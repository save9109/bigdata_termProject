0,"The fact that, as a species, we have created a movie dedicated solely to tiny pictures you can send to other people to express emotions is honestly confusing and horrifying at the same time. Why does this movie need to exist? The idea wasn't even well executed. It's chock full of cliches and moments that are hard to watch. If it weren't for the fake reviews by people who obviously hated/didn't watch this movie the score would most likely be below 1.",0
1,"What The Emoji Movie gives us is literally and actually predictable from the start. It lacks everything creative and everything that makes a movie successful. The Emoji Movie asks for your money so bad they had to literally do the impossible. New low for the year and possibly for the rest of this decade if there aren't as many cringeworthy movies in the near future. The crew behind this embarrassment that you call a movie will probably regret working on this a few years later when it comes to that time. If you give this movie your money, you should feel ashamed of yourself.",0
2,"I saw this movie in a free screening and I'm glad I did - I would never spend my money on a trash like this. I went in with barely any expectations. I thought the animation/voice acting might turn out descent. Guess what. It did not. Every single thing about this movie is horrible. It's just a poorly made, unfunny, ugly cash grab and on par with trash like Fifty Shades. I never thought an animated kids movie could be so bad - especially one with T. J. Miller - but it is.",0
3,"They cancelled The Popeye's movie for this disgusting crap. What were they thinking? Hide your kids from this terrible movie, and have them watch something else.",0
4,Everyday we stray further from God’s light. This film is nothing short of a waste of Earth's resources. All traces of the Emoji Movie should be collected onto a rocket and fired into space in the shortest path to the Sun.,0

7,"The Emoji Movie is poop. Go watch Dunkirk, Atomic Blonde, Spider Man Homecoming, and War for the Planet of the Apes instead. Don't support this nasty garbage.",0
8,"The Emoji Movie is a shameful, artless vehicle for product placement and deserves all the 0/10s it can get. It's a grotesque mixture of four much better movies: Wreck-it-Ralph, The Lego Movie, The Angry Birds Movie, and Inside Out. Just add in a pinch of lowbrow Minions-style kiddie humour and you have a diabolical atrocity that is the worst animated film since Foodfight.",0
9,"The Emoji Movie is the best movie ever made. I cannot believe that one film could sum up all our lives, but it does. The film is terrible, bland, short, and boring, just like ourselves. Never would I have thought that a movie would make me reflect on my incredibly useless life, but The Emoji Movie did. The Emoji Movie shows us that we're all just trapped in our own world, we're useless, and we should only have one sole purpose. The film is too good for all our puny human brains to process, and it even made Kim Jong Un cry. If you don't like the film, it is because you don't understand the sheer beauty and perfection that the film delivers. Go clean up your dirty minds and keep watching it until you understand it. This film is an international treasure and should be shown to everyone.",1
10,"HORRIBLE! A stupid, dull, not funny, crappy, and really poorly developed!!!!! Compare this crap to the lego movie. The Lego Movie is pretty great because it's funny, has actual plot, and Lego people are basically like real people made with Legos. The Emoji Movie is awful and is the opposite of good. Here's my emoji: A dead emoji.",0
11,An Inside Out rip off without the charm or story. The story fails in almost every way. The idea of creating a story on the Meh Emoji and the failure for him to make that face tells you all you need to know. D-,0
12,"Well, that was horrible. This is among the worst film of the year. It is boring, predictable and unfunny. The characters are poorly developed and the film seems more interested in jumping from one application to the next(product placement 101) than telling an original, compelling story.",0
13,A bunch of old people tried to appeal to millennials and created this abomination of a movie. Fun to watch ironically with the boys and laugh at the horrific attempts at humor though. I don`t even see kids enjoying this garbage.,0
14,"The biggest joke of the year 2017. Tragic humor, incomprehensible message and idiotic dialogue. Emoticons will disappear like any fashion, and making a movie for a young audience without knowing their slang and style of being is a failure.",0
15,"Let me just say this right now, The Emoji Movie is A DUMPSTER FIRE OF A FILM THAT I NEVER WANT TO SEE EVER AGAIN, and if I ever find any parents that took their kids to see that film, I am going to say that how they turn out is your fault now!!!The Emoji Movie is not a movie, it’s an advert.  I am not even kidding, the plot, if you can call it that is interrupted constantly for adverts for products such as Drop Box, Twitter, YouTube and even the Just Dance game.  I am not even joking, for no reason, the plot is interrupted for an advert for a mobile version of Just Dance.  Everyone in this movie is terrible, they are all giving awful performances, including smug performances from Anna Faris, T J Miller, especially James Corden, who seems to be in every terrible animated film I am watching at the minute, playing the exact same role every time and in this film, he is incredibly annoying.  The jokes are never funny, the animation is obnoxious and there is no real message to it whatsoever.  Kind of ironic considering it’s a movie about emoji’s.  This is one of the most cynical things I have ever seen aimed at children and the fact that this film is aimed at children is the most disgusting part of it.  The film also has no original idea whatsoever, ripping off other more successful family films constantly, especially Inside Out, Wreck it Ralph and Toy Story, doing it in a way that required no effort at all.  You will want to slap some dignity into Patrick Stewart for playing the pooper emoji and I would like to point out the opening credits say Sir Patrick Stewart, Robbie Collins summed it up better in saying the opening credits might as well have said “yes, we have ruined this man’s career”.  Everything about it is everything I despise about cinema:  no effort, product based placement throughout the Wazoo, no originality, mugging actors constantly giving off the impression that they know what they are in is terrible but they don’t care as they got an easy pay check and an attitude of “that’s good enough for them”, which cinema should never have!!  Before you say anything, the opposite is just as bad, I hate films that go “if you don’t get it you are obviously an idiot”.  So don’t accuse me of being elitist for my opinions on this film.  It’s just crap and anything in the comments section for this review that have any emoji’s in are getting deleted instantly.  I am sick of them now and if I ever see a copy of this film, I am going to set it on fire.  I HATED THIS MOVIE!!!",0
16,"""The Emoji Movie"" is maybe one of the most perplexing pieces of media I have ever borne witness to. I feel strange saying this, but this movie was written... incorrectly. I have never before felt this way about a film, but this movie was written wrong. The worst part isn't even the fact that the main characters are representations of things as characterless as a coat rack, it's the fact that the film doesn't know what it wants to be. This movie has a bizarre tendency of making overly cynical jokes, yet presenting them in such a way that children are guaranteed to take the wrong message. For example, the phrase ""Words are lame, use an emoji"" are presented at a certain point to the user of the phone where the eponymous emojis reside, yet this phrase is not balanced in any way by a differing perspective, a sarcastic glance, or any similar method of showing that it was a joke. This happens multiple times throughout the film. It is also worth noting that pretty much every line spoken by the ""Jailbreak"" character seems to be there just so they can consolidate the female gender into a marketing tactic like they did with ""Ghostbusters"". Thankfully, it doesn't work at all, and just makes a few scenes a lot more awkward than they would have been normally. I recall actually pausing the movie when she said the line ""You know men are always taking credit for things that women come up with"" after the main character figured out what her reasoning was and confirmed that he knew what she was talking about, not at all taking any credit for what she was saying.In terms of the rest of the movie, I feel bad for anyone who paid to sit through 2 hours of advertisements for dropbox. I almost didn't expect it to be as bad as it is. For a film which prominently shows spam emails as a recurring joke, it sure does present a lot of its own spam. Another pause moment happened when the main characters escaped from a villain by going into dropbox, to which the girl replied ""It's illegal malware, and this app is secure!"". I believe I could feel my brain slowly melting out of my ears when that statement was made.While I didn't enjoy this movie, it is kind of a shame that it had to be this way. A lot of people probably didn't like this movie solely because it was essentially a drawn-out advertisement for smartphone downloads. The problem is, there is another movie that is essentially one big advertisement for products, yet it's one of the best animated films I've ever seen! If the people making ""The Emoji Movie"" had taken any inspiration from ""The Lego Movie"", we could have had a potentially amazing film! It is especially depressing since the animation in this film is as good as it could be, being wonderfully stylized and moving beautifully. All in all, ""The Emoji Movie"" is maybe one of the most depressing pieces of cinema I've ever seen. In terms of recommendations, if you are a person who likes to tear films apart, I would recommend watching this film once and never again. To everyone else, avoid this film like the black plague. It's bad for you and terrible for your kids.",0
17,"This movie is the worst. Everything in this movie: Bad scripting. Bad acting. Bad modeling. Bad trailer. Terrible color textures. The characters are rubbish. The scenes are rubbish, and the whole movie is rubbish. Everything in this movie was complete trash.",0

19,"bad, awful, mediocre, cliché, unfunny, waste of time, predictable, disgusting, horrible, terrible, unoriginal plot, cringeworthy and shameless are the words that describe the best this huge pile of trash called a movie",0
20,"Sony Pictures really outdid themselves with this terrible film. The Emoji Movie was exactly what I thought it would be from when I saw the trailer, an incredibly ridiculous abomination that filled me with anger. It doesn't deserve any praise at all, it lacks what I think every film should have: a soul. The animation of the Emoji Movie may be decent enough, but that won't win me over. I've officially lost hope for Sony Pictures, this is NOT their finest work. I thought Chicken Little was my least favourite film, but The Emoji Movie can easily take that spot. -Pippoa",0
21,"Blessed with the high-quality animation and a cute, hip concept that could have made it a hit with the kids. But it doesn't have a soul. T.J. Miller is not leading man material. Not even when it's just his voice trying to carry the show. The whole cast sounds so generic I was genuinely shocked to find out that it wasn't comprised solely of D-listers. What was Patrick Stewart thinking?!It starts off simple enough. A boring Wreck-It-Ralph rip-off that really has nothing going on. It's kind of smug in a ""haha, look at me! I'm poking fun at how teenagers keep their heads buried in their phones!"" sort of way. Self-satisfied with the fact that it even exists in the first place. It's bad, but not torture. Not then. But oh boy does it take a turn. It happens about the time Candy Crush shows up. That's right ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of app-related product placement. Watching the little emojis play Candy Crush is just as fun as watching a real life person play Candy Crush. Not fun at all. But it doesn't stop there. We get to watch the little tumors play with other apps as well. Oh boy!It's got more than just phone games though. We'll witness these poor excuses for characters visit Dropbox, YouTube, Spotify, and a few others. Now, this could have been a cute thing, but the implementation isn't clever or inventive. Nothing in The Emoji Movie is. The stale quest about being true to who you are is not only devoid of originality, but heart as well. Every emoji and phone creature thingy is a bland stereotype meant to carry the almost non-existent plot forward. Things get weird when it tries to preach feminism and has weird symbolism on things like divorce. It never manages to actually say anything about them, but you can tell they're there. Because, you know, I'm sure that didn't go over the heads of the 6 year olds in the audience out there. The ones that were scarred for life by their first truly abysmal movie.What tiny bit of imagination it does have is only present on the surface level and is meant to cover up a rotten core created by a group of morally bankrupt individuals that created this film to exploit children in order to prey on the wallets of their unsuspecting parents who didn't know any better. The Emoji Movie is a humorless romp through cellphone land that is devoid of joy and personality. Don't watch it and certainly don't let it near your kids. That would be child abuse in my book. I'm sure there are judges who would agree.",0
22,I saw this in theaters. I don't know why I do this to myself. This film in unfunny and bad in every single possible way. At least the people who wasted their time animating it got paid.,0
23,"The most lamest film ever this movie tries to be like micheal bay films with advertisement but at least no EXPLOSIONS basically this movie is boring, characters are weak, the plot rips-off ""Inside out"" and ""Wreck it Ralph"" (which are superior films). The idea of an Emoji movie is terrible in my opinion.",0
24,"I don't even need to explain why this is bad, just look at the pictures, it's god awful in every single way, there is NOTHING even close to enjoyable in this movie.",0
25,The story really doesn't have any logic! It messed with story!!! There is no logic! But its new idea about phone world beside it's not complete world.,0
26,"The Emoji Movie was a thing that should've never happened... but it did. And it's every bit as bad as you'd expect. Even with some half-decent animation, a good cast and maybe 1 or 2 chuckles, The Emoji Movie is far too lazy, poorly-written, cynical, unimaginative, and boring to recommend to anyone but the youngest moviegoers. There is little to no heart, charm, wit, or even a good moral and all we have left are super-cheap jokes, bland characters, head-slapping pop-culture references, tissue-thin story, and some of the most absurd product placement you'll ever see in a film. There's no reason for family films to be this eager in pandering to the lowest-common denominator.Every frame melts with corporate cynicism at its worst. Leaves no impact but to feel dead inside. Stay away. 1.5/10",0

35,"I honestly can't believe that Sony would make an entire film based on tiny images used in our text messages. Does it make people regret watching it? Three guesses. Not even Gene himself on the cover can keep a smile on himself. It's boring to the extreme, the jokes aren't funny, and this entire film's existence is something nobody would ask for. Don't even get me started on how much this film seems like a mash up commercial! In conclusion, don't even think about watching this film, unless if you want to see how bad it really is, and to lower the rating of this movie even more, which in that case, I'd be fine with.",0
36,"The worst movie I ever seen, i have seen a lot of bad movies, but this is absolutely the worst!",0
37,"I honestly don't know how you can give this masterpiece of a movie a low rating. The movie was easily the best movie ever created and all other movies try to reach the pure greatness of the emoji movie. like how could you give the Dora movie a better rating then THE EMOJI MOVIE. Did Dora have Patrick Stewart, James Corden, Maya Rudolph, and T.J. Miller. Didn't think so. maybe think next time on how to rate a movie. mic drop",1
38,"Right off the bat, the movie is overwhelmingly cringy, and one of the most feel-bad movies ever. This movie is entirely product placement with poor lines and even worse actors. The production of the movie is years and years they'll never get back.",0
39,What can I say it's perfect. God haa blessed us with this movie and we are not worthy.,0
40,"All evidence points to this animated film being contrived as a money-making scheme. ""Hey, we can create a cheap CGI movie and make companies pay for the celeb voices in advance by inserting their brands in the film!"" The result is worse than crass, it's abominably bad. It's so bad that the film has been stuck in production limbo for a decade and it hasn't aged well. The CGI, the story and the one-liners (oh God, the one-liners...) all bear the mark of genuine and profound incompetence, a complete lack of even the most most rudimentary story-telling skills.What passes for a narrative revolves around supermarket brands coming to life at night. Rex Dogtective (yeah, go ahead and try to laugh at that one), voiced by Charlie Sheen, mourns his lost love but must soon save his supermarket city from the evil, impersonal Brand X. With the help of ... ah, who cares?Foodfight! will bore, offend and anger you at the same time, such is its unprecedented badness. Please don't watch it.",0
41,This was an absolute dumpster fire of a film and I'd rather stick forks in my eyes than watch it again. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities and the movie makes no attempt at making you like them. The story was bland and recyclable to the point where I felt nothing when they were in danger. They cancelled the Popeye movie for this.,0
42,"This movie made me seriously ill. Every time i close my eyes, all i can see it that godforsaken yellow emoji staring into my soul. I feel physical pain every time i think about this hellspawn that is put before my eyes. If North Korea decides to nuke us, i wouldn't even be mad. Just please, remove the film from existence.

48,"It's about as good as the poop emoji in the movie. Watching this would be wasted time and a new lack of a meaning in life.

I have watched 12 second pornos with better acting than this piece of **** and how I am even able to write this is amazing considering I lost practically all of my brain cells from viewing this so-called film (which is more comparable with a **** war-crime).I illegally streamed this movie and I still want my money back. I can't **** fathom that the Popeye's movie was cancelled for this ass cancer. This movie only proves that God lives in heaven because he lives in fear of what he has created. And if north Korea decides to nuke us, I just hope Sony Pictures Animation goes up in flames too.",0
56,First of all what the heck and also this movie reminds me of Wreck it Ralph. A type of electronic doesn't want to be the thing they are and tries to change it but an enemy tries to stop the two. Yea...what the heck. At least Wreck It Ralph was creative and had a meaning but the Emoji Movie is awful and has nothing going for it.,0
57,"The name of this movie is simply enough to know that it was destined to failed, and it did live to that expectation. Not only does it lack originality in terms of its plot (which by the way shares too many similarities with ""Wreck it Ralph""), but it also manages to be even worse in every other aspect. If you want to see a mindless boring sequence of animated shots with no real characters full of product placement, go ahead, waste your money. It doesn't really matter though, after all, this move was created only for the purpose of making money and draining the wallet of millions. **** sells.",0
58,"I can sum up ""The Emoji Movie"" in a few words: Unoriginal, boring, stupid, dumb plot, characters that serve no purpose, terrible, full of ads, unfunny jokes and of course: the movie itself.

66,"The Emoji Movie is what I would like to call a 90 minute ad disguised as a movie. The story, if you can call it that, is literally a shot for shot remake of Inside Out, just without any form of emotion thrown into it. And you know when you failed that aspect when the main stars of your feature are actual emotions, or Emojis in this case. The movie's sense of humor is just plain unfunny throughout the film, and the characters have already been done in other, better movies. The biggest example being Jailbreak. However, while the writing is abysmal, the animation is not. It's really colorful, how the animators design and animate the Emojis and the apps is pretty creative, the animation when in the human world is decent, and the effects of things being made out of little cubes like fire, debris, and the upgraded bots is a nice detail. So, all in all, the animation is not half bad. But then you realise it's not half good either. Some of the character designs look weird, like on Smiler, the textures of the emojis' hair looks honestly out of place, and again, some of the app designs have already been done in the past. So like I said, The Emoji Movie is just a big 90 minute ad for smartphones.",0
67,"Absolute crap. Imagine a cringe idea combined with a completely unfunny script mostly copied from another film, but it's less funny. The poop emoji is the perfect explanation for this movie. You may think that you can cut the movie some slack because it's for kids, but Wreck it Ralph was for kids and it got great scores from critics. It's not bias against Sony, it's just this movie is complete  and utter crap. I'd rather you burn your ten bucks than spend it on this movie. I know this movie is gonna make a ton of money, but isn't that obvious? People are gullible enough to spend two hours of their lives to watch this dumb ""film"" because this barely counts as one.

The film, for those unaware, doesn't fall under the category of ""watchable, disable fun"" that was Sony's prior animation attempt, The Angry Birds Movie. No - this Emoji story is far below that - into the land occupied by Disney's lackluster direct-to-video sequels and other junk that no one cared to see. The fact that this is getting the attention of cinemas and audiences worldwide is hard to believe. The Emoji's famous cast can't even manage to save it - Patrick Stewart, even, in all of his glory. In the end, however, The Emoji Movie's lack of messages and themes for kids to walk away with is the most surprising. Even Angry Birds found something to say. Finally, my message for you is simple. Just avoid this crap - please.",0

75,"How do i accurately detail the absolute hells cape that is The Emoji Movie. The entire time I was watching it I was feeling real life pain due to some of the most cringey, depressing, and unironic writing I have ever seen in a blockbuster film. The half-baked social commentary was both unintelligent and by-the-numbers when it came to feminism, being who you are, and honesty in relationships; but the downright glaringly awkward issue of the role of technology (or even product placement) in our lives was lost on the makers of this fine movie.",0

81,"There are no words to describe how bad this movie is... in fact, there are no emojis to describe how bad this movie is... not even the ""poop"" emoji is insulting enough to this film, since he is one of the main characters... 'The Emoji Movie' is the worst movie of 2017 so far, a film so bad and so joyless, I gave it a ""Zero"" rating. A rating I very rarely give, unless it's to 'The Room' (2003) or any of ""The Human Centipede"" films. This film has joined that club. The film (if I can even call it that) follows an emoji named Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), who lives in Textopolis, a world found inside of a smart phone. Gene is the son of Mel Meh (Steven Wright) and Mary Meh (Jennifer Coolidge). Gene feels that he can be useful when he gets work, but when given the opportunity, when the phone owner sends texts using emojis, and Gene is selected, he is often unsure of what to do, and tries to what he can at the last minute. This ends up wrecking the text centre, and Gene feels responsible. We meet a handful of other characters from; Smiley (Sean Hayes) to Hi-5 (James Corden), and more depressingly so, the legendary Sir Patrick Stewart voices the Poop emoji. Good to see that he has moved up in his career, especially since he co-starred in the excellent 'Logan' (2017). There is so much to talk about with this so-called ""movie"", but honestly, this is awful. Why even talk about it when nobody, in their right mind, would see it either alone, or with their families. There are five top reasons as to why this film is the worst of 2017... 1) Bad writing, 2) Horrible animation, 3) Lack of storytelling, 4) No compelling characters and 5) Bad pacing. The movie's pace is so uneven, I found that it dragged towards the third act. How could so many talented actors from T.J. Miller (who was hilarious in 'Deadpool) to Sir Patrick Stewart get involved in this trainwreck? It tries to be like 'Inside Out' (2015) in regards to the premise (emotional characters inside a tiny world)... but I had a headache watching this turd, and I'm sure nobody else will see it too. Let's hope this movie does not influence more like this in the future. One ""Emoji Movie"" is bad enough.",0
82,"This left me with the feeling that seeing it had rent my soul asunder. I never thought a movie could be worse than M.Night Shamallama's The Last Airbender,but dear god was I wrong.

83,"what a crappy movie!!! guess i shouldnt be surprised after the actors applauded themselves that ""this is our chance to push our progressive agenda onto children"", that the movie would be so void of actual story and anything funny... look at Inside Out, same chance to push certain opinions, but with a story and laughs, and something for people to enjoy at the core of it...stop trying to (in tj millers own words), ""use this movie to push back against Trump""...its a KIDS MOVIE, make it something fun, that parents will want to take their kids to, and buy, and dress up as for halloween, we dont need you to force your political opinions on us in the form of a winky smiley face or a pile of poop...thanks tho!! smh",0

This movie is one of the worst high budget movies made in the past decade.  Although the movie was complete garbage, the animation was exceptionally good which is why this doesnt get a 0.  Usually terrible comedy's have at least one joke that is unironically funny, This does not.  Half of the Emoji movies runtime was product placement disguised as character development, there is no real character development in this movie, it seems as if there was real character development scenes but they cut those out because in scenes there is random information that the characters know that they shouldn't.

The lesson is so cliche, ""Be Yourself"" This concept is shown in many movies already.

106,"Pros:-The movie, as bad as it is, actually looks pretty great. Shoutout to the animation team for at least trying to make this movie have any redeeming qualities.-There were a few good ideas-The voice acting was okay(?)-The original music was also pretty alrightCons:-Even without all of the other cons, this movie would've still been a predictable, unoriginal, cliched, boring, and forgettable piece of (poop emoji)-The writing is INFURIATINGLY awful. I had to pause the movie so many times to let the stupidity sink in.-The ""jokes"", if you can call them that, are all either bad visual gags or awful ""puns"" that don't even make sense half of the time. There were a few times when I was a little close to laughing, and two times when I genuinely laughed, but the rest of it is garbage.-This movie has some of the worst product placement I have ever seen. They weren't trying to be even a little subtle, it just felt like I was watching a big ad for a bunch of apps, with an awful movie in between the ads.-The characters are bad. Gene is just an uninteresting ""meh"" protagonist. High-five is very annoying, and I don't buy his friendship with Gene at all. He just seemed to tag along on the adventure for his own personal gain that I didn't care about. Jailbreak is a somewhat boring character who randomly spouts out feminist remarks from time to time, and does some EXTREMELY out of character things near the end of the movie. Again, I don't buy her relationship with Gene, but at least it isn't the most forced in relationship I've ever seen.-This movie doesn't seem to have rules. Here are some examples (minor spoilers):""He is going to go to the phone store to delete us tomorrow!"" After what seems like a few minutes in the movie's time: ""We only have 4 hours before the phone is deleted!""""We have to travel to the other side of the phone to get to the trash to save High Five from being deleted!"" Later: ""Here, I can pull up this email you found and left in the trash on my screen.""Not to mention, a large amount of things that happen in the movie are just not how phones work at all. Also, many plot holes and things that didn't make sense were created just to throw in more ads.-There were some subplots, but I din't care at all about them. At least they were breaks from the infuriating main plot-There is probably more cons, but as I was writing this review I forgot what I was going to say. That is how forgettable this movie is.The only reason that I am not giving this movie a 0 out of 10 is because it did have a tiny amount of good qualities, and I only give a 0 out of 10 to movies with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Don't watch this ad that is calling itself a movie. It is not so bad it's good, it's just infuriating, and it will be forgotten within a year or two.",0
107,"Awful script:The hand emoji (James Corden) says 'hashtag truth' and 'hashtag blessed' on two separate occasions... oh boy. Generic, soppy lines that are meant to develop the characters emotionally (keyword being MEANT).Awful characters:You couldn't care less about Gene and his stupid face, or his sidekick and Jailbreak. Even the 'subplot' with his parents is deplorable, so predictable and I know the comedy is meant (again, keyword being MEANT) to be that they're 'meh' emojis, none of the scenes were they expressed their love for each other were good. NONE. Just some yellow-faced wastes of code walking around for their son that abandoned them.  Completely predictable plot.Other things I can't be bothered to explain:Dance sequences that outstay their welcome by the total time they're on screen.Absurd, ridiculous amount of product placement. I mean, they legitimately explain how Candy Crush works and how to play it. A main 'plot' is them reaching Dropbox.... Who thought this was a good idea? WHO??

One day, a movie will come out in the future that will change the world for the better, a movie that will change the fabric of our society for the better, a movie that will end world hunger, stop terrorism and end the useless hate between the races of man and bring in the dawn of the next evolution of our species.I always thought he was a crazy old man until today... Until the day I watched the Emoji movie, you see, the Emoji movie is one of the greatest movie ever made and I will tell you why. Not even a single second after leaving the theater, my son was cured of his homosexuality, touting how much he wants to **** that blue haired emoji"", I was so proud of him, my dog Rover who had two limp legs started walking on fours for the first time in 10 years. The elderly couple were so engrossed in the movie, I hear that they are still there as I write this, sitting in their seats, how nice! The political satire was so accurate in fact that a police officer stood up and shouted ""I see the error of my ways! No longer will I shoot African Americans!"" which was nice, in fact it was so accurate that the white house LITERALLY exploded causing a power outage on the entire east coast of America, causing families to finally reconnect with each other and grow as people.

140,"This movie is so well thought out and executed all the way through. The animation is vivid, fast and smooth. Its cast is memorable and the voices unique. The plot is innovative and original as it made me cry and laugh many times. There is absolutely no advertising just references, popular viral videos and memes. You go to this journey with the protagonist, Gene, who struggles to be a ""meh"" emoji because of his expressive personality. Together Gene, his dumb friend and Jailbait will try to find the answer to Gene's problem. Also the music was just too generic for me and my friend, William Xenopanagos, but some kids might like it. The plot twist was mouth gaping and quite clever. It was so clever that i cannot spoil it to you because you have to see it for yourself. And so, I rate this movie 10/10, go watch it and enjoy it. (please downkoad th e just dance ap its cool)",1
141,"This will be a surprise for most of you but....:why the bad reviews?It's a really good and fun movie.Sure, it's not great but it's good. Go watch it.9/10",1
142,I went to see this movie with my sons and they LOVED it! My kids laughed all the way through although I wasn't very happy with the Smiler character who frightenend my yougest son. I loved how funny High Five was and James Gordons performance was amazing. It is much better than those violent transformers and marvel movies! In total I rate this movie and 8 out of 10! would recommend!,1
143,"I liked it. Yes it's simplistic but it's very funny. I love films like this. What I mean is I love films that don't take themselves too seriously. Or, in this case, not at all.Sure, irs but Citizen Kane, but it is a lot of fun.",1
144,Me and my son Jimmy (age 7) went to go see this movie on saturday. He LOVED it. The whole way through he was laughing! I did not see any scenes that I thought were innopropriate and would very easily reccomend this movie to  any friends with kids. In total I rate this movie a 7 out of 10 would reccomend.,1
145,"Truly a masterpiece,I can't wait for the sequel. The Emoji movie is the best movie ever made with funny references to ever day life and an awesome story line. Honestly movies like Wreck it Ralph and Inside out are just lame rip offs coping this movie. Plus the humor is top notch going from poop to more poop. To top it up a new dance sweeping the nation called the emoji pop which you won't stop dancing from this because it's so addicting. Amazing movie in all and highly recommend this to people of all ages.",1
146,"I don't know why stupid people like this. Anyway, ¿How you can make a movie about Emojis? Easy: YOU CAN'T. The film fails in everything. Writing, Characters, Humor, Message, Animation, Dialogs and More. Everything is cliche, stupid, unfunny and painfully annoying. Even if it has some good things in the animation, The Emos*** Movie (Yes, i call it Emos***) is just another generic movie trying to be The LEGO Movie, Wreck It Ralph and Inside Out with the only purpose to make money.",1

I seen better movies for sure but i can say that this movie doesn’t deserve 12/100. Movie is funny and well animated. The story is well writen, too. My little brother watch with me and he loved it. I can’t say that I enjoyed watching movie but it is for KIDS and just because adult or teens didn’t like it doesn’t mean some kid didn’t and to be honest there are much worst kid movies made.",1

168,"""Ok, so this is epic"" - Me 2018. The emoji movie is quite possibly the most underrated movie of all time. Most people underestimate the lengths and character development of the movie along with the hilarious jokes made that are almost as funny as those funny fortnite moment montages. Let's start with the plot, the plot begins with Gene a hilariously well-constructed character representing the Meh emoji. Questioning his existence which he is unhappy with life and in a suicidal place. This is a huge leap and a well-constructed plot reasoning for the mission to take over the internet and spread his dank memes about the funny moth memes.",1
169,"This is really bad, the plot sucks, it's a litteral commercial, and it shouldn’t exist.",1
170,This is a literal movie about talking emojis. Easily the worst movie ever made. The characters are unlikable and the plot is the stupidest plot ever for a movie. Also there are numerous ads in this movie so kids can buy more things.,0
171,"I don't even know why this movie exists. I didn't even want to watch it, I was forced to see it and it was like a torture. Just saying the title out loud is already cringeworthy...""The EMOJI Movie"", Ugh. I know people will say that it doesn't matter because it is made for kids, but kids don't deserve this level of stupidity. I thought Minions was the worst thing to happen to animation, but this now claims that title. The concept is just stupid, no one asked for an Emoji movie, yet it actually exists, it's an hour and a half waste of time.The Bad:-EVERYTHING. I don't even have to say it, EVERYONE knows why this movie is so bad.-People went to SEE this movie. Doesn't anyone realize that Sony did this movie intentionally bad so audiences go ""Mmmm is this movie that bad? I'll go and see it!"" and keep in mind I saw it because I was forced.The Good:-It ended.",0
172,Whoever sparked the idea to actually continue to write and film this lame movie? I don't know...someone very stupid. Terrible movie.,0

181,"I don't think I've ever watched a movie that made me feel this awkward while doing so. It's a terrible mish mash of everything. It's clear the original script was 2 pages long and the writers were told to fill the rest with memes, puns, and other obscure references. What a strange experience.",0
184,"There was a slight glimmer of hope in the first 15 minutes that this wouldn't be as bad as everyone said it was.Boy howdy, was I wrong.This was painful...just absolutely painful.Don't even think about watching it.Don't make the same mistakes I did.I'll never understand happiness ever again.",0
185,"While the plot is predictable and most jokes don't land, ""The Emoji Movie"" is more meh than poop. The premise is interesting and the pacing and runtime are decent and short respectively.",0
188,"Hi-5 eats his own vomit in this film.The Emoji Movie is a fascinating car crash of animation. It's about Gene, the meh emoji who can also express other emotions. Because of this the villain, Smiler who literally just screams obnoxiously for the whole movie, wants him killed, or deleted I guess, this movie's rated PG after all.It's a film where you have no idea if it's actually a film or a commercial, since I would say 90% of it is just product placement. These characters literally just play Candy Crush for at least five full minutes at one point, and after that they fall in to Just Dance and play Just Dance for even longer.But basically Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), and Hi-5 emoji, (voiced by the bored sounding James Corden) have to find Jailbreak, a hacker emoji, so she can code Gene to become a normal meh emoji again. And the idea is that they have to go through different apps in Alex's phone, but Alex is about to get the phone reset because of Gene not working as a normal meh emoji.The first thing where the movie immediately screws up is the characters. If you're gonna make a film about emojis, at least you have the chance to make every character feel in some way different because they already have a clearly different expression, but unsurprisingly the writing is s*it, kinda like the s*it emoji in the film, voiced by Patrick Stewart, who probably has the worst and most obvious jokes in the film. For example he yells ""We're number two!"" with his son s*it while they're walking out of a bathroom. Also, it doesn't really make sense that all of the face emojis act like their expression, but then an emoji like Hi-5 can express any emotion he wants. Why???But anyway, they try to get to this hacking center place and the whole film is just them going through different phone apps like Spotify, Just Dance, Dropbox, Instagram and at one point they literally fly the Twitter bird. And my god do they take every single chance they get to show these apps to our faces and literally yell at us to download them, especially Just Dance. The film tries to show a world where these young people can't live without social media and at the same time yells at us to be the same. Seriously? Although this isn't the only message they're trying to get across. They also have Jailbreak randomly say things like ""Women are always coming up with stuff men take credit for."" and ""I'm not a princess waiting for my prince."" Yes we get it, women are equal to men, but why would you say things that make it look like you're trying to bash men? How is that useful in any way that your dialogue makes it feel like women are better than men but then you say that women are just as good? It simply doesn't make any sense. And not only that, but why would you write this generic feminist message when you could write a message saying that EVERYONE is just as good, regardless of who they are and what gender. The dialogue overall is just the kind you would expect from The Emoji Movie. Here are a few lines: ""I was wrong Gene, I should've believed in you all along."", ""Don't be afraid to express yourself!"", ""#truth!"" and ""I like that you're one of those guys who can express his feelings."" By the way, that last one is said by the girl that Alex, the owner of the phone, has a crush on because she was so goddamn impressed by this super emoji that Alex sent her. Yes.The film was surprisingly well paced which made it go by fast and it was also only 86 minutes long. But it still doesn't change how bad it was. Also, the Alex character tried to confess his love to the girl with Rihanna lyrics. Also also, the soundtrack sounds like it's from Simcity. I can't be the only who thinks that. Also also also, there are continuity errors. Like at the end Hi-5 is shouting his name and the words aren't syncing with his lips at all. And when the characters jump to Just Dance the movie f*cks up completely how physics work. And how was Alex able to take the phone to tech support if the phone had Jailbreak? Doesn't that void the warranty?",0

190,The Emoji Movie is simply the kind of torture that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.,0
191,"OK not giving 0/10 because as cringy and garbage it is, I can appreciate some things such as work put to animate the damn thing. so both my points go to animators, and no one else making this movie because actors - cringe, plot - bad, jokes - overused or just unfunny, packaged with feminist man-hating bullcrap (yes, somehow they managed to include that in kids cartoon). I mean movie is just an ad for few apps which worked as product placement like Just dance. Even in movie the logic of things make no sense: Jailbreak is princess emoji but does not look like other skin princess emojis? It's a mess, not a movie",0
192,"I liked it. It had some mistakes, yes, but it was still fun to watch. The story felted rushed, but that might be a good thing because it didn't drag out. The animation was actually really good too. It was also mostly funny, but some jokes were not that funny. The main problem was that the story seemed like it was done before, and a little predictable. It was fun to watch..",0
194,"This movie tries to create a universe inside the smartphone, a living universe inside the most varied apps. Inside the conversation app, there is a whole civilization of emoticons that apparently live and grow in favor to serve the phone and be the emoticons. There is a situation that the ""meh"" emoji does have a bug that make him have different emotions instead of just the ""meh"" one, he is different and he get in trouble because of that. This movie is directed by Tony Leondis.The story of this movie is the much possible cliche, that journey that someone is different from the others, then the others repudiate him, and then he goes in a run of self discovery and end saving the day because of his difference, the most of these stories are actually cool because you can relate to that in some way, not just that but you care for that, here you just can't care for them, you can't worry about anything, the verisimilitude here is so low that, as i said, you won't worry about anyone here, and that is definely a proble, because the movie will put people in dangerous in a dramatic way that don't work at all. The movie does have some funny moments, but there are some nice moments that made me had a little laugh, some moments outside the cellphone that was relatable, like when you send the wrong message to a girl, who can't relate to that, right ? that is so funny, but in general, the jokes don't work that much, not for me, and i believe not for the kids neither, wich is a problem, because this movie was surely a childlike movie, but if not even then like it, it is a problem. The movie got no setpieces that you will remember after you watch, there are some ok moments with pop music, but then again it doesn't make sense and they stop the whole story for that, just for the popular song that everyone will know, but had no purpose. The movie have a few moments that feel so disconnected, somethings are completely out of place there, the movie have rhythm issues, somethings that could have been better explained.The dubbing is ok, like T.J. Miller did an ok job, it was simple what he had in his hands, but he did well. James Corden is the best one here, because he is legit funny, the way he put his sentences out is very sincere, his accent also helps, and he is a very funny guy in real life, so that helps, almost every small laugh that i had in this movie, was with him. Patrick Stewart is in this movie, not much to talk about him, he doubles the pop. Anna Faris is also here, she was ok, like she could pass friendship.The cgi is at least good, the creation of the world inside the phone it isn't bad, i gotta say that it was cool they walking around the phone, the structure of the different applications, they sailing around the spotfy waves, or walking around the photos on instagram, the cgi was good, the animation also, it wasn't great, but good.This kind of movie, that normally are meant both for kids and adults, like pixar and old dinsey animation movies, it had a big meaning that worked for both, things that would really make the adults think some deep things in life and also things that kids would get for form their character, in this one it doesn't have any, and if it does, it is the wrong message, things that aren't right, like people being in the phone instead of real talking.The movie have some funny moments, a interesting cgi job, the story is cliche and bad, it have no good meaning and definely wasn't a good job.",0

204,In my opinion i think the emoji movie is rushed and poorly put together.It isn't the worst in the world but it is far from being good.It isn't really a plot it's more like a series of brand deals.They advertise apps thoughout the movie.90% of the jokes are not very funny even the little kids won't laugh!The ending is predictable and bland.They go on about being yourself and feminism thoughout the film(which is fine on its own but not excessively).So in conclusion do not waste your good money on this movie.,0

Any feminist statements that may have been in the Last Jedi or Captain Marvel pale in comparison to what this characters says and does in the movie.-“Emoji’s are the most important communication tool ever invented.” This is a real line from the film. I’m not kidding. -Blatant corporate product placement is very blatant and feels very corporate.-Gene’s relationship’s with High Five and Jailbreak feel very forced and unreal.-Gene’s parents, while I get that the whole point is they are always to supposed to be feeling meh since they are meh emoji’s, are still boring to watch because they are always meh about everything. -It’s hard to care about the human character Alex because we learn little to nothing about him and his personality. Same goes for his love interest who’s name I can’t even remember. -Patrick Stewart plays the poop emoji in this movie literally just so they can say Patrick Stewart played poop in a movie.-Why do they have to go through all these apps when they can literally just walk around them to get to the one they need to go to. -The film has a really terrible message at the start that you don’t need friends in life, just fans who will idolize and worship you, which is so not something you to put in kids minds, because yes, that is this films target audience, especially in this day and age when every kid thinks they can be a big youtube star and they don’t need school.-The film as a whole kinda insults kids by saying they have no attention spans anymore and are too lazy to type out words. -Most of the attempts at jokes crash and burn. Only once or twice during the movie did it manage to get a bit of a grin out of me, and I didn’t smile or laugh once while watching it. -The movie feels like it was written by focus groups, stealing elements like character traits and even whole plot points from good movies like Wreck it Ralph, The Lego Movie, Inside Out, you could argue the characters referring to the humans as users may have been stolen from Tron, and of course the dance party at the end of the movie that has been relatively common in animated films since Illumination hit the scene. -They cancelled the Popeye movie, which was actually looking pretty good and certainly had a far better and more unique animation style, and was even being done by Genndy, the creator of Samurai Jack and Hotel Transylvania, so they could do this movie. Sony, are you actively trying to ruin your reputation in the film industry?Final verdict: This is without a doubt the worst animated film I’ve ever seen, and possibly even the worst movie I’ve ever seen period. When it wasn’t making me cringe my ass off, it was boring me to death and the only thing keeping it above a zero is the fact that it was at the very least short. Still, unless you are a masochist, stay far, FAR away from this movie. I cannot stress that enough.",0

There is so much that could have achieved on this theme but the studio makers decided to go the lazy way and make a movie that is only appropriate for babies between the age of 1-4 because what they will see is bright colors and... that's it. for anyone above the age of 5, this movie is pathetic. I hope Sony learns from this and put at least 5-10 percent of work into their ""art"". This is hands the down the biggest abomination of filmmaking since Superbabies baby geniuses 2 and the movie which had the budget of 200 dollars called ""Who Killed Captain Alex"" is a million times better than this load of feces.

The story has been done a million times over. I don't even remember a SINGLE song from the movie. The characters all feel like rip-offs of characters from other, much better movies (i.e. Jailbreak is basically Wild Style). And the ""jokes"" couldn't be less funny.

225,"The Emoji Movie (2017): Dull, unfunny, unoriginal, and a waste of time, this ""meh""vie isn't worth your brain cells.",0
226,"Now first let me say something. This movie is an extremely blatant rip off of the Disney animation, Inside Out. It was quite a successful film, so I think that when they made this movie they were extremely wrong. In every way imaginable, this movie was bad. The plot was rubbish, it is a massive advertisement for numerous apps, such as candy crush and dropbox. And last of all, it was just cringe worthy in general. I will also state that the only thing I DID actually like about the movie was that Patrick Stewart was in it, but sadly he played probably the worst character in the film (a poo emoji).",0
227,"Probably the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. No sense, nothing funny, with characters without essence. A true film fiasco that should be forgotten and disappear from this planet.",0
228,"what the **** did i just watch? ill tell you what. 2 HOURS OF ****ING ADS. this movie was made by greedy little monkeys who managed to cram as many ads as possible into a movie. theyre literally running through ads, do not watch......",0
229,It's adds spoiler theres candy crush just dance it is very bad fails on almost all levels,0
230,"This is not a good movie. In fact it's terrible. It's even more soulless then uglydolls and that saying something because with uglydolls you could tell it wants to make a cheap buck like for example the budget of only 45 million bucks (kinda ripping off illumination because illumination also makes cheap movies),ripping other movies and having the characters barely go anywhere. The emoji move does and puts in stuff that are trendy and hip and cool with the kids like emojis,Twitter,just dance,cat videos,candy crush,I phones and so many more. The character aren't much better. We have gene  the 1 note main character,hi Five the stupid and annoying comic relief,jail breaker the girl,poop the one to make poop jokes,Alex an rippoff to rilley from inside out. I don't care about the rest. The story is really bad. The plot is Alex texts a girls but uses an meh emoji but oh no gene makes the wrong face so smile emoji trys to kill gene. This movie is a ripp-off to inside out. The only good things about this movie is that the voice acting and animation are not too bad but that's really it. This movie sucks.",0
231,"They cancelled Popeye for this! This piece of grape from Hollywood is lacking everything, truly it is a Cash grabbing mistake!",0
232,"What's the difference between this ""movie"" and the ads that played beforehand?",0
233,"Definitely the worst animation movie ever made. If on the one hand many point to ""The Emoji Movie"" as a plagiarism of ""Wreck-It Ralph"", the truth is that a film with a similar subject or a more blatant copy should have more ambitions in being a quality film and not only (""AntZ"" and ""A Bug's Life"" are movies of significant quality, for example).Does the film still waste a great cast of dubbing (as Sir Patrick Stewart agreed to join in?), A great instrumental track composer (Patrick Doyle, in a work surprisingly short of his ability) ... And although the film does not visually disappoint, the script failures spoil any positive outlook.",0
234,"""The Emoji Movie"" é incoerente, estúpido, lento, monótono e aborrecido. Este filme é literalmente um ""Pile of Poo emoji"". Que perda de tempo...1/10",0
235,It just isn't up to my standards which are very low. Really? I expected better from Sony.,0
236,"Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, baddddd, worst movie i ever seen! Horrible! It deserved the home video, not the cinema!",0
237,"I could not describe in words how awful this movie is. Everything from the animation, to the acting to the jokes is outright crap . As i watched this movie with my friends, there were ads all surrounding it such as the Candy Crush Scene.This movie literally felt like some form of torture. When the movie was done, i was so relieved ... the pain was over. During the movie, i felt my head internally screaming ""MAKE IT STOP!"" But, i kept watching it. That was a foolish mistake.On the plus side a kid kept failing to get some candy out of a candy crane, so they just left in some credits and quit. I got fun dip from that which helped to only relieve my sanity just a little bit.",0
238,"I Especially Hate this Movie Because First at all, It's Boring, Second, It's More Unfunny That Great Movies Like Spider-Man, Into The Spider Verse And Other Funny And Great Movies, and Third, It Mades Me Cringe, So if you Reading This, Don't Watch This Movie!",0
239,"Do i really need to say anything? Honestly. This movie was literally just an 80 minute long ad. The ""jokes"" are obnoxious and sound like a 6 year old wrote. Incidentally, I feel the only person to like this movie would be a 6 year old.",0
240,"The best movie ever!!! Said no one ever, worst movie ever..................",0
241,"Movie is fantastic! I don't know why People hate it or review bomb it, but developers should make second part of this movie",1
242,"Such terrible movie with boring jokes. It is literally about emojis which made the plot really terrible. The screenplay was terrible also. This is only for childish kids who were crazy about emojis but for others, it was the worst of 2017",0
243,amazing loved it very cool very awesome best movie ever my 5 year old wife loved it,1
244,Have a good time watching 1.5 hours of advertising.The film has no scenario. Its just advertising,0
245,"There were only two things that weren’t terrible. First, there was an eggplant emoji for 10 seconds, Second, the Animation was nice, the rest of it was terrible. The characters had almost no personality, the story was half-way decent at most, the ending was unsatisfactory, and the ads in the movie took up about 30% of the screen time and 60% of the plot. Overall, it felt more like a Lords Mobile ad, only this one I had to pay for and it lasted for 1 and a golf hours.",0
246,I like this movie it's not bad acting is good story could be better me and my friend actually like this movie and we don't really like emojis good movie but could be better,1
247,"Very boring and cheesy film, unlikely to entertain even the youngest of children. The story is unbalanced, and the whole idea is stupid.",0
248,I have no words to describe how awful this movie is. Why does this exist? Suggestion: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Seriously.,0
249,I knew from the beginning that it would be a really bad movie and well... IT IS! I don't even know why the people who made this film even exist. I'm disappointed in humanity now.,0
250,"Pardon my French but this is a piece of **** **** even blind people couldn’t stand watching this movie, they’d want to tear their eyes out. Ever since watching this movie I have been performing exorcisms on myself to try and clear my soul of the horror that is the emoji movie. I confess that I have been weak in allowing myself to watch this movie, all the warnings were so clear, this movie will kill you, and I swear on Jahseh Onfroy himself that I will be dead in the next week. To the person who finds my body, when you see no cause of death just know it was the emoji movie that did this to me.",0
251,"I never knew it was possible to make a god awful, juvenile, mediocre, manipulative, super dreadful long 80 minutes of ads, yet some how it achieves beyond that: it won the achievement of the biggest disgrace to animation and I congratulate this film for that! There is no redeeming quality to this WHATSOEVER and this is a embarrassment to the entertainment industry",0
252,Terrible animated film there's nothing positive I could say about this film.,0
253,"It is soooooooooo bad. Stupid humor, stupid pilot, stupid characters.......",0
254,It's a horrible movie of the genere animation.(with 86 minutes of duration ).,0
255,"Have you ever wanted to watch the worst movie in existence? Well you have came to the right place! The Emoji Movie was easily the worst movie to come out of 2017. Who with more then 2 brain cells actually liked this abomination?The Emoji Movie is infested with cheesy advertisements that only appeals to 4 year olds that play Just Dance and Candy Crush, they even failed the character designs! Can the Emoji Movie team do anything right?Sony should be ashamed that their name is attached to this movie, and don't get me started on the directing, why would you cast T.J Miller who has gone to jail multiple times as your lead role? You basically set it up to fail!Don't buy this movie, buy something else that is actually worth your time and money, you don't have to look far for good movies, for example, The Sonic Movie and The Incredibles.The Emoji Movie is a prime example of what an animated movie should not be.",0
256,Una de las peores películas de animación. La historia está más vista que el tebeo.,0
257,"In portugueseFilme muito mal construído, não agrada em seu enredo, muito menos nos personagens .",0
258,This movie is absolutely terrible. Never have I been so bored and uninterested. It isn't even a so-bad-it's-good movie because it's so obvious that this was made for the brand deals and revenue. This movie would even be lame as an April fools joke.,0
259,"One of the worst movie as well as animated movie of all the time, it’s worse than Mars Needs Moms, Smurfs: The Lost Village (which It’s just amazing for me.), ect.",0
260,"Una completa basura, chistes sin gracia, una historia sin sentido, simplemente horrible.",0
262,"This movie has given me the strength to live, without this movie I probably would have ended in 2004. This movie saved me then and it can do the same for you. Give it a chance, worth the fourth viewing.",1
263,Absolutely loved the poop jokes. There weren't enough in my opinion. Just the pinnacle of comedy. Let's have that bald guy back as other poop characters.,0
