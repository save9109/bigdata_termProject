1,"It's a big disappointment how this film can ruin one of the best musicals ever made in theatre. The new arrengements  are a chemical mess, the acting is poor, can't believe Dench & McKellen are involve in this.",0
3,Spoiler alert! This movie sucks. Id have rather smelled your fart.  id have rather had monkeys throw poop at me,0
4,"I have to admit that I enjoyed the dancing and much of the singing, BUT Andrew Lloyd Webber's show just doesn't translate to the big screen. When I saw it the audience kept laughing when the characters made feline gestures.",0
6,"Horrible, parece una pelicula de furris. Horror una mala decision recurrir a esos graficos",0
7,"It took me about thirty minutes to get into this movie. I love the beautiful dancing by the cat Victoria. And I loved hearing Jennifer Hudson singing Memories. Also I loved the humor of James Cordon and Rebel Wilson. Also Judy Dench was great. I loved the tapdancer. This movie is not for everyone, but if you understand that it is a musical with singing and dancing, you should be satisfied.",1
8,"Fãs de divas pop passam muita vergonha. O filmeco é horroroso sim, e não há argumento que justifique o contrário.",0
9,"I know the critics have mostly canned this film, and I went along with my wife, not expecting much, but I’m happy to say that I was surprised at its pure entertainment value. I never saw Cats when it was a musical stage sensation, but I understand that this movie stays true to its theatrical roots. TS Eliot’s work was probably not written with a theatrical adaptation in mind, so the writers have done well to spin this book of poems into a loosely knit plot. There is also a touch of Eliot’s mysticism. The characters, played by a Who’s Who of actors, convey a great deal of warmth and heart, and the production values are top notch.  Don’t go expecting a complex plot. Just go to let the experience wash over you.",1
10,The most horrible movie I've seen in a long time. Trash. Old Cats like 100x better.,0
11,"This movie is great... if you know what you are watching. This movie is intended for fans of the musical, and not for critics and film reviewers alike who have not seen the musical, or read the poems. Yes, I’ll admit the CGI is very choppy in some areas, particularly towards the end, which is not something you want in a movie, to say the least. The controversial CGI design, however, can be easily overlooked and even ignored if you’re able to get into the story and experience of Cats. As a fan of the musical and the poems, I greatly enjoyed the film, and had a lot of fun with it. The only other criticisms I have about the film are nerdy nitpicks which I don’t want to get into (E.g: Skimbleshanks should not have a moustache!), or casting decisions that I also don’t want to get into (E.g: Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots). Overall, the film is wonderful enjoyable if screened to the right audience, but unwise casting decisions and unfinished CGI work pull it down. I would give the film three and a half stars, but Google doesn’t let you do that here.",1
12,"The most horrible movie I've ever seen. It sucks. Why did they dare to do such crap? And all the reviews that are in green, that chance that they are all fans of the singer Taylor swift hahaha, ridiculous all of them who don't  accept that it is a very bad movie.",0
13,Worst movie of the decade! A mess! The soundtrack flopped brought to us by Taylor Swift. Tayvodoo strikes so bad. Swifties aren't streaming and paying to watch this montrosity.,0
14,"I loved the movie!The critics and reviews suggesting it is too sexual... clearly have their mind in the gutter. It is an entertaining adaptation of a Broadway MUSICAL- something that most seem to be forgetting.If you appreciate great dancing, singing, and fun- this movie is for you! If you love to jump on the bandwagon and hate whats popular to hate, might as well just save your money.",1
16,"See this movie, and decide for yourself. CATS does not deserve the scathingly negative reviews that many critics gave it. With all musicals, stage or screen, the theatre goer must first knowingly suspend disbelief in order to allow themselves to be swept away, and drawn into that world. This is T.S. Elliott’s poetry, written in 1939 and combined with modern day glitz, technology, spectacle, song and dance. This creative crew did a fine job brining it all to life, and I was very entertained! Critics are just that... critics!",1
17,"My husband and I really enjoyed the film. Despite all of the negative reviews, it is pretty true to the stage production with some slight changes. Francesca Hayward was an enchanting Victoria, Dame Judi Dench was charming, and the CGI really wasn’t the disaster critics claim. Cats has always been a whimsical, idiosyncratic musical without a hefty plot line. The joy of Cats is in the wonderful music, dancing, and the unique feline characters. If you have no sense of fun or appreciation for the arts and can’t suspend your disbelief long enough to simply enjoy some great singers and actors who happen to be in Cat costumes, skip this film. I’m sure there will be another dull, formulaic and unoriginal film you can watch instead. Maybe another Fast and Furious sequel is more your speed ?!?!",1
18,"This movie is weird, but I loved its weirdness. I was mesmerized by Francesca Hayward as Victoria. Idris Elba and Judi Dench were fantastic. I liked the music. I liked the weird visuals. I liked it.",1
19,bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad,0
20,"I hate this movie, seriously is the worst movie and the song beautiful flops is only a joke for the true music",0
21,"Great reworking of a classic. Perhaps the songs are a bit dated now, but the plot is better than the stage show ever was, and the CGI effects are good too.",1
22,I absolutely loved this movie and so did my daughters (age 23 and 26). We've seen the play though and loved the play but we liked the movie even more! I believe those who appreciate dance and music (actual talent) will enjoy it.,1
23,"I can't really wrap my mind around how unfair people are to this movie. I loved it. The actors really are giving their all, the songs are great, the choreography is also very good. As someone who seen the original play it's my favorite version of it.",1
24,"""Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me."" Thing is this valley -  The uncanny valley is scary. For the whole movie my brain was hurting trying to humanize cats. It struggled so much that almost missed constant cringe-fest, bad music and ""choreography""? What was it supposed to be? Only good thing in this situation is I got ticket for free. Otherwise I would feel robbed. Production value in general is typical Hollywood level, hence score of ""2"" instead of -2 that this ^#^##*$@%#&*$(*#*# deserves.",0
25,I'm just glad I eventually woke up from this two hour long fever dream.  Now I pretend it never happened.,0
26,"The design of the characters is a failure. Simple as that. I cant believe somebody draw this, then someone else approved it, made it in to super expensive CGI and again said - yes, this looks fine! How is this possible that no one said - wait a second, thy looks creepy as hell.",0
27,"What to say about cats. Cats as a whole movie is a master piece. The movie starts with a horror vibe as the main cat is ambushed by a bunch of cats wanting food for the night. After a few songs about genitals we get to the main plot of the story.The queen cat has to pick a cat to kill and send to space. so we go on this whole wacky adventure with hit star James Cordon and other non important characters and jump into the world of cats. They eat,drink and meow like cats. Half-way through seeing the movie i realized it was not star wars, but in fact cats. I mean most people were probably confused, it had Dumbledore. anyways back to the movie. talor swift drugs all the cats and then the sung a song about wanting to bring back all the cats that were thanos snapped (James Cordon). Once they are back the queen cat picks a black cat because she is racist. then the cat dies and they sing a song about being cats. all in all i give this movie a 10/10.",1
28,CATastrophic. I don't understand how anyone ever thought this CGI mess was a good idea. It is utterly cringeworthy.,0
29,"Too many things going on, storylines were difficult to follow with the lyrics being impossible to understand in critical moments of the movie.",0
30,"What an experience! Cats overflows with creativity and ardor and spirit and energy that comes from the cast onscreen and the people behind the scenes. The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's infectuous whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of ""Beautiful Ghosts"" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of ""Memory"" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This ""Cats"" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizbella's ""Memory"" preludes with a sweet and touching version of ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some ""meh"" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous ""performances by an actor"" were  Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat.  There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminicing about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S. A quick comment on the ""trailers"" ~ having seen the complete movie, I feel sorry for those whose jobs were to create 3-minute trailers to communicate the merits of this movie. The film contains so much more than can be squeezed into a trailer.",1
31,"CreepyThere are some things that should stay as drawings like anthro animals, Even if the designs weren’t creepy, Cats would still not be good because of a badly written script.",0
32,"What did you expect? Oh. Do the you think the humans pretending to be magical singing cats look weird? I tell you, if someone was going to make an adaptation of ALW's Cats, i WANTED it to look weird! I wanted it to strange, fantastical, sometimes silly, sometimes oddly serious, and always unlike any other movie out there. In those terms, this film is a wild success. You can argue that you don't like the show on which it is based (I had actually never seen it, nor was I familiar with most of the music,) and that you might have never had any interest in seeing any adaptation of it period, but I feel like most people are merely reviewing the film's existence and not the film itself. If you don't like the look of the film and the performers, what WOULD have satisfied you? It was always going to be humans pretending to be cats. Yes, the CGI fur and make-up looks odd, but I was totally fine with it. I was thoroughly entertained for the entire film. I went to an early press screening, and then took my wife a few days later. Unlike me, she is very familiar with the show and she absolutely loved this film. Even more than I. Are there so rough edges to this film? Definitely. But that's certainly true with similarly toned recent musicals like Moulin Rouge or The Greatest Showman, and I like this film considerably more than those. The cast here is excellent. Ian McKellen is a notable standout. Many of the non-star dancers are exceptional. I think Hooper did an excellent job with the film. A Cats movie was always going to be weird. This is gloriously weird. The more people who hate on it now, the bigger the cult status it will achieve later. This film has its fans. They just need to find each other. This one will be watched for years to come. Just not by everyone.",1
33,"Cats is poor, Stranger, confused, with performances wtffff. And the Soundtrack daaaahhh",0
34,Give me a break- there has never been a plot to cats. This is a fabulous and imaginative production- great fun and  Ian McKellen was amazing. We loved it but know what to expect!,1
35,"This screams cult classic. Just wait, this will be a beloved fav for many critics in about 20 years.",1
36,"I know this is getting a lot of bad review, but I really enjoyed Cats. This is such a wildly imaginative movie in both story and appearance.In order to help explain the plot, it helps to look at this film's origins. At first, there were a bunch of poems about cats written by T.S. Elliott in the 1930s. Then came the crazy idea to turn them into songs for an eighties musical. It really didn't have any spoken words. A loose story was added to tie the songs together. Now we've got a film trying to to sell this loose concept to a general audience. I don't think it did too bad a job.The movie takes the basic musical and adds some dialogue and a little more to flesh things out. The story is this: a bunch of cats compete in order to win the honor of cat reincarnation. The story still isn't big; a lot of this is just the contestants introducing themselves through song. (You can go through multiple numbers without dialogue.) Still, I feel it works well enough. Don't get me wrong, the whole thing is kind of nuts. We've got a whole bunch of humanoid felines doing a bunch of random stuff. (Also, some of them are magic apparently.) But that's what I like about this. It's basically creative pageantry that is just trying to have fun. (Although, there is this really dark turn in the Jenny Anydots song, which wasn't in the previous works. It left a bad taste.)Director Tom Hooper really tried to keep the highlights of the musical: the songs and the dancing. A lot of musical movie adaptations have to cut stuff for time, but this one is surprisingly intact. The movie manages to keep all but one song I believe. Fans of the original be prepared that they change up the lyrics or musical tempo or style for some of the numbers. (I think the movie was trying to update these to appeal to the mainstream.) Personally, I didn't find any of the changes too outrageous.As for the songs, well Memory, which the musical is best known for, is an excellent piece. The other numbers, though... Well, these contain thirties lyrics and peculiar feel to a lot of them. I think the songs are decent, but they don't compete with a bunch of other musicals. They're a bit of a selective taste. The new song Beautiful Ghosts (the one they usually create for films in order to get a best original song Oscar nomination) is okay. The lyrics are very poetic, but the music can't live up to them.One of the things I like best about this is that it brings back what is missing in a lot of modern musicals: the extended dance sections. The choreography is really good the cinematography does a fluid job of displaying the action. There is a real distinctiveness to people dancing like cats.This movie is eye-candy personified. All the sets are huge, dreamlike, and colorful in a dark neon sort of way (as confusing as that sounds.) There are these big fantastic-looking set pieces and so many of them.The cats are created using computer graphics on mo-cap actors. The people-cats are definitely distinctive looking. The animation for the faces never quite feel natural, but it I didn't find it to be a deal breaker either.For a movie where people act like cats, I'm impressed that almost the entire cast really committed to this. Idris Elba seems to be having a hell of a time eating up the scenery. It's rather fascinating seeing how veteran actors Judi Dench and Ian McKellan take such goofy actions as rubbing heads together or scratching themselves so seriously. McKellan puts so much work into his character's mannerisms that I think this is one of his best roles. The lead Francesca Haywood, a ballerina, does a fine job as the newbie to the group.Remember when I said ""almost?"" Well, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots is the only actor who doesn't feel like they're trying to play a character. She's just doing Rebel Wilson stuff and throwing jokes. The character Jennyanydots as she plays her doesn't really match the character as described in her introductory song.This movie, especially the songs may not be for everyone. It's kinda artsy, but I found this to be a truly unique and creative ride. I say give it a shot.",1
37,"I love Cats, although Bombalurina's character appears shortly is the performance that I liked the most. Swift gave everything he had as a cat lover.",1
38,"Sem surpreender ninguém, crítica especializada massacra ""Cats"" e filme estreia no Rotten Tomatoes com míseros 9% e um whiskas podre. Segundo os principais sites, o filme megalomaníaco de Tom Hooper se perde em um CGI preguiçoso e roteiro mal construído que não destaca a atuação de nenhum dos grandes atores envolvidos no projeto, nem mesmo o trabalho de Jennifer Hudson, responsável por cantar a canção mais marcante do musical, ""Memory"".",0
39,"Brilliant! Surreal and engaging! Wonderful characters, amazing choreography and sets.. Both amusing and touching.",1
40,"Great movie! Great themes and lessons of compassion, love, community, friendship, good over evil, redemption, kindness. Instead of taking your kids to a blood-and-weaponry movie, take them to this one. Memorable music, breathtaking dancing, and wonderful characters to relate to. Too bad the stupid critics wouldn't know a great movie if they saw one. With growing violence in this world, isn't it time to teach the lessons of this movie? I vote for it!",1

51,"An amazing adaptation of the musical to the silver screen. The acting, dance and special effects have taken CATS forward to a new generation in an exciting way!",1
52,I love love love this movie! I have been a fan of this musical since I was a child and for me this movie brought that magical feeling that I experienced so long ago rushing back to me.I really don’t understand why this movie is experiencing so much hatred. I guess you either feel the magic or you don’t. I kind of feel sorry for those who don’t. ,1

55,"Maybe isn't one of the best movies, clearly not, but there's something in Cats, something that makes me love it. And obviously, Taylor was amazing.",1
56,"An incredible delivery, which goes back to the old performance of Cats, but with a touch of the current with those effector somewhat rare, but well achieved; Unbelievable numbers like Taylor Swift's in her small appearance, a touch of subtlety and sensuality. I loved!",1
57,It's a very good musical movie. We loved it and actually everyone in the theater became quite emotional..great job!,1
58,Exceeded my expectations.  I loved Taylor's acting in the movie.  Beautiful Ghost is the most beautiful song I've ever heard.  10,1
59,"Loved this film so much! Music was great, cast were great, sets were great and I even liked the cgi I though they looked funny but in a cute way",1
60,"Definitely don’t listen to the critics. This movie is funny and the performers are talented. Even the children in the theater enjoyed it. Great music and great dancing, if you enjoy musicals then you should definitely give this movie a chance.",1
61,The critics are dead wrong about this one. It's the best movie of the year! It's purrrrrfect!,1
62,"Eu gostei muito de Cats o filme é muito bom e surpreendente, as críticas negativas são compreensíveis, mas tem um limite. A atuação da cantora Taylor Swift é simplesmente perfeita e surpreendente.",1

65,"So I went and saw Cats.  Here is my review:As expected, this is not a movie about cats; This a movie about ghouls.  Two hours of gyrating ghouls.  Maybe you're thinking after two hours you'll get used to the ghouls, because you'll get immersed in the plot or something. But nope, they're still ghouls the whole time and it's always terrifying.  And there is no plot.This was the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time, mostly because the combination of unintentionally terrifying creatures really sincerely trying their best to be cute for so long but just never succeeding was sort of like a running gag that kept getting funnier and funnier as time wore on.Also when you add on top of the cutesy terror the fact that there also attempts at humor that never quite land, so its sort of like if a demon was doing a standup set and just bombing up there and you feel bad for him but well, he is still a demon who would devour your soul at the first chance so not too bad for him.And then you add in that none of the songs make any god damn sense whatsoever because there is no plot development so stuff just sort of happens and it is terrifying and then it stops.This is a trash classic.",1
66,"Um filme incrível que fez jus a originalidade do musical da CATS, se os “críticos especialistas” estavam esperando ver algo totalmente diferente erraram drasticamente.",1
67,"It's not a bad movie. The CGI does come to be strange, but the acting, songs and direction are very well thought out",1
68,"This is the worst thing i ever saw. It would be understandable if it would be some niche porn movie for some special people but its not, its a musical. Terrible. No, just no.",0
69,The worst film of the year. And the music is as CATastrophic as the film. A shame.,0
70,"Uma porcaria igual tudo o que a taylor faz, que merda de filme sem noçãao. Vai fazer filme de cobra que combina mais com vc sua vaca palmito ecaaaaaa kkkkkkk",0
71,"I give this film 10 out of 10 stars because I thought the song and dance was very visually and audibly pleasant. I don't understand why people are putting heat on the movie just because the cats look weird, that's literally so rude. I feel like this production culminated in a very wholesome and stunning manner and that it is deserving of praise. Please give this movie a chance, you won't regret it. I'm going to watch this movie until it stops screening at my local cinema",1
72,"There are so many critics about this movie, but surprisingly, I disagreed with the most. The songs, in general, are pretty good. The editing, tho, should be better. Bombalurina's part was the best and they should've definitely worked out more on her and Macavity.",1
73,"First thing I want to say here is, the hate this movie has been receiving is overwhelming ridiculous. I’ve been a fan of the original cats musical for a while now, so watching the movie from the stance of a theatre fan, this movie did an amazing job at bringing the magic of cats to the big screen. First of all, I love what they did with Victoria’s character. In the original musical Victoria doesn’t have a song and she isn’t the main character, no one is. But they way they spun this film into a story of a abandonment and acceptance was really touching. Furthermore the scene with skimbleshanks was incredible and magical. I could not believe how they gave skimble an entire tap number which fit his character perfectly. And Jennifer Hudson’s performance of “Memory” had me in tears in the theatre. Overall, this film was a great adaptation from musical to movie. Anyone who dislikes this movie is most likely a hater of the original breathtaking musical, Cats.",1
74,This **** is good just bc Taylor Swift is in it. I mean I’m so obsessed with Macavity,1
75,What an experience! No way to describe it really. It’s simply Cats. Taylor Swift honestly stole the show but Jennifer Hudson & Francesca Hayward were amazing as well.,1
76,"I've seen the original Cats musical a handful of times, and the last time I watched it I did wonder why they hadn't created a film (other than the old filmed version of the musical). For the most part the film hits the spot. It has most of the songs from the original musical. The new song, Beautiful Ghosts, isn't a great fit but neither is it terrible. It's great to see some a variety of actors in the roles, which are pretty much a good fit. I don't have an issue with the CG, other than from a technical standpoint the fur seems to shift ever so slightly at times in relation to the actor. The story from the original musical is an odd one, and I suspect most people didn't understand it or pay attention, watching the dancing and listening to the songs instead. The film explains a lot more about what's going on, and it's either something you engage with or think is daft. Overall I enjoyed it, but clear it's proving divisive.",1
77,"nice movie, i see from here lets check gusy. {id-movie.site} just copy and paste on new tab",1
78,"I am so glad that I gave this a chance! It was great!! Never have I ever gotten chills from a musical in a movie theatre. Having seen this on broadway three times, this could have been a letdown but I have told everyone to go see it again and again!!",1

80,"a scary and fun movie, brings all the magic of a musical back. I love the way Taylor Swift views the role.  a real actress",1
81,The movie was an excellent adaptation of the Broadway stage production. I can’t wait to see it again! It is wonderful that the movie industry made this show available for a broader audience to experience. Some people can’t access live theatre. This movie will give them a near experience to what it’s like to watch the show on Broadway. My sister who hates the live show adored this movie. She said it made the entire stage plot make sense. I loved it as much as I loved the stage show. The Jennyanydots scene was too graphic...extremely disgusting. Other than that this movie deserves 10 stars.,1
82,"im a swiftie what can i do? nothing but support my queen, but about the movie i think it was good",1
83,Just because of Taylor Swift the film was good and the credit solely goes to her.,1
84,Esse filme é incrível e eu amo com todo meu coração e eu vou defender sempre e para sempre,1
85,"The plot in the movie is something terrible as well as everything connected with this movie, exept atmosphere in a cinema. Due to the fact that most of people know that it is piece of sh*t, there were no audience.",1
86,Its a good movie ! You're really going to like it if you're interested in musicals a must-watch Tayor's part was the best part in the whole movie,1

95,Como podem desprezar uma obra de arte dessa ? Taylor Swift uma rainha tão dócil capaz de receber um hate tão grande que nem ela mesma merecia?  Aonde iremos parar ? O filme está ótimo.,1
96,"Ignore the Taylor Swift stans inflating the grade of this truly piece of crap movie (she’s only in the movie for around 5 minutes btw). Cats is, for the lack of a better term, a catastrophe. It was a terrible musical to begin with, mainly because it contains no plot (unless you consider the act of only introducing characters as a “plot”), is a dumb concept, features literally only one good song (Memory), and, most importantly, is really boring. The film, however, amplifies the terribleness of the musical by using nightmare-inducing CGI characters/costumes that look unfinished at points, annoying acting, and mixed tones, while also keeping all the huge flaws of the Broadway show. Nobody asked for a Cats film adaption and nobody (not even Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper) could ever make it work. Truly a sight to never behold.",0
97,"Oh, how crummy this movie is! Stinks worse than a litter box. I was bored to tears.",0

99,this is movie is just too wierd i can't even finish it the fact that is cgi on cat costumes it's just wierd,0
100,Spoiler alert! This movie sucks. Worst movie I’ve seen in nearly a decade. I mean... Maybe it could  become a cult classic for being so terrible? Probably the best the producers could hope for.,0

Don't forget to include some sort of weapon otherwise they will most likely use their nails to claw their eyes out and die very slowly. Quite a mess too.,1

113,Worst film I have ever watched. Two hours of introducing characters with almost no story. The film is hard to follow as half the songs are mumbled. The dancing is extremely repetitive and visually lacklustre. The CGI is horrific and the humour is non-existent. It was excruciating to be stuck in the cinema watching this.,0
114,"When I was very young my mother had this doll of one of the main characters from CATS that would play a music box version of one of the songs. I think she got it at a showing considering she was a big fan of the musical from what I can remember. That doll helped me consider different character designs working and shape my perceptions of what characters in media could be which led me to a love a weird but good media like anime and video games.Unfortunately in 2006 my mother passed away due to kidney complications. After she died I would occasionally wind up the doll and play it. I never figured out which song it was but I remember it being very calming to me when I was struggling with School or other problems I was facing during the grieving process.Now here I am at 22, I have a job now. Made friends from a world apart from where I am. I have my own apartment. I have, moved on. Then I hear that the musical my late mother loved so much was getting a movie adaptation. I watched the trailer, saw the CGI and thought that this is going to be one of those movies where the CGI is bad but the story itself was good. Oh how wrong I was.I've never made a metacritic review, or even made one for fun. I usually feel that what I could say is what everyone has already said tens or thousands of times over. What could I add to the conversation when so many people share the same feelings as I do?You and I know the movie is bad. You've probably seen the twitter posts, you've more than likely seen the professional critics have an existential crisis over this movie. You've probably seen it with friends for a ""Bad movie night"". Or maybe you have no idea what this movie is or what it originally came from. And truth be told, I've never seen the play despite that doll from my bygone days. So there's nothing for me to say on the differences between the stage play and the movie. But for me, there's something personal I have to say about CATS.My mother is dead and I'm glad she didn't have to see this cannibalization of something that she loved.",0

117,"Went there to mock watch but it was so bad it wasn't even a challenge. Most poorly made movie I've seen in a while. The CGI was TERRIBLE. So terrible that the producers had to be aware of this, which means it's a case of incredibly lazy filmmaking. Disappointing. Even worse, they had my guy Ian McKellan lapping milk out of a bowl. Made him look like a whole fool. Despite this, his performance was just about the only impressive one in the whole movie. Jennifer Hudson really shined in the vocal department, but her acting failed to convince me. It goes without saying that the cat ""costumes"" were unsettling and things of this nature should be left to the Furries. An all-around poorly conceived film. Thank God the cinematography was half-decent or I might have walked out of the theater.",0

119,"I watched it and I have a PTSD for two days due to the disturbing nature of the film. The plot was average and overall it's just so bad, I walked away from the theathre in the half of the movie.",0
120,"Great music and dancing, funny characters and cat like CGI. I enjoyed the movie despite the negative reviews.",1
121,"Director Tom Hooper did a masterful job of turning the musical Les Miserables into a marvelous movie. This time around, he's tackled one of the world's most popular shows and failed nobly. I've always thought this play was stupidly weird (what IS a jellicle cat?) and the music was too twee (with the exception of ""Memory""). This screen version hasn't changed my opinions. As anyone who's seen a clip knows, it's downright creepy to see these actors digitally transformed into catlike bodies. To make matters worse, the dancing is often dumb, the sets aren't attractive and the staging lacks beauty or inventiveness. With the exception of Ian McKellen's touching ""Gus: The Theatre Cat"" and Jennifer Hudson's dramatic ""Memory"" there's nothing warm or wonderful about this laughable feline failure.",0
122,"I knew this wasn't going to be good going into it, but I was hoping/expecting it would be the fun kind of bad like The Room or Sharknado. All of the promotional material and post-release press painted a picture of this being cinema's next big trashterpiece. While I can see it fitting that bill for some, I personally found it to be too aggressively awful to deliver the kind of ironic entertainment I was looking for.I had no idea what was going on for the first half of the movie. It's just a string of inconsequential characters being introduced through musical numbers, all but one of which are unintelligible, and not just lyrically. Everybody onscreen does have a powerful voice, but not one of them seems to be able to enunciate. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the audio mixing or what, but I've heard more vocal clarity from mumble rappers. That's a big nail in the coffin for a musical like this.A plot centered around reincarnation does eventually emerge from all the nonsense. However, that's when the movie goes from being stupefyingly terrible to a total snoozefest. I legitimately struggled to stay awake and came dangerously close to turning the thing off. It was only by sheer willpower and the fact that I had already given up halfway through another film earlier this month that I was able to keep going. The ending is sweet in a sappy sort of way, but nothing leading up to it is interesting.The CGI cat people are, of course, horrifying. The opening sequence looks like something out of a horror flick and these are the most terrifying dance routines this side of the Suspiria remake. Just when you think things can't get any more disturbing there's some horrific new sight waiting around the next corner, be it the nightmarish rat children or Idris Elba's disgusting unfinished pelt (between this and his old man look in Thor: Ragnarok I no longer find him attractive). Why do they all have human hands?It's also weirdly sexual. As if Tom Hooper made this for his own enjoyment if you know what I mean. This is especially strange because it appears, at least to me, that the material would have done better had it been aimed at children. Yet, at the end of the day Cats is too inappropriate for the audience it seems most suited for.Only time will tell if this becomes a cult classic the likes of Birdemic or Troll 2. It seemingly has all the right elements as it's very existence is kind of hilarious. The problem for me was that those laughs weren't found while actually watching the movie. It's far more amusing from the outside because you don't really have to experience how overly long, boring, and uncomfortable it is to sit through. So given how the aforementioned titles have managed to find followings despite their lack of quality because of how much fun they are in the moment with the right mindset, this will always just be little more than a particularly foul turd in the litter box from my viewpoint.2.6/10",0
125,"Cats (2019)Sinopsis:Una tribu de gatos debe decidir, como cada año, cuál de ellos ascenderá al Heaviside Layer y, así, podrá renacer y volver en una nueva vida.Opinión:Debo confesar que esperaba plenamente lo peor, ya que objetivamente esta película fue el mayor desastre crítico y financiero del 2019 y posiblemente de los más grandes de los últimos años, aún así, mi intuición me convenció de que podría rescatar algo bueno y lamentablemente apenas puedo mencionar un aspecto o quizás dos.Lo bueno:- La breve pero impecable participación de Taylor Swift, creo que no fueron ni 10 minutos, lo cual no indica nada bueno después de todo.Lo malo:- A ver, los efectos especiales no son tan horrendos como dicen, a decir verdad me parecieron bastante promedios.- La protagonista, la cual está con cara de mamerta frigida durante toda la película, pésima actuación de su parte, hasta Jennifer Hudson que es otro de las docenas de personajes odiosos lo hace relativamente mejor.- Judy Dench, una actriz respetada con tantos años de trayectoria cuesta verla en esta película sin sentir que está en un terreno donde no pertenece.- Los números musicales, okey, es una película musical, pero una cosa es eso y otra es llegar al abuso, aquí abusan deliberadamente, tan solo en la primera escena los jodidos gatos antropomorfos hacen más escándalo que en todas las películas de High School Musical juntas.- Exceso de personajes en pantalla, tantas criaturas cantando y bailando hasta saturar la pantalla es abrumador y difícil de seguir.- La banda sonora no es exactamente mala, pero es difícil de seguir por los puntos anteriormente mencionados.- El guión es plano y pretencioso, y cuando una película se aprecia el exceso de pretencion y ambiciones es señal de que no veremos un buen producto final.En lo personal ni siquiera la terminé de ver, apenas concluyó la presentación de Taylor Swift dejé de verla porque definitivamente es un suplicio la película en general, de los 110 minutos que dura no pasé de los 80.Una PESADILLA...Valoración:0.5 ⭐ de 5 ⭐",0

131,"So let's just get this out of the way.Cats is just as good as the Broadway music.Which is to say it is and always has been hot garbage.The only reason that the musical every worked was simply because ""The 80's""I literally know not a single person who is a fan of cats, I know people who have seen it and enjoyed it, but mostly because its just that bad... And that bizarre.This movie, a title that It pains me to use for this aborted tragedy of a cinematic outing.The original show's audience was basically children, stay at home mom's and perverts. And the movie most likely has the same group of people going to bat for it.The movie was ugly, like the musical.It sounded alright but had not emotional gravitas, like the musical.The acting was bad, like the musical.It was far to close to being a porn, like the Musical.It had a paper thin plot, like the movie.If the're is anything nice I can say about this movie it's that it is a good adaptation of the musical. Which was also hot garbage.",0
132,"Everyone pretty much immediately jumped down this movie’s throat when its first trailer dropped, with pretty much everyone saying the effects were horrible. That’s not necessarily true; the creative decision to put human faces on cats is strange, but the effects are pretty decent from a technical level. And you get used to the weird faces pretty quick.I say this because the thing that everyone thought was going to kill this movie is actually the least sh*tty thing about this movie.Positives, positives. Uhhh... the production design is fine, I guess. I mean, a lot of the environments feel really empty, but they look nice. From a lyrical standpoint, most of the songs suck and are pretty boring, but they sound fine. And I did like Taylor Swift’s song, not gonna lie. Everything else is just about the worst it could be. I can’t remember seeing a movie that was THIS bad at telling a story in a LONG time. I honestly could not have told you what the plot was immediately after leaving the theater. It’s aggressively boring and unfunny. The only laughs I had were the ironic enjoyment of a horrific Rebel Wilson, Idris Elba yelling meow and disappearing, and 80 year old Sir Ian McKellen hissing and drinking milk. The actual intentional jokes were PAINFUL to sit through.Do not see. Not even worth sitting through for ironic enjoyment; go watch The Room or Birdemic or something, anything as long as it’s not this.",0

135,A pior história de todos os tempos. Nunca vi nada tão bizarro como esse filme,0
137,"I was honestly expecting this movie to be worse than it was. That's not saying much, though, since this movie was still terrible. First of all, the special effects throughout the film are god-awful. Every character in the film was incredibly uncanny in appearance, which is a big problem. Apart from the awful aesthetics of the film, everything else was basically average. I liked some of the music in the film, but the songs didn't seem to have any purpose really. It's not a huge knock, but I would have liked the songs to actually progress the plot in some way and not just be cats singing about their personalities or abilities. Speaking of the plot, there basically was none. Things just sort of happened in this movie, and it was not compelling to me. Maybe people who are fans of the Cats musical aren't bothered by the lack of a real, substantive plot, but I have never seen the musical, so it was a problem for me. If you're a fan of the Cats musical who is also not creeped out by the cat-human CGI characters, I'd recommend this film, but I can't see myself recommending it to anyone else.",0
138,"""You aren't allowed to see Cats without me"" was the message I got on my phone from Friend a week ago, not that I was ever intending to see this film. So when we booked tickets two days ago and I sent a message to our other Friend with a time and place and he said, ""Cannot wait to see the first horror film of the year,"" I was surprised. And I was more surprised when our other Friend, upon hearing that we wanted to see it blackout, messy drunk in about twenty-four hours, also agreed. We were, as you might have expected, the only people in the theater for about twenty minutes until two well-meaning elders entered and dutifully ignored us, our soda spilled on their floor, their seats ignobly stolen, grown men and women shouting full-volume at Coke commercials and trailers (they were all right people).I vacillate between thinking that the Cats people were in on the joke and thinking that they were basically the sloppy procrastinator in class who made his science fair project on Sunday night and got caught trying to pass it off as a full-fledged thing. I don't want to reward laziness or slave labor, which is what Brother says was basically the way that the SFX house was able to win the bid for the movie (he also said that it was reportedly only about 10% finished when they released it to the public), but I'm also completely willing to believe that this was basically the exact creative vision of a very, very sick man, who only recently became aware that his version of reality does not match with the rest of us. I can confirm that Ian McKellan is great in this movie (mostly because someone has told him his lines are the words associated with cat sounds but not the actual sounds) and that Taylor Swifts catboobs are misshappen and also distractingly enhanced, but I don't think I follow when people say that this movie is too horny for its own good and that all the erect tails are distracting. I can only imagine being uncomfortable about the level of cat horn if I were taking my kid sister to this movie, but as it was, we were all adult enough to watch Dame Judy flash us with her cat minge and Ian McKellan sexually harass that milk plate with his tongue. It is kind of **** how Rebel Wilson takes off her own catsuit (oh is it a pun? I think it's a pun!), but there isn't a cockroach holocaust as was billed in earlier critical reviews, unless the first cut of this movie included more graphic scenes than the one I saw. I understand what that one review meant when it said simply of Jennifer Hudson, ""They did her so dirty."" I think at first it meant that of all the ugly CGI cats she was the queen of the ugly cats, and though I think that's part of it, I think it might be a specific combination of the amount of snot they left on her lips in any given close up and their direction to her to act like someone who had just recently been told that they were contractually obligated to star in Cats. Brother said that he could ""not explain the ending of the movie even now that I've seen it,"" which I sympathize with. Because the movie is basically ""cats introducing themselves for two hours"" until ""Judy Dench stares directly into the camera and lectures you for three straight minutes,"" the plot never really develops any characters, beyond the fact that Idris Elba seems to be some sort of powerful wizard who gains strength the less clothing he's wearing. I'm not entirely sure how Deuteronomy is able to free herself from the plank walk, except the length of the Mephistopheles song really gives her enough time to have swim home and blow dry herself for all I know. (At what point does one song become  long enough to actually legitimately be two different songs?) I refuse to believe that **** cat with his stupid hat learns magic through peer pressure. Regardless of how many other cats are magic in this movie, he uses a **** miniature pencil as his wand. And if he is a real wizard, why does Deuteronomy not thank him? Why does she just sing the song that the rest of the cats has been singing to make believe that he's much more impressive than he is? Why does she appear behind them as if she's been hiding in the wings the entire time? This is how they win, right? They paralyze us in thought about small **** like this so that we have a hard time fighting the nauseous feeling of seeing someone's face painted onto the front of their head or maybe carved deep into it, it's hard to tell, because everything looks so fuzzy and out of focus, except, well, the actual fuzz, which looks painted and a little bit tacked on.",0

146,This movie was purely awful in all respects. Just terrible. Please never watch it ever,0
148,"When the classic musical “Cats” composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber was announced to hit the big screen the possibilities seemed endless. While this film has nostalgia for fans of the stage play; it ultimately leaves a void that it never quite fills. The CGI was at times painful to see. From odd bulges, strange looking hands and simply an overly sexual design left me wondering why they didn’t just stick with costumes. Choreography was changed, characters were different; (no kittens)and one of my favorite scenes where the white kitten dances at the ball to a express her coming of age and sexuality was heavily edited (doing no favors to the talented ballerina  Francesca Hayward) and thus lost all meaning that had touched me in the stage play. Yes “Cats” is a musical but majority of this nearly 2 hour film is just music. The film brings together big names such as  Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen and Taylor Swift to name a few but they are quickly lost in the debacle. The minuscule amount of time spent on the story and character development had a detrimental effect on the cast. Grizabellas plight that I had once found moving seemed trivial. While Jennifer Hudson delivered powerful vocals on many of her characters beloved songs the scope of the film was so limited that neither she could break free of its restraints.James Corden and Rebel Wilson are the definite “comic relief” but while Corden has his moments Wilson’s role was an utter joke. In one of her worst roles yet; her non humorous repetitive lines, idiotic scenes, and just out of place crotch shots left a horrid impression that was not easily forgotten. Memorable moments included the vocals from both Jennifer Hudson and Jason Derulo. Taylor swift shined in her role but even tho it was highly advertised was a mere ten minutes of the entirety of the film. Overall “Cats” was the golden coin chocolate promising on the outside but bland and uiniviting on the inside. Fans of the stage play will find glimpses of light here and there but just like Grizabellas plight this musical has had better days in the sun.",0
149,"I went to see the movie “Cats”, directed by Tom Hooper and adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical of the same name, out of pure morbid curiosity. I tried to go into the experience with as little bias as possible, despite the horrid reactions that came from near everyone I knew who had seen it. Not to mention the poorly received original trailer for the movie, which still sits in the abysmal 20% approval range on Youtube. Dear lord… I wish somehow my own curiosity could’ve killed these cats. A misguided effort in almost every possible way, “Cats” feels like a consistently unpleasant fever dream that never quite reaches the entertaining awfulness that comes with the likes of “Troll 2”, or “The Room”. It’s just… a boring assault on the senses every step of the way. From what I’ve gathered, having never seen the original musical myself, the source material never should have been given a shot at the big screen, and simply didn’t have the substance to carry over to a feature length film. This part of the review would typically delve somewhat into the plot of the movie, so you don’t go into it without any clue as to what it’s about. “Cats” makes this very easy by having little to no plot at all. To put it as simply as possible, it is all a big talent show of different musical numbers from individual cats in a tribe called the Jellicles, all being shown to us through the eyes of a newcomer cat, Victoria (Francesca Hayward). From the moment her horrifically CG cat body is abandoned on the streets and surrounded by her new friends, we are subjected to a parade of different nauseating musical numbers featuring dramatic moments which have no depth, and comedic moments which aren’t the least bit funny. Weirdly human looking felines gyrate and prance about with feet that look like they aren’t quite touching the ground… A fat cat named Bustopher Jones (James Corden) unfunnily sings about being fat, and a cat who seems rather horny for himself named Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo) woos a myriad of female cats to the point of making them all ‘meow’ salaciously (weird). This is the movie. Sure, there is some evil cat named Macavity who wants to sabotage the thin plot with some sort of vague magic, but to call him the antagonist implies that the film has enough plot and character to antagonize. But no, it is really just a showcase of unrelated musical numbers for poorly rendered feline-esque creatures from hell who would be better off if their Jellicle-hides were tanned into some Jellicle-boots.It should be noted that the costume designer for this movie, Paco Delgado, has been nominated for Oscars for his work on “Les’ Misérables” (2013), also directed by Tom Hooper, and yet they decided to go the freaky CG cat person route. This really is a testament to the movie’s main issue. Not… not one single decision that was made seems like the correct one.I suppose the one reason that I can’t quite bring myself to give this movie a dismal 1/10, which would mean it has no redeemable qualities, is the obvious effort put into the choreography. You can tell that these cats can dance. You can even tell that these cats can sing. It would just be less distracting if the moves and notes weren’t coming from the strange, haunting and horny creatures that we’re forced to sit with for almost two painstakingly slow hours.",0
150,This was legitimately the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. The entire plot is in song and if the theater that you watch it then does not have top-tier sound equipment you cannot understand half of the words they say. In order for me to understand the plot of this movie I had to read a synopsis about it because I could barely understand what was going on in the movie. The best part of the movie was the Taylor Swift musical number. It had the best vocals and sound. At roughly an hour and 45 minutes I think this movie was too short. The story progressed way too fast there was almost never any conflict. I honestly think that I should have been paid to consume this content. Honestly I don't know who this movie was made for no one asked for it. it might have been a good Broadway show but it definitely was not a good movie. And I feel bad for the actors and actresses who actually spent time hard work and effort to work on this movie. You could tell if they were devoted to their parts but what they were given was just bad.,0
151,"I saw CATS on New Years Day and I thought it was absolutely fabulous! Francesca Hayward was a true star and had a flawless and moving performance!A group of 6 of us went (ages between 50-70), so that may have been a factor, but we all thoroughly enjoyed it! The music was just terrific! I could actually see it again and probably will purchase it to watch at home as well!All of the cast were awesome and I enjoyed the moving moments as well as the funny song and dance sprinkled throughout! The choreography and singing was so enjoyable to watch and the performers were flawless! I have to mention Francesca Hayward again! She really shines and I would love to see more of her in the future!Thanks to all that helped to create this masterpiece!",1
152,"I was entranced by this film from the opening scenes, and find most of the adverse criticism bewildering. This is a film, in a staged style, of actors, dancers and singers portraying a story about cats, without having to wear heavy make-up or masks. I congratulate the CGI team for the wonderful work of fur, ears and tail enhancing the actor’s abilities to express the ‘catness’ of their characters. The storyline is easy to follow, the poems from T S Eliot having been supplemented to make a narrative whole. It is a film of humour, compassion, empathy, and “just desserts” portrayed in dance and song which was entertaining and thought provoking. I saw it twice in one week, gaining even more from noticing different aspects of the staging and revelling in the words, music, and many different styles of dance chosen for each cat character. Ignore the adverse criticism from the ‘professionals’. See it and make your own mind up, as I have.",1

156,"All the negative reviews are complaining about things that have been a part of CATS since the musical premiered in 1981. The original production and many high school productions have been available on YouTube for years. I found the original musical a little confusing yet still entertaining. The film expands Victoria’s character from one solo in the musical to a protagonist that you can follow as she learns what Jellicle Cats are and how she fits into her new world. I have an acting & dance background where I have had to portray animals for class exercises or in shows. If you are familiar with theatre you know how to willing suspense your disbelief so it’s pretty easy to accept actor/dancers portraying cats. I mean... that is what anyone who likes the musical CATS wants to see. It improves upon the stage production in both story and casting. Old Deuteronomy is played by Judi Dench and not a male actor. I appreciate the diversity in the cast. Many of the lead roles were played by non white actors. The film captures what is great about the musical and the singing and dancing is great. If you don’t like the musical, you won’t like the movie. But it’s really not for you, I guess? There are plenty other popular franchises out there. If you must listen to critics than go elsewhere. I’m going to see it again!",1

If you didn't see it or didn't bother to learn more about the premise of the movie then don't rate it as poor because you 'didn't get it'. I thought the CGI and costumes/makeup were very cool. Some said they couldn't understand the lyrics...did you understand all the lyrics in Hamilton before you listened to it a couple of times? I thought CATS was clever and entertaining. Go see it!,1

161,"This movie looks horrible, like why didn't they use normal cats? Cgi cats would be way better, than some knock off Will Smith, and Jack Black, like common now.

165,"You know, I always wanted to go to a musical, and then I saw the trailer for this miracle, read the comments, but they were all very negative, well, I thought and decided to trust the people who created this film ...I received such an aesthetic pleasure from watching this film that I cannot convey in words beautiful compositions and performances, an awesome plot with a very important problem in our society, and for me it was understandable and fully disclosed !!! I was wondering during the viewing, why is it so low rated? But I still don’t know the answer to this question, because for me it was one of the best adaptations that I watched !!! I hope the viewer will consider it more ...",1
166,"I personally loved the movie as much as I loved the musical. It’s a film about singing cats, I expected it to be weird and I’m not really bothered by the CGI.",1
167,"Truly Hollywoods Broadway adaption masterstroke. The only thing worthy of more praise than the star studded cast and production value, are our hardworking boys and gals on the VFX crew. Keep up the good work!",1
168,"Jesus I knew this was gonna happen. When first looking into the trailer, I knew this was gonna fail big time. This movie received so much backlash for its horrific cgi character models. I only watched this on a free movie app and immediately got bored of it. The horrific cgi and boring story got me thinking that this was the movie of 2019.",0
169,I would rather watch paint dry.just imagine the best thing you can get for 10$/€/£ can bd good or a game or anything well to bad you get that since you actually went to cats,0
170,"Ok this review is probably a bit controversial but I enjoyed this film. I admit the flaws that it has but there is some time of strange feeling of enjoyment, this film is just ridiculously weird however the songs are catchy, the CGI of the world (not the cats) is impressive, the acting is fine in my opinion, and it is a blast to watch. Even if its extremely cringey at parts and the design of the cats could be a million times better. So I would recommend this film if you like the original musical or if you want a oddly entertaining movie.",1
171,"This is my favorite movie. I think the bad reviews are by people who don’t like musicals. If you enjoy musicals, you’ll love this movie. ",1
