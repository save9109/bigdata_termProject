0,"This series is second only to Lord of the Rings in my favorites of all time.  I've read the books many times.  I've dreamed of this story being brought to the big screen for 20 years.  This movie is a **** alternate story set in the Dark Tower Universe. It has next to NOTHING to do with the books.  It's it's own story and it's a crappy one told on a budget with horrible casting, a mushy, utterly banal script and totally standard special effects.  It is literally the worst book adaption brought to film I've ever seen.  Stephen King and all involved... you have forgotten the faces of your fathers.  Shame on you.  Court would have beaten the living **** out of you had you handed him this pile of drek. Tragic.  Mark my words nothing more will be made based on these books.  You've ruined what could have been a 7 year saga bigger than Game of Thrones.  Unforgivable.",0
1,"This thing posing as the dark tower manages to turn one of the most epic, insane, heartbreaking, and fun series into boring, tired, drek. Do not see this movie if you read the books, especially if you really loved them.",0
2,"As a huge fan of the book series, this is a very disappointing movie.  Fans wanted the actual Dark Tower series.  Not some stunted alternate version that has nothing at all to do with the series.This has all the signs of the typical Hollywood book-to-movie adaptation disaster.  Take a series with a devoted fanbase.  Slap the name on a generic action movie.  Put in a few references to the books ""for the fans"" and call it good.No thanks.  The Lord of the Rings strayed slightly from the source material, but they did it *RIGHT*!  Nobody wanted a fake Dark Tower movie.  They wanted a series of movies that at least attempted to stay true to the books.There is one other thing I have to say to maker of this travesty.  It has been said before.You have forgotten the face of your father.",0
3,Honestly. We waited all this time and had to listen to all the stories about the movie being 'on...then off again.....' for the last 10 yrs and they came out with THIS piece of garbage?Save your money.,0
4,"Is this movie an entertaining 95 minutes?  Yes.Good casting choices? Yes, I loved the actors.Does the film have other good qualities...?Not many.  This was one of the worst film adaptations of a novel I've seen.  When you consider how long this adaptation has been a concept, how many attempts have been made, and the effort spent to achieve this in 2017?  I seriously just don't get it.  #CashGrab #AudiencesAreStupid  #JustGetItDone?All right, only 5000 characters I can post.  Let's get this over with:1) Tone & Mood.  Mostly wrong throughout the film.  The books are epic in scale, very dark and brooding.  Post-apocalyptic, lonely, desolate, etc.  While the film occasionally makes you feel that way, mostly it's ""Just Another Action Film"".  Many scenes feel forced.  Many scenes feel totally artificial.  Not sure what the director was looking for, but they failed.2) Story.  The film's title is misleading.  It should have been titled ""Jake's Adventure feat. Roland"".  This film was really all about Jake.  Everyone else is a guest star.3) Roland's motivation for pursuing the Man In Blank is *completely* different than the novels.  It's nonsense.4) Roland is supposedly *not* a Gunslinger anymore due to the above point.  I cannot even begin to describe how much this irks me.5) Roland embraces Jake as a friend too early/easily and divulges personal information.  I'll just blame the 95 minute length for this one.6) Walter cannot harm Roland *directly* with magic.  However, apparently he can harm Roland *indirectly* with magic, by throwing very sharp and fast objects at him.  So while Walter *could* have very easily dispatched the Gunslinger these past dozens of years, or when he killed his father, he didn't...because why not???6) Not sure why Jake needs an evil stepfather when his equally careless and inconsiderate father from the novels would have sufficed.  Unnecessary script change.7) Post-apocalypse villagers apparently still have working generators for inter-dimensional portal technology?  Wow.  Besides blatantly violating the novels, you'd think with such portals and technology at their disposal, they'd have better defenses.  Why not zip over to Earth and steal some firearms?8) No explanation of what Gunslingers actually are.  Audience is left wondering what's the point of them.9) Jake's ""shine"" powers are drastically over-mentioned, over-used, overblown compared to novels.  Besides cross-dimensional spying on people, he can maintain inter-dimensional portals?  Amazing.10) Apparently Jake killed the creepy house demon with his powers?!?  This was not at all obvious during the ""fight"" scene.  Good thing Walter mentioned it later, or I wouldn't have known.11) Roland briefly teaches Jake to use firearms.  Then immediately says Jake doesn't actually need them, because his powers are his mind.  What was the point?12) Random attacks of random things in forest, because we needed some action scenes.  Roland, gunslinger supremo, doesn't hear Jake leave camp and wake up immediately?13) Dark Tower will ultimately be *really* easy to find, since you can just follow the gigantic blue attack-beams made by the Breakers.  Of course, they'll likely use one of the many high-tech portals just lying around everywhere...14) Vampires hide from us the fact they are vampires?  Would have make henchmen scarier. I guess we'll be surprised later.15) Hospital treats Gunslinger for various unusual ailments.  Neither he nor Jake have forms of ID. No police called, no security guards at hospital.  Gunslinger and Jake just stroll out.16) Firearms shop person easily ambushed by man with firearms.17) Inter-dimensional portal in NY kitchen left standing open during latter half of movie?  No FBI/CIA/NSA called?  Chefs just continue cooking and ignoring gaping portal, until Jake and Roland return?  Maybe more of Jake's mysterious mind-portal-control nonsense.18) Jake is awarded title of gunslinger for staying strapped in chair, resisting mind control, and maybe keeping portal open?  Whatever.19) Does Roland reclaim title of gunslinger for himself?  Why?  His motivations were rescuing Jake, with a side-motivation of revenge on Walter?  Yes, rescuing Jake *happened* to have good results for the Tower.  But does Roland ever actually admit he cares about saving it and the universe?20) Roland's father stands in for Cuthbert and Alain?  Seems another unnecessary script change, but fine.
21) Besides the occasional comic relief, Roland seems pretty comfy in NY.  Why?  Totally different from novels when he sees it through Eddie.22) Walter is supposed to be unpredictable, kind of crazy, chatty, psycho, never-know-what-he'll-do.  In movie he's a pretty serious villain.Well, that's almost 5000 characters.  So...people of Earth?  Can we acquire some film rights and allow independent filmmakers to redo this someday and do it justice?",0
5,"What a waste of a big series of books. Once more a King filming properly goes off. The trailer shows only a lot of gunfights with very thin action and weak dialogues. Hence, the whole film has not become better. To the abovementioned problem still come many lengths on the negative list.",0
7,"To put it quite simply, this is not a dark tower movie. I have read every single book in the series and have been a fan for years. I was so, so disappointed by this movie, and how poorly it resembles the book series. The only way that I could think of to do the Dark Tower any justice via visual media would be to hand it over to HBO or Showtime to create an unrated series that takes several seasons (at least one per book if not more) to tell the story as it should be told, and even then I would expect them to ruin it as pretty much every HBO and Showtime series has a specific ""style"" with specific elements that they add that is not a part of any original work that they adapt. Anyways, tl;dr, if you are a fan of the books, just don't bother.",0
12,"I read the books and after watching the movie and considerable thought, I think this movie is piece of poop that should never have been made.  This should be a series on HBO, Netflix, or Amazon that is true to the source material(well, mostly true to the source material).",0
13,"Based on the bestselling book series by highly acclaimed author Stephen King, The last Gunslinger, Roland(Idris Elba), has been locked in an eternal battle with the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey), determined to prevent him from toppling the Dark Tower, which hold the universe together. With the fate of the worlds at stake, good and evil will collide in the epic battle as only Roland can defend the Tower from the Man in Black.--I begun watching this with mixed expectation. Was a bit disappointed to see yet film based on 'kids'. That alone makes it hard to take the film seriously. It's a fact there is a limit to how well kids can act compared to full fletched young adult or adult actors/actresses.The ideas and concepts are good. Though not exactly original, with respect to demons eyeing to dominate human world. They still make a good general concept for a good story. However the idea that kids' minds (after being strapped to machines) can be used to destroy the tower, is a really silly concept. I generally like the film as I was watching it. The pacing is alright. Actions are well choreographed. The plots lack depth, and have the problem of being kinda predictable.Characters are all underdeveloped for the most part, except for Roland where the film shows some key aspects of his past. The villain (Man in Black) is pretty cool and ruthless, and have some nice abilities, most notably the ability to command any human to do what he commanded at will, with a simple spoken command. It would be nice if the film delve deeper into his background character and his past.If you like The Mortal Instruments (film), give this a watch.Plot: 3.5/5Characters: 3/5Action: 4/5Worth a watch in cinema: Yes, if you like action and okay with simple plots.",1
15,"A very enjoyable movie, all the hate seems a bit harsh. Never read the books though.",1
17,"While i'm not a fan of the book series I have read the first two and this movie goes out of its way to change everything into something that will have mass appeal rather than a niche movie for fans. It was incredibly miscast, the prime culprits being the Gunslinger and the man in black, the plot was generalized and changed so much from the book nothing made sense at all and it spent way too much time on earth when the book mostly takes place in midworld. This movie was an attempt to cash in on a successful franchise while generalizing the plot to maximize profit from mass appeal.",0
18,"He who trusts Sony with his franchise has forgotten the face of his father….A film adaptation of Stephen King’s epic seven book series The Dark Tower has been along time coming. After languishing in development hell for decades with directors, stars and studios coming and going, 2017 has finally seen the story of Roland of Gilead and his existential quest for the mysterious Dark Tower brought to life on the big screen.Except not really….Although I haven’t yet reached the conclusion of the story in its original medium, I know enough to know that this film is for the most part completely divorced from the source material.From the opening text its clear that the filmmakers have decided to simplify and streamline the (admittedly meandering) plot of the books into a more straightforward ‘Macguffin’ plot involving the use of children for evil purposes.From there we get a fairly generic ‘save the world’ story revolving around a young boy from modern day New York (Jake played by Tom Taylor) as he journeys to strange new worlds and meets ‘The Gunslinger’ Roland (Idris Elba) all the while pursued by the sinister agents of The Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey).Making Jake the protagonist of this first attempt to adapt The Dark Tower makes perfect sense. In a complex world of parallel universes, ancient cultures and high fantasy, having a character from ‘our world’ to ask the questions is a tried and tested genre trope (think Neo in The Matrix or any of the Doctor’s companions in Doctor Who).Unfortunately, Jake’s attempts to understand just what the hell is going on are met with vague answers, mountains of exposition and throwaway lines that deserve much more explanation than they are given (did he just say ‘Excalibur’?).For some bizarre reason the filmmakers have decided to try and cram the full story of The Dark Tower, complete with a final confrontation between The Gunslinger and The Man in Black, into one 90 minute film. In a world in which EVERYTHING wants to be a multi-film franchise and The Fast and Furious series has no less than eight entries with a ninth on the way…this choice makes no sense on any level.The film itself doesn’t make a lot of sense either, image if someone tried to edit the entire Harry Potter series into a 90 minute fan film on youtube and then put it out in cinemas — there you have The Dark Tower (2017).One of the most frustrating things about the whole debacle is the casting. Idris Elba is great as Roland, with an unspoken world-weariness coupled with a magnetic screen presence, he is an inspired choice for the part (and another reason I was excited to see the adaptation). Likewise McConaughey brings a detached menace to The Man in Black reminiscent of David Tennant’s Killgrave from Jessica Jones, only this time he has the whole universe at his fingertips. Unfortunately both actors are held back by a thread-bare script with very little in the way of ‘character’ to work with and minimal screen time together.In terms of the plot the stakes couldn’t be higher with the Man in Black seeking to bring about THE END OF THE UNIVERSE by destroying The Dark Tower of the title.This should feel like a big deal, but as the film barrels-on, motivations become less and less clear and the point of the whole thing gets lost in amongst conflicting lore and strange tonal choices. As a comparison, The Lord of Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring did a great job of setting up the potential horror of the world under the rule of Sauron, making it very clear what our heroes were fighting for and setting up their motivations for the next 7 hours of screen time. The Dark Tower instead chooses to make Roland and Jake’s quest to take down the Man in Black far more personal, so much so that by the end, the pair seem fairly apathetic about the whole ‘end of the universe’ thing.More than anything The Dark Tower is a massive wasted opportunity. As a book reader (sort of) it’s hard to know what general audiences with no exposure to the series will make of this cinematic mess but judging from the poor box office it doesn’t look like they thought much. What could have been a epic story spanning over a decade in film or TV has fallen at the first hurdle.While some Stephen King’s fans are understandably angry at the failures of this adaptation I can’t say I feel the same way. I think the negative buzz combined with the short run-time prepared me for the worst. I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed.",0
19,"Cliched, weak, uninteresting bland generic scripted ""action movie"", filled with boring senseless stuff because not only did they shave off 95% of the material it was ""inspired"" from, but also, tried to shove up random stuff without no explanation at all (locations, images, characters, behaviors etc). Complete waste of time. People who say this movie is not bad are being too kind.",0
20,"I expected better, to start right off the bat.    Much better.    Yet another Stephen King saga set to film with some promise, but manages to come up short.    I submit the original ""Rose Red"" and ""It"" for evidence, two movies that are impossibly long, and twice as dull.    So at least ""The Dark Tower"" spares us the monotony, but even with the prospect of Matthew McConaughey as a sorcerer set to destroy the Universe which is protected by The Tower, the film never bothering to explain how, and the fine actor Idris Elba, fails to grip the imagination.    What matters here is the lack of intensity, emotion, and frightening moments you ought to expect given the premise.    McConaughey does not come across as evil as he is supposed to be, nor do his followers.    For a character supposedly the last great cosmic Gunslinger, Elba does not connect, and that's really the fault of the script.    This movie is disjointed, fails to involve the viewer, and worst of all, comes across as yet one more hack sci-fi/superhero cliche.    King's formulas have run their course, and the lack of fresh approaches to what could have been a good movie in better hands is wasted.    For a film about impending apocalypse, we're left thinking it will be a boring one.",0
21,"The Dark Tower sets a new low for how loose and unrecognizable a book adaptation can be and still be presented as such to the audience. I don't know for whom the movie is intended. For the fans of the book series, it will be infuriating as the movie is as far from a good adaptation as possible. For the people unfamiliar with the book, it is just another dull, boring, teen fantasy movie. Truely a shame.",0
22,"God awful.  I went in, a fan of the books, with the lowest expectations, knowing what would be on screen would be different, so I'm not nitpicking about small nuance changes, but rather, immense changes that fundamentally change the story, and certainly not for the better.A major shift in character is Roland.  Forget about casting Elba(who did fine,as expected), be more concerned with the night and day difference in the character.  In the books, a recurring theme is that Roland is constantly faced with incredibly difficult, life and death choices to make.  Roland is who he is because of years of his obsession with the tower costing those around him dearly.  In this film, Roland is barely even concerned about the tower at all.  Not only does not have to make tough choices, he doesn't make any at all.  His character guided through the film on a rail.  Jake makes the discoveries, Jake makes the strategy choices.  Its Jake that leads Roland.Speaking of Jake, well, readers will know that Jake pays the ultimate price, not once but twice in the first book alone.  The second time, a result of another one of Roland's tough choices.  The line, ""there are other worlds than these"" is used in promotion of the film, but not used anywhere in the film, and certainly not where it comes from in the book, where it is so pivotal, and causes major change in Roland's character.  All missing.Another key missing element, is the journey!  Every step of the way in the books is an ordeal unto itself.  Here they literally jump from place to place, not really having to earn any of it the way they are forced to in the books.It was nice to see little touches, like the rose graffiti on the wall at the end of the movie, or that Walter's base(?!) is at 19-19.  That they say ""thankee sai"" in the village.  But all is overshadowed by other major elements reduced to line or two, such as the whole concept of ""the world has moved on"" reduced to Roland not knowing what a theme park is.  All of Ka, reduced to Walter's one line ""once more around the wheel my friend.""Its not just that its different.  Its that it rips the soul from the story and the characters.  It does not resemble the story at all.  If you loved the books, you'll likely be disappointed or upset.  If you never read the books, you'll likely leave wondering what any of that was about, since they do very little explaining for the uninitiated.",0
23,"This film was only like the novels because it became a tired mess by the end, and it was similarly, with minimal effort by its writers, abruptly put out of it's misery.",0
24,"If you are a fan of the series, please, don't do it to yourself. This is a ham-fisted travesty of an adaptation. This story, this universe, these characters, deserve so much more. Instead we're subjected to a cheap, shameless cash in on the brand recognition of King and the Tower, which lives up to not one bit of potential. What a waste. Genuinely upsetting for a fan, utterly boring for everyone else.",0
25,"After watching 1 hour and a half of terribly handled action scenes, I can definitely say that Dark Tower is one of the worst films this year and probably the worst Stephen King adaptation. The very few parts that surprised me about this film is Matthew McConaughey's Man In Black, a surprisingly memorable villain that will give kids nightmares!Idris Elba's Gunslinger is weak, not memorable and just flat out disappointing, the story spans around 5 books or so, the plot is overstuffed and crammed into a complete disaster of a film, a few surprising scenes with good visuals can't save this terrible, boring attempt at recreating a fun book.",0
26,"This movie absolutely sucked. They've ruined the Dark Tower and Stephen King is laughing his way to the bank with a check for $10 ""haha, suckers! This'll last me a week!!You have forgotten the face of my ass!""The author is as much to blame for this as the production, fawning over this movie like it does any of the books justice. It does not. Don't care about the gunslingers skin tone, but the tone of the characters and world are completely replaced with nonsensical fluff.I don't know how anyone (King included) can agree that removing Eddie Dean and Odetta Holmes would be beneficial to the story. They are absolutely essential.Guhhh, so sad how this turned out. Until next time folks, hopefully on a better movie, game, or TV show.",0
29,"There are a few issues here from the start. 1. This is a VERY LONG book series, that incorporates a bunch of King's characters from other books in certain ways, its basically a homage to himself (which makes sense for King). 2. The books suck, they are all setup with no payoff (again pretty typical for King with of course a few exceptions).  That being said the setup in the first book or two is actually pretty good, but its just set up, and then it turns into a disjointed disaster with King playing himself. 3. This series is wayyyyy too deep to do in a movie let alone 3.  The depth of the characters backstories and how they all change (which is really the only redeeming part of the series - except roland his ending sucks). Thats impossible to do in one movie.  The way to salvage this series was to do a movie basically only about book 1 and END IT THERE.  The problem here is they are using a movie to try and set up a TV show, which after this may not happen anymore who knows. 4. Stephen King is the most overatted author ever.  He does bring up interesting ideas and develops characters well, the problem is after that he doesnt explore the interesting idea and the development is meaningless because the rest of the story sucks and goes off into convoluted territory with no real ending. Or over 1000 pages of repetitive ""love story"" nonsense that was 11/22/63.  Another book that had a pretty good beginning and then completely falls apart and you wonder why the hell you went to the end. IMO one of if not the most over rated book ever.",0
30,"Yeah, so I don't know what the writer(s) director(s) were thinking with the Dark Tower series. Instead of just starting from the beginning like they should have, they begin the film focused mostly on Jake. More importantly, the opening sequences makes it appear as if the film (and the Dark Tower) is focused around Jake, which is absurd. While Jake was a major character, his role was never as important as Roland's.It amazes me, really. Fans for a franchise will work hard to propell to popularity and then, hey, let's make a film about this beloved franchise and then just mess it all up. Has Hollywood learned nothing about messing with the source material?King should be ASHAMED he allowed this sad excuse of a movie to have been released. What a waste of time, effort and money. A stain on an otherwise amazing series by Stephen King.  Fans of the books WILL not like the movie. Take the money you were going to use to see this film and use it to wipe your butt next time you have a bowl movement, it's about the same thing.",0
38,This movie was confusing and convoluted for those who had not read the books and a vast disappointment for those who had.  Who in their right mind would squish an eight novel epic into a 95 minute long movie?  Trite is the word...,0
41,"It would've been more fulfilling to have another 10 years without a movie adaptation of The Dark Tower than having this one is. It is pretty apparent that of all the people who wrote the script and were in charge of casting, not a single one has picked up one of the books.It has nothing to do with The Dark Tower, even if they claim it's set in the same universe. Change the character names and it might actually be good.Get the books or audiobooks instead.",0
42,"This film is a travesty. Not only does it completely destroy the characters and story from the books, but to the casual movie-goer it is an incoherent and ill-conceived piece of trash. It's a pathetic attempt.",0
43,I knew nothing about The Dark Tower going into the film.  I thought it was a great movie.  As entertaining as any of the marvel films I've watched over the past 10 summers.  It introduced a exciting universe that I want more of.  Why the bad reviews?  Because Marvel fanboy is less critical than Stephen King fanboy.,1
44,"Too many seriously negative reviews. Let me try to explain, I've read all the books, all 8. This movie is in no way even an adaptation of those books. It is pure Hollywood and is why so many loyal King readers feel their years of waiting for the perfect Dark Tower movie have been cheated and crushed. Especially with the success of Harry Potter and Game of Thrones from book to screen. That being said, this movie is not poorly done. For the budget, they do a great job at bringing a wealth of action and scenery as well as a cast that does a very good job at selling what they've been given. I went with 2 people who have never read the books and both said they enjoyed the film and were now intrigued in the books especially if it is better than what they just watched, which they most certainly are. If you have never read the books, give it a try and don't bother with the negative reviews from fanboys. If you have read the books, understand the perfect Dark Tower movie may never get made and thats OK. Even an average one can bring even more into our universe and have people reading such a fascinating story, which in turn may let to more creative minds than these to develop an even better version.",1
45,"An abomination.This crap just uses a famous series name to get your cash.It has almost nothing to do with the 8 novel series.If the title of the movie was Boring,Generic Tripe-The Movie,nobody would even realise it was 'related' to Stephen Kings work.Stay away.",0
46,"The Dark Tower is nowhere near as bad as the critics and fans are making it out to be. Despite the trailers making this look like a straight up action film with bad dialogue, it is in fact a fantasy story containing acting and directing so good that you will forget the script's sometimes lackluster lines. Good actors can make a bad line disappear, and these actors do just that. It's very loosely based on the books, and is considered a continuation rather than an adaptation.The movie centers around a psychic boy named Jake, a cowboy-knight named Roland, an evil Man In Black named Walter, and a Dark Tower that holds the universe together by keeping monsters out. The Man In Black wishes to destroy the Tower so he can rule a chaotic universe. He needs Jake to destroy the tower. Jake needs to find Roland to save him from the Man In Black. Roland seeks the Man In Black for revenge. Each character pursues another, and around and around they go.The movie does a better job of laying the groundwork than the first book in the series, in many regards. Of course, the first book is notoriously confusing. Just like the first book, 3 of the main characters have been left out. This non-departure from the source material helps to facilitate a digestable entrypoint for newcomers.Idris Elba is wonderful as Roland. Some people argue he does not fit the description of Roland in the book, and they would be right. Roland is described as an ugly Clint Eastwood/Steven King look alike, who appears emaciated and ancient beyond belief. Mr. Elba is none of these things. However, he understands how to convey all the necessary aspects of the character. He is full of grit and grump, beleaguered, yet heroic. His performance has convinced many a skeptic to sing his praises, with good cause.Tom Taylor plays an excellent Jake. He fully embodies the worry of a troubled boy who may be going insane, but also the innocence and excitement of someone finding a portal to another world. Child actors often get a well-deserved bad rap, but Tom Taylor delivers every line perfectly.Matthew Mcconaughey was really and truly awful as The Man In Black despite having come so far as an actor and playing such wonderful roles in the last few years. As an all powerful wizard, he was neither intimidating nor believable, opting for an over-the-top take on the character that just doesn't work. It's understandable why he went that route. The rest of the movie allows for, and even encourages, over-the-top at times. However, that was the greatest weakness of the film, and Mcconaughey's performance is the embodiment of that weakness.The score varied from average to well-above average, rarely grabbing your attention, but always fueling the emotions on screen. The cinematography, particularly of the first two thirds, is some of the best in years. Praise should also be cast on the editing. Contrary to the cut-per-milisecond style that has become ever so popular in modern movies--and especially action scenes--The Dark Tower does not fear lingering on a beautiful scene and letting you soak in it, or staying with a character as we see emotions fully processed through their face and body. It's as if the editor knew that they didn't need to cut haphazardly to instill a false sense of excitement, or to cut away from a less than genuine performance. They trusted the story, visuals, and acting to hold our attention, and that faith was well placed. At least, it was well placed for the first two thirds, before falling into so-so territory by the last third.The movie should also be praised for doing with $60 million what many others fail to do with $120 milliom. I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed. The ambition of this project far surpasses others, despite the budgetary constraints.The humour peppered here and there was phenominal as well. Marvel has the jarring idea lately that they should throw humour into every nook and cranny possible, hoping the 15 good jokes make up for the 15 that fell flat. No such philosophy is necessary here. For the first time in years, I felt like every joke worked. None of it felt forced.Of course, the movie had its problems. The tone should have been dark. It was too over-the-top for its own good. It added the strange element of futuristic technology that was completely absent in the books, and the technology was overdone in the style of bad science fiction. The costuming department seemed to think they were making a new Matrix movie, instead of the dusty cowboy/fantasty it should have been.It wasn't a great movie, but considering the source material is known for being unfilmable, it's a shock they made a coherent movie at all. I have newfound confidence that they can learn from the mistakes of this film and make a truly great second installment. Hopefully they do, so we may meet the other three main characters (yes, Oy the talking dog counts!), hear some ZZ Top backbeat, and maybe even meet Blaine the Train.",1
47,"Having never read the books I cannot compare this film as harshly as the critics have. To me it was a decent action flick, in which Idris Elba does a good job. It felt more like the prologue for a series of indepth movies, but I still respect the effort.",1
50,"Absolute garbage. Let me set the stage: My wife is a huge fan of the books while I had read the first three and fell out of favor with the series. Going in, we had two completely different schools of thought on what to expect. We BOTH walked out disappointed and annoyed. My wife was annoyed that, even though she understood it was after book 7, they fundamentally changed the structure and the world so much that it, in her words, ""felt like a cheap young adult movie about Jake and not enough about the Roland or Randall Flagg"". For me, I walked out feeling more confused than when I went in because the movie runs at a break neck pace, barely takes time to explain anything, and blows from action scene to action scene. Jake, good. Flashbacks! Roland, good! Man in Black, bad! Cross dimensional conflict, oh no!Idris Elba is literally the only good thing about the movie, a fact on which both of us agreed. It's a shame his talent is wasted on such bad writing, a poorly designed plot, lousy cinematography, and poor CGI. McConaughey was AWFUL, almost a caricature of an actor playing a role. So, so bad. It became quite apparent that this movie was stuck in development hell - to use software terminology - for all 10 years of its supposed creation, especially with a running time as short as made-for-TV movies. If this is the best they can do, no one will mourn when the franchise is left to die. It's just a shame that Idris Elba is still chasing after his own summer blockbuster franchise. Here's hoping he at least gets a fair shake to play Bond after Daniel Craig.After walking out of the theater following this mess I felt less annoyed about spending money to see Valarian the weekend before.",0
53,"Come on. This movie wasn't that bad to have a 4.0 score. Minimum I would give it is a 6/10. Had it's issues, the most glaring of which was that it failed to set up characer backgrounds properly such that if a character died, we feel the impact. I felt nothing when Jake's mom died or even when Walter died. If the emotional impact was felt, the movie could have been an 8 or 9.",1
54,"I wasn't expecting much based on the poor reception but really enjoyed it. It seemed a tad rushed in places but as a fantasy adventure movie it hit the right notes and had strong performances. It might not compare at all to the books and might not be strong enough to kick off a franchise but if you just want a fun 90 minutes, give it a go.",1
55,This movie should have been great. Had plenty of meat on the bones to pick from but no. I couldn't find any reason to care about any of the characters. The antagonist was so boring I thought it was a beer commercial. All the charactors were boring and were like stick figures. What was their origin? Why do they do what they do? Who wrote the screen play as it sucked? Who directed as this sucked. This movie went no where and came from no where and I cant think of any reason to watch it. It was really bad. Only think missing was Nicholas Cage! What a waste of production money and time. I would be so mad if I were Stephen King! He deserves better. Avoid at all costs.,0
59,"this is quite an interesting project, but this film only at one time and the film is not associated with Roman only indirectly.    P.S i'ts my mind",1
60,"After all the hype, after Stephen King insisting on his input, etc. to make sure this was done right, it was totally done wrong and very rushed.  Very disappointing.",0
61,The story is all over the place and would only make sense to someone really familiar with the books. It's way too short and edits are all over the place. The performances were good but even the cast can't save this piece of junk. They should have simply adapted the first book and it would have been so much better.,0
62,"+Excellent visual style+Keeps a good pace +Memorable action sequences+Impressive cast deliver great performances-According to fans deviates/simplifies the plot from the book seriesWent in with low expectations given the negative review from critics and book fans, however having not read the books I can say I was more entertained than I expected going in to this. As a fan of sci-fi/Stephen King adaptations/action films I can say this is an entertaining blend of all three! Highly recommend this.",1
63,"It's a very fun to watch fantasy movie and i loved the acting of Elba and McConaughey. I watched it without knowing it was a movie based on a book, so my score is based on the movie itself and not for being a good or bad adaptation. However, the movie felt a bit like it was too much story and too little time to tell it. I would've like the movie to be longer, or made with multiple parts. After the movie i looked up the books and there is much more they could do with that, a shame they didn't. But overall the movie was fun to watch.",1
64,"The Dark Tower was a good movie. I feel like I’m not allowed to say that unless I explain myself, so here goes:I think this movie should have been called “The Gunslinger” because it was about a gunslinger rescuing a boy from a bad guy. And it does a good job of telling that story.Calling the movie “The Dark Tower” sets up the expectation that the movie will be about the Dark Tower, but its not. We barely see the Dark Tower, and no action whatever takes place there.I think SONY did a very awful job of properly promoting this project, and properly setting the audience’s expectations. It should have been made crystal clear that this was not an attempt to tell the stories from the novels, but rather, an attempt to tell a simple story that will introduce key characters, themes, and mysteries that exist in the Dark Tower universe.It should have been made clear that this was an introduction to this universe, and not the beginning, middle and end of it.It should have been made clear that the characters, themes, and mysteries that were introduced in this movie were not going to be addressed in depth in this film, but instead, will be fleshed out through upcoming TV series and movie sequels.If a person knows all that going in, there is a much better chance that they could just relax and enjoy the show.  Unfortunately, and through no fault of their own, the viewers just had no idea what to expect going in, and were turned off by a simple quick storyline, huge themes and mysteries being mentioned and then never addressed again, and feeling like they were JUST getting to know the characters just as the thing ended.I’m super bummed about the bad reviews and the low box office, because now I fear this project will be abandoned… I certainly hope not.  But Sony really screwed up.",1
65,"I really liked this film. I don't have the background (baggage?) of having read the Dark Tower novels -  I was just looking for an enjoyable way to spend two hours on a Saturday afternoon. I found the movie fast-paced, conceptually interesting, with very good acting and interesting locales (great on-location scenes in NYC). Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are both excellent, and the kid who plays the lead (Tom Taylor) is also very good. I can understand why those who have read the novels might have certain expectations that weren't met (after all, there were several novels and this is a two-hour film), but that doesn't explain the perplexing negative reaction of the critics, who should judging this film on its own merits.",1
66,"Oh boy... Now I'm feeling miserable giving Blade Runner 2049 6/10 the other day. Watching The Dark Tower really gives me perspective. It's among most forgettable, almost unwatchable movies like The Great Wall. It looks like an episode of a third-rate TV show for kids. The one that you can watch at 6.30AM if you have insomnia.  And I am not even King fan. Everyone rambles about how original book series is a masterpiece, but I'm pretty sure it is just as incoherent, as you can get with King. The only virtue of the movie is that story makes sense. It's naive and stupid story, worse than almost anything you can watch or read, but it is story nonetheless.",0
67,"Cinema as mythmaking 101, pay attention.  What we have here is a christian and/or metaphysical myth of a LIGHT Tower, A Tower of LIGHT, which keeps the world of waking human beings--and similar worlds--coherent and protected from an outer universe it perceives as monstrous and demonic.  Thats one myth-archetype.Next myth is a TV Western gunslinger written only two-dimensionally but brought to life by Idris Elba.  That's two myths-archetypes.Next is the Satan-Devil figure, given the 2D writing, done as well as I think Marvel could do him in Matthew's fine performance.  That's three myths-archetypes.  Then we have the boy-coming-of-age myth, Heroes Journey myth and common sub-myths and tropes.  Tried and true mythmaking is what critics get awfully tired of.  However, the audience I saw it with cheered and clearly several were seeing it at least a second time.  Mythmaking done well is always a crowd pleaser.I liked it.  Why?  It's done with conviction.  Not often do we see a POSITIVE LIGHT Tower as a mythic element in a script.  Compare with LOTRings where all the towers and mountains are negative downers.  The LOTR Elf kingdom is more hospitable but plays only a minor role.  Could this be extended into a series on TV, on film?  Hard to say.  From skimming the Wikipedia article on the book series, I think making it a young adult film makes more sense than a literal translation of book plot to filmed script.  However the film makes little to no attempt to suggest where a sequel to the movie might go.  It may be myself and only a few other esoteric-Christian mystics who see in this Dark Tower a LIGHT Tower.",1
68,"I read the book years ago when it first came out, so I didn't remember much. That being said, this movie wasn't bad. It wasn't fantastic but it was decent. Good acting. Good sci-fi. Good action. Good special effects. Nothing life changing but fun to watch if you're looking for good sci-fi fantasy adventure.",1
69,"If you want a scene-by-scene interpretation of the book: forget it. But if (like me) you appreciate the creative translation that is necessary to make a movie work, than you'll be very pleased. Way more engaging, tightly plotted and solidly acted than anything in the book (which was even to King's admission a mess) the movie also boasts a very impressive characterization by Elba and McConaughey while boasting a solid single story (if you don't like open endings) while still allowing for the sequels to be made. Everything about this movie was impressive. Must see.",1
70,"The Dark Tower series is my favorite. I've been really nervous about this movie for a long time. My hopes were dashed when the first reviews started pouring in. I knew it was a failure, but I read the positive reviews and decided I still wanted to give the makers my money. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I knew this movie would never live up to the books, but the movie actually incorporates more of the material then I would've though possible for a 95 minute movie. The story was good, not perfect, but good considering how much material they had to condense to make one movie explain what is going on. The story was a different perspective on the material that and works well as an introduction to The Dark Tower universe.  I thought Mcconaughey was effective as the man in black, I still have reservations about Elba playing Roland, but it wasn't bad. All together the movie didn't let me down, and re-enforced the idea that I want to see more of this universe on the screen. Whether it be TV or the movie screen, they'd get my money again.",1
71,"Following in the line of thought that the book is only inspirational for the film, and that this is a new interaction in Roland's search for the Dark Tower, I must say... IT'S AWESOME!!! The only reason I did not give 5 stars for this movie is that I felt it was too short, not better explaining some of the things that are happening in the plot. But probably some of the novel's concepts were left out or only hinted in order to simplify the movie's premise. No harm with that. Given the low ratings, it'll probably won't have a sequel, which is a shame.",1
73,"I was originally excited to see this movie when the 1st trailer came out... I hadn't read the books but researched the concepts for the film, getting a general idea of the overarching story. When all the buzz seemed to indicate the movie was a disappointment, I elected to see the film anyway and kept an open mind. If nothing else I'd probably like the leading actors' performance and would see some cool cinematography. The rest of the folks in the theater that saw The Dark Tower with me I think all felt the same way: 'this isn't getting a great buzz, but let's see what it has to offer'.The Dark Tower gives us a glimpse into a gritty reality, one that ties into visually fantastic worlds and concepts, and portrays characters that were interesting and intriguing; characters you end up liking and if anything, you want to see more of what they have to offer. The movie makes me WANT to read the books; I’m not a filmmaker/film critic/in the film industry, but I would venture a guess that the intended outcome of this film was to get folks interested in the series and for me they succeeded. The film has a ""young"" director; Nikolaj Arcel has not made that many movies from what I can tell, and this I think shows: if you are looking for flaws in this film you WILL find them… I suppose I’m just willing to forgive the occasional flaw for the sake of having a good time.We live in a day and age where people want to find things to be upset about, sadly enough. I liked The Dark Tower; it was fun, visually impressive, and only once or twice did its film-making flaws really feel apparent enough to distract.I walked away from this film enjoying the overall movie-going experience. It's sad that the film's positive qualities are getting overlooked so much... there's a good time to be had with this film if you're willing to let yourself have it.",1
74,A good dystonian romp through a world on the brink.  What the movie lacked in a complete backstory it made up for with some good brooding by Idris Elba (all I needed was someone to yell that he was going to cancel this apocalypse and my movie would had been complete!)  As a stand alone movie this  made my cut; for all those of you who only want the movie to be like the books...this ain't that type of movie bro.,1
75,"Having never read the books, I found the movie quite enjoyable.  The action is solid, the story doesn't drag on, it sticks to one type of story without switching modes constantly and the acting is solid.  The script isn't amazing.  The audio effects are astounding.  I didn't really expect to see extreme reviews of this movie one way or the other.  I recommend it if you're in the mood for straightforward action/fantasy/horror.",1
76,"Stephen King is probably the most filmed writer. ""The Dark Tower"" — his most famous work. And not without reason. The cycle consists of an eight not small books. They varied in quality, but still dragged them into his world. Rumors about the film adaptation began to circulate in 2007, and ten years later we got a film based on the series of novels. This film everyone was waiting for, because in books there is everything you can love a captivating story: a charismatic protagonist, interesting world, inhabited by different dangers, evil villains, and an interesting mythology of the world. But many fans and sympathizers was suspicious of the film before the premiere. Black Roland, that all sin! Yes, and the film will last only 1.5 hours. Also this film is not the film adaptations of the books of the cycle, and their continuation! This is a controversial step. For fans of the great cash not to do a ""stray"" audience can not understand. But the writers did it! Maybe the fans will complain, they always will be. But for me, as someone who has never read a single book from the series, though, and knows a lot about them, the film exceeded my expectations, which, by the way, was no. Roland — the protagonist of a cycle of novels. Here he plays a talented Idris Elba. Himself Stephen King praised his acting! And even cut some dialogues of Roland, as the Elba, perfectly passed all his facial expressions. I think the Gunslinger could play and Matthew McConaughey, and Idris Elba Man in Black. But we have what we have. Idris Elba has really fine job with the role. Roland is still the same charismatic, and how awesome he is with revolvers! He has his own drama, and not even knowing her backstory from the books, you're still experiencing it with the hero.Matthew McConaughey plays the Man in Black — main villain of the film, which is pumped from the books. Playing McConaughey nice to watch. When he's on screen, it just steals the stage with her charisma. About him the villain we know almost nothing, and he wants to destroy a Dark tower, to rule the world, but thanks to the game McConaughey, he does not seem so flat villain. Roland, though the hero of the books, but not this film. He is one of the main characters. The engine of this movie is the boy Jake, who has the gift of ""the shining"". He foresees things and sees ""the middle world"" is one of the variations of Land where the lives of Roland. The guy behaves heroically, though, and is a small burden to Roland. The movie is 1.5 hours, and we began to forget what it is. Usually blockbusters are now 2 hours or more, and we are already used to this pace. But this timing does not allow the film to sagging in the dynamics. The narrative here is very dynamic and, at times, throws us abruptly from scene to scene. At first it's annoying and it feels like some kind of serial format. But you get used to it. Such dynamics is great for such a simple plot. We have a guy who is being chased by the villain, and a good shot trying to save him and kill the man in black. Everything is simple and without surprises. The series of books was large and there was always a continuation. This film though has the freedom to continue, a complete work. Of course, first and foremost it is perfect for fans of books that finally got really the end. The world of books is varied, but the film didn't show us many of its inhabitants, and in general, feel the lack of budget.The movie ""The Dark Tower "" is not to be confused with the adaptation of another author. Though this film is not an adaptation of the books of the cycle, Stephen King felt here. In the books the dynamics a little, the film is completely dynamic. This is action movie in which the books of Stephen King was almost nothing left. Fans will not be happy, but for people who have not read the book the movie will make a good impression. Yes, Idris Elba is not Clint Eastwood, who Stephen King was inspired by when creating the image by hand but Idris played it well! Before watching the movie don’t have to read the book, which is good. But if you read the whole cycle, you will understand much more. Although, the audience and explain a lot. It is a dynamic, emotional film that will not let you get bored.",1
77,"We read:Dark towerITDr. SonRadianceAnd then the film is like. The guys who put bad marks are guys who apparently have no idea what they're talking about. If something does not coincide with the book - they are dissatisfied. I'll remind the little girl, who repeats almost every page: there are other worlds besides this. Hence, interpreting is still possible a little different.For an unknowing viewer, the film will indeed be terrible.To the knower is incomparable. The only nuance: the merged final battle. Just a break in the film. For this huge minus.",1
78,"Did NOT read the books, so not pre-influenced. The film started off with an interesting concept of the world being influenced by dire events in another dimension/world, which ever. But like all movies that feature super powers/abilities and unbridled magic, it's going to disappoint in the plausibility dept. Walter's demise was fairly clever though. On my Buy/Netflix/Skip scale, it's Netflix.",1
80,"Surprised the metascore is so low for this movie.  Rented it from Redbox with 0 expectations based on critic reviews.  This is not a 34/100 movie.  Not great by any means, but competently written, acted, and directed.",1
81,"Wow,never listen to the critics again. I thought this was a tremendous film. Sometimes I find movies made from books are immediately panned because they don't measure up, which is a warning sign if you don't care because you haven't read the novel or short stories. Anyways: solid performances, great visuals, original direction and a plot that keeps you engaged.",1
82,"I will tell at once - I didn't read the books. Also I consider the Universe only on the basis of the movie. Yes it is not the best movie in 2017. Yes a plot at him very simple and the first half of the movie is very tightened. Characters are almost not revealed! It is the main failure of the movie. But 2 most favourite have acted in this movie me the actor therefore I can't soberly estimate the movie, but death of Man in Black looks too silly.",1
83,"Just a rancid adaptation of the source material. It's as if the creators set out with the explicit goal of making this as different from the original tales as they possibly could.  The characters, the story, etc... and it's gotten the score it deserved on all the review sites.  Mis-cast, bad original story.  Ultimately it's a great IP that has been sacrificed on the alter of political correctness.",0
84,Best adaption from a book that I have seen in a long time. Matthew McConaughey was such a huge scene stealer. His southern accent was funny. As were his one liners. Idris Elba was good too. Hope they make more sequels.,1
85,"It was not bad as I thought, but I still don't this film. I'm not even sure if the director has read the books. The Dark Tower was one of my favorite series and I was hoping to see the next film if the film went well, but whatever.",0
86,Empty movie and just waste of time. Good idea ruined during the realisation. Elba was a bad choise for main character here.,0
88,"It clearly is a movie BASED ON the Dark Tower books (it says so at the ending titles). I knew it and didn't expect anything else from it. As a first sneak peek of Stephen King's multiverse, it was ok. I enjoyed the visualization of some parts of the books, but I missed the story. The actors were a bit flat and soulless and the shooting was a bit too much. Oversimplified and mediocre.",0
90,"Having read the books and The Dark Tower being perhaps my favorite story of all time, I admit I was disappointed with the direction they took in the film. That being said, as far as films go, it was a pretty fun ride with some interesting moments and I enjoyed the actors portraying both Roland and Jake. Worth the watch but don't get your hopes up.",1
91,"As someone who hasn't read the King books - and someone who gave up on Marvel movies several years ago - I have absolutely no idea why this film is so maligned in an era where the stock-standard superhero movie reigns so supreme. Nothing here is terribly ""new"", but it's a successful mish-mash of various genres (mostly fantasy and Western) that does what a good blockbuster should: entertain. Furthermore, as someone who hasn't read the King books, I can't say I felt that anything was ""missing""...but I guess it's inevitable that condensing eight beloved books into a single movie is gonna tick SOME people off.//As for claims that it's ""incomprehensible"" to newcomers: I'm pretty sure I understood every second of it, no problemo. It's fairly basic stuff, to be sure, but has enough flair to keep one easily engaged for a smidgen over ninety minutes. Methinks you people have gotten just a wee bit spoiled if you find this inadequate; especially given how indiscriminately you all rush off to catch the latest Marvel movie in the cinemas (several times a year, no less). Oh: and McConaughey's delectable depiction of the villainous Man in Black is simply to die for, and well worth the price of admission alone.",1
92,"I thought it was interesting to watch and something new, but maybe that is just me and given that I have not read comics, maybe I dont know about any flaws etc, but for a regular movie goer it felt decent movie. I did not like how easy it was dealt with some stuff and the kid just forgets how his mom was killed and is happy again at the end even though he lost his whole family etc and is just happy that he will be the gunslinger. Also it was quite predictable mostly, but still a fun watch. For those who have read the books or comics (not sure which), they probably dont like it because it is not true to the source or something I guess, but for casual viewer it was decent.",1
98,"The overall feel of this movie was like that of a teenage novel being transformed into a movie. Consequently viewers cannot grasp the full depth of the universe and the complexity of the characters. I believe that this film was negatively received because casual movie-goers found it too hard to get into, whereas fans of the book series were disappointed that the film was 'Hollywoodized'. This was ultimately a good movie when viewed on its own. The acting was incredible, and the plot was, at minimum, intriguing.",1
99,Maybe I would have thought it was good if I hadn't read the entire 7 volume series first.  There is just no way you can possibly do the story justice in one movie. I would liked to have seen a series of 5 to 7 movies. That might have done the story some justice.,0
