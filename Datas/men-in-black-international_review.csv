0,"This is so bad. Absolutely idiotic plot, stupid scenes, unfunny jokes, characters often just laugh just like that, actions of heroes are unmotivated, all subject turns or are read at the very beginning of the movie, or simply stupid and illogical.",0
1,"I love both Hemsworth and Thompson but this film is just *so* bland. It lazily slugs along from set piece to set piece, and then tries to present us with a twist that was obvious from the trailer. Waste of talent and your time, someone please use a neuralyzer on me...",0
2,"The story revolves around a week plot. Very predictive and old-age screenplay. Hemsworth has been involved only for Glamour and stardom, there was absolutely no strong character or pre-story behind Agent H. The story revolve around Tessa Thompson, Protagonist. All the supporting characters, Including Liam Neeson couldn't save the film. I clearly missed humor of previous MIB movies, Could hardly laugh despite hearing Kumail Nanjiani's voice. Overall, If they are planning to do it again, I will strongly recommend them device a strong plot.",0
3,"This movie is the definition of okay.And for a MIB movie where the universe is literally the limit in terms what you can do plot wise, is utterly unacceptable.It plods methodically from set piece to set piece, with no real purpose, and no real concern for justifying why the characters do and say anything. To then limply reach a thoroughly predictable and underwhelming conclusion that could have been written by a 7 year old.To find some positives, the visuals are perfectly acceptable (most of the time), the soundtrack is inoffensive, and the cast do what they can with the miserable screen play they were given.This project should have been canned, or at least shelved until they could get a competent writer on board to give them something worth making a film for. Instead of reinvigorating this franchise, I believe they have killed it. Which is a real shame.3/10, don’t waste time or money on this. Catch it on Netflix in 2 months time if you really want to.",0
5,"a perfect example of what happens to a movie if you don't follow the ""show, don't tell"" principle and combine it with a mary sue and a god complex. Men in Black was good because Will Smith had severe flaws was bade at certain things and it was funny because he had to learn a lot of things fast and on the fly. In this Movie the producers make the same boring old mistake.. the main protagonist is flawless from the get go. no character progression, no needs, just a ""want this"" and some over worldly mad skills derived out of (shown) nowhere and being at the right place at the right time because the flawlessness of the main protagonist was supposed to be there.. no struggle, no flight, no development no personal involvement.. It's like Hollywood forgot how to make good and interessting movies.. i hope this era of Highjacking films for clumsy remakes goes away very soon..",0
6,"A complete waste of time. I haven't been so bored watching a movie in awhile.The alien designs was unimaginative, the effects are terrible, the comedy falls flat, the characters suck, and Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson lacked any chemistry this time around.There was nothing here that I liked.",0
7,"The reason the first two MIB movies worked out so well was you had one steel backbone character who knew the ropes (Tommy Lee Jones) and one smartass recruit (Will Smith). In this movie both Helmsworth and the girl were both wierdo goofs. Helmsworth was too busy flitting around with his pretty boy B.S. and the girl was just wierd. That means there was no strong character foil for both to play off each other. Next, the storyline was convoluted and difficult to follow. Because of the name 'international' in the title they now had to figure out how to get different countries in the film and because of that, the writers had a hard time. I give this one star and a half. The worst MIB movie to date.",0
8,"The main character perfectly encapsulates everything wrong with this movie. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about following an obnoxiously plucky, hyper-competent, characterless, unfunny protagonist in your sci-fi comedy film. This character isn't given any stakes or strong motivations. This character doesn't struggle at any point. This character doesn't learn anything throughout the story. She's boring to the point of infuriating. It certainly doesn't help that no one else in this movie is funny either. Bad comedies are probably the most unfortunate type of bad movie. Most bad movies have the potential of being funny by virtue of how bad they are. Bad comedies are already inherently unfunny. They're effectively worthless. That's what this movie is: worthless.",0
9,"Worst mib ive watched with some horrific acting. Really predictable and boring through the whole movie. Probably the worst acting performances from liam neeson, chris hemsworth and then that chick who plays the valkary in thor, she was horrible.",0
10,does anybody remember the story? because it's forgettable. worst of the franchises i wish it never had been made,0
11,"MIB International is just a painfully boring movie. It isn't funny, the action scenes seem very out of place and it absolutely fails to capture your interest. And let's be honest, Replacing the chemistry that Jones and Smith had is a tall order and try as they might, Hemsworth and Thompson don't even come close to matching that.",0
12,This is the perfect movie to show you how a screwup a sure thing. MiB would draw based on the name and this movie ruined even that. I would not watch this again if I was PAID to for anything less than $500. Even then I would wear headphones and take a nap during it.,0
13,"This is surely the worst Men in Black. Special effects worthy of first release in 1997. The Eiffel Tower is pitiful. The bad guys are very stylized, but too simple. All pushed by a minimalist scenario does not do anything good. Men In Black 3 that I did not appreciate so much; after reviewing it, it can be said that Will Smith does the job that Chris Hemsworth #Thor will not be able to do because he does not have the class. He remains in the role of Thor.Voici surement le pire Men in Black. Des effets spéciaux dignes du premier sorti en 1997. La tour Eiffel est pitoyable. Les méchants sont très stylisés, mais trop simples. Le tout poussé par un scénario minimaliste ne donne rien de bon. Men In Black 3 que je n'avais pas tant apprécié; après l'avoir revue ont peux dire que Will Smith fait le travail que Chris Hemsworth #Thor ne pourra pas faire, car il n'a pas la classe. Il reste dans le rôle de Thor.",0
14,"This movie was written by two people and it was still a predictable mess... I also wasn't a huge fan of how this was directed/edited/whatever, it felt a little choppy and like scenes got cut off too early sometimes. However, I loved Tessa Thompson, Chris Hemsworth, Rebecca Ferguson and Kumail Nanjiani.",0
15,Hombres de negro: internacional es pésima estos remake dejan en evidencia la poca creatividad de Hollywood,0
16,"What a terrible piece of crap. Men in Black was fun in the 90s and with its original cast. This is by far too little and too, too late.",0
18,"Hemsworth is still carrying that goofy confidence in his body language and Thompson, her new state of bloated coolness, the suit suits, the job doesn't.Men In Black: InternationalF. Gary Gray, I thought, usually is the guy to carry on franchises with equal respect as they start on with. If not increase the hype but will surely continue the momentum of the chase that drives the fans to cinema. Of course, these are all hypothetical thoughts you wander before going on in this cash grab chapter of a popular franchise that lately has been struggling aplenty in order to be politically correct, compromising both quality and the agenda that births that whole drama; ironic, right! Now, before I go through train of various disappointing elements, let me point out the primary and the surprising one.The visual effects and physical sequences- the one thing these big banner film thrives for- are practically straight out wrong, as in they have somehow forgot to account in the distance and time factor in doing so; from showcasing a vehicle zooming, to a creature in a jetpack boosting off, it is odd and uncomfortable to swallow all. And on the other hand, the best asset is the creativity on how varied number of creatures are presented, these tiny aspects keep giving us hope in this overlong two hours of journey- basically a slow death.The storytelling mostly follows the Copy-Paste system from other passable buddy cop films which to be frank isn't done properly, ergo, the result is worse than that. The antics, nothing but loud bangs, the jokes, desperate attempts for cheap shot and emotions, fairly shallow. The only character that you are going to look forward to, is Kumail Nanjiani's voicing as Pawny whose affirmatively positive comments are flat out hilarious. Men In Black: International, the name gives it all away, from the locations to the transparency of the characters, I mean still holding on to their obvious hidden card, is not actually arrogant but simply ignorant.",0
19,This is what happens when you use a brand name to fake a movie. This was suck trash,0
20,This was not men in black. This was sacrilege. Hollywood is also on a role with there agenda,0
21,"Everything in this movie is bad.The story, writing, acting, special effects, everything is just awful. I can't remember a good thing about it. And Tessa Thompson sucks, why did they bother with her. It's even not funny at all. Avoid it and believe the bad reviews, unless you're 8 or 10 or something.",0
22,"MIB: International is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen. The entire film never entertained me, and the storyline was predictable from the start. I actually fell asleep for a part of the film; the last time this happened was during Jason Bourne in 2016. I haven’t seen any of the other MIB films yet, but this one makes me uninterested. (25/100)",0
23,It’s just guardians of the galaxy but with 2 characters instead of 4. I like how Thor is in it but isn’t he supposed to be fat? Doesn’t feel like a marvel movie at all and this is probably the worst marvel movie ever sense Iron Man 2.,0
24,SJW garbage. Who thought this was a good idea? 'Why is it MEN in black anyway?' - good idea! A big middle finger to every guy who just wanted to watch a movie.,0
25,"my eyes burn when I see this garbage, the politically correct version of men in black is not even the shadow of what it once was.",0
26,"Not much to say more than, bleh, the movie was so boring and bad that i found it hard to watch. I've never been a huge fan of remakes of older movies, but this was just a terrible remake of the original. The actors/actresses somewhat made up for the poor writing and boring plot, but their performances definitely weren't close to enough to save this disaster.",0
27,"This is another example of get woke go broke. This story is very bad, I mean really really bad. Almos everything the female character did is solve all the problem, by luck, yes, by the freaking luck!The visual effect is not really impressive. But the evil guy is so predictable. The final boss is weak as weak, there is only one effect hit landed on it, and killed it......",0
28,This movie is crap .Because action scenes bad and there is a boring spread on film.I am sleep in cinema. Especially crushed under John Wick 3. This is not a MİB,0
29,Another sequel no one asked for. If anything you should of made Will and Tommy a requirement to continue with this movie. Because they didn't and just trying to milk old franchise cause money money money. I haven't watched it and I don't need to. The trailer is all I need to see to know it was going to be terrible.,0
30,"Horrible and predictable movie. Helmsworth could not save it. Tessa Thompson is an example of an ""it girl"" who is a horrible actress that Hollywood keeps trying to shove down our throats even though no one is asking to see her movies. Another example of a horrible actress that keeps getting hired is Clara Delevigne.",0
31,this movie sucked so bad. its nothing like the original. there is nothing there for the actors to work with. the entire thing was re-imagined poorly. there is no cool banter between the seasoned pro and the newbie here - it just sucked. zero. do not pay to see,0
32,"- The chemistry between two lead actor and actress is non-existent- The usage of MIB lore / style is missing- The movie tried to establish a bond between a man and a woman whilst pushing a ""women power"" in a cringy way with the (Men in Black? People in Black? Women in Black? debate and ""all knowing omnipotent woman"" character) message making it impossible- Humor does not exist, everything is so meh. How many times is Hemsworth will let people use him as an underdog alpha-male being taught his place amongst powerful wamen scenario, I really don't wanna know- Tessa Thompson and Hemsworth played as themselves... again. I miss the actors and actresses of old, who used to put some different flavor in each individual character they played- I won't even go for the plot... They didn't even try, what a shameIn fact this much of dissection is somewhat overkill for this movie. But for the memory of THE three MIB movies, these must be said.",0
33,(Mauro Lanari)A brand stripped to the bone but that Sony and Columbia will insist on re-proposing until they'll come back to invent something new.,0
34,"Without the charisma of Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones! Instead full of PC SJW Agenda. This wasn´t what I´m looking for. Too bad another franchise gets down the drain. I can not understand, why Hollywood don´t wanna earn money anymore by creating good movies and interesting characters.",0
35,sadly this was garbage.  I really wanted it to like it but it was painful. they were so fun in Thor Ragnarok.,0
36,"Everything in this movie is bad.The story, writing, acting, special effects, everything is just awful. I can't remember a good thing about it. And Tessa Thompson sucks, why did they bother with her. It's even not funny at all",0
37,"its a jumbled mess of a movie, it makes no sense. most of the scenes don't reveal any important or relevant information concerning the plot. and the characters are boring and hallow. it tried to be funny, and i cringed. it tried to be serious, i cringed. I didn't enjoy a single part of this move and i regret watching it. so please do yourself a favor and go watch something else.",0
38,"Skip this. Stephen Spielberg has made some good movies, but this is not one of them. He has taken a series that began strong--with humor and imagination--and turned the fourth into bland acting, unimaginative special effects, and no reason to root for anyone. You can always tell when Spielberg is totally out of good ideas when the music track is painfully loud.",0
40,"This movie was absolutely atrocious.Bro, I just went and saw this movie because I love Men in Black, this movie was horrendous. Agent H: The greatest field agent that never actually saved the world. He is completely incompetent, and is not knowledgeable of almost anything. Basically, he's a party boy who used his good looks to swarm his way to the top. Agent M(olly): Mary Sue, who was a shut in her entire life, yet is not socially awkward. Has never been in a fight, but defeats a galactic goddess of death. A hacker who used NASA sites to track down MIB actions, while also TURNING DOWN the FBI and CIA, but don't think about that too hard.... Then waltz's into MIB headquarters, to get interrogated which turns into a job interview. She gives the female chief a few fashion complements, and tells her she's smart and has no life. Gets hired on the spot.Now, immediately gets to choose her weapon, is a complete dbag, disses the name of the whole organization. ""Men in Black, why not people in Black, or humans in Black?"".... It's based on a myth about aliens who obduct people. They look like emotionless creatures, dressed in all black suits, and resemble Men... Men in Black... Ffs....Brand new agent, just gets sent on a special duty to England.. ya know, as new recruits do. Is following top agents around, just casually hangs out with a top agent. F's up the mission, that's fine.Ends up obtaining a super weapon, that at some point in the movie she fires just because, creates a Grand canyon in the middle of the desert. And not one government agency shows up. Then travels to the goddess of death whom she defeats, who apparently has extremely high security system with many bodyguards, but she just gets on the island because they weren't paying attention or something. Basically like Bond villains, in a world where there's a secret agency above the CIA or FBI surveillance, but apparently have ADT security systems LOL.A psych out ending, with the villains that have been built up being a bait and switch.   Confronts actual villain, this is where it is revealed that agent h never actually save the world. Apparently High T has always been possessed since 2016.  Pawns grappling hook can withstand a black hole / vortex that can make people travel across the universe. agent h gets the keys to the whole organization, despite not actually saving the world, despite not being  competent in almost any single particular way, and his main rival in the organization gives him the keys because of respect or some BS. And he gets the nomination because the possessed high T, had recommended him before as a good leader. Despite not having shown one single good leadership quality.  Agent m knows how to fly the cars and everything, just cause... Guaranteed the people who say they like this film, willl have the most generic responses. the people that dislike this film, will tell you exactly why it was trash.Man I don't feel like typing anymore there is just so much wrong with this movie, and I will never trust an angry Joe review",0
41,"I was looking forward to see this movie, (mainly because of Chris H). but it wasnt as good as I thought it would be. I actually fell asleep about halfway through. It would be okay for younger kids who may not have seen the origional",0
42,"MIB is a franchise with no reason to continue. It's novelty worn off and any good idea has already be done. This movie has nothing new to bring to the table as pretty much everything is just copied from previous. To the point of being desperate as new elements are quickly pushed away and forgotten in favour of cliches like a mcguffin, alien sidekick, ""MIB is compromised"", etc. meanwhile the characters show little new in personality.Such a shame cause Tessa Thompson isn't bad at all and seems to do her best. Especially the first half, but the movie quickly turns mediocre at best and no amount of star-power is going to fix that.",0
43,"Feels very uninspired. Even some good actors wont make the characters lovable, simply because they are written like the stereotypical monotone, sterile, unemotional, Mary Sue'y and unfunny characters nowadays.The Walking Dead seems to have started this trend, by even killing off all the lovable ones quickly and only running a show based on its story alone, and now you see it almost everywhere, but the story wasnt even good or innovative either. Its a boring action fest. Obviously aimed at children, but even I as a child wouldnt have liked it. I liked movies like that as a child because of the characters. They were my heroes, they were lovable, they had their flaws, they had a deep personality, they were funny, they did great and believable things. Nowdays these film makers obviously either think children are all dumb as a rock or they aim to indoctrinate them with crap like this.And since its aimed at children, in these times it of course also has the mandatory SJW theme. MEN in Black. Of course they go off on that because woMEN are not included in MANkind and MEN in Black. Clearly we never saw female Men in Black before, huh?Instead of respecting that, and not doing division, they gotta do division, not only by mentioning it, but also mentioning it in an arrogant, femsplaining divisive way, and thus only showing their divisive and hypocritical ways. The main character from then on is completely unlikable, not that the others were not.",0
44,"This movie is a piece of garbage, bad characters, bad guion and the aliens were really bad just like this movie.",0
46,This is the **** thing that I ever saw this movie is **** not sure if I should get it in the morning,0
47,"This ""new"" Men in Black entry is just pure garbage. I'm feel so bad for Liam Neeson and Chris Hemsworth to have starred in this crap of a film. Still can't believe how stupid and boring is this sequel. I've expected something correct since this was from the director of The Negociator, but I've probably missed that he also directed Fast and Furious 8 more recently...",0
48,"это высер, помойка, каловый поток. Это не смотрите, не с чего сделать выводы. Зачем потратили на это ресурсы",0
49,This movie is a total garbage. Just terrible. Don't waste your time and money,0
50,"No Will Smith and Tommy Lee... why even bother. Tessa Thompson also just sucks. She sucked in Thor and she sucks even worse in this crap. I like Hemsworth but hes pretty bad in this as well. Jokes are bad, SJW agenda is being pushed, Its pure Cancer AIDS Cringe.",0
51,"I long for the days when writers in Hollywood actually cared about their creative content. There are so many movie franchises that should have ended years ago, such as The Terminator saga, Toy Story, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Pirates of the Caribbean. These filmmakers can't just leave what's already great alone. Of course, there are a few exceptions every here and there. However, Men In Black: International is not one of them. The majority of awful sequels these days definitely outweighs the anomalies. There are some moviegoers who don't mind Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson being paired together in this film. Needless to say, these two were already featured once before in Thor: Ragnarok. With MIB: International, it doesn't feel like a MIB movie without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. They should have stopped after MIB III. Most people don't want non-Marvel movies to imitate Marvel comic book films. It's not necessary, it's just cringe. Yes, this includes the casting. It may have been better to replace Thompson's character with Will Smith's. This way, Agent J, who is Will Smith, can show Chris Hemsworth the ropes. On second thought, it's not like this hasn't already been done before. Like I said before, this series ideally was supposed to end with MIB III. The golden guideline for screenwriters should be aiming for a trilogy, not winging it and milking it with four films, or five, or six movies. It's too much. Copycats are the last thing that Hollywood needs right now. Creative writing in this 21st century has become a forgotten necessity in the film industry. They care more about their politics than they do about their stories and characters.",0
52,"This film is complete garbage. There are only two aspects of the film that I found decent at best. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson have great chemistry together and Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, and Liam Neeson do an okay job acting. That’s where the positives stop. Here are the loads of negatives. The editing in this movie is awful. Scenes just abruptly end out of nowhere with no context. Some shots are shown multiple times in different angles and it is super annoying. Some shots make no sense. There is a desert scene and all of a sudden, it cuts to a picture of the moon for 3 seconds. There is literally no point to scene. The visual effects are bad. They are not complete garbage but they aren’t good either. The aliens look extremely fake and it gets distracting sometimes. The original Men In Black movie may have some dated effects but most are better in that movie than in Men in Black: International. The characters suck. Liam Neeson is a terrible villain and his character has no motivation. He wants to take over the world just because. Both Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson’s characters also don’t have any motivation to do anything other than they are told to. The supporting characters suck. Rebecca Ferguson’s character was only used for pointless action while the other supporting characters just suck in general. The film isn’t funny at all. I didn’t laugh at one joke. Each joke is painfully unfunny. The script sucks. Every line of dialogue feels forced and unnatural that you want to claw your hair out. The story and structure sucks. It tries to be this mystery movie but the film is so predictable that it loses any mystery. The film jumps from place to place with no rhyme or reason other than to move the story forward unnaturally. The tone is inconsistent. Some scenes are trying to be serious but are undercut by a comedic joke or some other conflicting tone. The pacing also sucks. Some scenes are so slow and others are just way too fast. Save your money and don’t watch this garbage. Use that money to just rent the original film instead. Overall, Men in Black: International may have good chemistry between the lead actors but fails at recapturing the craziness of the original film. I give Men in Black: International a 1/10.",0
56,"'Men in Black: International' is nothing more than Sony trying to cash-in on another franchise they own and attempt to revamp it for modern blockbuster competition. While they knew what franchise they wanted to revisit, and they knew who they wanted to be the lead stars, the only thing they forgot is to tell a story. Tessa Thompson ('Creed' and 'Thor: Ragnarok') is Molly, a dedicated and feisty young woman who, since she was a kid, witnessed the existence of strange extra-terrestrial beings among earth. This motivates her to be a part of a secret organization and she wants in. She attempts everything she could to get recruited, and when she finally meets Agent O (Emma Thompson), she manages to pass and get what she wants. Molly then also meets a strange yet handsome gentleman of an agent, Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) and she persuades him to let her join in on a mission together. Their boss, High T (Liam Neeson) is concerned about H's behavior and his constant recklessness. They go on a few missions together, and they manage to win everyone's respects back at headquarters. The problem that faces this film is that it is extremely underwhelming. The ""Men in Black"" franchise has been known for its imagination, as well as bringing out some surprising charisma and chemistry (previously with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) between any two leading stars. This one is actually rather frustrating and, dare I say, boring to watch. Hemsworth and Thompson are gifted actors, and have proven their worth ever since they showed their chemistry in 'Thor: Ragnarok' (2017), a movie that allowed them to do whatever they wanted and showcase their talents. Here, it seems that they are weighed down by an uninspired plot and dialogue that does not give them a chance to be themselves. Even director F. Gary Gray ('Straight Outta Compton') seems to be punished from a creative perspective. Not adding his own directorial traits to bring new life to the franchise. This film is only 1 hour and 54 minutes long, yet, you know it's an issue when earlier this year, 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019) (also co-starring Hemsworth and Thompson) clocks in at 3 hours and 1 minute, yet that one felt much shorter. I didn't get invested in any of the characters as Hemsworth was rather underdeveloped, he's just charming, but that's all he has. The action scenes weren't nearly as exciting as they should be, they're just fast and flashy. Also, none of the jokes land, time and time again, we see two characters holding their weapons at their enemies and a good five minutes is spent on quipping, or one character side-whispers something to the other character, what they say is nowhere near as funny. I honestly don't know why such talent, from F. Gary Gray, to Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, is wasted here. Perhaps Sony needed relevant names to bring some kind of appeal to the film, but you'll only find that appeal by looking at the poster. The film won't do much for you.",0
57,"This was absolutely dire with masses of sexist jokes, childish jokes and predictable story line.",0
58,What is this man .....Plz make the next sequel bestThis could be better...,0
59,A disposable movie with very little to offer. Chris and Tessa's chemistry is excellent but nothing else even comes close to matching their energy.,0
63,"Another movie with the now ""classic"" pandering to current tropes with 1/ a Mary Sue 2/ a dumb male character 3/ no character development 4/ childlike humor 5/ bored to death celebrities cashing on easy money 6/ pointless eye candy 7/ plot holesThis level of regression is just exceptional and it just shows the industry thinks so little of their customers. It's just pathetic and it has little to no redeemable qualities.",0
67,The Beard Alien has to be my most favorite funny alien ever! Right up there with Mordin Solus. Tessa Thompson is awesome too,1
68,"I like this is film!!!!Good,and nice....nice film.I love people in black!!!",1
69,People need to relax! I saw this last night and it was fun and good to see the MIB world back in action. There is some things lacking but overall I am happy I saw it and it was a good night at the movies. Calm down people and go into this movie ready for a fun ride.,1
70,I had a blast watching this but only if they had some sort of will smith/Tommy Lee Jones cameo appearance,1
71,"I'm a little surprised to see the general lukewarm reception to this. Okay, maybe this doesn't have the impact of the first one, but I found it to be a breezy, fun affair.I mean, I found the story to be competent and the movie had some nice humor, locales, and weird aliens. I actually liked the design of the aliens here better than the original MIB. This film made the hidden world of aliens feel more lived in.I was bugged a little by the inconsistent appearances of the extraterrestrials. At times the MIB headquarters is stuffed with them, while at other times it's solely humans. The placement of aliens should've been better paced.Alright, Tessa Thompson and Ian Hemsworth don't have quite the dynamic and presence of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. They're still both affable. I liked Thompson's attitude and her backstory. Though Hemsworth's character comes on a bit strong in the beginning and his motivations for the way he currently is could've been spelled out a little better, he remains charming and does a convincing portrayal of his emotional journey. Kumail Nanjiani really brings on the laughs as the voice of a tiny alien. The enemy duo agents fight are really impressive looking and dangerous.Wasn't the biggest fan of Rebecca Ferguson as an alien. I felt she was miscast and the character was poorly written.I came to this for action and entertainment, and I felt I got it.",1
72,"Хороший фильм. Если б не странная концовка, и незавершенный вопрос по Эйч, можно было б вообще 9 поставить. А так все логично, юмор присутствует, пасхалки тоже, ламповый такой фильм как по мне.",1
73,"Отличный фильм из вселенной Людей в черном. Откуда такие низкие рейтинги? Я серьезно, сохранена атмосфера, шутки, некоторые персонажи, сюжет ненапряжный как и в прошлых частях. Фильм НОРМАЛЬНЫЙ, фанатам серии идти обязательно, не смотрите на рейтинги и обзоры",1
74,"The popular franchise has expanded to traverse with globe with 2 new agents (Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson). The plot is insignificant, especially since it has them trying to save the universe (yawn). There's plenty of action, but most of it is unexciting. Almost every scene is populated with a variety of wacky aliens, which keeps the visuals fun. It's slick and cool looking, but otherwise, relatively bland. Kumail Nanjiani voices the animated sidekick character and adds a few glimpses of humor, otherwise, there's little comedy that works. The new duo does OK with their roles.  It's not a bad movie, just not living up to the comic or action standards of its predecessors.",1
75,"God alone knows what people are complaining about. It an entertaining movie with very enjoy able performances from the stars. This was at par with the rest of the series. Unfortunate that Will Smith backed out, but still good!",1
77,"The movie was not great but it was a good movie. The visual effects were great and cool, I liked all of the aliens. The chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson was fantastic and they were so natural together. The cast gave great performances especially from Kumail Nanjiani,Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, Emma Thompson, and Rafe Spall. The movie was not as funny as I hoped and there wasn't much action but it wasn't a bad movie.",1
80,"‘Men In Black: International’ is everything you’d want from a fresh Summer blockbuster. It’s got charm, energy, and some good humor. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson are both well-suited to their roles and they do a great job portraying their characters. The duo villains that we’ve seen in the trailers, to me, are less captivating characters than anything I’ve seen. Some humor aspects didn’t land as well as others, but for the most part, the jokes landed very well. Although predictable, this movie is a great start to the Summer season bringing a stellar cast, vibrant visual effects, a quirky setting (as established in the first ‘Men In Black’ film), and a lot of fun for the family. Definitely see it in the theaters for the great visuals.",1
82,"It was a fun movie to watch. The plot wasn't all that great and too predictable, and the climax was way too short and again, predictable. I still enjoyed watching it, and the 4DX in the cinema was fun to try out with this movie and for me definitely added some extra fun factor, but the movie itself is mainly a ""switch your brain off and chuckle at the jokes"" movie in my opinion.",1
83,This is a fun movie. I had a good time in the cinema watching this and would recommend it to others,1
99,"I think Sony would have done better to play the ""book smart girl without street smarts"" and ""street smart man without book smarts"" more to the point. The movie has a long cringe worthy ""introduction"" before we finally have two agents working a case... but once started it does mellow out into something watchable.Sony seems to clearly want to play this trope, but is clearly a scared of offending their audience and hence dials back on the humor which mostly just ends up making both characters look like jerks. (Which, let's face it, they are... but that's why the gag works when done right.)The golden age of cinema is dead... but they really didn't do that badly, just were scared to take a very good concept and push it to the point that someone might get offended. I mean the setup is there, the scenes themselves seem to stop just short of cracking the joke you'd expect them to.I mean, at one scene you can clearly see that Agent M should probably be begging that her new friend doesn't kill someone else in as horrible way as possible. Instead the scene cuts from what was clearly setup to be a joke and it's over as soon as it started.",1

101,"Una Decepción....... no me esperaba nada de esta película y aun así logra decepcionarme, los personajes son planos, no hay desarrollo de personajes, y la historia es plana y genérica y como si esto no fuera suficiente suplicio hay una enorme corrección política y hembrismo.Esto nos da como resultado un producto vació sin ninguno tipo de personalidad.Edición: No me mal interpreten, se que hay quienes les puede gustar la película, solo estoy dando mi humilde opinión, tampoco quiero ofender a movimientos culturales como el feminismo.",0
102,"Really enjoyed it. Every single scene of this movie was at least good imo. It looks awesome too which doesn’t hurt how I feel about it at all. Really liked the characters, especially the main pair, and they play off each other pretty damn well too. The action was fun, and there were some funny moments here and there. Not everything landed, but none of it was cringey or anything just sorta the kind of joke you smile at. The story is actually pretty good too I was engaged in what was gonna happen. I’m not gonna get into it at all because it’s super easy to spoil this movie, but there were a few moments I was kinda impressed by story-wise even though I predicted what was gonna happen. It felt a bit like there were b-plots inside the movie but in the same way it all connected to the main plot or at least the main characters. It’s not a great movie, though it does come reasonably close, but there just aren’t many flaws. There was a time I had to pause the movie an hour in and I saw the time and I was like wow it really has not felt like an hour. I guess that’s just a testament to how enjoyable it is.",1
