0,"To be honest, it was clear that Dark Phoenix would be another failure from Marvel, just because the main role playing by Sophie Turner instead of a good actress, or to tell more precisely that Sophie Turner unsuccessfully tried to show something and no one knows what is it. Unfortunately, bosses of film companies and TV channels idiots (mostly) and absolutely don't understand what a quality product means, they have the task to get as much profit as possible, and for it, they think that them need to invite famous faces, but not good professional actors. So here it turns out not a movie, but sh*t with dubious special effects.With regard to Dark Phoenix:- The main  minus is Sophie Turner. How could she be invited after the Game of Thrones and X-Men: Apocalypse ? With the same success, the role of Jean Gray could be played by mannequin from clothes store no one would know the difference.P.S. The New Mutants will be epic fail, for the same reasons as the failure of Dark Phoenix and X-Men: Apocalypse - famous faces not good professional actors. This is especially true of Maisie Williams, which ""actress"" as Sophie Turner.Bob Iger, Christine McCarthy, Alan F. Horn, Alan Bergman, Emma Watts, Cathleen Taff, Asad Ayaz, Isaac Perlmutter, Dan Buckley, Joe Quesada, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso what are you f* doing?",0
1,"That's enough! Stop invite Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams into movies and TV shows, because from this they will not become actresses, they will remain two mediocrities who were accidentally taken into Game of Thrones, and now for some reason film companies consider it their duty invited these mediocrities to play the main roles. STOP! YOU'RE DESTROYING HOLLYWOOD!",0
2,"One of the worst movies by Marvel, and absolutely worst along with X-Men: Apocalypse to all of X-Men series. Of the thousands of actresses Marvel/Disney have chosen dummy Sophie Turner.",0
3,"First of all, I hated everything in this movie and really found no joy in this movie. As soon as I saw the credits rolling I booked it out of the theatre and was the first one out. This movie is so slow in its pacing to the point I nearly fell asleep a bunch of times. This is a superhero movie and part of one of the greatest Marvel superhero teams and there is nothing to keep somebody’s attention for longer than 2 seconds. This movie is one-hour and fifty-four-minutes long but it feels like a three-hour-long film. This is due to the boring dialogue and a slow-paced story that never really picked up at any point. Even the action scenes were boring to watch. This movie has one of the most iconic comic book person ever and they just waste her. There is like three or four action scenes in this film and every single one was just as boring as the last one. The characters for some reason changed so that they were nothing like what they were actually supposed to be. This can be mainly seen with Charles, played by McAvoy, and Nightcrawler, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. They both had major character changes that just didn’t suit their characters at all. Also, I rewatched a clip from X-Men Apocalypse and Nightcrawler had a downgrade on his makeup effects. The makeup looks nothing like what it did in the last movie. The special effects in this film were just hideous and I couldn’t stand to look at it. This film had a budget of $200 million dollars and I think all of it went to get back all of the actors because they all probably had better movies to film. Lots of scenes in this film just ended randomly. The part where I thought the film was going to end ended up not being the ending and went on for like 2 more pointless minutes. In the end, Dark Phoenix just isn’t a good film for anybody. I give Dark Phoenix a 3.5/10.",0
4,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen. But at a loss of words when it comes to say anything good about it. The acting wasn't bad, but at times was flat. The story as it relates to the comics was way off. Overall, sirens your money elsewhere.",0
6,This is baaaad. This is not an X-Men movie. Cringe is the king of this so-called movie. It is not a movie,0
7,"This movie was freaking awful, I never thought they could outdo origins wolverine or last stand but they pulled it off.",0
8,A terrible script meets worse directing and an editor that must have been kept in the dark as to the purpose of many of the scenes.  A few decades ago this would have been put in the vault and never seen the light of day.  If you want something more entertaining check out the reasons people are giving this a 10.  Even the shills are phoning this one in.,0
9,"They took a truly cosmic scale character and made a deeply mundane film out of it. Why would you do that?  There's no epic character arc here, just a series of firework shows interspersed with overwrought agonising.  It's so earthbound in perspective that even the cardboard baddie aliens were made to look entirely human.  A few sparkly effects later, some more maudlin introspection and then we wrap up leaving everyone wondering what the point was.  A gross injustice to the source material.  Super disappointing.",0
10,"the movie was horrible. Sophie turner looked like a dam zombie and played Sansa again in Flippen X-men. And ""respect for women lacking"" as throughout the movie they demeaned crippled Prof X.",0
11,"Here we go again. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse then the last stand, fox managed to surprise me. What a horrible movie, it donesn't even make sense, the plot is awful. Thankfully it's the last one. The rating 3 is for Magneto, the only good thing about this movie.",0
12,"Already forgot what this movie was about. In another year, I'll completely forget about it if I'm lucky.",0
14,"Me da mucha pereza hacer una review para este bodrio tan decepcionante, pero dentro de pronto la escribiré.X-MEN: Dark Phoenix es probablemente junto con Orígenes, la peor cinta de la saga. Aburrida, penosa y nada sorprendente. Es tan mala que no logra generar interés en las cosas que suceden. “Mira, un X-MEN murió” ¿A quién le importa?",0
15,Only Fassbender as Mags brings something cool to this movie the other actors don't really get what their characters are about.The script is awful the movie has no soul.,0
16,"I knew I shouldn't have gone after reading the reviews but everyone was up for action. The reviews are accurate; it is a retread of everything before and then we put in lots more fight scenes to give it a sense of stakes. Interestingly, the current Jennifer Lawrence curse continues, if she is in the movie, it will tank. This movie is about getting the last dollar out of the franchise. Then again Captain Marvel was far worse than this and made tons of money. My hat is off to the marketing professionals at Disney, they made the right choice not to waste money on this one.",0
17,"This movie is boring at its best and hard to watch at its worst. There is only one kinda fun action scene in the third act but it quickly becomes boring again. There's no feeling of real stakes and I blame the villains because, despite all the exposition thrown at the audience, their plan is not well explained and you are given little sense of how powerful they are or how scared you should be. Character motivations are slim or nonexistent and the cast seems entirely checked out. Overall, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you go see something else. Dark Phoenix is not the worst X-men movie but its definitely bottom 3 and should be avoided at all costs.",0
18,This movie is bad....This movie is very bad. The only thing that stops me from giving this movie a 0/10 is because Michael Fassbender came through with a decent performance as usual. Everything else on the other hand is honestly awful. Atleast X-men 3 had the Juggernaut to laugh at.,0
19,"This was literally the WORST X-Men film I've ever watched. It even found a way to be worse than The Last Stand. Don't waste your money. A dollar saved is a dollar earned.. to be used on a movie that's not an absolute flaming dumpster fire. Also, the exploding dumpsters had terrible CGI flames.",0
20,"prolly the worst x-men of the last years, a very weak plot, with a bad direction, boring, useless, nothing new happens, a bunch of great actors with no chance to act properly",0
21,"This movie was shallow, there was a forced intention to make it bigger than it really was, as for example the ""solar flare"" or whatever thing that destroys planets... but somehow stopped nearby earth, just in time for it to be absorbed by Grey... really?. The enemies were also shallow, I mean they were some kind of aliens, very stereotypical aliens if you ask, with the ability of acquiring human forms... I mean like thats not been used in a hundred movies and tv programs before, and that posed no real opposition, and the final one, just vanished because it could not absorb all the power it wanted... Sorry it had some action moments like when the military was after Jean, and all of that, but that has nothing nothing of special... (sigh). Hope they didnt make the trailer so appealing as to have me running to watch the movie.",0
22,"Good: The acting was fantastic, as usual for this cast. Good music. Great CGI.Bad: Incredibly boring and trite script that stays heavy and depressing the whole movie. Typical millennial masturbation about naive and untrained young people being better than those with experience. Picture Captain Marvel, but without the refugees and you have pretty much the exact same story. At least Captain Marvel had some funny moments and good action though.",0
23,"This is by far the worst Xmen movie put out there. Acting was terrible and you might as well throw out Xmen Days of Future past when watching this movie,  because the movie in no way correlates with Days of Future Past as it should.",0
24,worst comeback ever this movie sucks watch this if you want to waste 30 dollars this move is not worth the money,0
25,"IDK WHY PPL ARE DEFENDING THIS! It's an awful movie.... it's tanking for a reason, it's loosing over 100 million dollars for a reason. The reason is it sucks!",0
26,Feminist garbage infects and destroy everything it touches. Vote with your wallets!,0
27,"This is an utterly reprehensible attempt at bringing the Dark Phoenix saga to the big screen.  The story was ALREADY WRITTEN in the X-Men comics for god's sake!  You had ONE job studio clowns, and you couldn't even get that right.  Avoid this dumpster fire at all costs.",0
28,"The dark side of the Marvel, the black hole, where even the fans won't return satisfied. Dark Phoenix Kinberg, at a certain point, could be forgiven. I can see him pitching the idea enthusiastically and even getting the equal reaction back. He is, first and foremost, a writer. And he, the writer and director, Simon Kinberg, therefore, surely knows on what frame to finish the film. That very piece of note flying about, the whole point gets checked off metaphorically, in those last moments. But we are getting ahead of ourselves and we are exaggerating. For beyond that very frame- surprisingly for a movie of this genre- I didn't buy a singly word of the film. It is the probably of the shortest runtime and yet the most time-consuming one. The previous chapter, Apocalypse, did make me think that maybe we've had too much of superhero films. But I resisted. Clearing out my doubts, this time, the franchise is back with another irrelevant chapter; after Days Of Future Past, everything seems like a desperate pursuit for big box office collection. I would say, that this is the olden days in rom-com genre where we are suffocated by CGI explosions, even the summer schedule at the theatre is congested. And, this is the Kate Hudson rom-com that no one asked for. In terms of comic book films, it is equivalent to Clooney's version of Batman, or current DC; pick your choice. Tomfoolery is an unintentional by product; obviously, and if not, than this is gold. The promising concept was James McAvoy's track, that too, only in the beginning, where you see him as a fully fledged egoistic leader, which later on, is crushed on by super super elements that weighs zero credibility in the narration. The only question that this so called sci-fi film asks, is why did they name it Dark Phoenix? It is not likely to be, but if another chapter does comes up, I'd recommend X-Men Mistake.. oh no, Dark Mistake- it gives that intense feeling.",0
29,As soon as Jennifer Lawrence said women do all the work and name should be changed to X Women .  I knew I was in for another poorly written dull movie with an agenda other than entertainment.,0
30,Is this a kind of joke ? I think Its the worst movie of 2019 .  just wasting  my time for watching . even its not good for spend time just make me angry and nervous !!! . Only reason i gave 1 is because of working hard for make this thing . What you need is find a spoiler and ask about the movie and simply   you wont have to watch it  and waste your time like me !!.,0
31,"This is probably one of the most terrible movies I've seen recently. Dumb plot, dumb and lazy characters writing, dumb everything.",0
32,"Absolutely awful movie. No chemistry between actors, making JLaw one of the good guys even though she's not. Rubbish, absolute rubbish. This actors don't even look like Xmen. Could go on for decades, because even when first class came out i said no to this actors as xmen. I don't recommend this movie its just a big waste of time nothing more.",0
33,"Terrible movie. I made a mistake thinking that i might be wrong that this movie could actually work, but I've been fooled before. Definitely worst X-men movie",0
34,"Too much SJW bs in this one. Not a high quality movie or good story. It says something when what is usually the ""shill media"" who pander to anything that's anti white male, are also reviewing this movie poorly. Avoid.",0
35,Enredo bizarro. Construção da história ruim. Personagens mal aproveitados. Fênix negra boba.,0
36,"This is extremely disappointing. It has taken me a while to really get my thoughts down, after rewatching it. Simon Kinberg wrote a great film called Sherlock Holmes that was so well done. So how the hell is this possible? Well when I heard about the reshoots and the delays, I knew there was problems coming ahead.The writing and effects are the worst aspects of the film. The cast, Michael Fassbender, James MacAvoy, and Jennifer Lawrence are outstanding; trying to make a god awful movie some how work. I am frustrated with Jessica Chastain and how they wanted her to be. There are moments in which this could work, but they are afraid to commit and use cliches to finish the story. But there is a comic book. There's a reason why this film exists, so use it.Overall, just don't watch this movie.",0
37,"A terrible mess of rushing around for absolutely nothing. It seems like no one even tries to act properly. I didn't even know that this ends the franchise, but what a depressing way to end it indeed. This films tries too hard to be something it is not supposed to be.",0
38,"Pior filme do gênero, pior filme da franquia, roteiro sem pés nem cabeça, desenvolvimento ridículo, conclusão horrível, um filme sem sal, sem uma trilha sonora decente, personagens sem carácter, fotografia simples até demais, tudo que tinham para errar, erram.Parabéns aos envolvidos.",0
39,"More SJW trash. Jennifer Lawrences character proclaims ""women do all the saving around here"", conveniently forgetting that Nightcrawker (A Male) LITERALLY SAVED EVERYBODY by himself in space not 2 minutes prior? I am 19 minutes and 30 seconds into the film and just burst out laughing. Boy am I in for a bumpy ride. Imagine paying money to see this tripe.",0
40,"Dragged to see this loathsome wreck by my nephew who hasn't yet developed critical-thinking skills, I found myself desiring to undergo a colonoscopy; at least I'm unconscious for that.Which may be a great win-win future business-venture: combine colonoscopies for reluctant adults with obnoxiously-woke SJW superhero movies targeting viewers with IQ's less than 50.  And that's not to insult people actually born with developmental deficiencies; THEY can't help the way they are.  No, I'm talking about allegedly functioning-members of society who intentionally switch off their brains because social-media orders them to. Seriously, I read some of the positive ""10 out of 10!!!  SQUEEEEE!"" reviews.  Geez, get a economy-sized drool cup for all that saliva, Skippy.This movie was directed by Simon Kinberg who wrote the screenplay for 'X-Men Last Stand'.  You know, that 3rd movie that was supposed to be directed by the awesome Matt Vaughn but instead went to the hack Brett Ratner?  That should set off Defcon-1 Red Alerts to your wallet.  AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS...Sophie Turner: boring.  Just because she was on Game of Thrones doesn't justify her yet in a leading role.  She needs to seriously pad her resume with at least 5 years of movie roles before doing something this big.Jennifer Lawrence: jarringly-obnoxious & phoning-it-in.  Is she worried that fellow up-and-coming Brie Larson is invading JLaw's man-hating-feminist turf?  Too bad James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were probably forced at legal-gunpoint.  Seriously, they have this constant ""God-I-wish-I-was-anywhere-else-but-here"" looks on their faces throughout this dreck.And Quicksilver?  He gets sidelined for the most of the movie?  He was the BEST thing about 'Days of Future Past'.Jessica Chastain: competing with Brie Larson for Wooden-Plank-Oscar of 2019.Everybody else: Forgettable. Bland. Invisible.Honestly, if this is the new Hollywood standard, with ENDLESS nagging political lectures to all you audience rubes about how wise they are, I say, ""Sure.  Go for broke.""  And I mean that LITERALLY.  Hollywood, I suggest that all superhero movies from now on feature EVERY.SINGLE.MINORITY with a political axe to grind as Gary & Mary Sues: perfect in every way, marching across the screen with all your propaganda packaged as eternal wisdom.  And make sure that EVERY moustache-twirling villain from now until Doomsday features a white/conservative/Christian/Alpha male.I'm sure that will reap gi-normous financial windfalls.  As for me, I'm done with movies.  A waste of time & money.",0
41,"I don't remember one of characters name, she change herself in person, she died ",0
42,"I thought Apocalypse is the worst movie franchise. I was right, because Dark Phoenix is not a film at all. This is a badly made amateur video clip. No moments are emotional at all. The plot and dialogue ignores every character development. Xavier is feeble heart and forceless hand. Erik is coward's coward, crybaby and pathetic wimp. The president accepts the mutants, and Erik hides in a bidonville built of Lego toy bricks with a possy of dirty rednecks. Senile teenager Peter is moody. Raven is Mockingjay again. Even the actors seem uninterested in their roles. Fassbender plays like a cheap melodrama. Probably, he is training, waiting for the death of his career. McAvoy just does not play. Turner can not play. Kinberg can not shoot. Action and CGI is poor. The costumes are terrible. All is awful, sad trash.",0
43,"Basically sjw gone wrong, just political agenda with no regard for a good story character development etc..",0
44,"Horrible. One of the worst ""superhero"" movies ever. Sophie Turner is a pretty bad actor and should not be a lead.This movie was boring and feels rushed, incomplete, predictable in places and poorly constructed.The costumes were very bad and the CGI looks very cheap.Dont waste your money on this very films-student-style and loaded with tropes movie.I was honestly hoping they would end with a good send off considering it's the last Fox Studios X-Men movie. It was full of cheesy one liners and terrible direction. I was ready to leave the movie within 45 minutes of starting it.Now that the Mouse is in charge we can expect nothing good ever again. Sad.",0
49,"Okay now I'm home I've had a minute to reflect on this film and I do have a lot of thoughts. Mostly very angry ones. But there is some good points which I shall go through first because there wasn't many. Firstly Sophie Turner despite her slightly off American accent gives a damn good performance as Jean. The emotional scenes aren't her strongest but when she's going full psycho I am in like so there with her. Jessica Chastain elevates her dull, non-existent character into some levels of villain but that's through pure muscle on her part because god knows how she managed that.Now the steaming pile of **** that was the rest. Firstly this would have benefited about 2000000% from a film between Apocalypse and this; I know it couldn't have happened but it severely needed it. The characters you are meant to care about like Cyclops and Storm are just sort of there. Big recognisable characters that blend into the background because there is no substance. You can't connect to characters that are part of such a huge ensemble without a lot of work and this film didn't do it.The characters you do know like Raven and Charles are just rough approximations of characters we've seen before. Charles felt like a different person. Erik feels like there is absolute no character growth until his U-Turn in the third act. Raven well, there's nothing to say there. Hank actually feels a bit like a character with an arc but not much else besides that.The alien dudes were all irrelevant. They were there purely to give the X-Men some random hench-people to beat up on that train. Sure they seemed menacing for like a split second and then they're all dead anyway so whatever I guess. Jessica Chastain's leader is menacing but like why are you there? While I love Jessica she had no reason to be in this film. Her guidance, if you can call it that lasts all of two seconds for Jean to almost kill Erik, torture Charles for a bit then oops gone never mind. So pointless.The whole third act is basically a waste of time because the fight is pointless. Jean wipes out everyone in her way disintegrates Jessica and becomes the Phoenix Force. Cool. Do I care? Not really I don't know this Jean, so oh well. Bottom line Last Stand is actually better. RIP Fox X-Men.",0
50,"Someone commented that he/she ""really don't get the hate this movie is getting. The film's hugely emotional, dark and dramatic and nothing like the usual superhero films."" The problem is, it's all high school level drama, and not everyone like this kind of it. Personally, i hate it.",0
51,"Far better than Apocalypse! It could have been better in terms of aesthetics and grandness, but, none the less it is definitely entertaining!",1
53,"It was no real secret how wholly disinterested Jennifer Lawrence appeared in X-men Apocalypse, now imagine that applied to every character in Dark Phoenix with the exception of James McAavoy (barely) and Sophie Turner. Nobody looked like they wanted to be there and by 30 minutes in, if not sooner, you'll realize that you don't want to be here either.",0
54,What I found to be remarkable with this movie is how bad it is right from the beginning. It is unconvincing at every step of the way. The actors don't have a clue what to do and the pandering to current politics is pathetic.,0
55,"Tired of all this forced feminist propaganda. It was not that terrible but I decided this movie with unredeemable at the first crap feminist line. No more tolerance or patience for this, which is after all, exactly what they want.",0
56,"Here's the bottom of the barrel from the X-Men franchise! This chapter is even worst than X-Men 3 the Last Stand, what a damn accomplishment. The story is just empty as the brain of the producers, Sophie Turner is even worst than Christopher Lambert in Beowulf, the action is boring and ineffective, the Hans Zimmer score is a pathetic joke, well... What a mess of a film.Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are great as always, but this isn't enough to save this crap. Some scenes are still enjoyable, but this is overall a huge disappointment. This could be a franchise killer at this point.",0
57,"Just the worse Xmen movie , by the way Jean was supposed to already have the Phoenix in here in Xmen Apocalypse....",0
58,"Para Ser Marvel / X-MENLa verdad esperaba un poco mas, la falta de creatividad y falta de seriedad en esta película fue lo que le falto. Escenas feministas forzadas, Trama poco elaborada,Personajes o actores secundarios poco comprometidos con su personaje. La verdad salí algo decepcionado de la sala de cine.",0
60,"Bad script, bad action scenes, bad acting (except for Sophie Turner), this movie is a mess, the plot is bad, the villian is terrible and the ending is bad.",0
61,"This is so sad. What could have been one of the best X-men movies ended being the worst. You have the most powerful story in your hands, you can create fear, destruction and reach so much climax paths with the Dark Phoenix and you do nothing, you reach nothing... This writer/director didn't make a tiny choice on the right path. It is one of the most bland and anticlimax movies released lately. He reached nothing with this movie, and he had on his hands the most powerful being on the Marvel Universe, the Darkest story and character, the best comic story... and he achieved nothing, absolutely nothing with it. I hope this man loses his job because he destroyed and ashamed a whole franchise. The only reason I didn't give a Zero score is because Sophie Turner surprised me... She was the only thing I thought could've destroyed the movie before watching it, but in the end she was the only one that actually saved the movie a bit. Her Jean Grey is actually very good, she showed so much potential that the director/writer actually wasted. Because Sophie Turner really sent chills and threat feelings. She was threatening and volatile; and very powerful on Dark Phoenix scenes. If she got more content from the horrible writer and director I am sure she would blow the roof as Dark Phoenix, but she just didn't have enough material to work on.",0
66,"Sitting in the theater to see Dark Phoenix,the final installment in the X-Men franchise (that Fox improved and failed at the same time),felt like if you're going into a Disneyland attraction made for couples,only when you enter,it actually turns out to be a ""Haunted House""-like attraction without any scares,because it bombards you by throwing everything at your eyes,as they're trying to **** your pants,but they fail Miserably.You know what's the most unfortunate thing about Phoenix? Not only it has a fantastic opening sequence,but the score by Hans Zimmer (the only thing I was looking forward in this movie) is not enough to save this big failure of a picture.But let's talk positive for a second…As said,Hans Zimmer's score is magical and brooding at the same time,almost returning to its Interstellar (2014) roots,although it's devoid of Zimmer's signature "" Loudness Factor"". Yeah,that Factor appears for a split-second,but it's still not enough to carry that label.Aside from a bit of Sophie Turner,the cast is fine,but McAvoy and Fassbender steal it all.The concept and the small scale structure Simon Kinberg (Director,Writer and Producer...Yikes) gives to the presentation I can see working with a more talented set of people.And the s...We're sorry. If you want to proceed with the good stuff,please. Spend another million dollars.Unfortunately, this wasn't the hot mess I wanted to laugh at because of its Production Value.To start off,some parts of Sophie Turner I really liked,but the rest of it felt like she should've been in a S** Tape,as some of her movements and facial expressions are either weird or hilarious to look at.There seems to be no sign of Writing and coherent Action,as everyone is just throwing punches or saying plain words. Yeah,little bits of story are here and there (Jean Grey's internal crisis with her powers,Magneto taking care of new mutants in the island with no name [I suppose it's Genosha,but the writer never acknowledges it]) but they're never used to their full potential,yet,I can see a better movie somewhere in here…Also,where was Quicksilver this entire time?And I still laugh at the X-Women line,AKA the greatest movie line in HISTORY!!!Overall,luckily it's not Jurassic World 2 bad,since there are many pluses in here than JW,but worse than Dumbo and HellBoy (2019) it is.It's a hopeless,wasted,disgusting and dramatic Production Hell movie that fails to justify its existence,other than being ""the grand finale in the X-Men Franchise"" .Hell,even the studio lost faith in the movie some months ago with the whole Disney/Fox merger,so why bother spending your precious money?",0
67,La peor de toda la saga terrible la historia es pobre las actuaciones terribles,0
70,"Much better than I expected, and definitely better than Age of Apocalypse.  Sophie Turner does a great job as Jean.",1
74,"Overall I enjoyed it. Was it the best superhero/marvel/xmen movie? No, but it is way better than what the critics are saying. Sophie Turner performance as Jean Grey was one of the highlights of the movie. And of course James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as always did great. The soundtrack was another highlight of the movie. To be honest I can understand why some may have issue with the story/dialogue/pacing/development. I prefer movies where the pacing is a slow build up to the epic battle at the end and they delivered on that. I think they should had made its at least 30 minutes longer, to develop the characters more, especially the villain. But overall it work. Was it a 100% adaptation of the comic? No, but neither is any of the Disney Marvel movies are. There was some great dialogue and cgi, but there was some bad dialogue and cgi. However there was no more bad dialogue or cgi than there was in other blockbuster movies like Disney Stars Wars and Marvel. What I'm trying to say is, if Fox just slap Disney logo in the credits, more people would loved this movies. One thing I think people need to understand is that this movie was suppose to be beginning of a new X-men trilogy and not the end. Fox didn't merge with Disney until after the movie was made. So there wasn't supposed to been a big ending like Avengers Endgame.",1
81,"Better than, less commercial than Apokalips, the last X-men film, not as good as Logan, this is still about as good as superhero movies get.  I had a good deal of fun with the final moving train fight sequences.  The villains,  Jessica Chastain as Vuk and Ato Essandoh (the black guy) as villain Jones are given more to do than in most films.  Both are strong.  James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Sophie Turner, all perform with admirable conviction and gusto.  Given what Sinmon Kinberg had to go thru to get this made, this speaks volumes for his integrity, perseverance and craft.  I agree with James Kendrick of Q Network Film Desk:  ""It works on its own terms and deserves neither the critical scorn nor audience apathy it has received.""  Not quite a ""spiritual movie"" taken down by aggressive negative reviewers, this is a good effort likely to rise in estimation in years to come.",1
82,"“You're always sorry, Charles. And there's always a speech. But nobody cares!”Yikes.‘Dark Phoenix’ ends with a flicker rather than a bang. It’s quite depressing that a franchise that basically breathed life into the superhero genre that we know today sadly stopped caring.Despite everybody desperately holding on for hope that ‘Dark Phoenix’ would be a solid exist, I was the complete opposite - the evidence being in the development stages. Some have argued that “People have already made up their mind about this film before it’s been released, they want to hate it”, mm...no. This movie has been pushed back three times, a first time director Simon Kinberg, the test screenings was called “disastrous”, and the lack of interest the cast had towards the project.Even the clips realised for the movie either looked atrocious or absolute cringe, especially the Mystique “Change the Name to X-Women” scene. Like, you’re addressing this to a guy (Professor X) who lost the use of his legs by saving the world, lost his friend to differing opinions, uses his fortune to construct a school for helping mutants, and creates a team to help protect humanity.Anywhere, ‘Dark Phoenix’ is far from being worst in the series, but it’s the most dull and forgettable entry in the series, which is much worst in my point of view.James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender being the saving grace isn’t anything new, yet needs repeating with every entry despite their characters conflict being repetitive. Sophie Turner is fine as Jean Grey, but Turner truly shines whenever Jean is in shock and confused. Jennifer Lawrence, on the other hand, easily the weakest link as it’s never been so transparent for any actor to not give a damn. She was really bad. The Mystique make-up looks so bad and cheap for some reason. I’m guessing Lawrence didn’t want to go through the torture make-up process...well, tough sh*t. You’re being paid billions to star in these movies and the make-up being accurate to the character. If you don’t like it then leave. Jessica Chastain is fantastic as s̶k̶r̶u̶l̶l̶ Grace Randolph.It seems like the dialogue really took a nosedive with this franchise. I mean every line being delivered by the cast felt stiff and stilted.Also with this movie being set in 1992, it’s confusing to know that in 8 years time James Mcavoy will look like Patrick Stewart, and Michael Fassbender will look like Ian Mckellen. And don’t jump into the defense with the whole “set in the not too distant future” at the beginning of the first ‘X-men’ movie, because with the timeline being so f**ked up, it still doesn’t make it clear where anything is set. I find it extra confusing with this movie set 30 years after the events of ‘First Class’, yet the characters have barely aged during the intervening years. They could’ve easily put aging make-up on the actors to show a passing of time. I mean, sure it will look uncanny, but it’s better than not trying.The visual effects looked questionable at best. The final battle lacked any suspense since I didn’t care about any of the characters. The cinematography and Simon Kinberg directing wasn’t anything special. I’ve seen the movie a few days ago and nothing is sticking with me in terms of memory. I can’t think of anything worst than being forgettable.I find it alarming how a superhero movie coming out in 2019 can feel so outdated.Overall rating: Mr Feige will like to see you now.",0
84,"I don't get all the hate.  This Mutant effort is MILES BETTER than X-Men: Apocalypse.  It is not the greatest action movie ever, but some of the fight scenes had me clenching my fist in glee as the bad guys got their comeuppance.  I don't get invested like that in many movies, especially a film that is pretty much a standalone film, despite the franchise and history.  All of the actors are as good as ever.  Jennifer Lawrence, who is obviously in contract-fulfillment mode and phoning it in, was still good.  Sophie Turner is very good.    It's a super hero movie, folks. I had fun",1
85,"Dark Phoenix is not perfect but it is not bad either. The script, acting, and direction, though not stellar, were okay. Also, while uneven, CGI and editing were generally above-average. The action scenes, however, were mostly well-done and fun to watch. My favorite character was beast/hank (played by Nicholas Hoult); he had a very compelling story-line within the movie, and Nicholas did an awesome job in the role. But Sofia Turner was not bad either; Dark Phoenix/Jean Grey was a complex role, and I feel Sofia rose to the challenge. Overall, I enjoyed watching Dark Phoenix, and would definitely recommend it.",1
89,"This was not a bad film. Not the best either, had a great time watching the last of the X-Men films. Its sad to close the book on this beloved franchise but everything has to come to an end.",1
91,"Good entertaining movie, especially in terms of action scenes. I mean they are just amazing.",1
93,"IMO this movie has been rated very very unfairly. The story of X-men has always been complex, poignant and thought-provoking:It is about a community of mortals, gifted/cursed with superpowers, who struggle with emotions, morality and difficult choices just like ourselves.  These mutants only want to live in harmony and be well-balanced just like our multi-racial reality. I think this movie brings out these ideas very well! I really appreciate how the movie spotlights the characters, even Professor X who has the best of intentions, as imperfect. It makes us question whether the choices we made in our lives are always “for the best”.It is also about friendship and family, how this two things shape a person’s life more than societal norms or what is currently acceptable.The action is just right. Not overly fanciful and unnecessary. I do agree that the characters could have been given more lines and the younger actors could have performed better but it doesn’t warrant such a low rating!I like the poignant ending, it is fitting for this series! Only those who have watched all the X-men movies will understand it.I know many superhero movies are all about the action, fun and coolness, hence if you watch this movie with that in mind then you will not be able to appreciate it fully.",1
94,The phoenix rises. I'm obssessed with this movie. A very good action movie about my favorite X-Men character Jean Grey.,1
98,"This movie is amazing. One of the best marvel movies ever. Sophie Turner's performance was very good. I nearly cried in the end, the emotions were overwhelming. I expected less to be honest. I will watch the movie in cinema again for sure.",1
99,"It's emotional, fun, entertaining and takes the core of the Dark Phoenix saga elements, and makes a great job adapting them. Sophie Turner and the cast are great. Jean main issues from the comic are well portrayed as well.",1
100,"Went into this expecting something terrible.  Instead I was thoroughly entertained. The tone of this film is fantastic from the get-go.The action scenes were phenomenal.  I often found myself captivated in the fight scenes and really feeling the effects of them. Some neat angles as well and cinematic flair that I thought really brought out the grit in the movie.Story wise- no comment.  I grew up reading blue and gold generation x-men so all this phoenix stuff is unknown to me.  However, a lot of the psychology of the characters in this film did remind me of that era.  I enjoyed that.  So I went into this hearing some criticism of Sophie Turner not being the greatest.  I was waiting and ready for that, but in my opinion I would disagree.  I saw a wide range of emotion, and seriousness to her.  I liked it.I am so happy I went and saw this.  Great movie to watch in theater (dbox was actually a fun experience for a change).  I can honestly say I enjoyed this quite a bit more than the majority of recent comic book based films.",1
101,"Best cast, Amazing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, Great CGI and Visual Effects, Great Photography, Best teamwork and action scenes from all X-Men prior movies. It has it’s issues like every movie, but I saw a quality level that I have never seen before in the Fox mutants franchise.",1
102,"It’s the tone i remember for x-men in the 90s. It’s a really good ending for this series for me. The fights are bite sized, like a good xmen fight should be. Turner does an amazing job of showing the craziness that goes with power. Loved it, can’t wait for the bluray",1
103,Xmen never dissaponted me ! its really a good movie (maybe for a xmen fans like me). Really like it.,1
104,"I went into it with the attitude of ""I'll take it for what it is as a comic book fan just to say I watched it"". I was extremely entertained which turned into excitement. It seems people are projecting their expectations onto the characters (which is ironic considering the core motivation of the movie). There are those that are confused by the time-line. There happens to be another marvel movie recently released that made trillions but still confused people with the time-line. No, the dialogue was not painful. From the beginning, Raven sounded awkward when talking to others. But her character disagreed with the direction the x-men were going and, inside, she questioned the things they were doing. It was meant to be awkward (how do you feel talking to a mother-in-law you don't agree with?). There are those that said magneto could have shown more development. He completely changed who he was, came to peace with it, and does basically what Charles does at the permission of the US government. I'm perplexed at those complaints. What got me excited was how true-to-the-comics the characters became. ProfessorX showed his villain side. If anything, this movie held back on what Charles did in his selfish pursuit. Beast went full beast mode clawing people up. He shreaded people in the comics. Nightcrawler FINALLY started using his tail to kill poeple. Thats his signature move. Transporting people to their deaths then transporting away. It was beautiful. Seeing the Phoenix develop into her final form at the end was perfect. Anyway, it was very enjoyable and I'll watch again.",1
105,"This movie is really super nice! The story is so emotional and the fight scene is so satisfying, the soundtrack is excellent too!",1
106,An Absolute Blast! Dark Phoenix is an awesome film with a shocking ending. The visual effects are crazy and totally worth your time. I'm going again.,1
108,"I really don't get the hate this movie is getting. The film's hugely emotional, dark and dramatic and nothing like the usual superhero films. VFX is top notch, their acting's amazing and i have to note Magneto and Jean are super badass in this film and Sophie and Michael just gave an Oscar winning performance. The fight scene is ",1
109,"Fresh from the finale of ""Game of Thrones,"" Sophie Turner plays a new mutant who's sullied by aliens during a rescue mission. Her inherited powers are not only formidable, but coveted by the strangers from another planet (led by Jessica Chastain). Unlike some of the Marvel movies, the plot seems more focused and the interactions more interesting. What's most important is the action: which is sufficiently scattered throughout and less noisily cluttered than most of this genre. There's nothing new or particularly exciting here, but the narrative and effects are sufficiently entertaining. Sadly, this is the first Marvel film without a Stan Lee cameo, although it's dedicated to him .",1
110,Este Filme é Maravilhoso Na Verdade Porquê eu Amo os X Men e não é Nada Disso aí que as pessoas americanas falam á pelo amor de Deus né meus amigos,1
111,"All in all it was a good movie. It was fun to watch,the action was great and also shot very well(no dark or hard to see scenes),the story is a little bit boring but not too bad. As an X-Men fan I enjoyed it.",1
112,"This movie is **** awesome! I'm not sure what crack viewers are smoking, or perhaps they're just easily manipulated by the media, but I found this X-Men film to be one of the best in the whole series. Second actually only to X-Men 2: X-Men United-and I hated X-Men Apocalypse. The plot is familiar of course, and there's definitely some cringe worthy lines (and no Hugh Jackman is a severe handicap) but IT IS A SUPERB retelling of the Dark Phoenix saga. Don't be fooled by the bandwagon. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is unforgettable and the whole movie us unbridled action from beginning to end. With the final 40 minutes or so, complete balls-to-the-wall mutant splendor. My second favorite film of 2019 after John Wick 3 of course!!!",1
113,"This films suffers from a few things that a lot of other comic book (MCU) films suffer from such as underdeveloped villain, lack of clear motivation at times from characters, and somewhat shallow plot. Weird thing is, those other films get a pass when this one doesn't somehow. But all of these issues don't stop the film from being entertaining, cool, emotional, or even thought provoking at times. The cast is great, special effects are awesome, and the action is top notch. Not to mention the score by Hans Zimmer fits perfectly. Too bad critics treated this film so harshly when it didn't deserve it. This film takes some risks, and maybe some aren't used to that. Everyone should go see this film and judge for themselves without the critics telling you how they should feel. One of the better films of the year so far honestly.",1
114,"I personally liked the movie, I do not understand why it was so understated!",1
116,"The movie can surely appease fans, it's cast tries very hard to obtain the best of a lackluster script. Some sequences are pretty good, other are doubtful. The Dark Phoenix Saga material here is only scraps of the source material has to offer and the script seems rushed. Sophie Turner's performance it's good. She lets you feel the doubt, the pain, the betrayal and the strenght of the Dark Phoenix. The let down is how little the scope of the entity is worked and the action scenes seemed a bit clumsy. I hoped for more, but what It gives can entertain and shows us the unscaped potential of the saga. Hope someone get It right sometime and shows us the resplendance of the white phoenix instead.",1
119,"Dark Phoenix no es la mejor película de la saga, pero tampoco la peor. Absolutamente no es el fin tan merecido de una saga de 20 años, no obstante, si se intepretara como una aventura más de los X-Men, tendría una mejor calificación.Su peor enemigo es, otra vez, un guión que no parece querer terminar lo que comenzó con pie derecho. Si bien cada escena va construyéndose de manera específica y bien narrada, al final todo se siente muy contenido y no parece haber muchos momentos donde todo el drama explote. Mas, acierta al momento de hacer brillar a cada personaje en su debido momento; y esto se debe principalmente a las excelentes interpretaciones de un acertado cast.El desalentador debut de Simon deja mucho que desear, pero no creo que se deba a principalmente su estilo o conocimiento para hacerlo, sino porque su guión no estaba bien hecho. Visualmente es excelente, con efectos especiales bien hechos y encuadres que reflejaban el gran entusiasmo que tenía Simon.Quizá más tiempo de duración, sin la compra de Fox por Disney y el cambio repentino del final, la película habría gustado a todos y hubiera alcanzado la merecida gloria.Sophie Turner tuvo razón cuando dijo que la película era un drama, más allá de ser una epica película de super héroes. Se concentra en que el espectador empaticé con los personajes, y durante muchísimos momentos lo logra.Pero este justamente fue siempre el corazón de la saga: Interpretaciones excelentes de estupendos actores y actrices.",1
120,I don't care what critics or haters say. I loved this movie. I liked it more than Endgame. Everything was done very well. Fight scenes were amazing. The movie perfectly shows Jean's transformation into the dark phoenix and her powers.,1
121,"I dont know why in our time so agressive rating for the movies,  think its DC fans bots, cause You see huge rating of Aquamen and Shazam, and i say this DC movies a real piece of **** but with good rating. Very Strange.X-men: Dark Phoenix its good movie, real good movie!",1
122,"I just finished watching the movie a second time and I really adore it. There is a seductive beauty to every scene and I found all character motivations convincing. Especially, the socio-political subtext is timely and very well done. in a nutshell: access for minorities is only granted through politics of respectability. The action set pieces are also probably the best the series had so far. The X-Men finally fight as a team.Unfortunately, some scenes felt quite rushed and I wished the movie would have been longer. I do not understand why the length is so short. Jessica Chastain's character is the weakest link and underused. But all in all Dark Phoenix surprisingly became one of my favorite X-Men movies and is close behind X-Men 2, Days of Future Past, & Logan in my ranking. I am very irritated why so many critics online feel the need for articulating such harsh and hyperbolic reactions.",1
123,"Unless you are looking for forced comedy alas other Marvel Studios flicks, this movie is amazing...the action scenes are everything you would expect from X-Men",1
124,"Pretty solid. I don’t Understand the hate and the bad critic reviews. Good acting, good action. Could’ve been more epic with more quicksilver but overall I enjoyed it. Guess it helped that I went in with Lower expectations.",1
125,"While not a perfect film, if you go into it with all expectations left at the door you will be pleasantly surprised. However, do not go into this expecting comic accuracy.",1
126,"Genial, muy diferente a todo lo que veníamos viendo, buenas secuencias de acción y buen drama",1
128,"This is the 2nd time that Fox had the opportunity to bring the Dark Phoenix saga to the big screen and they mucked it up AGAIN. Not only did they muck it up again, but they also mucked it up much worse than X-Men Last Stand which looks like a flawless masterpiece by comparison. It sucks so bad to see them destroy the X-Men brand with a string of a terrible movies but...they keep doing it for $$$$$$$ because people LOVE the X-Men and they'll see anything with X-Men in the title (see X-Men Origins Wolverine for evidence of this) and yet the last GOOD movie was Days of Future Past. Avoid Dark Phoenix like the plague. It's terrible. Poor acting, poor directing, and it's also incredibly long and boring. Not something I ever thought I'd associate with the freakin' X-Men but, well, there you go.",0
129,"Another 2019 film that I'm not necessarily sure merits the amount of hate it's been getting from critics (and from fans, too, in this case). Simon Kinberg's ""Dark Phoenix"" sure isn't the finest comic book movie I've ever seen, but the worst of the entire X-Men franchise? I guess I wasn't aware of the sheer enjoyment fans drew from the unsung cinematic classic that was ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" but I digress. The character work is a bit of a mess at times and -- yes -- there are a few cringe-inducing lines and ideas for scenes. But the overall product was watchable, mostly straightforward, occasionally well-done and just enough of a success for me to stay on board with Fox's X-men franchise for future installments. Oh, wait. . .never mind. Rest in peace, 20th Century Fox. Again, this may not have been the worthiest effort from the X-men producers in question, but after seeing it, I can't say I would've minded following them through semi-rough patch they entered. I guess that won't be happening though.",1
130,This is a beautiful movie otherwise ruined by toxic femininity. Toxic femininity has been taking over the film industry and other aspects of our lives for years now. It needs to be condemned and rejected.,0

132,"This film is bad, not bad funny, just bad..Turn out  Sophie Turner can not act,, at all, I feel bad for the GOT directors, the editing they must have had to do to make her acting passable is incredible. Aside from that the story id disjointed and badly scripted, the music is just sleep inducing and drab.. It just bad..Please if you Marvel guy even make a X-Men movie this bad again feel free to call it X-Woman, like you mentioned in the film.Corniest and out of place statement in a film ever..Considering there was one instance of a woman saving people and about 10 instances of men saving people in the first 15 minutes of the film. And that one woman that saved people went on a killing spree for the rest of the film,, the whole film is wtf..",0
135,"If you're a fan of the First Class series of X-men this is worth a watch. Sure it's not groundbreaking. Definitely not as good as Days of Future Past, but much better than Apocalypse. They kept up the solid characters and has some of the best action SFX scenes in the series. Even after seeing all the bad reviews going in I still liked it.",1
138,"Dark Phoenix is actually not a bad movie. When all the critics started to going out and they were bad, I thought maybe the movie wouldn't be that good, but after I saw it, don't really know why the critics put it soo bad. I'm giving it a 10, because I'm a fan of the x-men and been a fan of the franchise for a few time now, but technically speaking would give 85 in 100, the visual effects, God, they were stunning, the soundtrack good, no major plot holes that ruin the movie soo bad, the movie it's rather entertaining, it should be a little longer to explain some things but it really doesn't matter. The final battle gave me some chills and I kind fell for Jean character, unlike the critics said. It's not endgame, not near, but for the franchise it delivers what's promised, not the worst of the x-men movies but not the best too. Just watch it, don't judge it before you see it and don't expect the best movie ever, just rather a good movie, entertaining and with good soundtrack.",1
141,"É uma ótimo filme! Não vejo porque a critica caiu tão encima do filme. Ótimas lutas, ótimo conceito. Porém a morte de um determinado mutante foi totalmente insana e não compactua com a franquia! Porém o andar da carruagem segue firme.",1

148,"Oh, man! Never thought an X-Men movie would be so f**king awful. ..Good : The ensemble cast. In particular James McAvoy. He really tries hard to save this movie. Some really short sequences were fine, just because it had Fassbender and McAvoy. And, that's all about that. ..Bad : HOLY F**KING S**T! I hate this movie. I F**KING HATE THIS MOVIE!!! Who the f**k greenlit this piece of s**t?!! The story doesn't make sense - if you can say it has a story. Everything is basically a f**king rehash of everything that was wrong with X-Men: The Last Stand. I mean what the f**k?! I have no real problem with the First Class cast not aging, I can simply enjoy the story, ignoring how they look. The major problem I had with this f**king s**t is that it f**king tries to retcon Days of Future Past and Logan, staying in the timeline set by DoFP. What's the f**king logic there? I mean, what was Simon Kinberg smoking when he was writing this monkey a$$ of a movie? DoFP was supposed to retcon the two **** films - Last Stand and Origins, right? Why am I calling them ****? They are f**king Citizen Kane and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly compared to this f**kery! This rat's a$$ of a film kills Raven, retconning the first two films! Alright, I can take that bulls**t. Then, it shows Professor X retiring, with Beast taking his position! What?!!! How does that hold up DoFP? That's a gigantic and the most unforgivable plothole that it generates. The opening sequence is something that a 10 year old can write, 200x better that is. Magneto is too forced, lacks a motive and changes his mind really quickly. He was introduced well with first three films, and had a really great arc in First Class. After that, there wasn't much to him. I didn't hate what he was in Apocalypse and DoFP, but this one is just bonkers! I, sort of, remember watching some storylines on Phoenix in the animated series, and it was better than this dumba$$ery. And that was a cartoon and obviously was cartoonish, but way less cartoonish than this blant f**kery! There are a lot of scenes taken from Last Stand and dumbed down at least 2 million times. Raven is human - Raven dies. There's a house to house action scene, which makes me like Last Stand even more. Phoenix gets killed - Phoenix gets pseudo-killed. Whole bunch of new mutants who serve zero purpose. I can go on and on. The dialogues are f**king cringe-worthy! ""Since all the women are helping the men out here, better change the name to X-Women"" or some d**k sauce of a line - that's in the movie man. Unbelievable! Also, all Beast does is give First Class references. Guess what, motherf**ker? First Class references don't make your s**thead of a film as great as First Class! Cyclops is a f**king dummy. His f bomb was a bomb that emitted laughing gas. Is there anything left? Nope. There's it, people. I summarized the entire monkey d**k of a movie. ..Conclusion : F**k this movie!!!! If you're an X-Men fan, stay away from this suck-a$$ery of a cringe-fest. ..Rating. ..Score : 0/10Grade : F",0

It surprised me, I enjoyed it very much.Good special effects and mostly a good story. Besides the ""x-woman"" frase the movie was pretty good. The bad thing was that the last quarter of the movie I notice that this was a two part movie and not just one. They rushed the ending to make it a one part movie. You can notice it in the acting, that overall it was pretty good.",1
154,"Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect and perfect!!!",1
156,"The conflict of the movie was too short. I didn't felt like the movie deserves its ending. It's like the whole franchise was wasted. Not even any Wolverine appearance, since this ends the franchise. What they did to replacing ""Xavier's School"" to ""Jean Grey's School"" doesn't feel good to me.Simon Kinberg is more like David Benioff.  But still, the actors did great especially Sophie Turner. A new side of her was shown in this movie. Also, the effects  and CGI are amazing like what they did to the train.",1
157,"Everyone should see this film a second time. It is so much better on the second screening (especially on an IMAX screen). I think the first time watching it can be a shock because it is such a different tone from other X-Men movies and it is so dark and serious that it almost seems one-note and disappointing. But on the second viewing I could appreciate the sublime tragic beauty of the film (especially thanks to Hans Zimmer's gorgeously haunting score).  What I thought on first viewing was cliche dialogue, now on second viewing seems like economical, deep and meaningful dialogue. I even could appreciate the acting performances. Jessica Chastain's performance is actually really good. Notice the contrast between her human self and the alien replica self. Her emotionless cold performance fits her alien character's motives and makes her performance appropriately creepy. Jennifer Lawrence gives a fine performance (despite everyone saying that she's just phoning it in) It's actually quite good and honest and makes the story even more tragic. And Sophie Turner did a good job showing the emotional evolution of her character. On my first viewing I thought she was terrible and I even made a joke about her acting being more wooden than Jessica Chastain's alien character. But on second viewing, I take it back. Sophie did a great job. A lot of her acting was understated and internalized. What gets me about the negative reviews is that the people who love action complained about the first half of this film not having enough action in it and being more like a dramatic soap opera. But then other people complain about the third half having too much action. I think this film gives something for everyone and I really admire its three act structure of the story. The first act was like a philosophical sci-fi film. The second act was like a film noir. And the third act was like an action horror film.  I liked how the whole third act and big finale sequence takes place at night. It fits with the title Dark Phoenix. Also, unlike other people who have complained about this abbreviated version of the Dark Phoenix saga, I would not have liked to see this story arc continue over three films. I think this film did a good enough job distilling down the themes to be appropriate for one film and to give the whole series a cautionary yet hopeful ending. It's just a shame that it had to be released after Avengers Endgame because that films was such a complex and triumphant masterpiece that it is a tough act to follow for any other superhero film. But try to view Dark Phoenix as a more psychological chamber piece and it becomes its own kind of masterpiece. Yes there are still the slight flaws that befall any superhero movie where magic powers are allowed to break all the rules of logic. But I was able to suspend my disbelief more during the 2nd screening than I was during the 1st screening. So I am hoping this film stands the test of time and becomes more liked as the dust settles and people have a chance to view it a 2nd time.",1
158,This movie was so great compare avengers Endgame . I really enjoyed watching this movie.,1
159,"Without ruining anything, this move is more than what the trailers lead on. The cast did an amazing job with what they had, the fight scenes where amazing, and I can't help but feel this move was unappreciated. Go to the moves, give it a shot, and form your own opinion.",1
161,"Absolute phenomenal movie, i loved the way it was presented and the graphics and animation were great.",1

164,"Dark Phoenix movie is great!!! The visual effects are outstanding. I loved the villain, Vuk, who is the leader of the alien race D'Bari whose planet got destroyed by the Dark Phoenix in the comics(Jean Grey swallowed their sun's energy which resulted in their solar system being destroyed). Dark Phoenix is very different from another superhero movies as well as from the Last Stand where they also tried to make a movie about the Dark Phoenix. It has its unique style of a superhero movie that I really liked. Now it's my favorite marvel movie. This movie focuses on Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix, I'm glad I saw a movie about her because she is my favorite marvel character.",1
165,That wasn't the best movie about x-men but i liked it and it was really good.,1

170,"I think what really tanked this movie was not just remaking a storyline we have already seen in X-Men 3 but doing so in the most straightforward, boring way possible. It was just bad. From the very beginning, I knew it would be awful and indeed it was. And it certainly doesn't help that Apocalypse did such a terrible job at setting up this film because that was yet another poorly written X-Men film.Dark Phoenix should just be ignored, Pretend it doesn't exist. You are better off. And no, I don't blame the cast for it failing. You can only do so much with an awful script.",0

Some superb acting here and Simon Kinberg's pleasing direction means all the production goodness is up on the screen here. The emotional and action packed core of the film is present and solid with Sophie Turner delivering an excellent performance here as troubled mutant Jean Grey. The teenage me that grew up loving the animated xmen series was so happy watching this today!(was genuinely moved by the ending also!) So for all true x-fans who love seeing the trials and tribulations of those poor downtrodden uncanny mutants, ignore the hate and breathe in the x-goodness that is Dark Phoenix.",1
174,Very funny X-men parody. X-WOMEN UNITE *wink*. Phoenix story-line wasn't done justice. Cyclops kept missing Magneto again and again when all he needs to do is look at him. Want to see how laser eye beams should be on film? Watch The Boys.,0

Nem mesmo a morte de Raven e de jane.-Aspectos Negativos: Muita coisa em boa suma. Lutas horriveis, história com fio nenhum, personagens sem impacto, não existe momentos marcantes e parece um filme feito á pressa. Em suma, não gostei praticamente em nada do filme.",0
177,"Хорошее выше среднего кино получилось, не заслуживает столь низких оценок. Иногда пересматриваю его.",1
178,"All are not good especially the justification of the phoenix that adds another nonsense .. The music is superb #LoveHansZimmer ..The story is sensitive like the phoenix and gifted compared to everything around it .. We talk about power .. Less than x men 3 but much darker and impacting!In conclusion it is an excellent thought you should start! All you need to wake up the woman who is in you ""Laetitia founder of L-Women!"" seen 2 timesTous ne sont pas bon notamment la justification du phénix qui ajoute encore un non-sens.. Les musiques sont superbe #LoveHansZimmer..L'histoire est sensible comme le phénix et surdoué par rapport a tout ce qui l'entoure.. On parle de puissance.. Moins que x men 3 mais beaucoup plus dark et impactant !En conclusion il est un excellent cru tu devrais te lancer ! Tout ce qu'il faut pour réveiller la Femme qui est en toi ""Laetitia fondatrice des L-Women !"" vu 2 fois",1
179,"Loved, loved, loved, X-men 1 and 2. The others were nice, but with this one, all hope is lost, X-men franchise died, i stop wathing x-men from now on.",0
181,a whole disgrace. not much to say here except this movie shouldn't have been made,0
183,Trash movie. The worst in the series for sure. Girl has daddy issues. No super villain just an X-Men angry about what happened to her. I couldn't finish watching boring as hell. 2/10 Final. Don't bother with it.,0
184,This movie fills me with such rage that I cannot express myself with any rational thought.,0
186,"X-men Dark Phoenix is probably the best X-men movie until date, in terms of action. I would give it a 9.1 out of 10 in action. The story was more or less. In it we see how Jean Grey adjusts to her new powers that came with the Phoenix force, but she can’t seem to control them, thus leading to her hurting the people surrounding her and the ones she loves the most. It was kind of interesting to see that, but the villain was the most generic one I’ve ever seen in a movie or series, so that lowers the quality of the story, since she is one of the main characters. In terms of story give a 4 out of 10. The characters are very well used in the story. Every single one fits its role in the movie perfectly. No one has more screen time than he/she should have, considering the story is based on Jean Grey and kind of the decisions of Charles Xavier. At first we get a glance of their powers and then they go all out with it, it’s so well done, and we get to know just enough more of each character. So in terms of character it has a 7.4 out of 10. I think it was a worthy enough ending for the Fox X-men saga.So my final score for this movie is 6.8/10.",1
187,"The worst X-Men movie ever. Say whatever you want about Last Stand and Origins Wolverine, at least those had things going on. In this movie, nothing happens, it was just boring and painful to watch. Every character has nothing to do in this movie, no character has any believable motivation or personality (let's not even talk about the villain, how could they make a villain worse than Malekith or Steppenwolf, seriously, I had to look at the credits to even know its name). Horrible dialogue full of clichés. The editing is choppy and the visual effects look so bad at many points. And the makeup...Ignoring Mystique's obviously lazy makeup work, everyone else looks bad, like Nightcrawler and Beast. As I said noone has anything to do: Mystique and Quicksilver barely appear in the movie, and any other character that is not Magneto, Beast or Cyclops does literally nothing. The acting was so bad. Every actor is just there for a paycheck, noone seem interested in what they were doing (With Sophie Turner and, maybe Michael Fassbender being exceptions because they...tried. Not saying their performance was good but they tried). Once again critizing the screenplay: It is so confusing that for most of the movie I didn't know what was going on, or why did this character do this or anything.The worst part of all is that this is the last X-Men movie (Yeah, New Mutants is coming, but I'm refering to the main series, also, I feel that New Mutants will be bad too). It is sooooo anticlimatic, it's the complete opposite of Endgame: Instead of being a great conclusion, with a great battle, an emotional death of an important character, with tons of fanservice, we get nothing of that. This is the worst X-Men movie and one of the worst I've seen in the year. It's a complete trainwreck. It doesn't get a 0 because at least I could watch it, a 0 is reserved for those movies that I can't even watch in a single viewing.",0
188,"Quem escreve esses roteiros???Muito decepcionante. Eu não sei como uma franquia pode se perder tanto assim, de verdade.O roteiro é pobre. Não temos um vilão cativante, cujo a justificativa para o que está fazendo é nula. Tipo, literalmente nula. Não há quase nenhum background, nada que possamos nos basear ou minimamente entender. Fora as frases genéricas de ""sua emoção lhe faz fraca"", sim, sim. Falou o E.T super racional que quer aniquilar a humanidade e nem sabe o porque.Quanto as atuações, são medianas [Com um roteiro desses, sair do mediano é pedir muito do ator, que trabalha na artificialidade], com um claro destaque ao Michael Fassbender e James Mcavoy, cujo são fantásticos de qualquer jeito. É muito triste ver atores talentosíssimos sendo desperdiçados dessa maneira, mas ok.Os efeitos especiais são excelentes e fazem jus ao orçamento, mas como quase todo filme de herói tem isso de sobra, não devia se esperar menos. A OST está presente no filme, de maneira que é sim notável, mas não faz a diferença que poderia [dando mais peso a cena ou algo do tipo].Como conclusão: me parece que esse filme quer mais mostrar seus efeitos especiais que uma historia de verdade. O roteiro trabalha na artificialidade e subestima o publico. É uma pena que esse universo de filmes acabe assim, sendo que podia ser bem melhor.",0

190,"X-Men: Dark Phoenix marks the end of a great franchise that lasted 19 years. Granted The New Mutants will be the last X-Men Movie from 20th Century Fox, but this was the last installment in the mainline franchise. X-Men: Dark Phoenix was one of the greatest movies of 2019 in my opinion, I was more than impressed with the talent in this film and I thought it was a sad way to end the series, literally sad as in emotional. I’m happy they showed us the true potential of Dark Phoenix in this explosive finale! I’m very upset that this movie got panned for absolutely no reason at all.",1
192,Boring movie. The worst xmen movie ever.It was the same like xmen 3 story but this has not any sense. Mystique dead by a bunch of wooden stakes??? Really?? Why people have them in their houses?,0
193,"Безвкусное, скучное и жалкое завершение целой эпохи когда-то великих кинокомиксов от FOX.",0
194,"Probably nothing is more important to mention about this movie than the fact that it’s becoming increasingly obvious that Sophie Turner starred in this role in order to slap Conan O’Brien in the face.The entire marketing campaign leading up to its wide release would suggest that Dark Phoenix is a trainwreck, a remake of a really bad movie made by the SAME DIRECTOR 13 years ago that no one was expecting or asking for, that got shoved back four months from a quiet, sleepy release date in November of 2018 just before Oscar season with no real competitors because of a need for reshoots on account of the script was bad and then because it apparently so generic that it copied entire scenes from other superhero movies put out at the same time by its parent company (there’s another insane element to the delay of this film’s release where James Cameron kicked it into the jaws of summer in order to protect his project Alita that I find so cruel it’s almost funny). Director Kinberg admits that the end of Dark Phoenix looked a whole lot like Captain America: Winter Soldier in the way that the mutants had were pitted against one another, but also like Captain Marvel in the way the space scenes (and in the maybe clever future connection to the Marvel universe, but equally just lazily written shapeshifting Skrull-esque villains), but also a lot like Infinity Wars with her mini Snappening, which just leads you to wonder if they were conscious of how much their film looked like it had stayed up for an all-nighter and then just cribbed off of every Marvel movie made in the last eighteen months, why didn’t they change it?The Hollywood Reporter also talks about how this film was never meant to be a summer blockbuster, but doesn’t mention it in the form of autopsy or eulogy for the film that could have been. It talks about Dark Phoenix as a film with humbler stakes, smaller scope, a corrective to the disaster of Apocalypse. Friend says that Apocalypse clumsily tried to phoenix Jean Gray in the final boss fight, which everyone promptly forgets in order to make this movie even possible. Matthew Vaughn, who’s been making the rounds for some of his future projects while the **** of criticism for this film really ramps up, pulled back the curtain a little on the reboot in order to show what could have been, his alternate story boarding of the franchise, his desire to recast Wolverine for a younger actor, quaint notes for an innocent time before X-Men had crossed the point of no return.I can see the merits of both sides on the film. Much, much smarter people embrace the (un)canny legacy of the Dark Phoenix storyline and its retelling as an icon of female empowerment. At the same time, the ensemble cast feels at once past due and also distractingly new. Turner is only in her second film in the franchise, whereas Lawrence, Fassbender, and MacAvoy have been in three or four, right? The effect is one of the unrequited familiarity of a distant relative comforting the orphaned child of the recently deceased at a funeral. Jean and Cyclops have a budding romance, but we’ve only really seen their chemistry over the span of about fifteen or twenty minutes before he–rudely–asks her to “Come back to me” like a wayward dog. Mystique gamely chides Prof X, “the women are always saving the men around here,” which leads one to momentarily wonder if that’s actually true or just what an X-Woman is supposed to say in 2019 to get a rise out of the Sad Puppies who are going to **** about this movie no matter what because it dares to tell a story from a woman’s perspective.Most of my issues with the film are a lot pettier than the content... There’s a weirdly large amount of dialogue devoted to whether or not someone can read your mind: “I can’t read her mind now,” “turn up the power on my mind reading machine,” “she’s blocking my ability to read her mind,” “I didn’t need to read your mind,” “you’re not the only one who can read minds,” you get the point. And for a movie whose original intentions were to dramatize teenage angst about being queer, the sexuality of these stories is pretty hetero. Practically every man and woman is paired off. At times it seems like maybe there are too few women to fight over, so dudes magnanimously share one instead. Never thought something could make you nostalgic for anything Bryan Singer has ever done, but… no still no.Watching this with my dad was a bittersweet end of an era, but not altogether unpleasant.... It’s strange to think about the random steps that end up defining the movies that make up your childhood, so I know that not everyone will enjoy this one, but if you’re of a certain age, and you remember your dad taking you to those first few films with Hallie Berry with all the cheesy special effects, it might bring some solace to return to this film to say goodbye.",0
195,"The storytelling here was just so incredibly un-imaginitive that the movie and the actors couldn't help but give up.  It's pretty clear in the first ten minutes of the film that everyone involved gave up.It's fine to deviate from the source material as long as you're taking it in interesting new directions.  Here they deviated from the source material in the most cliched way possible and the result was it just never grabbed the audience's interest to begin with.  None of the actors were going to be able save it.  Nothing was new and everyone was bored; The audience, the actors, the director, bored bored bored.And I hate to say it but Sophie Turner just can't carry a movie herself.  She was dreadful.  She is better suited as a character actor in a fairly narrow range.",0
196,"This film is without a doubt the worst I have ever had the displeasure of having to sit through in my life. Jean Grey is supposed to be one of the most powerful beings in existence & yet all she can do correctly is die over & over again? Ridiculous! This is why Scarlet Witch is better, this film flopped for a reason, don't waste your time on it. 0 barz.",0
197,"People think this movie is **** but it is good as f**k! I love the action, and overall has a good plot for it having to be modified so much.",1
198,It wasn't nowhere near the crapfest most of the reviewers are saying it is. I put it in my top 5 X-Men movies. The only thing that throws it off is that it has a cheap kinda quality to it and the costumes sucked. Sophie Turner is a great Jean Grey. I really think it should've been a two part movie,1
199,"Extremely upset, I went to watch this movie with my expectation up there, and it comes out extremely disappointed.The movie is just another generic movie, not much new, the actors are disinterested, Simon Kimberg didn't know what to do right.Bottom line: The movie is bad, the script is rotten, the direction doesn't exist. Let's pretend this movie just doesn't exist",0
201,"X-Men: Dark Phoenix, an end to an eraThe Stream: The movie is a bit predictable, lacks originality and the end leaves you a little empty.The Big Screen: The movie looks great on the big screen particularly in action sequences.The Final Bill: Being the end of an era, X-Men fans should catch it in the theaters and general watchers should watch the other movies first and then consider a matinee, if you have free time.No after credit scene. Parents be warned that unlike the other 3 movies PG-13 is accurate with some language and violence towards the end.-S2SStream to Big Screen is back at it again. This week we will be reviewing the long awaited, X-Men: Dark Phoenix. The fourth, and final, movie of this recent X-Men reboot. A movie marking a last for 21st Century Fox films with the X-Men due to the Disney/Marvel acquisition. The third movie of the series had mixed reviews but ultimately was very entertaining. Let’s see if Dark Phoenix arose from the ashes for one last flight.Let’s dive deep into the ashes. I wouldn’t say that there are elements of this movie that are bad, just ones that were lacking. The movie is missing some minor detail that would lead you to say, “Oh, that right there was on point.” Even in the ending, the viewer just feels like the movie was good, but something was missing. I’m not sure what 21st Century Fox and director, Simon Kinberg, were thinking when they looked at the product as a whole. Looking back on it, the movie made you feel like when you pick up your cup expecting orange juice, but actually you picked up the wrong cup and drank apple juice. It’s still healthy for you and it quenched your thirst to a degree, but it wasn’t the taste you expected.On top of that, this movie is too eerily similar to X-Men: The Last Stand. Too many elements of the movie made me feel as if I was watching a reboot of Last Stand rather than it’s own independent movie. No seriously, the plot was similar, except the stupid cure aspect. With that said, Dark Phoenix is actually a better version of Last Stand. This may be the reason why the movie feels like it’s lacking originality, but ultimately the movie is just too predictable on its own. This may also be because of the movie trailer. The movie trailer was very good, but also gives away too much. The movie did hide a couple secrets from the viewers, which were worth it, but again execution was lacking. Finally, the director let the movie live in flashbacks too much. An issue not too horrible, but we got the point of the flashbacks the first time we saw them. The 5th time was understood, but just too much.Now, the part that you’ve been waiting for. This movie looks like they spent a $200 million budget. The scenes seem to literally jump off the screen at times. The scene that was in space look great and the action scenes are very clear and well cgi-ed, except for some running and flying. Unlike the previous installments, the movie’s action towards the end is closer to a John Wick film than X-Men. Quite welcomed, even though it’s short lived.The storyline, while predictable, still was executed well, except the ending of the franchise. We take a ride with the X-Men every step of the way. Just like the movie jumps off the screen, so do the emotions we feel. Sansa, while not a great actress, displays a nice depiction of a person drinking in /falling prey to power, yet keeping true to who we’ve known her character to be. James McAvoy, again does a good job, but the movie missed an opportunity to truly use Michael Fassbender. Clearly, the producers were featuring the Queen of the North, but they could have still taken advantage of the star talent in the cast. Lastly, the movie has a little comedy in it, compared to the previous installments, but the few chuckles were good.Long story short, X-Men: Dark Phoenix is a solid movie, but is just lacking a little in execution that would make you say it was a great movie. For fans of the series, you should see this through to the end and the action scenes will make it worth a matinee price. For everyone else, go check out the previous installments first, and then consider seeing the movie during an early matinee.",1
202,"Это просто позорнейший финал великой серии. Я не думал что можно сделать эпичный сюжет хуже апокалипсиса, но нет, из этого фильма убрали даже остатки логики. Нет смысла ни в одном диалоге. Как актеры подписались на такую залуппу не понимаю. Если сравнивать фильмы из этой серии, то ""дни минувшего будущего"" это 10 а СранныйФеникс - 1!",0
203,"Sigh... just no! Mediocre writing, performed by a mediocre Dark Phoenix, resulting in a mediocre movie. What a shame. Cut out and mentally delete the anti men brainfart of Ms Lawrence and most of the so called ""woke"" force is kinda out, but that still doesnt make this a decent movie. I really enjoyed Sophie Turner in her character on GOT, but really didnt like her in this movie. I hope things will turn better in future parts or I will have to start ignoring work with her involvement.",0

206,"My gf thought plotline was a little weak but i saw her in suspense. Truth is i was captivated more. The sheer pressure of suppressed memories being able to generate such a destabilizing force it destroys yourself is familiar to me. The selflessness in the sacrifice made followed by the intense struggle, basically a life and death struggle, was almost impossible to turn away from. Seeing such a strong person struggle enhanced my respect for everyone going through the motions. My gf and I had a rough life and I'm sure we both learned something here.  I can look past the aliens and see what they did here. The Phoenix that flew over Charles and magneto in the end gave me goosebumps. Although this movie seems to be criticized I saw some unique points of view in this movie that are achievements on it's own and therefore I give a solid 9. This chapter was welcome and necessary. I think many lessons are hidden in this movie, and in this day and age of superficial friendships this is the one that is able to add the depth human relations so often need. Great work, this movie is a sacrifice in itself",1
207,1/10 * Sah erst gut aus im Trailer aber als ich den Film angeschaut habe war ich sehr enttäuscht. Hab es mir ganz anders vorgestellt. Der Film war zu lw. Schade.,0
208,"It boggles my mind that so many people are giving this movie such bad reviews and ratings. Personally loved it! The love story between Jean and Scott was phenomenal. They made the story and backgrounds to it perfect, but there could have been a little tweaks here and there. All in all perfect movie. At the end I do kinda want a little bit more explanation about Jean and where she went after send the alien and herself into space, and sacrificing herself to save everyone. I'm pushing for the next movie to come and and possibly bringing Jean back. I would love to see the love story between Scott and Jean continue.",1
