0,I think the word 'masterpiece'is going a bit far but Joker is an amazing film. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get the best actor oscar award there really is no justice; he's that good.,1
1,Ladies and gentlemen!!! THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. It is an INCREDIBLE origin story. One of the best movies based on a comic character. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is SPECTACULAR! Thank you Todd Phillips for bringing us this shocking story.,1
2,"Joker is one of those rare movies that my only regret in watching it is that I can never watch it again for the first time. That being said, I'm not sure when if ever I could watch it again as it's such an exhausting experience. And I mean that in a good way. One of the best movies of this century so far.",1
3,A must watch movie of the year especially the month (October).Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a masterpiece.Robert De Niro's acting was also mind blowing.,1
4,"This wasnt a superhero film, and thank God it wasnt!!Joker is, by far the darkest and most tragic story in all of the DC universe.  Not only was it respectable to the source material, everything in the movie reflected what The Joker is, when you take Batman out of the story.  Fair warning:  the film is very graphic.  It holds nothing back.  Also dont expect a special fx show.  This is a sit down and shut up flick.  This is a film about madness, illness and sadness.",1
5,I generally agree with Metacritic's movie score over Rotten Tomatoes but not this time. Forget the paid critics biased views of Joker and go and see one of the best movies of this century and maybe the last.,1
6,"Joker is a hard film to love but an easy one to admire. As many others have commented, it is a very grim watch with only a few moments of gallows humor to lift the tension. That being said, I would urge any lover of cinema to see it. At least once.",1
7,"Joker is deep, immaculate, powerful, and triumphant as you witness Joaquin Phoenix giving the Oscar winning performance of his entire career as the Clown Prince of Crime in 1970’s unforgiving Gotham City. All thanks to Todd Phillips’ inspiration from Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, it is safe to say that this film is one of those films that will be talked about for a very long time. And there is no doubt that Joker can deliver a mature fish out of water story that is dark and psychologically brooding that every comic book fan needs to see. May the future of DC Black begin…",1
8,"the new “Joker” is totally worth to be considered as the best of DC’s movies now. gorgeous, breathtaking, horrifying but amazing.",1
9,"The film is an excellent story of origin, departs from comics, and allows you to see the psychology of the character. You can also see that it has enough similarity with the current era in some attitudes quite well reflected. It is a movie to feel and think.",1
10,"Felt like more of an Arthur Fleck movie than a Joker movie. But in this case I think that worked in its favor. Honestly, when compared to other ""gritty"" and ""grounded"" dc comic book movies, this one actually works and is better than most. But, if you are going to compare it to something like taxi driver? Well then it's just average. It has some issues but nothing glaring. Overall I think everything works well. Not blown away but impressed.",1
11,"We truly do live in a societyBut in all seriousness, this movie was amazing. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. It had me shaking and disturbed for a long time after I left the cinema, and that can only be the mark of a great movie.",1
12,Unrelentingly bleak but absolutely captivating. There's really nothing more that I can add to the praise it's already garnered. Go see.,1
13,There’s no word describe how amazing this movie is. This man deserves an award for this role. The real Joker is back!,1
14,"Es una obra maestra absoluta, olvida los comentarios negativos, la pelicula no es aburrida y la actuación de Phoenix es, excepcional.",1
15,"Gives a view of the darkest the world can be and builds up well to the worst day someone can have with that dark life, which births the Joker. Doesn’t glorify violence, (spoilers) with the main character being initially hesitant to take a gun from a coworker (first 10 mins of the movie) and he expected says he doesn’t have any political stance and just manages to fall into place because of the public’s reaction. Not a movie I’m planning on seeing a millions times in my life because of it being so hard to watch someone fall like the Joker does, but it’s a movie that needs an award. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don’t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie.",1
16,"Having just finished watching, I am stunned to say the least. Jaquines' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. As unfortunate event after unfortunate event baraded the Joker leading to circumstantial wrong-doings, I truly felt for the character, while also being aware that his actions were wrong. Amidst the action packed superhero movies presented today (and as much as I do enjoy those as well) this movie is truly in a league of it's own.  Joker takes the lore and characters we have grown to love and revere as immeasurable beings, and throws it in your face as an all too real, true to life possibility.",1
17,"I find it somehow disturbing, yet undeniable amazing. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in both being a normal person with bad days and the Joker, the one we are familiar with.",1
18,"One of the best performance by Joaquin, Bold and intense storytelling makes this one terrific and influential. Cinematography and set pieces were almost great. Don't miss this one",1
19,"Joaquin Phoenix shines in this dark character study about one of the most popular comic book villains. The slow but rewarding direction is accompanied by an eerie score that fits perfectly with Joaquins Oscar worthy performance and will leave audiences feeling disturbed and uneasy,  exactly how the joker should make one feel.",1
20,"Great movie, it touches the themes of mental illness well, and the necessity of escaping pain by suicide.. That some people feels, this is a different joker, who is trying to accept his cruel life.. Great movie, only bad aspect is that it ends in a weird way.",1
21,Amazing and beautifully haunting film. Joaquin Phoenix oscar worthy performance in another level.,1
22,"Is a joke not everyone gets.The critic can't decide if is good or not, so is up to you.",1
23,The most disturbing movie ever made. It is seriously a must-see and the critic reviews lie.,1
24,Joaquin Phoenix gave extraordinary acting in depth as well as Tood Philips who was able to make the Joker the person I know best through his films.,1
25,Don't listen to the critics who don't know the difference between art and reality. Go and watch the movie and make your own opinion.Joker is a masterpiece and JOAQUIN PHONEIX deserves all best actor awards of the year.,1
26,"I went into this film knowing two things, the score from Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir (friend of Johann and Chernobyl musical genius) meant the tone of this film was going to be glum at best and Phoenix throwing himself into all his roles would undoubtedly deliver. Both of things for me at least were spot on.The story is desperately sad if not a little predictable, my only really gripe being  the use of on screen notes to move the plot along at times, I find trying to nail which part I am meant to be reading takes the immersion out a little and I’m pretty sure It happens on at least three occasions. Acting across the board is fantastic; I can understand why Phoenix has been called out by some reviewers but for my mind the Joker is meant to be over acted and his slow descent into madness is perfectly executed.Overall this feels like the sort of film you end up studying in English class, there is a lot to take in and you will have questions come the end. Not everyone will love this as it can plod a little at times but it’s a needed plot that adds to the overall mood of the film.",1
27,Beautiful piece of art the acting the shots the intensity I was focused on the screen through out the whole movie,1
28,"This was farthest thing from what you expect from a ""superhero"" universe type movie. Even if this movie had a different title and stood alone it would have been just as great! The writing was absolutely amazing. The mood set for the different scenes and the slow uptick of this movie was absolutely on point. Phoenix deserves every accolade possible for this stunning portrayal. Would reccomend for anyone tha appreciates deep writing, dialogue amd the classic sense of how a truly timeless movie is put together!!!",1
29,"Joker Movie is a dark and emotional movie that hides behind the laughter of Joker . A disturbing movie but powerful performance by Joaquin Phoenix is the beginning of new era.It is one of the best example on flim making... Pure art work with camera( Less VFX expenditure)Take a bow Todd Phillips for your excellent execution. Inspite of Todd Phillips's confirmation that Joaquin's joker won't meet Pattinson's Batman, I believe Todd and Joaquin,Both should reconsider their decision to unleash full potential performance against Robert's batman. Because joker needs batman in order to show his full potential. This movie is ""the raise of the joker.""",1
30,"uma obra impecável e simplesmente perfeita, joaquin vc é lendário, taca um oscar nessalenda",1
31,"Uma obra de arte! Perturbador e encantador ao mesmo tempo, necessário para nosso tempo.",1
32,"Данный фильм не рекомендуется любителем экшена, любителем комедий и прочей лабуды, фильм реально тяжелый, я был на третьем сеансе мировой премьеры, видел улыбающихся и смеющихся людей, которые заходили в зал с огромным количества еды.Я то знал на какой фильм пошел, а вот большинство зрителей увы нет, и моему удивлению не было предела когда на 20 минуте фильма и до самого конца, я не услышал ни одного звука в зале, люди смотрели закрыв рот, забыв про свою жратву. Теперь о фильме, повторюсь фильм тяжелый если в него вникать, а вам придется это сделать иначе вы не поймете фильм, это не Marvel, не каких глупых шуток и сисько-жопного юмора, но свой юмор все таки есть, в этом фильме всего около 15 выстрелов из револьвера. Игра Феникса на уровне, я не такой критик что бы как то дать оценку, этот Джокер хороший ответ Джокеру Хита, в гримме данный Джокер выглядит на много круче Леджера, один минус это акер дубляжа, хотел бы я посмотреть его в оригинале, и обязательно посмотрю. Моя оценка 10/10, возможно даже больше, фанатам DC фильм зайдет и тем кто попытается в него вникнуть.",1
33,"Truly spectacular! It's been SO LONG since I've seen a movie with QUALITY, something that makes you think, something that's different and as creative as this. Honestly... just when I was starting to lose faith in the movie industry this comes along and blows me away, it gave me that feeling of ""finally! A movie we've been desperately needing in the age of reboots and remakes and remasters and live cartoon adaptations and political correctness BS"" this is the direction the movie industry has to go and keep going. It's exactly what I personally always wanted as a Joker movie, a character study analysis about a broken man. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an award for his performance he killed it and honestly crushes all the previous Joker's that came before him that we've seen on screen and that's a huge statement. That laugh will send chills of disturbances down your spine every single time. It's a mix of sadness, confusion and just downright creepy I will even dare to say it's better than Mark Hamill's laugh. Make of that what you will. Acting? Superb!! Atmosphere and tone was perfect for this style of movie very depressing. Story? I won't spoil but it is very engaging, makes you think and you definitely feel for the Arthur. You'll be asking yourself questions even after the credits roll. No post credits by the way so don't sit through it. Music is a huge plus the composer really made the perfect soundtrack for such a film, she captures the mood and mentality of Arthur with every key note played a real treat. Loved it, I don't care what anyone says this is a 10/10 to me. If you love the Joker, or just a very good thriller about a broken man - watch this you won't regret it. Also - the snowflakes crying about wanting this banned because of violence? Ha... there was hardly any. I think other movies are worse in that regard, more drama than action if anything so no it won't promote a mass shooting or anything like that if anything it helps raise awareness on helping the mentally ill. Don't believe the fake news and mass hysteria, do yourself a favor - watch it and make your own judgement.Joaquin Phoenix man... that guy never fails to impress.",1
34,The movie is an absolute masterpiece.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is OSCAR worthy as well,1
35,"Lived up to the hype, loved it, don’t listen to critics, they’re idiots, they got scared of this film, hence why the rating is low",1
36,Great movie! Sometimes I feel these so called critics do not know a good movie and good acting even if it slaps them in the face.,1
37,"That's beautiful. Лучше фильма в наше время, с такой актерской игрой вы не найдете.",1
38,"Um filme perturbador porém INCRÍVEL!!, Joaquin Phoenix fez mais do que um ótimo trabalho, o filme está impecável, sinto que o Oscar é de vocês.",1
39,"An amazingly well crafted masterpiece with perfect acting, great story, thrilling moments, great camera and actual deep message. Phoenix is perfect for the role and his depiction of a joker may be the best i have ever seen.BTW: go see the movie dont let yourself fool by urinalist ""professional"" critics who started their campaign to denigrate the movie almost right after the first trailer. Remember those same people think that utter trash garbage like the last jedi or captain marvel were good movies. So go to see the Joker its the best movie about comic book character in many years",1
40,"Gorgeous film, haunting score and a pretty incredible performance from Joaquin Phoenix. It's a slow burn, and I can definitely see where the film will turn a lot of people off, but I really liked it. ﻿",1
41,"A fantastic film that is visually and thematically well crafted. It effectively develops the idea that monsters are made, not born and asks the question, ""why is anyone surprised that a society that routinely goes out of its way to antagonize its undesirables helps birth monsters?""",1
42,"I've always had an affinity for Batman movies, even the bad ones. But, this wasn't a ""Batman"" movie, obviously,  and I read no reviews and went in with no expectations, except one. I was postive that they picked the wrong guy for the Joker. I was hilariously wrong. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was unmercifully perturbing and left me, for the first time, connecting with a criminally insane character, whose makeup is far more complex than that of a murderous clown. This depiction of the Joker could stand all on its own, and maybe will. But, after leaving the theater, I have a desire not to leave the transcience of this sorrowful film there.",1
43,"Mind BlowingJoker is intense, sinister, intelligent, tremendously acted, and brilliantly written.",1
44,"Joker is a bloody masterpiece. It's ominous yet beautiful, terrifying but satisfying with subtle easter eggs from the DC Comics. Joaquin Phoenix embodies the characters of Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin, Tyler Durden and Patrick Bateman to give a once in a lifetime performance thereby making it one of the most intense and gripping watch I've had in recent memory.",1
45,"A cinema masterpiece to be passed on through the ages.  Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker is on par with Heath Ledger in my opinion.  From the subtle expressions to the immense tension building throughout the movie, one could almost forget that this movie is set in the Batman universe.  The movie is able to stand on its own expressing a tragedy through amazing story telling and character development (or rather descent).  An excellent recommendation for movie goers.  You get what you deserve and we all deserve this considering the modern day agendas.",1
46,An amazing piece of cinema which I would recommend to everyone. Very smart reflection on Humanity and Society and a Great Joker portrayal. 10/10,1
47,Just a fantastic movie. Joaquin Phoenix did a wonderful job as Joker and the movie overall is beautifully crafted. The writing was brilliant and the acting had true heart and soul poured into it. An absolute masterpiece and a must see.,1
48,Masterpiece. A work of art. Completely blown away. Great acting. Spectacular film.,1
49,Amazing piece of cinema as a stand-alone film. Even better as a part of the DC universe. DC movies always seem to be amazing when grounded in gritty reality in some Christopher Nolan-esque way. This certainly delivers. Brave departure from the current uninteresting pop cinema DCEU that has destroyed the legacy that man of steel and Chris Nolan’s Batman left. A well deserved 10. The only 2 criticisms being a small segment of hammy acting at the “interview” scene (later completely forgotten after the culmination!) and that the back story between the train and riots should have been Developed a little betterdeveloped between the,1
50,"Amazing acting and origin story for the joker, pulls from multiple comics and ties it together well.",1
51,"Dark , gritty , disturbing , bad vibes , masterpiece and phenomenal acting by joaquin phoenix.",1
52,"Not only is the Joker the best comic book adaptation on film I have ever seen, it is by far the best film of 2019 I've seen. The moments that gave me chills were the scene when Arthur is holding little Bruce's face and then when he is in the stairwell with his mother's medical chart and verifies everything Tom Wayne told me was true about his mother. Learning everything he thought he knew was a lie and the anger that grew within him that bought him to such disillusionment with his world it made him kill the one person he most loved in his world and turn him into the psychopathic killer. Her death killed Arthur Fleck and reincarnated him into the Joker. The twist with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz ) was brilliant and totally unexpected.Wow. This film was like a Greek Tragedy play. This is the film I wish all other comic book movies were modeled after. Nothing is over the top, everything is plausible in this realistic world. No super powers or grandiose schemes. Arthur Fleck is just a regular man like the Waynes, but without the fortunes of the Waynes. Just a man who beleaguered with abuse, lies, manipulation and misfortune that snaps into the killer he becomes.I did not want the movie to end because I loved it so much. My bladder was at the point of bursting but I did not want to leave my seat and miss a thing. This is a titanium scribed A++. It is rare I think of any movie as a perfect 10 out of 10, but this movie hit that score. I was left thinking about this film hours after I left the theater. DC Black finally blew away everything Marvel had out of the water with this film. All thanks to a super talented film director and one of the best actors of our era Joaquin Phoenix. If the Oscars don't see it fit to grant him an award, then the Oscars have no redeeming value.",1
53,"Joker, has a great focus on the madness of the human being himself. A journey that takes you to the life of Arthur Fleck, a deranged man who lives in a city completely full of hate. The plot twist keeps you at the edge of the seat, the movie knows how to generate different emotions and in the end you just want to see it again. Of the best movies in the year.",1
54,Masterful movie with an absolutely amazing performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Really is a massive condemnation of modern society and the sjw mobs that are always looking for a punching bag. Condemnation on current societal dislike of kindness and forgiveness in current western society.,1
55,"This is a film that masterfully presents what it proposes to do.  With a right dose at every point in the movie, and a highlight for Joaquin Phoenix's frighteningly spectacular acting, this movie will not only be a milestone in the history of comic book adaptations, but also as an influence on other genres.  Simply a spectacle!",1
56,"The Joker is an entertaining movie and its depiction of the titular character was compelling from begging to end.  Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding and will be remembered as on of the better Joker performances. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat when it comes to its themes and what it wants to say.It seems like it wants us to be on the side of the working class. After all, the joker is a working class man who's issues are exacerbated by the upperclass. The government cut funding to mental health services, leaving him without his therapist and medication. Thomas Wayne seems uncaring and critical of the poor and even his celebrity hero made jokes at his expense.  Following the Joker's actions, you can see how the class divide came to a head with the working class finally having enough of the oppression of the upper class and want social change.However, this falls apart when you consider the actions of the Joker and rioters. The Joker, while more sympathetic in this iteration, is still a psychopathic killer and he is propped up as the hero of the working class. The working class started rioting and one even murders the Waynes in the alley as a form of revenge on the upper class. If the film wants us to take the side of the working class as the ones being taken advantage of, it failed.  The upperclass were **** but the working class are dangerous criminals. This isn't helped by the fact that the movie showed the murder of the Waynes. We all know what will become of young Bruce. He becomes the hero of Gotham.  He is also the top 1% Billionaire playboy. So eventually the hero of Gotham will be a rich man saving Gotham from people like his parent's murderer, who happens to be a poor and angry at the rich.Even if the movie wanted to try to take a 'both sides' argument, it fails because the  actions of the working class were way worse than the actions of the upperclass.  The upperclass are the ones getting murdered in the streets. The working class are the ones idolising a killer clown. It seems very one sided.",1
57,This movie is must watch movie for all joker fans. Phoenix performance and the story will just blow up your mind. It even show the situation for a person becoming voilant.for conclusions watch it if you are 18+.,1
58,Really an amazing movie of DC. Amazing performance of joker(Joaquin Phoenix).It's a must watch flim.,1
59,"In a year full of mediocre films and some mediocre comic book films, Joker is a HUGE breath of fresh air. Joker is a fantastic film and a fantastic comic book film. Although the film is great, there are a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, most of those issues are spoiler related so I can’t talk about them. The one I can talk about is that the film does sometimes borrow a little too much from the films it is inspired by, Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1983). If you have seen either of those films and watch Joker then you will know what I am talking about. Other than that and my spoiler related issues, the film is almost perfect. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as the Joker. You can barely recognize that it is him because he just disappears into this role. The way Joaquin Phoenix shows this slow downfall of his character is incredible. Robert De Niro also does a fantastic job with his limited role. He’s cold, calculating, and manipulative and it’s perfect. The sequence of events that the film portrays is perfect. It doesn’t quickly get to the “Joker” but spends most of the film showing the slow downfall of his character. The film does this to perfection. This film is incredibly dark. There are multiple moments in the film that your jaw just drops at what happens. The film uses violence to its advantage. The scenes where it is used in adds to the already huge amount of tension that has been built up which leads me to my next point, Joker is incredibly tense. There are multiple moments where events are slowly building up and you are just on the edge of your seat waiting for the climax of that scene and when it happens, it feels super satisfying. The score for this film is amazing also. Hildur Guðnadóttir has so many outstanding compositions that adds to the tension and gives us an insight into Arthur’s mind. The cinematography is surprisingly really good. It always provides a way to show us how Arthur is feeling while also getting other necessary shots. Joker is a film that has to be experienced on its own. Ignore the controversy behind it and try not to pay too much attention to the critic reviews. You have to see the film and depending on how you feel the film portrays issues like violence and mental illness will determine if you like it or not. Overall, Joker is exactly what comic book films needed with a breathtaking performance from Joaquin Phoenix and an interesting, dark, and realistic approach  into an iconic character. I give Joker a 9.5/10.",1
60,"Film of the year!It shows a realistic decline of a mentally ill and poor man who was bullied, abused and had one bad thing after another happen to him. He really doesn’t start out as evil or vile. His struggles are real and he is a “throw away”, citizen. Overlooked and ignored. The movie is thought provoking and brings to light how a society “helps” and treats our less fortunate, “unimportant “ citizens. An action packed, comic book feel.",1
61,"The suffering the Joker endures is aplenty in today's world. Most Jokers choose to commit suicide, this is the story of a Joker who instead lashed out.The attitude of the sneering upper classes is also aplenty in today's world. Evident in the hostile, contemptuous, slur ridden reviews of The Joker released by elite publications.Art imitates life.",1
62,"Although I will certainly need to rewatch this film to think about it even more, after first viewing, Joker is a haunting, deep, and dark film experience that will stick with you for a long time. Phoenix's acting, while slightly over-the-top at points, is excellent, while the rest of the cast's performance is really great as well. The first act drags a little bit but is more than made up for by the solid second and truly masterful third act that will leave you breathless and terrified walking out of the theater. I would see this movie for the third act and climax alone. On top of that, the gritty 70s-inspired Gotham, Phillips' directing, many poignant themes, and soundtrack (specifically score) are truly amazing. Albeit not a perfect movie, Joker is a film experience that will send shivers down your spine more than any horror movie these days and stick with you for years to come. I have never walked out of a theater more shaken than after this movie.",1
63,"Ótimo para os padrões do gênero, Joaquin Phoenix está dando o sangue na atuação e entregando um estudo de personagem que as adaptações de quadrinhos raramente possuem.",1
64,"very good movieJoker is not a movie that suits everyone.  Especially those who are stressed or depressed  And it's not an action hero movie  And there are a lot of violent scenes in the movie  The movie will take you deep from the first scene.

66,"Coming from the dude who made the hangover films (which I dont think highly of) I was surprised to see joker, not watching any trailers I was surprised with the final product. Acting was amazing. Cinematography was phenomenal. However the major flaw to this film is the pacing. It jumped alot and there were moments where I asked myself why this part was important. Lots of slow mo wide shots pan the film tine to reach over the 2 hour mark. Its action is intense which is brilliant. Watch it",1
67,I quite enjoyed the performance  of Joaquin Phoenix and his creepy and twisted way of acting.The story was amazing and filmed in a really elegant and inspiring way.Even in the very end we are not quite sure if what just happened was real or just a part of his imagination.I left the cinema stunned and quite confused  but after 20 minutes i started figuring things out more and more about  why i felt confused and finally got the true meaning of the joker.That for me makes this one of the best movies of this year.,1

70,"Que podemos decir de la participación de Joaquin Phoenix como joker, es la mejor una de las mejores adaptaciones de este personaje",1
71,"A brutally honest and heightened diatribe against the cruelty and laziness of the mental health support in our society today. A full-throat battle cry against injustice and the cruel circumstance of fate. A blistering, punishing, character study of a good-hearted but diseased mind as it quickly deteriorates. The second half of Joker is cinematic nirvana, frequently chilling, unsettling, fascinating, and harrowing. Todd Philips has finally directed something visionary and unforgettable. The best thing DC has done since The Dark Knight.",1
72,"From beginning to end the movie is an emotional crescendo. There's not one scene without a strong emotion being felt. This movie is a masterpiece and will go down as one of, if not the best movie of this decade. To each is own interpretation of the movie. First time in my life that I go bacj to the cinema to rewatch a movie",1
73,I must sincerely state that watching Joker was a total breath of fresh air for me because my interest level throughout the movie remained intact and I don't think any CGI was used at all!!! The film touches on many psychological aspects of the human condition and Jacqueline Phoenix does a great job of portraying this as the Joker. This is a must watch movie of 2019 and it is totally worth the price of admission! Superb acting and a fantastic soundtrack! Take my word for it and GO SEE IT!!,1

79,Shocking! Worthy! A version never expected and proved to be the necessary one. An astonishing performance by Phoenix.,1
80,"This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC.",1

82,"Wow!!The cinematography,background music everything is perfect,easily best comic book film since TDK,Joaquin delivers a phenomenal performance which will be remembered for decades....",1
83,"This is an amazing movie on its own, definitely not a a generic comicbook villain type movie you seen a million times before.A must-watch for everyone.",1
84,"The story, music, cinematography is breathtaking! Every shot is beautiful and ofcourse Phoenix is just amazing! His performance made joker's character alive in this real world!",1
85,"Phoenix is quite simply one of those select few actors that can take a role and completely take it to a different place. Being a comic book fanatic and having a long standing obsession with batman and his villain roster, I honestly didn't know what to expect with this film.But quite simply it's a masterpiece and I would definitely suggest an oscar might just be on the cards and if so it's  100 percent worthy. Spectacular",1
86,"[ENGLISH]Since childhood, Joker has always been my favorite character, and everyone knows it. I don't know why, but, since I saw an image of Jack Nicholson as Joker, I loved it, and, that was the beginning of my love for the character. If I'm sad, I see anything about Joker, and it makes me happy... He it conveys many emotions to me.At first, I didn't like the idea of a Joker movie without Batman.I also thought that it would be a good movie, yes, but of a man who calls himself Joker, without being.On top of that, villain films are not usually the way I would like them, posing them as antiheroes or even heroes.However, with the last thing I was seeing, my hopes with this movie were rising, and finally, after seeing it, I can say that I am lucky to have Joker as my favorite character.His transfer to the cinema has been fantastic in most cases, leaving a mark on popular culture. And, I think Joaquin Phoenix is going to do it too.From the first conversation to the end, I have been seeing the Joker character.It seems incredible to me how Phoenix laughs, and suffers at the same time, throughout the whole movie. Simply incredible. I have no discrepancy with the issue that Phoenix deserves the Oscar for best actor.Any cinematographic element (the script, the rhythm, the direction, the photography, etc…), is wonderful.The film has managed to do one of the things that seem most important to me in any medium, and, what the character always causes me: Feel emotions.I have released tears, i have laughed, I have been moved (smiling uncontrollably like Joker), but, above all, I have suffered.The whole movie has kept me in complete tension, even more, that any horror movie.Besides, music helps in that, it's fantastic, and I love her, it wouldn't be the same without her.Without being exaggerated, violence impacts a lot, due to the construction of its scenes.The negative point that was going to criticize, disappears during the movie.The pace of the movie is great, and it leaves you wanting more. I wish I could see more of this Joker…I highly recommend it, if you are a fan of the character, and of the cinema. Though, I think it is not suitable for sensitive people.This is not a crazy clown movie, this, is Joker.[ESPAÑOL]Desde pequeño, Joker siempre ha sido mi personaje favorito, y todo el mundo lo sabe. No sé por qué, pero, desde que vi una imagen de Jack Nicholson como Joker, me encantó, y, ese fue el inicio de mi amor por el personaje. Si estoy triste, veo cualquier cosa de Joker, y me hace feliz... Me trasmite muchas emociones.En un principio, no me gustaba la idea de una película de Joker sin Batman. También pensaba, que sería una buena película, sí, pero de un señor que se hace llamar Joker, sin serlo. Encima, las películas de villanos no suelen ser como me gustaría, planteándolos como antihéroes o incluso, héroes (Por ejemplo, Maléfica o Venom, que de villanos tienen poco en sus películas…).Sin embargo, con lo último que estaba viendo, mis esperanzas con esta película iban en aumento, y finalmente, tras verla, puedo decir, que soy un suertudo al tener a Joker como mi personaje favorito. Su traslado al cine ha sido fantástico en la mayoría de los casos, dejando huella en la cultura popular. Y, creo que Joaquin Phoenix va a hacerlo también.Desde la primera conversación hasta el final, he estado viendo al personaje de Joker.Me parece increíble como Phoenix ríe, y sufre al mismo tiempo, durante toda la cinta. Simplemente, increíble. No tengo ninguna discrepancia con el tema de que Phoenix se merezca el Oscar al mejor actor.Cualquier elemento cinematográfico (El guion, el ritmo, la dirección, la fotografía, etc…), son maravillosos.La película ha logrado hacer una de las cosas que me parecen más importantes en cualquier medio, y, lo que el personaje siempre me provoca: Sentir emociones. He soltado lágrimas, me he reído, me he inquietado, me he emocionado (sonriendo incontrolablemente como Joker), pero, sobre todo, he sufrido. Toda la película me ha mantenido en completa tensión (no estoy exagerando), incluso más, que cualquier película de terror.Además, la música ayuda en ello, pues, es fantástica, y la amo, no sería lo mismo sin ella.Sin ser exagerada, la violencia impacta mucho por la construcción de sus escenas.El punto negativo que le iba a criticar, desaparece durante la película…El ritmo de la película es genial, y, te deja con ganas de más. Ojalá pudiera ver más de este Joker… Cuando percibía que estaba a punto de terminar, pensaba: ¡No termines, por favor, quiero más!La recomiendo muchísimo, sobre todo, si eres fan del personaje, y del cine. Eso sí, creo que no es apta para la gente sensible.Esto, no es una película de un payaso loco, esto, es Joker.",1
87,Absolutely amaizing! Loved every minute of it! Joaquin Phoenix definetly deserves an Oscar for his performance!,1
88,Greatest performance and direction i have ever seen in a movie!!!!! Period.,1
89,"Joker, a movie flooded by controversy about it possibly promoting violence-but that really only sends the complete opposite message. Yes, there is people like this, there are people in trouble and do terrible things but instead of idealizing them, the movie to me at least, is a reality check that ponders on how we treat people and the consequences of not caring enough. The character is effectively a sick person suffering from mental illness in the looks for help that doesn't come his way, and is additionally mistreated by society- hence creating the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix did a tremendous job portraying the character, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets to be a candidate for best actor at the Oscars because he did a phenomenal performance. If I have an issue with the movie, it is the use of sound-the soundtrack overall is very good with violin pieces setting the depressing mood of the film, but in some instances the sound seemed intrusive- trying too hard to set an emotion or a moment instead of the actual film doing that by its own, creating a sense of superficiality to some of the scenes. Yet, this is a deep study into the mind of those who suffer, a movie that has a lot to say disguised into a comic book film about one of the most famous villains in pop culture.",1
90,Cinematography was unbelievable. One of the best movies I've seen in that regard. It will require a few watches for critical analysis.,1
91,"Damn, where do I even begin?The whole movie was a roller coaster ride.I don't usually go for movies, but Joker being my all time favorite antagonist, I had to.And I wasn't dissapointed. The movie is damn good.",1
92,"Such a good film from start to finish, you can tell how the character change little by little throughout the entire film, and at the end, all I'm getting was chills.",1
93,"A rare A+ from me. SPOILER-FREE PART:  This movie did not waste a single shot, not a single line, not a single movement, from the very beginning shot to the very last shot... so much that I refused to leave my seat to use the restroom. It reminded me of late '70s Scorcese with a hint of Nolan and a dash of Aronofsky without being derivative.  Best character study on film, in my opinion.  Possibly the best origin story (though Deadpool is so much fun).  Joaquin does the impossible task of matching (if not surpassing) Ledger in creating a compelling, one-of-a-kind, surprising portrayal.  I couldn't find fault with anything. Manages to be inventive, yet it pays mad fan service.  *******BORDERLINE SPOILERS:  Unpredictable, with a twist (or is it?  wait it is?  no, no, I was wrong... maybe...).    Makes you not only feel sorry for Arthur, but it makes you care about him... and then you have to wonder at what point you will not like him (which reminds me of Walter White's journey).",1
94,"Incredible acting, a fresh take on a classic character, awesome cinematography and score.",1
95,"Joker completely reinvents the wheel of the iconic super-villan; filled with a dark sensation and emotional distress performed by Joaquin Phoenix. It’s tainted with a fresh paint of characterization and it drops you into a troubling Gotham city that is judgmental to those unfortunate, whom may be suffering from the lack of sympathy for their poverty or sickness.",1
96,"Joker is a phenomenal character study film about how the man Arthur Fleck becomes the infamous clown. Joaquin Pheonix gives an incredibly horrific yet heart warming performance, bringing to life the characters dark side and human side so perfectly. You really understand his backstory and care for him even though the criminal actions he performs in the movie are not right. The movie ends so perfectly and almost acts as a satisfying prequel to the Dark Knight Trilogy (even though they have different actors). Everything else about the movie is also top notch; including the beautiful music and the visually stunning cinematography and set design. In my opinion, this is one of the best comic book films ever made.",1
97,"A crude social criticism, which shows us the result of an insensitive and violent society that does not care for the less favored, we see the acts, justified in the sick head of the Arthur Fleck, the descent of a person with mental disorders to whom No one pays attention to trying, the rawness, it is necessary we cannot put warm sticks to a situation that happens daily, it is necessary to see the real consequences, to the limits that some people can reach when the root problem is not cut.",1
98,"You know, Joker once said in a comic ""If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" I'd like to think that this is one of the many origin stories that are inside his head. The movie itself was amazingly shot. Each scene is very colorful or chaotically dull, representing Arthur's mental state. At first, you really feel for him. But then he gets more and more deranged, and you can't tell what's reality and what's fantasy that's in his head anymore.I am kinda glad that there some humorous scenes here and there. Most horror movies in the past made monsters and killers goofier as the series went, ruining the experience. Not this movie though. The comedy in this movie feels really natural, which is weird because you just saw Arthur's craziness few scenes ago.For me, this movie was a low-key psychological horror. There were many scenes that made me uncomfortable and made me question if we as a society are doing the same to some unfortunate soul.10/10, would go see again",1
99,"This movie is fantastic, Joaquin Phoenix performance was incredible, the world was very dark and disturbingly similar to our world terrifyingly similar conflicts and events that mirror that of our own.Despite is slower first act it does pick up and keeps you wanting to see what comes next.  Its very intelligently written and is a must watch for anyone who is interested in a character study of an interpretation of one of DC's most interesting villains.",1
100,"Probably the best origin story I've ever seen in my entire life. Astonishing acting, incredible visuals, gorgeous OST. Absolutely must watch!",1
101,"Фильм года а главному актёру должны вручить Оскар. Журнал TIME поставил оценку 20 а последниму фильм Форсаж Чоббс и Шоу 50, но там ляпы каждую минуту а тексты актёров наверное в детском садике деть на каленки написали.",1
102,pure genuine concept. must see movies. i think Joaquin will get an oscar for this outstanding movie. best part is the bloody smile,1
103,A deep character film with a huge payoff. This is what cinema needed. Something that made you feel and think about it. Easily my favorite film this year and one of the best films this decade.,1
104,Una obra de arte de calidad. Una magnífica interpretación de Phoenix en una película desmarcada del género de superhéroes y villanos. Quizás por eso logra destacarse. Es la mejor adaptación de un personaje de cómic que se ha hecho.,1
105,"Se o Oscar de atuação não for pro Joaquin, é roubo! Botou o Jared pra mamar!",1
106,"I was really blown away. Joaquin was incredible. I don't recommend movies because there are a lot of great movies/shows to watch, but I'm telling everyone they have to see this if they like anything dark.",1
107,"This movie was phenomenal. It was soo good i watched it three times. For those who thinks this movie promotes violence then they should also talk about jhon wick too. To people who believes this movie is bad for kids, it is. It is rated R for some reason. Also dont blame movie for gun violence. Its not like there was no mass shooting before the movie was released",1
108,"Gripping, disturbing, dark, intense and still twinges with sympathy for the Joker, it's a phenomenal film that lingers in your mind unlike no other. The acting is as cliche as it sounds, Oscar worthy, Joaquim Phoenix encompassed the role as Joker entirely and deserves the credit he deserves. th The cinematography is gorgeous  and Philips did just amazing with it. Ost to overall movie, has to be a 10/10 from me.",1
109,"the movie of the year, not for the super hero movie fan tough.La mejor película del año, sin embargo no es para los fans de las películas de superhéroes que generalmente esperan ver a este tipo de villanos caricariturisados.es un personaje profundo y bien pensado, el guión es magnífico y las actuaciones dignas del Oscar para Joaquín, reflejando desesperación, desesperanza, hace que empaticemos con el personaje desde el primer momento.fanta",1
110,"Easily Oscar material. Joaquin takes us on a tour de force into the insanity of a psychotic derange criminal from a beginning of a begnin man who struggles with mental illness and poor social circumstances. I absolutely loved the movie and I WILL watch it a second time in a Cinema, which is something I do not do ever.The storytelling, the in setting logic, the lore of the Joker, all was respected and all fitted. Well worth your money.",1
111,"REALLY **** GOOD! Joaquin Phoenix's performance is incredible, the cinematography is beautiful, the music is haunting.",1
112,"This is a perfectly crafted film that stands alone for Hollywood in these times. It’s bold. A beautiful character study of a broken man in a broken society, and the product that can emerge in this particular instance. This is an important film and probably my best of the year",1
113,"A thrilling dive into the human psyche of a man pushed too far by society. Slowly builds itself up to the final 20 minute crescendo that is a masterpiece of cinematography. The soundtrack fits perfectly as an eerie and slow tune that fits perfectly with the scenes it’s associated with. Pheonix deserves all the praise in the world for his portrayal of Joker/Arthur in this film. Also to the media that’s been freaking out over this movie, rather than banning this film for being to relatable to “bad people”, we should start asking where have we as a society gone wrong that so many young men find themselves relating to this film.",1
114,La pelicula me ha encantado! Creo que es la mejor que he visto en mucho tiempo. La recomiendo 100%,1
115,"Totally the best Joker ever, especially the pain that was coming through the laugh, it was so psychedelic and scaring....",1
116,"Wow, I have to say I left the theater not knowing what to think, and I mean that in the best way possible. Never have I seen a film blend both fantasy and reality together so well since Pink Floyd The Wall. Excellent work to the filmmakers and the amazing actors.",1
117,"Absolutely amazing, thought provoking movie that is more to do with mental health, modern society and culture than anything else.  Much better than mindless fantasy drivel; for although this has roots in fantasy storytelling, it paints a picture that is well within the bounds of reality and that will resonate with people of all ages and backgrounds.  10/10, magnificent.  Oh, and that Phoenix guy does and OK job, too.  :-)",1
118,"In one word phenomenal. This film is an extraordinarily special portrait of an extremely sad but frightening psychopath who, through extreme violence, finally sees a way to be seen.  Joaquin Phoenix has literally not been able to do better and is a worthy and characteristic joker who already produces iconic images. The character development is the strongest point of his finely polished way of acting. The shots are beautiful, the atmosphere is appropriate and the sound design is excellent. A real masterpiece!",1
119,The best film of the year and the best film of DC all timeJoaquin deserved an Oscar,1
120,"The movie is amazingly cool! After Heath Ledger, I had little hope of such an epic performance and Joaquin was able to bring us that! Two different jokers, but both will be stored in memory!",1
121,"Wow, relatively uncontrived drama from a big Hollywood movie.  When was the last time?  This movie surely slipped under the studio's radar.  Almost like they knew it was a gamble and green-lit total creative freedom.  Fantastic!  The soundtrack, both original and licensed, the setting, the pacing, the scene composition, the dialog and the story were all excellent.  I'm not sure the actor was the best fit for Joker, but he did a great job regardless.  He hit the somber lows really well, and the lows were necessary fuel for the Joker's highs that he performed satisfactorily.  There was still slight room for improvement, but not enough to push it out of the 10/10 slot: the movie could have ended 5 minutes earlier and been more subtle in a few places, almost like the director is asking ""Did you get it?  Let me explain it for some of you"", but overall, this goes well beyond expectations for a comic book movie.Now give Watchmen the same treatment!",1
122,"An absolute masterpiece. A movie that wasn't afraid to take risks, and one that perfectly depicts the mental struggle and downfall of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix was nothing short of amazing in portraying the Joker. A heartbreaking and gut wrenching film. 10/10",1
123,"Let me begin by stating that I'm not a superhero movie ""fanboy"" and came into the theater with an open mind about this movie, not feeling either way about the genre in general. I left feeling like this was one of the top 5 movie's I've ever seen in my life.This movie feels ""raw"" and does not make any attempt to please the audience. You truly get the impression that each piece of the film has a purpose. This is refreshing compared to most films which seek only to please the viewer. How refreshing! This may seem obvious to some when it comes to crime based movies with an anti-hero lead. But there is something different about this film, I haven't experienced anything like it in this regard. The editing is also fantastic. They did an amazing job with both the visuals and audio cut. It is 100% worth going to see in theaters if you can for this reason alone. Phoenix's acting was absolutely stunning as well. His performance truly blew me away. The way he delivers each line forces the viewer to empathize with his character. I was not expecting this from this film, but gave me one of those moments where I said: ""Very few people could ever act on this caliber, he is gifted"". Beyond this, his physical performance was also spectacular. There are several scenes where he contorts his body in ways that could only be possible from a legitimate actor.In summary, this is a must watch or even buy in my opinion. I myself am usually quite cynical when it comes to most films for the reason that they tend to spew out unrealistic pleasantries to make the viewer feel good. I am usually screaming internally when this happens as it's usually pretty obvious. If you feel the same way, you will adore this movie. If you are the ""feel good"" type, you may not enjoy this film quite as much, but it is still worth watching solely for Phoenix's performance.",1
124,"Joker is a compelling drama that is surprisingly sad. It's certainly not as graphic as the critics have suggested. However, the whole film is a pretty dreary look at mental health treatment in America. Overall, it's a really entertaining movie with great acting and well worth the watch.",1
125,Masterpiece. Joaquin deserves an Oscar.  Tightly shot; Culturally relevant; Eminently relatable; Cruelly comedic.,1
126,"Joker is a thrilling twist on the classic character’s origin. Joaquin Phoenix’s outstanding performance as Arthur had me glued to the screen for the entire runtime.Unlike most ‘comic-book movies’, Joker tells a story of a mentally ill man, and how society failed him.It’s drawn out pacing is perfect as it doesn’t feel too long or too short.A truly amazing experience,Amazing soundtrackAmazing performancesJust go see the film.",1
127,"An epic achievement in film. Phoenix is picture perfect, everyone involved went above & beyond. I was mesmerized for the entire duration. Can not recommend higher. Joker is an absolutely beautiful future classic. Well done Mr. Phillips!",1
128,A successful dc movie finally..the depth into the joker story touches everybody..,1
129,"Es una joya! La actuación es soberbia, una caracterización perfecta, fotografía hermosa y llena de simbolismos.",1
130,"Film ini sangat luar biasa, mampu membuat penonton merasa simpati terhadap supervilain seperti joket. Dan film ini memberikan pesan yg sangat mendalam bagi setiap orang agar selalu memperhatikan orang-orang disekitar dengan tulus",1
131,"Crítico politizado que vai assistir a esse filme, deveria se abster de dar opinião, já que estamos falando de cinema, não eleição.",1
132,The most extraordinary portrait of Joker so far!! Phoenix is amazing and his acting just gets better with each movie he stars in.,1
133,يظهر تأثر المخرج بكثير من الافلام وذلك لمرجعية ودراسة عل سبيل المثال الفيلم قريبًا جدًا من Taxi driver  إبداع خواكين لا يختلف عليه أثنين، الصعب كان سهلاً وكافي ليجعل منك مختل في ثوان.,1
134,"It's not often a movie makes an impact on me. In fact it's close to rare. ""Joker"" is a unique masterpiece in so many ways. I am absolutely blown away by the acting, music, cinematography, script, makeup, and the whole feel this movie has. It's dark, sad and very realistic. It does a great job at showing the viewer, a story of a troubled mind, and answers the question ""What if the joker lived in our world. How would he have gotten there. What could push a person so far out, and hate society so much"".The scary thing is, you can really relate to his journey.Wonderful job everyone on the team of this movie.And kudos to DC Comics for daring to make this movie.Thank you.",1
135,"A exceptionally fantastic movie that was an absolute pleasure/pain to watch. It left me drained and lost for words, I hope to come back and edit this review after watching it again in a few weeks and letting it stew for a while.  Go watch this movie, you won't regret it.",1
136,Je vais rarement au cinéma et en avant première encore moins mais j'ai absolument pas regretté ma place... Un petit chef d'œuvre cinématographique loin des films niant niant de super héros...,1
137,This movie is one of my favourites of the year. Filled with tension and a remarkable performance from Joaquin Phoenix. This movie will be in my head throughout awards season. 10/10,1
138,Inebriating awesome! What a perfomance by Joaquin Phoenix! The film hits you somehow that takes sometime after to make sense of everything,1
139,"I'm not that qualified to review this, but who cares. Joker is a goddamn masterpiece and will probably be considered of the movies to define 2019. Knock Knock.",1
140,Amazing film. Everything I wanted. Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix!,1
141,"Esse filme é um dos melhores filmes de super-heróis, nesse caso, super vilão de todos os tempos. Atuação impecável de Joaquin, demonstrando gigante profissionalismo. Oscar vindo aí.",1
142,"Joker is a brilliant character study that seeks to expose the pettiest and most intolerant side of society and its aftermath. It's a fantastic movie, an instant classic backed by a brutal and true story, Phoenix's transcendental acting, consistent soundtrack, and wonderfully beautiful and dirty cinematography. It can come with open arms Oscar, this one deserves recognition and respect!!",1
143,"Filme fenomenal, com brilhante atuação de Phoenix, trazendo a origem de toda a loucura do Coringa.",1
144,Although this movie include too much violence but it takes you into the movie deeper and it becomes darker till the last.,1
145,Una obra maestra! Lo mejor actuación que he visto en años Phoenix magistral,1
146,Good movie very informative on mental and an overall great character study on the effects of loneliness,1
147,"Um filme muito bom, incrivel em tudo e tem uma fotografia e cenário maravilhosos",1
148,Beautifully made movie. Emotional rollercoaster that hits a chord in your heart.,1
149,I loved everything about this movie! Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as the Joker!,1
150,Nasty and thrillingBetter joker than Jared Leto. Cant wait for the ne xt movie.,1
151,"This movie is a masterpiece. When I went to the cinema, even the first scene was... Wow.Joker is unbelievable masterpiece with a lot of plot twists. Like these: Joker is imagining whole date, He killed his mother, His father is Thomas Wayne but when you get further in film: You will find out, that he is adopted and he don't know his father, not even his mom. I rate this movie 10/10. Hope it gets an oscar. Joaquin Phoenix is really a good actor and deserve your attention and of course... An oscar.",1
152,"Great R- rated movie.Wanna Look this movie 10 xAwesome.Great Story,  nice twist, nice entertainment.",1
153,"The critics have never been more wrong. There are so many ways this could've been a disaster but it was pulled off really well. It has a lot of the melancholy origin Joker from A Killing Joke with a legitimately good story about someone on the bubble of being a functional adult with major mental health problems in a world that throws people away. It has some of it's own subplots that are unique to this telling of the Joker's origin. It's a far better origin story than the old ""vat of chemicals"" routine and it's made with the pacing of a serious movie. It's not a non-stop sizzle reel.",1
154,The joker was beautiful made I suggest everyone to go see it .it's a must see movie,1
155,"I can't think of many films that follow a character through their descent into madness so well. The film really is daring and courageous to centre itself on such a perspective without wincing away.Phoenix deserves to be hailed as one of the best on screen actors of his generation. He is so convincing and uses every cell in his body to portray the mental state of Arthur, and is so precise and distinct with his reactions to the environment that surrounds him, as well as his unveiling past. The thing I like a lot about this film is that it's not disturbing for the sake of it. It's disturbing as a result of the story - where a lot of films sacrifice story for the sake of being disturbing.",1
156,"Psychiatrists will call you ""crazy"" and prescribe you drugs. Hypocritical people will tell you ""I care about you"" when they kick you in the ass. Whenever someone dares to speak about it, is beaten up. But the Joker puts some paint on all that and really stands out. He does care about things, although in a way that will hurt, just because most people are unable to face the ugly truth. Masterpiece.",1
157,"What a movie, acting , directing  , soundtracks , screen play , cinematography ..  at the top ! Joker is one of the best movies last 10 years without a doubt. can’t say more .. its a masterpiece!!",1
158,This movie Is beautiful in every frame and Joaquin gives a oscar worthy performance. Is a movie you should see more then once.,1
159,"This movie is a goddamn masterpiece, of course people who love mindless action like in the mcu instead of a good story will find the movie boring, but the lead up to the end is perfectly executed and the end gives a nice balance between the glory and the disturbing feel (especially with murray's death)",1
160,"This film is insane. I haven't seen something more powerful since The Green Mile. Totally agree with other comments -  definitely Oscar's performance. But I hope Joker will get more than 1 golden statuette. Going to re-watch this masterpiece tomorrow. And yeah, put on a happy face",1
161,"Holy smokes! This is, without exaggeration, Oscar worthy! The story and plot are so well written and told, and the acting so believable that I was absolutely immersed all throughout those two hours! A solid 10/10 without hesitation!",1
162,"Just simply incredible. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is Oscar worthy. From the cinematography and score, to the writing and characters were all done note perfectly!",1
163,"This movie is simply a masterpiece, and doesn’t deserve hate. Does this movie have strong violence, yes, but it is rated R! This movie does something special and sends a good message, not that you should be a violent clown murdering psycho, but a message that says people around us and the world effect our decisions and who we become and that we need to take more responsibility in that. I recommend anybody to watch this move. It is truly phenomenal.",1
164,"A psychological thriller, wonderfully filmed and acted about a man's journey of self discovery and subsequent descent into madness against the backdrop of a dysfunctional society. The film has undertone's of The King Of Comedy, reinforced by the presence of Robert De Niro whose role is an inversion of that in the original film.",1
165,What do you get when you cross Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips? You get what every Joker fan deserves. An iteration of the character to finally rival The Dark Knight’s and a film in which every element of production came together perfectly to create one of the best movies of our time.Final Rating – 5/5 Stars! (Translated to 10/10 for Metacritic)Full review available on our site.,1
166,"Joker is one of those films that is quite enjoyable but overall I kept thinking, 'Damn, why is everything happening Arthur in the same week.' It pushes itself to dark places but doesn't take enough risks to be as tortured and it wants to be.",1
167,"Un capolavoro. Due ore di magistrale interpretazione che fanno entrare lo spettatore nella testa di Joker, accompagnandolo nella sua discesa verso la follia.",1
168,Отличный фильм.Полный атмосферы грусти и реалей современного общества.Отдельный восхитительный аспект-это музыка...музыка эта бомба!,1
169,As a fan of the Joker this movie was amazing. It's a masterpiece and Phoenix's performance was amazing. The transformation from Arthur to Joker was chilling and once completed it was satisfying. Realy enjoyed and loved the film. My favorite film of the year thus far.q,1
170,"Joker is like nothing I’ve seen before. In amongst the short bursts of grim violence are some moments of genuine tragedy, more than a few dark laughs, and a final act that has to be seen to be believed. Joker isn’t necessarily a film to be enjoyed, per se; it’s a film to be experienced. That experience is an unforgettable one.",1
171,"Acting was Amazing, music was amazing and gothem set up the story really well. The story was really good although at the end it felt like if did bot know how to finish. Overall it was a fantastic movie",1
172,"Excelente filme. Pelo que observei, a maior parte dos críticos do filme formaram a sua opinião em uma suposta influencia negativa que o filme pode causar na sociedade, e não na qualidade do filme e da história em si.",1
173,I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job during this movie. To watch him play the Joker was a pleasant experience,1
174,"El origen es hasta mejor que el original, la actuación de Phoenix impecable, nada más que decir, es la mejor película de un villano",1
175,"Joaquin Phoenix absolutely nailed the role. The cinematography is spectacular, Hildur's soundtrack is amazing. Joker is good as a movie, but phenomenal as a piece of character study.",1
176,"This movie is so great that  Joaquim Phoenix should win a oscar for his acting in Joker, this movie is dark and the same time sad",1
177,"I went into this movie with a high level of skepticism.  Wow!  What an awesome movie.  Joaquin is amazing.  The direction and writing is amazing as well.  It touched on so many nerves for me.  I was creeped out, sympathetic and horrified.  This movie proves that ""superhero movie"" is too broad a category and story and acting can live in any genre.",1
178,"Very engrossing movie and story. I was mesmerized throughout the 2 hour playing time. A totally believable transition from sucker to horrifyingly scary maniac. Very worthy of the iconic villain that is the Joker. Obviously not very pleasant to watch at times, but very worth while. Highly recommend for those interested.",1
179,One of the most important movies of the entire decade. An absolute must-watch.,1
180,This is a great movie a motion picture blockbuster masterpiece I recommend you see it Joaquin Phoenix performance is one of the best acts he has done fantastic job by Todd Phillips as his director talent.,1
181,The movie plays with your mind making you understand the mind of the character and why he do such things,1
182,"Really good movie. It's a super good origin movie that is extremely sad and dark, but not overly political or artsy fartsy. It just is what it is, and the fact that the elite are horrified seeing their reflection in the dystopian Gotham when it's not overly stated is assuredly an added bonus. There's no cheesy writing or statements, but the horror of the movie is the same  dystopia that's our leaders of the last 50 years seem to be leading us too. But really it's just a Joker origin story. I love how they managed to pull this off. It's not about ""incels"" but is assuredly about croney capitalism, without ever outright saying it.",1
183,"This movie is amazing the script is great the plot is great and the act ring is great, Movie of the year.",1
184,"Фильм прекрасен, лучшее что я смотрел в этом году, однозначно фильм года!",1
185,"Had no expectations but really enjoyed watching it. Phoenix carries it. There are one or two plot issues and I felt it was 5 minutes too long, but overall thought it was great.",1
186,"Ohhh my gosh. Wow. I am blown away. Talk about an intense movie. This is a genius movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just sooo believable that I had anxiety and an unsettling feeling the whole movie! That’s how real it felt. That’s how well the movie was done. I left feeling stunned, but wowed! Not sure if that  makes sense but that’s how the movie made you FEEL! The movie deserves an Oscar, for the cinematography, the music...the music just set the tone...so well done....whoever the composer was deserves a nomination.... and the acting. Joaquin carries the whole weight of the movie from beginning to end. Let’s just say after this performance, I don’t think anyone can replay this role!!!!!",1
187,AN OSCAR LEAGUE MOVIE . The evolution of crown prince of crime is completely shown. A justice to Heath Ledger portrayal of joker has been done by Joaquin Phoenix,1
188,Meget interessant syntes den var rigtig rigtig god. Rigtig glad for at der ikke var for meget eller ingen super helte aktion.,1
189,"A fantastic absorbing performance that wears its influences on its sleeve and nods and bows to the graphic novels of Moore, and Miller, that inspired the story as well as the Scorsese film classics it borrows from. Phoenix has rarely been better.",1
190,"This movie is very hard to watch, but you need to watch it. Society can be scary even for a healthy person, this movie shows what it can do with those who are vulnerable.",1
191,Muy buena actuación de joaquin phoenix excelente el oscar que viene tiene que llevarselo si o si,1
192,"Amazing movie. Technically well executed. The film gives an exceptional portrayal of the human madness potentiated by the social setback, showing how a man can corrupt himself in this situation without magnifying him but by revealing his toxic side. A great character study, coupled with Joaquin Phoenix's magnificent acting.",1
193,Шедевральная актерская игра и постановка сюжета,1
194,"It's been a very long time since a film so thoroughly gripped me from beginning to end. Joaquin has delivered a performance that stands toe to toe with the likes of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. This film feels extremely prescient in our time as many who are disaffected are shunned and treated like they're toxic by nature. The gulf between the critic score and user score speaks volumes about the kind of film this is. Just like Dave Chappelle's sticks and stones, this is another masterpiece that the critics fail to recognize.",1
195,Phoenix’s portrayal of the joker is different from other one we know in Dark Knight but that doesn’t take from the amazing performance. Overall the film took a different approach than other films which included the joker and that’s what made it much better than anticipated.,1
196,"Un película increíble con grandes actuaciones, que hace sentir muchas emociones. Y reflexionar sobre muchas cosas. Aparte joker excelenten personaje.",1
197,"Довольно драматичная история неудавшегося комика Артура Флека. Для меня он не произвёл огромную массу впечатлений, но всё таки впечатления есть. И к счастью, хороших больше чем плохих. На 1-ой половине фильма, к сожалению, мне не было интересно как на 2-ой. Фильм тебя затягивает всё больше и больше, только к 3-ей четверти фильма. Но плюсы 1-ой половины в том, что видно, какое общество находится вокруг Артура, этот мир, мы понимаем почему он стал Джокером.  Этот фильм не про насилие, здесь его не так много как все говорят. И так, мы имеем на данный момент лучший фильм по комиксам, я более чем уверен, что Хоакин Феникс получит Оскара. Он буквально вжился в роль, даже очень сильно похудел для сьёмок. Конечно, он не западал в депрессию как Хит Леджер, но всё таки он очень постарался. Конечно, для меня он не лучший фильм года, но он держится на 2-ом или 3-ем месте. Рекомендую для просмотра, либо повторного, либо дома на диванчике. (Моя первая рецензия, поздравьте меня!)",1
198,"Astonishing and brilliant performance for Phoenix. Marvelous adapted screenplay had me hooked from the beginning to end.Bone-defying performance of a complex story of a broken down man who shows a compelling transformation between Arthur Fleck to the Joker we are so tempted to see come out. Many emotions sprawled,theirs a bit of dark-humor, analyzing the society on a deeper level and  a potential coming of age story for a man so worn down by society his only escape is to reinvent himself into someone he would like for others to see him as. Brilliant! A+ for Phillips adaptation and Phoenix's performance.Bravo! 10/10!!",1
199,"Uncomfortable laughter.Am I the only one laughing at this? I hope not.Great movie, incredibly depressing.Kind of felt like I did the first time I watched Natural Born Killers; disbelief; they actually made this movie, wow.Bravo for not shoveling the same old ****",1
200,"Seemed too simple at first but it all slowly sums up into something specialy retarded.Great acting,real.Whole look and feel of movie builds up character or messes  up is a better word.Some scenes kinda blur the line of who is the one that is really messed up there and that is quite something.",1
201,"Finally a Joker origin movie. As an origin movie, you cannot expect this to be action-packed like Ledger's performance of the clown. However, Pheonix does a great job showing you how the Joker became the villain we know today. The film can be a bit hard to watch at parts for people who aren't used to such violence. What we see is a very good look into the mind of someone who is beaten down by the rotten people of society and driven to the edge of sanity. Even if you are not a Batman or Joker fan, this is worth a watch for the study of a character alone.",1
202,"Joker is a fantastic character piece that takes place just outside of the Batman universe, it is very clearly inspired by other sources such as Batmans ""The Killing Joke"" and movies like ""Taxi Driver"". The story follows (Ben) Arthur Flecks descent from a deranged recluse to an unhinged murderous lunatic with a cult following. This film uses current world issues to add plausibility to it's story, you never quite find yourself empathizing with Arthur, but you can understand how he gets to be the Joker and why. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic in this movie, you really can't help but think of how short changed Jared Leto must be feeling right now. The acting is great, the story is captivating if now a little slow at points and the cinemetography is gorgeous. Well worth a watch!",1
203,"Certainly exceeded all expectations. Joaquin Phoenix soars. Beautiful camera work, haunting score, overall a very powerful, memorable film. Such exquisite talent! Critics prove once again they don't always get it right. One of the best movies of 2019.",1
204,"Joker is an exceptionally well made film. It has some of the best cinematography of this year and boasts probably the best performance of it also. The music is hauntingly beautiful and help this movie stand the test of time as one of being one of the most unique comic book movies to ever be made. I only really have one problem with the film: it's script. Now, the story is actually pretty good, it's just that it's one we've seen before in films like Taxi Driver. For a comic book movie movie, it's a pretty unique script, but compared to other films like this, it doesn't do this kind of story as well. It's a little slow n parts and its dialogue is nothing special, but this is still a pretty well written movie, with symbolism left and right and a satisfying, yet tragic, arc for its protagonist. On its own, this is a very well made movie, but just isn't quite a masterpiece (though, it was pretty close to being one).",1
205,"This movie is incredible. I've now seen it 4 times. It is so controversial and so horrifying due to its apsolute realism. This movie forced its watchers to look true sickness and mental illness in the face and see all of its ugly truths. Better yet, Joaquin Phoenix makes the view fall in love with him and side with his viel nature. This is exactly why some people dont like it. It can feel too real to be comfortable. I love this movie and I will be purchasing the DVD when its released.",1
206,"This is like one of the best movie in 10 years. It's deep and you can feel the story. Joaquin phoenix was a excellent choice for joker, he played joker so well!",1
207,This is art. The modern day Taxi Driver but still different. It became one of 10 favorite movie ever !,1
208,Excellent...Le personnage Arthur possède bien cette aspect autant monstrueux que héroïque.L'histoire qui est prenante et surprenante par moment avec de belles remises en question de Arthur.Le film est juste excellent et je le conseille vivement !!,1
209,сходил уже 7 раз и это просто шедеврально! всем советую а долбанные журналюги просто бояться ставить высокие оценки из за своей тупой толерантности),1
210,Joaquin Phoenix's performance was incredible. I can't stop thinking about this movie.,1
211,"This is one the best movies of this year, the story was great and Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the joker was amazing.",1
212,"So incredibly well done, Joaquin brought so much raw emotion to joker! Joker was by far the best movie of 2019, and it shed led light on actual important matters such as today’s society and it brought awareness to mental illness. So incredible, I could go on for hours non stop on how incredible this movie was!",1
213,not only is this the best film franchise reboot ever... this is probably the best dc movie since the very first batman film.,1
214,Masterpiece. Fantastic cinematography. Amazing acting. Very well written. My favorite joker. Dont listen to these stupid **** critics. Just look at the audience score on any website.,1
215,"amazing movie, its deep and not like the other dumb movies hollywood loves to make, its smart, sad and funny, all at the same time,",1
216,Joker Might be the Best Movie of the year! A True Masterpiece! The way they show the problems of mental health is amazing! It shows the tragic life of  Joker( and others) who have to deal with it. The origin Story was great. Joaquin Phoenix was born to play this role. I love the Cinematography by Lawrence Sher. It feels like a gritty 1970's movie. DC and Todd Phillips really made a one of a kind movie. I don't understand the hate from the critics. It's a MUST SEE!,1
217,"Αυτός ο Joker σέρνεται σε έναν αληθινό τόπο πόνου και έρπει προς τα έξω, ώσπου χορεύει τρομακτικά στους ήχους του Γκάρι Γκλίτερ, στην αξέχαστη σκηνή στα σκαλοπάτια. Δεν σκοτώνει από μιμητισμό, αναίσθητα και «ωραία». Ξεκινώντας από την ένδεια και την ανημπόρια, η ταινία  πραγματεύεται την αλαζονεία της εξουσίας και την προβάλλει σαν συμπαγή, συγκεντρωμένη παραλλαγή του V for Vendetta, με καταλύτη έναν αυθεντικά δυστυχισμένο που καταντά το τέρας που ξεφύτρωσε στo πλατύσκαλο της πλουτοκρατίας της Wall Street και της πολιτικής αναισθησίας που θα ακολουθούσαν.",1
218,"Just Great. I have no words to say about this movie, it's just a masterpiece.",1
219,"Gran elenco, gran historia para un personaje tan memorable como es el joker, el mejor villano sin duda merecía una película a la altura y es el caso, los actores de primer nivel, música orquestal perfecta buena fotografía y una gran historia que te sumerge a la interpretación de Joaquín fénix es una película con un sabor de amargura de alegría de impacto a través de los ojos de arthur fleck",1
220,Best movie 2019! And this review must atleast have 75 characters so thats why i am typing this.,1
221,"I am in awe of Joaquin Phoenix' acting in this film. That alone makes it worth watching. The depth of the character and the fact that he's not a Mary Sue-type or even likeable character combine to kick the ass of every superhero movie ever. It's not a funny movie, it's a tragic drama.",1
222,The biggest lesson to take from this movie :We really do live in a society.,1
223,"Magistral actuación de Joaquin Phoenix de principio a fin, la obra centra la historia del joker de una manera muy bien enfocada. Desde el punto de vista argumental excelente.",1
224,"Классный Фильм рекомендую к просмотруНовый «Джокер» стоит того, чтобы считаться лучшим из фильмов DC. великолепный, захватывающий дух, ужасающий, но удивительный.",1
225,"One of the best movie i have ever seen in my life, yes you get less action that in batman moovies but what it loose in action, it gains in depth. What an incredible movie about the joker past, it give a complete different point of view to this character.Can't understand how 'reviewers' gave it a 5.9/10, but they lost all credibility to my eyes.",1
226,"“Coringa“ou “Joker”, lançado no dia 3 de outubro de 2019 no Brasil, levou críticas como: maravilhoso, épico, até críticas falando que o filme era extremamente violento.O filme que tanto se fala (sendo até concorrido ao Oscar) conta a história do maior super vilão do Batman, sendo um pouco diferente dos outros, focando mais na história do personagem do que no “tema ação”.Confesso que quando fui ver o filme achando que seria muito violento, porém não foi. Eu achei muito interessante o que o Coringa disse à sua assistente social, pois todo dia ela perguntava se ele estava tendo pensamentos negativos e em seu último dia com ela, ele respondeu que a única coisa que ele tem são pensamentos negativos, na minha opinião alguém não precisa ser doente para ter isso, mesmo sendo otimista; a maioria das pessoas tem pensamentos ruins (penso assim ser) e não precisa ser louco pra isso! Nele também mostra Thomas Wayne como um outro tipo de pessoa, como uma pessoa “má” ou ignorante, o que não mostra nos outros filmes, em Thomas era generoso e bom.Quanto ao fato da mulher que teria começado a namorar o Coringa, mostrando no final ser apenas um fantasia dele, e pra falar a verdade eu achei um pouco estranho desde do início, porque se as pessoas consideradas normais mal conseguem lidar com suas loucuras, imaginem com as de alguém realmente (ou diagnosticado) louco!Mas o filme é muito bom e as observações que eu fiz acima deixam ele ainda melhor, eu recomendo muito assistir.",1
227,"I usually wait until the hype dies down to see films like this, and I have to say: believe the hype.This is a real film, cast your superhero apprehensions aside. To say that Joaquin Phoenix is superlative in his performance is the understatement of the decade - he is brilliant. The score, cinematography, the direction, and script are equally so.I don't know what we did to deserve a film of this caliber, or how on earth it got green lit in this day and age, let alone in the comic book arena, but thank your lucky stars that we did. Joker is a masterpiece of filmmaking, it is easily the most poignant comic book movie I've ever seen. It is all at once sad, tragic, deep, uncomfortable, yet never truly gratuitous - it is very nearly a perfect thing.Between this and the excellent Wonder Woman and Shazam, DC is on a roll. Thank you to everyone involved. You have created a timeless piece of cinema with this film, truly, and I hope that it continues with your future endeavors.Highly, highly recommended, but definitely not for kids, even if simply for the depth of its themes, that they will definitely not understand, this is no Avengers film. There are no cookie cutters in this movie, it is all nuance, and there are a few scenes that border on brutal. It is art in an artless age, it will make you think and it will stay with you. I for one am grateful that it exists. Well done. Well done, indeed. A very easy 10/10, this took a lot of courage to make in 2019.",1
228,"This is the kind of comic book character movie i can get behind. Telling the Joker story in a real world setting was just a brilliant idea. The themes of mental health, and mental health care (or lack thereof) are written and presented very well and Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of a man suffering from mental illness who is mocked and ridiculed by society and abandoned by the system until he is pushed over the edge, is just fantastic. Joker paints a very different picture of this character and gives you a real insight into why these characters become who they become, and who is to blame. Ultimately you are left questioning who the real ""bad guys"" are",1
229,"'Joker' was a dark, thrilling, and brilliant film that made you go 'wow'. The film brought out such fear and disturbance that you typically wouldn't see in these types of superhero movies.The acting was just PHENOMENAL. Joaquin Phoenix (Joker/Arthur Fleck) had one of the best most spectacular performances of the year! It was a perfect display of mental illness and sometimes you can just FEEL what the Joker was going through as Phoenix displays such amazing raw talent. I also believe Robert De Niro displayed a good performance as well as acting as Murray Franklin, a popular talk-show host. He really felt like an actual talk show host and his acting towards the end was fantastic. 'Joker' excels greatly in certain scenes, especially towards the end. To avoid spoilers, the scenes towards the end of the film is just ASTONISHING. It's worth watching on its own! The camerawork and music cues were splendid as well.Unfortunately, I believe there were a couple of flaws in the film which can be subjective. I deeply apologize but I think the film's pacing was a little bit off at times. It was slow at times.Otherwise, it's one of, if not, the best film of 2019. I would give this a 9.5 if I could. The critics' reviews are honestly questionable at a glance. To conclude, THIS FILM WAS FLAT-OUT ASTOUNDING AND TERRIFYING!",1
230,A masterpiece! It was the movie that surprised me the most in 2019. Joaquin Phoenix is ​​AWESOME!,1
231,A great movie with great acting and portrayal of reality. Is been too long since we saw a great movie. This is it.,1
232,"ok, let's talk about Joker, probably the most amazing movie of recent times. This film is very different, it's a very different storyline. The script is very well written, it demonstrates well the mental insanity of the protagonist, which propagates in the dialogues. Todd Phillips' direction is very well done, obviously it is a very different job compared to his work on The Hangover, here his direction is invasive and cautious. We can not fail to mention the magnificent and anthological performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who is sensational, it is really difficult to express words to describe this fantastic performance. Another incredible point of the film is its soundtrack, which is very good and deserves to win an Oscar. Joker is a very heavy film, it really is not for anyone. The film presents the basic coalitions with the D.C universe, but the focus in this film is really the presentation of the origin of the joker. I will make a small mention of Robert de Niro's performance, which despite doing a simple and basic performance, is an interesting performance that has a lot to do with the main character's arc. To conclude, Joker is a film that, despite being very heavy, is a beautiful character study, with a very good script, and a magnificent performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Oscar winner.",1
233,It don't get no better than this!  Phoenix really does this justice and the story made it just grand.  Best actor nod ... no doubt. I rented this one with a negative 'I will give it a shot' and was thoroughly surprised and glad I did.  You do not have to be a Batman fan to appreciate this movie.  Best picture seems very possible.,1
234,Best movie in the lasts 10 years! Best actor also. I don’t understand how the profesional reviewers had a so bad taste!,1
235,I thought this movie was so well made. Hit every heart string a human can muster. Even though the director usually does comedy he killed it. Joaquin Phoenix had is best performance ever next to Gladiator. 2 thumbs up from me.,1
236,"Joaquin Phoenix is the best. Music is fantastic, the camera work is also really good, but the direction is not so good. It's really good movie. Joaquin is of course best part of this.",1
237,Melhor atuação de Joaquim Phoenix E umas das melhores atuações da década,1
238,"Such amazing movie, seeing the joker in making, different point of view from all the past jokers, dark kinghts joker is still the best !!",1
239,Mr. Phoenix is amazing in his role! Truly stunning performance which captures both reality and psychosis of Joker character. A must-watch for me!,1
240,Joaquin is a phenomenal actor. The movie beautifully shot. And the story is intriguing if nothing else. The third act is solid and really delivers. And Joaquin's take on the Joker is fascinating.,1
241,"Espere mucho, y recibí el doble, la mejor película que he visto en este último tiempo, viva Chile ctm",1
242,"Great performance. Joaquin Phoenix is definitely one of those authentic actors who can burry themselves into the life of an intended character. In this movie, he gave life to Joker.",1
243,"The best movie I have seen in the last years. Joaquin Phoenix is awesome, he deserves the Oscar. 10/10. MASTER PIECE",1
244,"Todd Phillips, Scott Silver and Joaquin Phoenix has done an amazing job and created a masterpiece. The acting is phenomenal and the story is wonderfully portrayed.",1
245,"Obra de arte.Esse filme é bom em tudo que se propõe. O roteiro/Enredo são magníficos, causando empatia  com um dos vilões mais conceituados já existentes; A fotografia é muito bem trabalhada e intruidada, minuciosamente pensada; E quanto a trilha sonora... pra quem tem bom gosto, sai do cinema com um gostinho de quero mais. E quanto as atuações, Joaquin Phoenix atua dando o seu melhor, aprofundando o personagem de uma maneira que só uma excelente atuação, com um bom roteiro e direção poderiam oferecer. Enfim, melhor filme do ano sem duvidas.",1
246,Critics are triggered and wrong. This movie is phenomenal and the outrage is a PepeLaugh if you ask me.,1
247,"If anything, the “professional critic” reviews tell a lot when they decide to dish out wonderful ratings to a film like The Last Jedi, and attempt to subdue the awesomeness of a film such as this one. Talk about douchebags throwing a turd sandwich into the punchbowl.Back to the film. Scorsese would be proud, and the acting of Phoenix was mind-blowing through it all from the cringe moments to the sadness shown deep in the eyes of the character and during the manifestation of the Joker himself. Hats off to everyone who made this film happen.",1
248,"Absolutely incredible, definitely a must watch. 10/10 would recommend seeing this film.",1
249,Must watch.Knock Knock. Best Movie 2019: Joker. MASTERPIECE!This movie has it all,1
250,"The critical average on this website does not accurately reflect the quality of Joker--it is an outstanding film. But don't take my word for it, just look at the user score, and then, once you're ready, go see this movie.",1
251,"Great Movie, don't believe the ""critics"" that have an agenda. See the movie and decide for yourself.",1
252,Everything about the movie was perfect. They depicted how joker would come to he in the real world perfectly.,1
253,It's a great movie! Don't let the. Critics fool you! Go watch it! Best comicbook movie since the dark knight.,1
254,"Joaquin's Phoenix's performance as Joker is something that should not be missed, even if you find the rest of the movie not to your liking. He has brought something really new to this iconic character and his performance deserves to be discussed among best portrayals of the Joker up there with Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger. The rest of the movie? Todd Phillips directs the film with talent, and grabs your attention through a slow burn movie. That is something to keep in mind, it is a very slow burn movie doesn't feature much action so keep that in mind if you're the type of person who doesn't enjoy slow burn movies. Also while the media has way overhyped the controversy to this movie yes there are plenty of uncomfortable scenes bear that in mind. All in all I think Joker is one of the best films of the year. If your the type that enjoys a slow but gripping character drama with lots to say about society, mental issues, and features a unique take on a cultural icon than I cannot recommend Joker.",1
255,"Incredible acting, cinematography, soundtrack, story, writing, action. All-round just excellent and easily one of the best movies of the year. A must-see.Truly bizarre some of the scores we are seeing from critics on this film, and just goes to show you really can't trust them - their agendas and virtue signalling seem to keep them from forming an honest opinion and judging the film for what it is.",1
256,"It almost seems pointless leaving a review as it's going to be lost in the sea of 10's and 9's. As almost everyone else has commented, Joker is a remarkable movie. It is derivative yes, with obvious comparisons being Scorsese's Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy, but it stands alone as a brilliant homage to the Golden Era of cinema, the seventies, with a truly modern spin. Do not miss.",1
257,"This is the most grounded comic book movie ever made.  There are no supernatural or exaggerated elements whatsoever, which facilitates this being the darkest super hero movie ever made.  Phoenix's performance was captivating.  I could not peel my eyes from the screen.  My emotions tilted from fascinated to horrified as I the journey of Arthur Fleck becoming Joker.  I'll take a bold and courageous film like this every time over some focus tested, homogenized, formulaic MCU movie (even though I enjoy those movies for what they are).",1
258,"Great movie, awesome acting, spine chilling story telling. The best origin story ever.",1
259,"Without a doubt the best movie of 2019. Great movie with some very, very good acting.",1
260,The world needed this. Hollywood has gone completely political and it has ruined the movie industry. This type of eye opening movie is exactly what the world needs to see. It immerses the view into the character and story and makes your mind think.,1
261,"The movie is just a peace of art. Don’t believe the website score, they do it on purpose. .",1
262,"What an amazing, lovingly crafted movie. It should be up for many awards come The Oscars {not least for Pheonix's extraordinary performance, but sadly I think it will be {conveniently} overlooked.",1
263,Mesmerizing performance by Joaquin Phoenix... great cinematography & music score... a must see...,1
264,"""Joker"" is not fun. It's not an action-filled comic book romp or even ""entertaining"". By seeing ""Joker"", you agree to be uneasy, uncomfortable, and horrified throughout. Throughout the course of the film, you will experience a myriad of instances in which a single person reaching out in kindness could mean the difference between sanity and chaos. If for no other reason than to understand the importance of kindness in a bleak world, go see ""Joker"".",1
265,"Masterpiece! If you're into MCU movies, this is not for you. This is not for stupid kids...",1
266,"Joaquin's Phoenix's performance as Joker is simply superb. Academy Award for best actor material for sure. The movie is very grim with only a touch of humor here and there. It turns darker and darker as the story progresses. It is most certainly the darkest origin story I've ever seen with more than just a couple of uncomfortable scenes and very hard and shocking critcism on society, so this may not be for everyone. It does however always keep you guessing and thus engaged in the story. Never boring, it is without a doubt one of the best movies of the year, if not the best up until now.",1
267,"Outrage has really ruined the conversation about movies. Not that it’s a bad thing, but outrage tends to overshadow movie's overall intentions. It’s no surprise that Joker ends up getting a nice share of the outrage, but it often leads the question: Is the film worth all the controversy or is it a small issue blown up into a big one?The film follows Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) is older down on his luck man suffering through various mental illnesses, particularly his uncontrollable laughter in various scenarios. As his world crumbles around him, he finds himself teetering on reality and fantasy as he seeks to find some form of acceptance as he becomes the legend known as the Joker.This is no surprise when I say that Joaquin Phoenix pulls out an amazing performance as the Joker. He finds a perfect line trying to humanize his character's disability and bringing the viewer into his mind and often sweeping the rug under our feet with an “unreliable narrator” presentation where it makes you wonder what really happens and what doesn’t. The film gorgeously re-creates an early 1980’s New York aesthetic with the grime, trash and somehow frames it in a pretty well-shot way.The biggest problem is when portraying a character with disabilities, Director Todd Phillips shoots the film in the foot with often falling back on cliche old demeaning natures. Particularly one character who’s only character trait is his dwarfism and is often made fun of his height, that even involves a pretty dark scene later on which is hard to tell if it’s a payoff for a joke or not. Also, the film borrows a couple too many pages from Taxi Driver, which ironically stars Robert De Nero who’s in this film as well and is pretty great as a talk show host.Joker will divide many people and I think that’s the goal of the film. Many will like the portrayal of the villain, and many will dislike the violence and how certain things are represented. But I feel what many will agree on is how Joaquin Phoenix knocks it out of the park.",1
268,"Not a fan of comics. Went to the movie with friends expecting nothing, ended up loving the movie. No superheros, no magic, no **** just grim and violent alternative reality. I can't even come up with much criticism for this movie, it just worked from start to finish. I give full recommendation to watch it to pretty much anyone interested in thrillers and drama movies. TRUE 10/10 MOVIE!",1
269,"I won't spoil anything about this movie so I'll just say that this movie is pure genius! Don't not see this movie because of the stupid controversy surrounding it!! If you like movies that have great writing, great acting, great score, great cinematography, etc, then don't miss this movie!!!",1

271,"The dreaded approach of today's society that fragments the marginalized, emphasizes the new fascism, the racism and power of television that has become part of every family. The first film that transcends the simple super heroes community into a new world of social perspectives.",1

278,Gave me exactly what I wanted from a Joker movie. Phoenix's performance definitely gives Ledger's and Nicholson's a run for their money,1
279,"By far movie of the year!! Phoenix was absolutely Phenomenal. Critics need to stop being political about everything and enjoy a movie once in a while. Watch it for yourself, I have stopped listening to what so called ""experts"" think about movies and started listening to what actual audience think. Very close to the best Joker performance, very close.",1

281,Joker is a legend!/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////,1
282,"Few movies stay with you after the credits roll, Joker is definitely one of those movies. No wonder why such a masterpiece won the Golden Lion in the Venice Film Festival this year, it's the best DC Comics film, along with the Dark Knight, is really that good (don't believe the critics who are trying to ruin the movie).The Gotham atmosphere in the 80s is just perfect, there are some flawless shots in the movie as well and the scenario of wealth dispair felt so realistic. It's such a troubled city and the movie captures all that dispair in a way no movie has ever done before, it's just an outstanding work.Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker, a mentally ill character, is the best I have seen in years, his daily struggle is just fantastic, the character development, the makeup, the balance between total madness and serious moments was a joy to watch, throughout the movie the viewer can only sympathize with such a conflicted character. The way Phoenix acted in some scenes is unbelievable, I was shocked with his performance, it felt like I was inside the character's mind and to achieve that is just splendid.Overall, Joker raised a lot of questions about society and it was such a pleasure to watch it all unfold on the big screen. Todd Phillips masterpiece achieved such a disturbed and unique feeling, few movies in the history of Cinema have achieved.",1
283,The best film I have ever watched. There will be no better villain than Joker by Jaoquin,1
284,"A masterpiece, simply spectacular, made with love and brutal care, the best of the last 10/10 years",1
285,"As a big fan of batman mythos, I was really excited to see that movie. However, after all the comments and articles about how this movie is absolutely removed from everything from the comics, I expected just a good movie with a great performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Then, when I actually saw the movie I was really surprised. Because not only it was a great movie itself, but it was also a brilliant version of that world from the comic books and a Joker himself. It really reminded me of ''the Killing Joke'' that did something similar with the character of Joker. It made you feel empathy towards him, but at the same time you were not rooting for him, it made him more human. He was just a crazy person that had a rough life. He wasn't really a supervillain, which explains why Batman was even trying to help him in the end, but it was too late. Well, that's basically what happens in this movie. It just chooses a different path. It doesn't make him crazy through a chan of chemicals. It doesn't do it in one day. A few days. Or maybe even a life. You can see why Batman would do the same thing. Why he would try to help him. But just like in the comic, because of everything that happens in this movie, it would have been too late for that. So, as a fan of batman comic books, I was extremely happy. But again, it was also a great film in general. Cinematography, script, acting, directing, the score. Especially the score! It's the best score that I've heard this year. And of course, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is just incredible. It's hard even to describe, you just have to see it. And no surprise that there is so much controversy around this film. Because it is controversial. It talks about difficult topics, but it doesn't hold one particular point of view on them. It's up to you how to interpret it. And I just wish people would try to look at this film from different angles, rather than just claim that their point of view is the only one.",1
286,"Masterpiece. the most exiting movie of 2019. Best actor, director, music al is perfect.",1
287,"The perfect combination between Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of comedy"", however ""Joker"" is a unique and original masterpiece! About Joaquin's interpretation, i can't say it is the best interpretation i have ever seen, because that would mean to compare it to other interpretations, and that would be an insult for Joaquin Phoenix! What he did in this film is absolutely uncomparable! No award can express the real value of his interpretation!",1
288,The movie is terrific!! i didnt think anyone could surpass Heath Ledger but he is up there,1
289,"Joker is a movie that penetrates you, period. You don't feel like something is missing in the plot, its just the opposite! The movie gives content to understand and feel the story of The Joker in ways that a common movie viewer cant remember to have demanded in other movie experiences. Its so piercing that you will actually have a new discovered sense of understanding about movies. I loved the movie, but I don't know if I can say that I was happy watching it. That was my new discovered sense of understanding and feeling movies. I just loved the story that was being told. For me, it wasn't a movie.IT WAS KNOWLEDGE BEING ACQUIRED!  PS: Phoenix? Perfect.",1
290,"Фильм очень атмосферный и арт хаусный, качественная работа оператора и прекрасная актёрская игра Хоакина Феникса и Роберта Де Ниро . Бегите на фильм пока не поздно!!! Это картина точно удостоена внимания, нежели жвачка от Marvel .",1

The cinematography was great.The songs gave to and enhaced the scenes.It made me live the journey, understand the struggle ,and feel sorry for him.It gave no why and how's at least to me.Following the psychotic mind of Arthurand actually y following up with his corrupted logic. It's the perfect chaos...",1
293,The best movie i have ever seen.The music and dancing is so good And i just love it,1

A story never counted in this universe.The introduction of joker’s crazy way it’s very detailed and the new way that the story takes I talk about the relationship between Thomas Wayne and Joker in the film universe is very interesting.The only thing I can say is that DC has a new opportunity in the market.Good job, Congratulations",1
295,Awesome... Must watch. The acting was amazing this is a master piece don't miss it,1
296,"Reminder: the only difference between a troll and a critic is that a critic gets paid to write garbage.Now. This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in my life and I can't wait to see it again next week. Joaquin phoenix drives deeper into insanity as society kicks him when hes already down, and he laughs because of his nervous ticks. You feel bad for him while you also know what hes doing is wrong as he becomes the joker. Go see the movie, you won't regret it.",1

298,"A masterpiece, the best in 2019 and one of the best I’ve ever seen. Phoenix did his best and more, and he WILL get that Oscar once and for all. Arthur’s character is sad and miserable, got nothing from life expect more sadness, he is maybe mad but in the and, when he says that to Murray is true and fair, some of us still have that life some of us had that life, and we all understand what suffers Arthur. He is a villain but he is also a hero in a way.",1
299,Sheer Masterpiece .. . Joaquin Phoenix's act is like a gem found shining among brittle things . . . My advice is do not get inspired by the character rather just applaud his performance . .,1
300,Amazing movie.. Also don't by what the critics say rather go by the audience score. Because that's what the reality is.,1
301,"The critic score is not representative, and it is actually quite inappropriate for ""professionals"" to allow their cultural and or political bias to influence their score so heavily.I watched this, and I don't see the ""danger"".  The movie was excellent, and it was an interesting take on the character's origin.The acting is also actually quite excellent and not ""try-hard"" as aforesaid reviewers may want you to believe.Should DC continue to build a universe on the back off of this, they would finally have something.",1
302,"A magnificent achievement. Phenomenal performance, nuanced story, thought provoking narrative. All beautifully shot in a compelling film the likes of which Hollywood has all but forgotten how to make these days.A rare gem. See it.",1

310,"Simply a masterpiece in almost every area that's explored by Joaquin Phoenix no matter what the critics say, it's obvious that the film has been a major success by the public scores and reviews",1
311,"Joker is an incredible achievement in cinema, packed with gorgeous cinematography, an astounding soundtrack and an impeccable performance from Joaquin Phoenix.",1
312,"It took just a few inferences that ""Joker"" is a prequel to the earliest Batman comics and movies, let alone only the Batman character.  As opposed to typical fluff and cartoonish action scenes, however, this film doesn't horse around with pale expectations from the supervillain-following crowd.  ""Joker"" takes itself entirely seriously and unapologetic in it's many-faceted presentation of the main character, played by former renegade actor Joachin Phoenix, with the apparent attempt to dissect this guy's psyche' within the framework of a totally serious explanation of humour vs. tragedy and evil vs. good.  To the surprise of few, these analytics go only so far, leaving the audience to stitch the elements together for themselves.The effort was noble, successful in a limited sort of way given how hampered this film is by some rather intrusive flaws.  First and foremost to my eye -- or more precisely, to my ear -- is miscasting Phoenix as a clown who doesn't quite get the clown-laugh down convincingly; then again, perhaps this was an intentional faux pas (either by Direction or good Acting) in conveying Arthur Fleck's (Joker's) strain and frustration in playing the part of a professional funny man, when his personal life is in ruins.  Personally, I found the rendition more ear-hurting and off-color than convincing, but who can say ?The other quite noticeable bug-a-boo in this deeply disturbing tale is how, once in a while, random elements of older films are deliberately inserted into the action, not so much to enhance the story line but to throw in talking points among viewers.  The most recognizable was the choice of Robert Di Niro as TV variety show host Murray Franklin in, for those who can recall, a blatant re-seating of the same star as wannabe show host Rupert Pupkin in 1982's black comedy ""The King of Comedy"", easily a better and more engaging flick.  Tho it may be a facsimile of ""Joker""'s intent to date it relative to its setting and scenes' demands, Franklin's jokes and one-liners were awfully lite and minimally funny -- once again a probable counter-play to Fleck's ironic humorous twists, given that he is by this point in the picture revealed as a murderer.Another example of surreal connection to an earlier cinematic work was when rioting clowns protesting the mayoral campaign of Tom Wayne -- that's right, the father of future crime-fighter Batman -- began chanting something along the lines of ""We're mad as hell and won't take it anymore !!"" a la 1975's landmark movie ""Network"" starring Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway.  Perhaps this critic is too dense to pick up on some deep significance of this ""borrowed"" mass quotation, yet all I know is its use was so distracting that it only served as a mild giggle, tending to take away from the built-up drama of the story.It is understandable the upset many have over the release of this subject matter in a time of firearm mayhem, but what really bothers me is the timing vis-a-vis Halloween.  Here's hoping sanity and security prevail, so as not to end up with a Thursday-Bloody-Thursday . . .",1
313,"Don't listen to the critic reviews. This movie is amazing. Joaquin nailed it 100% when it comes to playing the Joker with the laugh, the tone of his voice, his facial expressions and importantly the acting. The made the right choice picking him over Jared Leto. The way the movie is executed and doesn't give away too much with what's happened or what's going to happen leaves you at the edge of your seat asking yourself ""What's going to happen""/""What's happened?"". The plot twist(s) prevents the movie from being predictable and too linear and leaves you discussing the movie after you watched it which is mostly a sign of a good movie if the discussions are positive.Overall, the cinematics of the movie are amazing and the movie wouldn't get this rating if it wasn't for Joaquin's amazing acting, which made me restore my faith in Hollywood picking good actors who can act and not just because of Political Correctness.",1
314,"Probably one of the best movies I've seen in 2019, or even the past years. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an incredible performance combined with a beautifully written and twisted storyline, which had me breathless once everything started to get wild in the last 20-30 minutes. Go watch it, it's definately worth it.",1
315,This was one of the bedt comic inspierd movies I've seen since the dark knight more Dc and marvel movies need to be dark gritty and violent like this phoenix anf the movie deserves awards,1
316,One of the best movies I have watched so far this year. Brilliant acting by Joaquin phoenix. And great cinematography.!,1
317,"Fenomenal, cambia la perspectiva del cine y los superhéroes, la considero una película de culto",1
318,"""Joker"" descenso a la locura (crítica sin spoilers)Ayer pude ver Joker en una función ""XD 2D"" y sin duda alguna puedo decir que es una de las películas mas honestas de este último año, tiene un grado de cuidado bastante enfermizo, todo, absolutamente todo me ha encantado.El soundtrack te envuelve en cada momento para ponerte en constante tensión ya que a pesar de que muchas canciones son alegres o animadas, combinadas de tal forma con las escenas de esta genial película siempre te deja un sabor de alerta.La fotografía es alucinante, pocas películas tienen tan buena fotografía como esta, grandes planos que podrías hacerlos pinturas y colgarlas en la pared.Para actuaciones tenemos al que realmente es la estrella de la película Joaquin Phoenix que interpreta no solo al payaso trastornado de ciudad gótica de manera genial, sino también al hombre común antes de transformarse en el Joker, en ambos papeles se desenvuelve de manera tan genial que llegas a empatizar de manera tóxica con este personaje, Robert de Niro también hace muy bien su papel junto a Zazie Bets, pero realmente la actuación de Phoenix opaca por completo el resto de interpretaciones, tanto es así que en lo único que pensaras después de ver esta película sera en el Joker de Phoenix, yo por ejemplo ni hable de Robert de Niro en todo el camino de vuelta a casa con mi enamorada.El guión que es de las cosas obviamente más importantes de cualquier película, es sin dudas muy interesante aunque no muy complicado, creo yo que esta película no desea abarcar una trama muy compleja, sí, toca temas políticos, sociales, algunos trastornos e injusticia pero lo hace de una manera bastante simple, como un ejemplo : ""el rico solo se preocupa por él y su círculo, o la sociedad de hoy en día es indiferente"" son temas que no son muy complejos y la película sabe que los entenderás sin abarcar en exceso en ellos, a pesar de eso la película esta muy bien construida y parece que algunos creen que es algo lenta pero para mí la actuación de Phoenix hace la película muy llevadera y te deja con ganas de más.En cuanto adaptación, me parece que la película cumple perfectamente con llevar la total esencia del Joker a la pantalla grande, el narcisismo de este como en los cómics, los movimientos, el trastorno, la risa y la frialdad para cometer crímenes son lo que encamina perfectamente lo que un fan puede pensar cuando hablan del Joker.El director o guionista sin duda solo con la película se nota que son fans de Batman y de su archienemigo Joker ya que al menos para mí esta bastante inspirada en ""The killing Joke"" de Alan Moore, hay muchas referencias al mundo DC que se te vienen a la cabeza como el Joker de ""Batman el caballero de la noche regresa parte 2 (cómic y película animada)"" e incluso la serie Gotham parecen inspirar este fantástico trabajo de Todd Phillips.Sin embargo a pesar de todas estas cosas buenas técnicamente hablando, si es recomendable tener creo que fuerza para verla, ya que sin duda es una tragedia que deberás ver sabiendo justamente eso, es muy depresiva, incluso abarca el terror en varios momentos, bastante cruda y la clasificación ""R"" no lo tiene solo para atraer a más público, realmente hace un buen uso de esta categoría.Sin duda Joker es una película que es difícil de ver pero que todos deberían verla y una muy fuerte candidata para los oscars en todos los aspectos posibles, que esperas, ve al cine y juzga tu mismo/a.Calificación: 10/10 (seré honesto no estoy nominando todos los aspectos de esta película a los oscars sin pensar que ha acertado al máximo en cada punto)",1
319,"This might be my favorite and best DC Film since Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" , Joaquin Phoenix Performance as a Joker is so Spot On, that ever scene that he's in is haunting and that makes this film a stand out to me, and the Music Score is just so Fitting to the Film.Don't let the critics fool you with their low scores on this film cause of a damn controversy.I Recommend this film to any DC Fans, Joker Fans, or Joaquin Phoenix Himself, cause you are doing yourself a treat by watching this MASTERPIECE!!!",1
320,"Just got back from seeing The Joker and felt compelled to make an account just to review this movie. When Heath Ledger died shortly after playing the role of Joker in the Dark Knight I was devastated. I never thought we would see another Joker who could fill his shoes.Thank goodness for Joaquin Phoenix and his suburb acting skills. The way he fleshed out the Joker and really made you feel the mental illness was jaw dropping. This movie was a rollercoaster of emotions that peaked at the very end of the film. I knew this film would be good but I had no idea it would be this good.I cannot believe (actually I can) how the critics have rated this film. They have allowed their political views to pollute a movie that hasn’t the hint of politics in it. They shouldn’t be allowed to review any movie. If you are a Joker fan then you owe it to yourself to see this movie. I will warn you it is certainly more graphic (violent) than the Dark Knight, but not for cheap thrills. It feels very balanced with the progression of his character throughout the film. Stop reading this now and go see this movie. Forget what those “critics” are saying. They are lying to you.",1
321,Best movie of the year. The soundtrack is incredible. The cinematography is incredible. This is not a super-hero movie. This is a Joker movie.,1
322,Brilliant film. The critics are obviously butt hurt! Checks pretty much every box.,1
323,Believe the hype. The Joker is a masterpiece!!! Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible!!!,1
324,"The movie is stunning, beautiful each frame can be stopped and it will be enough to take what it want's to show and its approach on mental illness the execution of the said, by Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is something which everyone has to see it once in their lifetime.The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, It also borrows heavily from movies of that era, including ""The King of Comedy"" and especially ""Taxi Driver"", in some scenes almost to the point of being a rip-off, which works wonders for it. It feels less like a Superhero/Villain Movie but more of a study.The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement. Violence is what happens in between and labeling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.Finally I think if you change the name of movie and the characters portrayed in it and the integrity of the movie and what they are trying to tell you remains the same then that movie deserves it's praise. Which can not be said about a lot of Superhero movies these days.",1
325,"Although Joker is an origin story, Phillips has said this was meant as a stand-alone film, and it functions as one.Rather than being an obvious base for a franchise, he wanted to make a film inspired by a different time in American filmmaking and was particularly inspired by two of Martin Scorsese’s movies, Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. And that he’s accomplished, for better and for worse.  One of the criticisms of the film is that it’s a bit too much “Taxi Driver Goes to Gotham.”  Joker is in many ways an homage to those films. At the same time, Phillips hasn’t simply made a replica.  By setting this in the past, before Bruce Wayne has become Batman, Phillips has kept Gotham’s cartoonish bad guys out of this. Instead, we have a much more complex story, of a man who’s genuinely motivated to be as good as he knows how to be, and has that eroded in ways that we can see and understand.It’s easy enough to see him as a psychopath. But Fleck is a person who descends into his madness for reasons we can see and perhaps even understand. There’s another stream to this film. Fleck commits his act of savage violence while wearing his clown make-up. That oddity is interpreted as an act of rebellion by Gotham’s disenfranchised to wear clown masks in solidarity, and then commit acts increasingly violent civil disobedience.We are, of course in Gotham, not the real world. Gotham is a city that is a dystopian version of New York, and a version of humanity working at a heightened-reality level of antagonism and violence.And yet, in a time in our history where people feel deep divisions, the movie is perhaps a little too close to home for comfort.At the centre of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix, who won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for this role. Phoenix is simply one of the best actors in contemporary film, with a staggering range. He’s an un-showy actor who does a deep dive into his characters, and unlike many Hollywood stars, he’s willing to take on roles that repulse.   In Joker, he disappears into Fleck and takes him from a dutiful son, to a confused man, to the psychopathic Joker character in a seamless arc. When he finally becomes Joker, Phoenix does a dance down a staircase, as if all burdens of the world have been lifted off of him. He has been released, and is embracing himself with a kind of joy that belongs to the damned. It’s a glorious performance and a terrifying moment in a film that revels in its dark heart.",1
326,"What a masterclass movie it was. Such delutional yet beautiful. The rise of supervillain will lead you to some other world. Best performance by Joaquin.. Great music and great Cinematography. Thanks to the whole crew of Joker, for this great movie.The best of 2019,undoubtedly.",1

332,A wonderful masterpiece by Todd Phillips And a great artistic acting by Joaquin Phoenix Excellent movie ,1
333,"Before any of us see a single frame of Todd Phillips’ ‘Joker’ we’re all well aware of the film’s many plaudits and longtime critical acclaim.  Even prior articles of our own have covered the fact that ‘Joker’ received an eight minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, or that it also took home the Golden Lion, the festival’s award for best film.Based on the competition, such illustrious awards may very well be warranted, but over time, reaction to ‘Joker’ seemed to falter, starting with the movie losing out to Taika Waititi’s 'Jojo Rabbit' at the Toronto International Film Festival.  Even now, ‘Joker’ is only garnering a 69% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 58 on Metacritic.  Frankly, we don’t disagree.For as much as we appreciate the grittiness and stripped-down nature of the film, which represents a welcomed departure from the typical superhero/supervillain genre (or action genre in general), the film simply has too many flaws to earn our outright acclaim.For example, a lot of the gratuitous violence just doesn’t feel organic.  Instead, it feels like Phillips knew he needed to show some gruesomeness—or perhaps he just wanted to ramp up the shock factor—so he wedged a few bloody scenes into the script.  Worse, a lot of the scenes were shot using a heavy filter, which to us made it feel like we we watching a movie-within-a-movie, which itself provided an emotional filter distancing us from the story unfolding on screen.Lastly, leading up to this weekend, plenty of people have made comparisons between ‘Joker’ and Martin Scorsese’s ‘Taxi Driver.’  Sure, Todd Phillips borrows a lot of imagery from the classic, especially the handgun gesture Arthur Fleck uses all too often.  But if the same people are comparing the two in terms of quality and merit, they are severely overselling ‘Joker,’ severely underselling ‘Taxi Driver,’ or both.",1
334,"An amazing adaptation of several Joker origin stories overlayed with other other works in film history. This doesn't make the move any less creative. Movies like avatar have had stories that are old and have been told numerous times, but it's how they present them that makes them stand out. Joker is no different. Filled with social undertones related to current times, Joker takes what was old and makes it new again in brilliant ways.Some of ""professional"" reviews are missing the point and even outright lying about it. Saying it has no batman in it, is disingenuous at best. You could argue that this is a prequel to the Dark Knight series, with the same amounts of darkness and even more realism. On the surface, it is about anarchy. Did you expect something different? Do you know Joker? Below the surface are undertones about inequality, social duties, and freedoms that we're allowed and our inhumanity in daily life.To all the people saying that Joker is glorified and the movie sets him up as hero, you're just wrong. No one sees him as a hero. Understanding why someone does something, doesn't mean you agree with it. Saying a kid has mental issues as a reason he shoots up a school, doesn't mean you agree with it. You just understand it. Joker here is no different. Overall a great movie and something I will watch several times, even before it hits other formats. Personally, I believe everyone needs to watch it, regardless of whether you agree with it or not. It contains messages that need to be said/heard.",1
335,"Joker is a masterpiece, a transcendent piece of cinema that will endure time. Joaquin Phoenix embodies the character like nobody else did ever, he becomes the Joker and I only hope he wins the Oscar to best actor. This is a dark drama that will leave no one indifferent.",1
336,"""When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker?""Yes, Joaquin, we can!""Joker"" is a film that is wonderful in everything.  A wonderful camera work, a great soundtrack, a beautiful and well-coordinated plot and, of course, an acting game, God bless Joaquin Phoenix, how he played ... We always saw that the Joker appeared from falling into a vat with chemicals or was some unattainable evil, but  now... now we see just a person in a terrible society of vices.  Many unfairly criticize this picture for the fact that it can push someone to violence or justify it.  But if you have a desire to commit violence, then the problem is only in you.  This film does not justify violence, it shows how we create it ourselves.  What do we get if we put a mentally unhealthy person in a society that will persecute and mock him?  We will get what we deserve ...",1

The plotting is strong, the pacing is right, there are no odd, out-of-place sequences.  It takes itself seriously in order to do it right. It's shocking at points.  It makes you uncomfortable.  Joaquin absolutely NAILS it.  You are watching The Joker.  It's truly amazing. It's a work of Art.",1

340,"If a child is not embraced by the village, he will burn the village down to feel its warmth.This movie is a grimy, depressive arthouse trudge down the stairs of madness and corruption. Joaquin Phoenix gives the best performance of his life as Arthur Fleck, a man who seems to be born on the wrong side of the bed. Whereas Ledger's Joker says ""all you need is one bad day to reduce a man to madness,"" Phoenix's Joker seems to say ""all you need is one good day to save a man from madness.""This movie is a masterpiece. Please go see it. Every level is excellent. Phoenix delivers the ultimate performance, the soundtrack is haunting, the message is badly needed. I will see this movie again and again.",1

Now I'm starting to wonder if there's even any point of movie critics, since their opinions are rendered useless.

344,The acting is just brilliant.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time,1
345,"This movie is a masterpiece, one of the best movie in the decade, definitely deserve oscar",1
346,"Fantastic, not an easy watch for everyone but an amazing cinematic experience. Incredible build up all the way to the ending, as well with some twists that test your mind!",1
347,"Movies are created to portray an emotion through a story, Joker did this very well by making me fell this emotion extremely well.",1
348,This is a bone chilling amalgamation of classic comics and classic films that results in story who’s sum is arguably even greater than its parts.  Joaquin Phoenix delivers the performance of a lifetime.,1
349,One of the best films ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
350,Magnificent...Definitely best movie in the year ... and it will be remembered over years,1
351,Brilliant go see this movie. What is the best movie made this year and probably this decade,1
352,"Потрясающий фильм с великолепными актерами, работой операторов, музыкой, - претендующий для меня на картину года.",1
353,"Phoenix gives a captivating performance. It very well may be the best mental breakdown ever captured on film. The violence is rare, but hits with a really hard and brutal punch.The class warfare aspect of the film feels a bit heavy handed, and portrays the rich as villains in an almost cartoonish way. This is not a fun film to watch, but is a great character piece. Strongly recommend",1
354,"Now I’m not gonna say that Joker was a psychological masterpiece and that it showcased the true art of cinema or some crap like that. For me Joker was great because it was different, it took its time to make you understand the character of Arthur Fleck and the plot was well written.First off to get it out of the way let me address the so called “controversy” of this film in my opinion. To me for the most part I never really saw any controversy, I knew going in that Joker was a villain and I expected the movie to show me the violent acts of the Joker character and yes some of the violence is brutal but was never glorified or overblown like in some R-rated movies(lookin at you Hellboy, no cap) but the purpose of the movie was to show you how someone can go from being a normal person and be broken by life and turn into a psychopath.Okay now let’s move on to the performances, I’m sure you’ve heard it somewhere and I’m gonna say it again Joaquin Phoenix was dope playing the role of Arthur Fleck/Joker. I usually don’t care for the oscars but I would like this man to win one. Joaquin made me feel sympathy for Arthur throughout the movie and potrayed Arthur’s mental health issues perfectly and when he turned into the Joker...I enjoyed his performance man. Robert Deniro as Murray Franklin (a talk show host) was good, Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck (Arthur’s mother) also gave a convincing performance as well. Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne was also interesting as the movie gave a very different version of Thomas Wayne from other Batman related movies. The character of Thomas Wayne was almost cruel and colder than any other versions from the comic or movies and I appreciated that a lot.Zazie Beetz as Sophie was meh I mean she didn’t give a bad performance by any means it’s just that she was used for a certain plot point and twist that I saw coming from a mile away and I felt that her arc or character even was unneeded and her contribution to Arthur’s story would have been fine without her character.One thing I was worried about was that people in the movie were going to be unrealistically cruel to Arthur, however that wasn’t the case the movie handled that part pretty well and again I appreciated  that. The story of Arthur becoming Joker took its time and didn’t rush his transformation, the movie really made you understand Arthur’s life, his dreams, mental state, relationships with certain people and his interactions before everything turns upside down and starts doing Joker ish. Arthur’s downfall was heartbreaking to watch and you felt the consequences of being cruel to other people.However although I really liked that the movie took its time with the story and was really patient....I don’t really like the slow burn feel to this movie , its  it’s not that i require an action sequence every 15 minutes it’s just that some movies take unnecessary time and energy trying to deepen the story or character motivations and the pace of the movie can become very slow and drag on. Joker was never 100% boring to me but there were times that the movie almost became a drag to watch. The third act alone is a solid 10/10 you not only get to see the Joker character in full force but the themes that the movie was trying to convey come full circle, it became brutal, almost heartbreaking, tense and wild. Especially with its themes about people being unnecessarily cruel to one another. The key theme about how someone can turn evil after a series of bad things happening to someone, being an outcast in society basically how the world can be a cruel place and how some people will break under that pressure.Also what I really really liked that the movie never preaches about these themes but mostly uses the show don’t tell method almost the entire movie except very few instances whereby the movie tells you it’s themes through characters. Without saying too much my favorite scene of the movie was the interaction between Joker and  Murray.The movie had a dark tone to it and worked really well, the movie wasn’t  dark for the sake of being dark and there were some funny moments, not a lot since it was a very serious but had funny moments mostly dark humor I mean it’s a Joker movie so there are. A few nitpicks are that you don’t get to see the Joker character for long until the last act of the movie I get it’s an origin story but I wished there could have been a little more Joker scenes but it’s not a negative point but a wish really. Not many characters were really as interesting as Arthur Fleck or Murray and maybe Penny.Joker was great, one of the best DC and comic book movies of all time, had funny some scenes The Arthur Fleck character was amazing, the story was well written,when Arthur became Joker it was really awesome. The movie had really great themes but the movie is slow at times and had some uninteresting characters but what really matters, Joker put a smile on my face.",1
355,"I generally agree with the consensus of critics, but this film is wildly underrated.Saw it last night in IMAX and can truly say there is no justifiable reason to give this film such a mediocre rating. The film is truly a remarkable piece of cinema. As mentioned a thousand times, Joaquin Phoenix gives a Oscar-worthy performance and the filmmaking is truly masterful. Don't expect a comic book popcorn movie. It's a dark, artistic character study which stands as a clear zeitgeist for the times we're living in.",1
356,"Me parece una exelente película que muestra un buen inicio para el personaje, mostrando las diferentes facetas que lo hicieron convertirse en lo que es.",1
357,"Una pelicula cruda y real, excelente actuacion de phonix, para mi el segundo mejor joker despues de ledge. Y para la gente que dice que insita a la violencia no opino lo mismo",1
358,"Powerful, riveting performance by Phoenix in an overall solid film. Best actor Oscar all but confirmed.",1
359,"Too dark? Isn't that why it's R rated? This is a movie about how a villain came to be, not some nice superhero saving a town. Joker is brutal and unflinching, doesn't care about your feelings, and ridiculously but beatifically dark and gritty. Joaquin Phoenix really put his heart and soul into his role and I admire that. I wish I could watch it for the first time again because it was seriously brilliant.",1
360,"Joker is a brilliant in depth character study of a mentally ill societal outcast. The film is an ominous take on the origin of the famous DC villain, The Joker. The film is a spectacular display of mental illness, violence and societal divide. But at its core what makes the film so amazing is Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of The Joker. His eerie performance makes you sympathise with his character but at the same time chastise the decisions he makes as he descends into insanity. The combination of Todd Phillips's Martin Scorsese inspired direction and Joaquin Phoenix's outstandingly realistic performance really make this film something to behold. A much watch for fans of the Batman mythos and fans of film in general.",1
361,"Wow, a true masterpiece and im surprised to see a movie of these acting-qualitys in 2019!",1
362,"**** insane......I mean damn how could someone act to real , he made people like a villain and that too without any super powers , just a sad person.. struggling in the world #oscarforjoaquin",1
363,"Fantastically present with great story telling, real flash and blood character and scene setting. Story reflect harsh reality of the society, what we trying to ignore.",1
364,A masterpiece which depict the life if a mentally ill. Jacquin's performance deserves an Oscar,1
365,I normally don't write movie reviews but I believe if you are a fan of media that challenges the way you think then Joker is a must see.Phoenix presents us a character that is complex and stands as a main character that whilst morally challenged we still root for their ideals in the end. Every actor in this film showed clear passion to the art they was presenting and that is extremely surprising especially looking at DC's previous track record. In all honesty Joker is the best depiction of the character I have ever seen Heath Ledger would be proud of the work Phoenix has done and I would love to see more of his portrayal of this beloved character.Joker is not only the best film to be released this year but one of the best films of past 10 years.,1
366,"Joaquín Phoenix esta insuperable, de las mejores actuaciones y de los mejores joker que he visto en mi vida. Es capaz de transmitirte cualquier estado de animo con su actuación, el guion esta muy bien pensado y deja muy buenos mensajes que te hacen pensar. Por ultimo esta pelicula puede hacer que el universo DC reviva y pueda pelear contra el de marvel. Espero que lo hagan y no lo dejen asi.Pd: oscar para Joaquín Phoenix ya!",1
367,"Amazing Movie! Lack of CGI but in a Good Way. Definitely Dark and Unexpected. Overall, A Great Origin Story for One of the Greatest Villains of all Time",1
368,"This is a great piece of art! The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking! Joaquin Phoenix is definitely one of the best actor period, his performance was out of this world.",1
369,Best movie in 2019! Masterpiece from begining to the end of movie! Last 20 min are best,1
370,The “critics” are full of it with an average of 59. This was a masterpiece.,1
371,The best movie of the year and one of the best movies in history. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best joker ever seen and he deserves the oscar. GO WATCH IT NOW if you haven't.,1
372,Um dos maiores filmes baseados em HQ de todos os tempos. A forma como aborda um tema delicado como a doença de nossa sociedade é brilhante. Joaquin Phoenix incorporou o personagem e nos proporcionou um espetáculo com sua performance,1
373,Incredible movie which yet again proves the critics don’t know what they’re talking about. Leo has a contender for best actor. Amazing.,1
374,"Es una película que es muy entretenida, da en que pensar y sobre todo, a pesar de que humaniza al joker, logra su cometido, se merece un Óscar",1
375,"I watched it, let it digest a bit and I still think insanely highly of it. Phoenix gives a career-best performance that all but guarantees the best actor oscar. Phillips crafts a world that sucks you in from the very first scene and doesn't let you go until you start to walk out of the theatre.I think what I love the most about it is how well it captivates you. You sympathize with Arthur, You feel like the world is crashing around you as much as it does with Arthur. There isn't a single moment that happens that causes a disconnect, that puts this film outside the realm of possibility. It's very much grounded in reality and that is what makes it work so well.",1
376,The Best DC movie. With a good history. Better than Avengers EndGame. Congratulations to DV,1
377,Joker is a must see. Phoenix does an excellent job portraying the Joker. The movie is a fresh and gritty take on DC universe. I would see this movie again.,1
378,"""Taxi Driver"" meets ""Batman"", dark maudlin origin tale of comic book super villain told eerily real to today's issues.  Too bad for some shoddy period flaws (slobs, if you point to 1981 then follow through in every detail)!  Joaquin Phoenix is an over-rated actor, but here is worthy as he was playing Johnny Cash.",1
379,"Un chef d’œuvre qui je l'espère inspirera des films d'un style nouveau chez DC ou Marvel, plus mature, plus sombre, plus jubilatoire.",1
380,"Amazing Movie. Color tone 10/10, music 10/10 and can't rate Phoenix, he was just EPIC! Watched it second time.",1
381,"as someone who has seen and dealt with mental illness from a healthcare workers perspective, this was an excellent performance by Joaquin Phoenix. was enthralled throughout. my new favorite movie . would gladly pay theater prices to see it again.",1
382,"A confused representation of insanity from a perspective of a sane person, a celebration of madness and chaos.At last, I have watched one of the most anticipated movies of this year.I experienced sadness, creepiness, joy, rage, confusion altogether, and it felt good.The story was above average, sometimes the director seemed confused about what he's trying to say.There were so many beautiful distinct pieces scattered throughout the film that gives you chills but ultimately they failed to form a complete landscape, eventually it became a gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.It criticizes our self-centered, pretentious, empathy less society but ironically the movie itself falls under its own sword.Welcome, Tod Phillips to the big boy's club! His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly! That's why it failed to become a complete cinematic art rather than a montage of eye pleasing scenes, and nothing more.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this movie is definitely one of the most exciting movie of this year.My Rating:7.5/10",1
383,"Me encanto la actuación de Joaquín Phoenix, La historia es diferente a los que nos muestran en los cómics pero esta es más realista lo que me gusta aun mas",1
384,"When scenes of mere dancing gave me chills, a simple smirk on the lift lingers, and depressed laughs deeply broke my heart - come take my money!",1
385,"One breath masterpiece movie, amazing acting by Phoenix!!! I was so sucked into the movie that I forgot I need to go to the bathroom for like the last hour of it...",1
386,"This is a great movie. Please take note of the names of the critics who scored this movie less than a 60/100. Please never take them seriously again and let the publications that they work for know about it. Many of them have reviewed the movie on ideological grounds, even though the movie itself is not ideological. The flaw these critics detected is that the movie does not give the appropriate nods to diversity and equality that they expect, so they instantly have concluded it is a subversive master plot by white nationalist incels. Please don't read their reviews, they will only make you dumber.",1
387,.best movie ever idk who dafuk!!!! Gave metracritic a license to do what they die. But they need joker to stab em in the face!!!,1
388,Didn't expect this to be so good. Amazing and deep story told here.Go and experience this film yourself !,1
390,"Amazing movie, joaquin was flawless. A really refreshing movies in this wave of mainstream super hero movies",1
392,"Wow!!!! Espectacular!!! Óscar in the bag, excelent photography, script and súper acting",1
393,"I mean- come on critics!!!!!! That is the most hateful and  envious rating i have ever seen in my entire life. If someone does soemthing great, you call it too much, if someone does soemthing amazng you call it too less. You guys are  really what  Homelander said about human beings - **** Cocksuckers"". A disgrace - this film is superb, amazing - and really i think you did not understand thid film - you are the ones  that create people like the Joker. Phoenix, Philippe did a masterpiece of this decade. The Dark Knight and Joker were the most determining films of this century. And you bunch of ignorants cannot stop this.",1
394,"The mighty work of director Todd Phelps, the events in a beautiful sequence",1
395,The best film based on a comic book character since The Dark Knight. Joker is a great character study with a phenomenal performance by the great Joaquin Phoenix. This film has no filter. It'll make you feel for the character as he evolves into the Joker. A man with no rules. There was one scene in particular that was so intense but at the end of it it makes you laugh so hard I mean I just lost it. Don't wanna spoil anything. Just go watch the Joker if you're looking for a deep dive character film.,1
396,"We can see a Joker from various perspectives here, good or bad, right or wrong. My emotions seem to be played through the movie. Shoutout to Todd Philips for this and Joaquin Phoenix unbelievable oscar worthy performance.Superb, SStuning, SSSensational, SSSSpectacular. the most serious DC Movie.",1
397,"Fantastic movie! It had great acting, directing, cinematography and score. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal.",1
398,"An emphatical portrait on Arthur Fleck's descent into being Joker. While predictable, the rich dialogue makes it worth watching. The film can be polarizing, however, with viewers expecting it to be something like The Dark Knight being left potentially disappointed.",1
399,"I believe this movie shows that critics job should stop by now and leave future judgment and reviews for the audience.It is a focused story on a a single character, but well written and developed in a way that you will feel his transformation.Great performance that cannot be criticized by any means.",1
400,The criticism of this movie is absurd! This is a masterpiece. The way Joaquin Phoenix played joker was amazing. You could tell he put effort. Screw the critics!,1
401,"Dont let these critics reviews affect you, joker is actually a very decent movie with an outstanding performance by Joaquin phoenix",1
402,"I cant believe I came on this page to see this score from the critics, they must be total morons to consider this a sub-par or bad movie. It is an incredible piece of art that portrays how if society constantly neglects or beats someone down they can become a monster. The acting is incredible , it is shot fantastically and one thing I didn't hear many talk about but I personally thought was brilliant was the soundtrack. There is very few scenes of violence in this movie but when it happens it stings and makes you go ''jesus'' ....is does not romanticise violence or make it seem like an answer to a problem at all. To the contrary it makes you lose your sympathy for Arthur Fleck's struggle's in life, which to me, is the best possible way violence could be used in as realistic a movie as this. Ignore the critics, this film is incredible, comic book fan or not.",1
403,Perfection in all ways. Phoenix reserves a Oscar. Using Joker to discuss politics was brilliant,1
404,"""When you bring me my Oscar, can you introduce me as Joker?""Sublime acting, outstanding cinematography and a subtle DC style dark atmosphere from start to finish (finally). Absolute masterpiece!",1
405,"Menacing, Mercurial, Unpredictable, will keep you on edge what mischief Arthur might pull at the end... it can be relatable to some who are going through depression, there is an old saying that ""there is a little bit of devil in ourselves"" well after watching this chilling masterpiece there can be new saying and that is ""there is a bit of joker inside all of us""",1
406,Brilliant movie that requires multiple viewings to grasp the smaller details. Don't trust the critics. Same clowns that give every marvel or disney movie a 10 before it even comes out.Watched it 3 times and have came up with 3 different conclusions to the ending. Not many movies can do that in this era.,1
407,"This film left me floored—speechless. It was a Scorsese type film in a comic book world. It is DARK, brutal, beautiful, classic. A true masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for Joker. The cinematography was outstanding, just gorgeous. The score was chilling and his laughter was uncomfortable but classic.",1
408,A must see masterpiece true comic book cinema greatness go see this film now,1
409,"The best dark movie. A great acting. Danger, is so sick!. I don't understand how there are people that not love this movie.",1
410,"Amazing! If you think the movie is offensive, stay at your **** home and do not disturb",1
411,"Incredible direction, casting and cinematography. Wat an absolute treat to watch this masterpiece.",1
412,Uncomfortably Satisfying. Out of this whole year I have never watched a movie that played with my emotions quite like this film. Joker is a character study on one of the most famous villains in the dc comics but this film is not what you expect. It's more of a story of a man who has a mental illness and just keeps going to the more extreme side of insanity. This movie does that so well and Joaquin Phoenix has one of the best performances of this year and deserves on Oscar.,1
413,"Beautiful film, great acting of Philips in the Joker, very deep this film because it shows how each scene falls lower and lower, it's a recommended movie to see, the plot is pretty, but otherwise it's great",1
414,"While it is not for everyone, this was such an entertaining movie. Everybody is taking it so literally, but remember it is a comic book origin story not a biography.",1
415,"""All I have are negative thoughts""A masterpiece. It's brilliant. Exceptional. Bla, bla, bla.If I were to cover the full scope of this movie's brilliance you'd be here all night. First of all my problems with some people's criticism of the film:Over the top violence???!!! Yeah, nah. What absolute BS, clearly Deadpool and Game of Thrones exist in a difference universe. So you think it will cause mass violence or people who are messed up to get what? More messed up? Yeah well you should have thought of that crap 50 years ago. And let's just forget about movies like the Shining or Silence of the Lambs. Yeah, The Joker is going to be absolutely detrimental to society, cause shootings, oh no, ban the film - eat my arse. The media is just encouraging people to do something stupid by bringing that sort of drivel to everyone's attention. Not the Joker, the media is far more detrimental to society than anything else. Unfortunately it's impossible to have an entirely objective media entity without bias. Well that rant went on for a while, what was I talking about?Ahh yeah, what's great about the film:Holy crap Joaquin Pheonix is a bloody legend, his performance as Arthur Fleck in his transition from slightly mentally f***ed dude to majorly mentally f***ed dude (i.e. The Joker) is impeccable. His portrayal of The Joker is definitely on even terms with Heath's, and Heath created the best villain any superhero movie has ever done. Rest In Peace Heath Ledger. The way in which the film connected Arthur to the Wayne family and specifically Bruce by creating a mystery around Arthur's parentage was extemely well done. If only Todd and his crew were willing to connect this Joker to The Batman in later films, because they set the scene for that possibility quite perfectly, unfortunately that notion is all f**kery. Robert Pattinson, surely you can't do anything worse than Affleck or Clooney, but I've seen Twilight. However, I also agree that you could make a really good Bruce Wayne and Batman. See you in 2021.Ok, Arthur's laugh was mind-blowing, and the Joker laugh is hard to do well (I've tried); especially if you're going for it at a new angle, Pheonix's laugh both gave me the creeps and made me crack up at certain points during the film. Honestly, that scene where he's watching the stand-up comedy, but he laughs out of time with the audience, and at the most unfunny lines that are only part of the build up to the actual punchline. Bloody hilarious. Yeah, my favourite scene in the movie I reckon. You might say that it was an insignificant scene, but it does a really fine job of depicting Arthur's detachment to other people and society in general.The dark humour is crafted expertly. At least I think so; at my cinema I felt like me and my mate were the only ones laughing throughout the film. Everyone else must just have been wonder-struck at how good the film was.  Arthur's dancing is simply sublime, and I'm not kidding; him busting a move in a public bathroom after he just busted the s**t out of three wankers on a train again did an excellent job of exploring his minor psychological issues. What more can I say, oh yeah, hehehe. Dwarf. I was sort of shocked when he killed that dude, Randall, I'm not absolutely sure why in cosideration. But when the Gary couldn't reach the latch, I laughed a bit guiltily. Arthur Fleck: I don’t want you to worry about money, mom. I mean, everybody’s telling me that my standup’s ready for the big clubs.Penny Fleck: But what makes you think you could do that?Arthur Fleck: What do you mean?Penny Fleck: I mean, don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?Hahaha, So good, so good....I wanna talk about his facial expressions, the riots the were invoked by his supposed ""vigilante"" actions, and his therapy sessions. But I don't have enough time, so here the last thoughts.That moment when he eccentuated the smile and red paint on his face with his blood whilst amongst his supporters was golden. His face, sorry, fate is sealed and he is now The joker.His speech and killing Murray on the talk show. Quite satisfying, Murray's talk show was great symbolism of a problem in society. Murray wants to find dirt on you, other people will find it funny, takes it much too far, Murray doesn't give a s**t Arthur kills him. The twist of him only imagining his relationshop with Sophie.The Ending Scene - grim, yet amusing.I didn't look to closely in to theme, plot devices, and whatnot, but there are plenty of other opinion pieces that talk about that stuff.I'm really looking forward to what becomes of Arthur Fleck. 10/10Oh, no. I forgot to punch out",1
416,"Having seen Joker a second time, I can confirm that this movie is a character study filled with strong performances that drip off of the screen. Throughout most of the movie, I forgot I was watching a comic book movie. Make no mistake, this is an incredibly timely, hard hitting drama that has a lot to say without being overly political.To address the controversy surrounding this film: this movie is not a glorification of incel culture at all. To make that claim is disingenuous at best. I find it hard to believe that anyone would walk out of this movie and think that Arthur Fleck is a hero. However, the movie dares you to feel empathy for him, and I definitely did. Joker really paints a bleak picture of a society that treats the suffering, mentally ill poor like garbage, and then shows apathy when violence does break out.On that note, the violence in this film is not overly gorey, but it is extremely realistic, and this is not a movie for the faint of heart. In addition to the very real violence, this movie is a story of a deeply disturbed man who has an increasingly more terrifying psychotic breakdown over the film's two hour runtime. Joaquin Phoenix is terrifying to behold, and he gives one of the best performances I have seen all year. People will not soon forget his scary performance, and I think he will stand proudly beside the likes of Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill when it comes to great Jokers.As far as the script, it's pretty darn good. It weaves a nuanced, complex argument about mental illness and classism. This story dares the audience to examine their own treatment of the mentally ill in their lives, and whether or not we really care about them. This movie is brave enough to ask whether our societal apathy is responsible for people going off the deep end and committing gruesome crimes. From a cinematography stand point, the camera work and shot structure is hideously immaculate. It constructs a really dirty, scummy underbelly of a city with striking beauty.The soundtrack is great. The music always comes from the world of the movie, and the use of Frank Sinatra is just terrifying to hear. It's very inventive, and I enjoyed pretty much the entire score.My only two qualms with the movie are that it is a very, very on-the-nose take on Taxi Driver, and that it is a slow burn. If you do decide to see this movie, it is well worth the slow burn, and you will find that this is a movie that demands multiple viewings, and one that will haunt you to the core.",1
417,"Simply put,a true MASTERPIECE,the acting,the cinematography,the story,everything is just as flawless as it should be or even better",1
418,Joker is a dark and gripping story that's at times very uncomfortable to watch. Joaquin Phoenix gives a performance of a lifetime.,1
419,"It is exactly like a late night talk show, it is not for everyone, for not everyone can endear the experience, the pain and the laughs.JokerTodd Phillips is a magnificent beast. Who'd have thought of that. Although I'd definitely mention my theory that still stands tall and strong. If a director can make a comedy classic with proper execution then it can pull off any heist of any genres with his eyes closed. Take either Adam McKay or Peter Farelly and now join the co-writer and director Todd Phillips's name to that list. Todd's film is, yes, a recurrent display of what you want from this film. It can also be translated as his fandom of this character over the years, that he has finally brought alive. Either way, whenever the film lands our expectations. Good expectations. The film suffers a lot. The script grows tricky for me, whenever the gaps are filled in with what you and the general perception would perceive and the dots that you know are about to come, and have to be a part of this case until it reaches that crime scene.The film is only troubling in those senses. Another issue could be argued would be that the film doesn't clarify or give answers to all the existent and even questionable elements of the film. If it is an origin, then it should answer every corner of the truth. Should it? Should it, really though? For amidst this train of reckless actions, we forget that this is a comic book film. And just as any comic book story, you are told to believe in something and then move forward. Joker is in its truest form, with complete make up, dyed hair and colored suit, then becomes a comic book character. The consequences are to be determined. And not the reasons.Not the ""whys"", but the ""what now"". And this is why Joker is much more present then Arthur Fleck. When Fleck is lost, the mobile objects in the wide shots are going further and further away. And when Joker shines, those same objects, those same trains returns back home. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck never looks for the surrounding or outside the vehicle he is in, for he has nothing, no one to look for. And Phoenix as Joker giddily drools over the catastrophe that his choices casts on Gotham city, a significance of his presence, existence. Joker is almost too aptly titled. For the film doesn't focus on any other character. You cannot blame that it is an excuse or justification with an emotionally manipulated track. You are empathetic towards him but that is only because he is the only one you have been with. His is the only appeal you have been hearing. The laugh you have been listening. The jokes you have been questioning. It doesn't matter whether you get it or not.",1
420,"Spectacular, chilling performance by Phoenix. Riveting movie that builds til the very end.",1

424,"Joker is an outstanding film and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is unforgettable. Highly realistic and believable, undoubtedly one of the best films of the year, if not the best! this one will leave you pondering over it indefinitely after the end credits roll.",1
425,"It's really good movie for movie buffs like me. But those who likes some masala **** movies like captain marvel, Shazam and avenger, l strongly recommend you to avoid this film. It's totally a good movie made for dark genre fans.",1
426,"NO SPOILERSThe Joker is an absolute cinematic masterpiece, it's everything you want from an R rated joker movie. It's violet, exciting, and an overall masterpiece, on the same level as The Shawshank Redemption and The Dark Knight, if not better.",1
427,"I'm giving this a 9 because I don't do 10's. This movie is an absolutely fantastic character study, and anybody who thinks it's confused about the plot is trying to watch a different movie altogether. Joaquin Phoenix pulls off an incredible portrayal of the Joker, one that is at once faithful to the character and yet as unique in its way as Ledger's was. If I'm being nit-picky, I have issues with the one scene where Joker pontificates towards the end, it seemed superfluous and slightly discordant, but takes away nothing from the massive accomplishment that this movie represents. It's deeply indebted to Alan Moore for this versio of the Joker's origin, and viewers should always remember that there is no 'definitive' Joker, or at least that question won't be settled until DC releases The Three Jokers! In straying away from the DCU, both in style and in substance, this movie is easily one of the best DC-based movies you'll watch this decade.",1
428,"Great origin story, the only problem i had, is that it was too short, i wanna see more of Joaquin Phoenix's joker, this was just the tip of the iceberg.",1
429,"Grisly, uncomfortable, slow moving, character study that fully delivers on the dark promise of the trailer.",1
430,Belleza de película lo mejor de este año vayan a verla no se arrepentirán para nada,1
431,"like a building or a trea it's growing very slowly  and it's end with a JOKER, a person who finally has  a history, really good one, and a face suffers dramatic life. I loved it, and Joaquin Phoenix did his very best performance ever with laughs out loud.",1
432,"Mesmerizing, dark, sometimes funny.Phoenix delivers stunning performance and could well be in run for an Oscar next year.",1
433,"This is a masterpiece, the acting the atmosphere the world ... it is intricate, dark and amazing. Don’t let some movie “critics” tell you what’s good and what’s not, watch it yourself, and appreciate the movie for what it is, it doesn’t beat around the bushes it’s raw and real.",1
434,"I can't believe while typing this, but thank you Indian Censor Board for not editing this movie and letting the viewers see the directors vision.Todd Phillips what an absolute surprise, when I heard Joker was a part of DC black and Todd is directing I didn't think he'd make it, but man has he managed to surprise me. Joker in every essence is a masterpiece. Like every scene is a part of a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces fall right into place, Todd has made sure you see it happening. To talk about Joaquin Phoenix as a comic book fan I think the biggest compliment I can give him is that he's finally a joker worthy enough to be compared to the great Mark Hamill, his laugh Haunts you, he manages to express his laughs in all situations and you feel it. I'd be lying if I said it didn't give me chills. The last time something like this happened was when I saw Batman, Mask of Phantasm. Joaquin's acting is top notch and this is the first movie I've seen of his, and I'm gonna zip through his other movies soon. The point of this movie is that it is gripping and it manages to hold its viewers, let it be through Todd's vision, Joaquin's acting or the music. It has all the right elements mixed precisely, and it makes you one with the character, I for once couldn't stop myself from dancing in my seat because the music is great and Joaquin is magnetic. If you love dark humour you will love this movie, if you don't like Joker states ""you wouldn't get it"". Comic book fans would know Joker does not have an origin story and they could have done anything with the storyline. They could have picked anything as a story, but they picked magnificence. As a comic book fan I had huge expectations and Honestly it has exceeded my expectations. My rant won't make any sense because this work of art cannot be described in words. You will have to go experience it, live it, feel the emotions and for once just once become one with a character. I've seen it twice already, but the experience is so good, I am gonna feed on it some more.",1
435,It was just perfect. I LOVE It. It was amazing the plot twist of the movie.,1
436,"Bloody brilliant in every way. Superb acting, phenomenal cinematography and extremely raw and real. Caused the right amount of controversy among some soft critics.",1
437,Joker is the only way DC should make their movies. This is a masterpiece. Period. The only negative reviews are critics who want to be “different” and seem more intellectual by explaining why the film we all enjoy is “tasteless”.,1
438,¡A MASTERPIECE!PHOENIX AND PHILLIPS ARE A TRUEDINAMIC DUO!!!OSCAR NOMINATED...!¡¡200% WORTH WATCHING!!,1
439,"Been going to the cinema for 30 years. I am dumbfounded to see the critics average score on here. Kids, never pay to much attention to these over paid idiots. This is for me, the best film of 2019 and it has a rare performance by Joacquin Phoenix that is pure genius. I haven't seen a performace by a make actor that left me spellbound since the likes of De Niro in 'Raging Bull' or Jack Nicholson in 'One flew of the cuckoos nest'. When I saw the trailer last year I sensed it would be a turkey and fail to live up to Christopher Nolan trilogy. I am so happy to saw I was wrong.",1
440,"There's little to comment negatively about this movie.It's a well-made character study movie of someone suffering from mental issues caused by mental health and society alike. So don't expect an action-packed movie, but a slow ""character growth"" (more likely regress) movie, but one that is surprisingly well-paced most of the time to not get boring.Joachim's performance is amazing, to a point in the movie where the character becomes more self-absorbed and confident and you can almost say it's a different actor playing the role. I've heard some calling his acting exaggerated, it's certally not, at least not in the majority of scenes. (the movie does a subtles, yet kinda smart trick where some scenes are from the main characters' POV and not the actual real POV of all the other characters; this is done with a subtle reveal near the climax of the movie)It's a gritty depressing movie, but there are a lot darker, violent and depressing titles than this one, to a point I'm starting to believe American media has a serious problem by calling this movie controversial. There's nothing controversial about this one, the Joker is not glorified nor blamed, he is just shown as he is (as a good movie should do), the movie does not force a point of view letting the viewer draw a conclusion (as a good movie should do).The directing and cinematography are very good. There are scenes that look so great visually and evoke a specific feeling very well. The soundtrack is spot on.You definitely have to see this movie. But go in with patience, it's not a movie to digest when tired or bored.",1
441,"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.",1
442,"I don't remember the last time I felt in shock, in a good way, after watching a movie. Irrefutable masterpiece",1
443,"Joker is a cinematic masterpiece, while the first 20 minutes may feel like they drag on a bit, the film more than makes up for it in the third act. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker perfectly making it so that no one to relate to him, but in the same way having everyone be able to relate to him. The end of the film is brutal with joker killing the television host live on air in a way only the joker can, as a joke. Furthermore while everyone saw it coming, including Thomas and Martha Wayne's now infamous death outside the theatre now inexplicably links the joker to Bruce Wayne throughout his ride as the bat, now becoming part of his origin as well. This movie is easily a 10/10 with no joker apart from ledger's being able to beat it. Joaquin does Heath Ledger proud.",1
444,"Joker was an incredible movie, during my watching, It never felt predictable or boring. Every scene is excellent thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance. He really sells the role, at points, I was even convinced he was not acting, that he really was like this in real life. That's how incredible he is in this film. Throughout the film, inescapable anxiety surrounds every scene. It feels as if Joker will crack at any moment, like a pipe with too much pressure. That constant feeling of unease was what sold the movie for me. In the end, I feel empathy for the Joker, and I think that's what the audience is meant to feel, the movie has been written like that. It makes me have an internal conflict, he did all this bad stuff, why do I sympathize with him? And that might just be the magic of this film.",1
445,"one of the best dc movie i have ever watched, not just because joker but also why he became a joker slowly losing his sanity and become absolute madman i like the way it is",1
446,"This is just a really great movie, it has so much depth and the character of Arthur fleck and his development is great.",1
447,Masterpiece! Finaly serious comic movie after dark knight. Will watch it in cinema for 2nd time.,1
448,"Incredible movie! Saw it last night, it blew my mind. Joaquin Phoenix will definitely win an Oscar for his role as the Joker",1
449,"Muy pocas peliculas me hacen dar ganas de ir a verlas al cine otra vez como en esta ocasion, al acabar nadie aplaudio pero no quiere decir que sea mala, sino que creo yo que como en las escenas crudas nadie aprobaba los asesinatos pero te hacia sentir lastima por Arthur. Definitivamente se merece un 10/10 pese a que los criticos ardidos digan que es ""predecible"" osea la pelicula se llama joker? el se convertira en un asesino que esperan que no sea predecible sobre eso? que es edgy? todo es edgy para esta generacion de consentidos",1
450,"It was unreal...  Joaquin Phoenix's performance was top notch. The scariest part of the movie was how much his actions made sense, and how you can't really fault the logic of the people who would consider the dude someone to follow.",1
451,"I didn't go into the moving expecting a good movie, given the last few from Warner Brothers, but WOW, this was amazing. I'm a huge Batman fan and the Dark Knight movie and Heath Ledger's Joker were undisputed at the top of the list of cinema portrayals and Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips stole the title handily. I think this is the best portrayal of the Joker and absolutely told a great story about how the crown prince of crime came to be. I objectively feel bad for the reviewers that are not getting this, I think it's amazing.",1
452,He eat the screen every single  time he is in frame  Super beautiful videography outstanding performance  and  mesmerizing fascinating magic score the movie is by far one of the best acting performance 2019,1
453,"Stunning, non-compromising, brilliant direction and acting. Never has a film based on a comic book character has managed to be so true to life.",1
454,This movie is surely one of the best vilain movie ever made you must watch it yourself and make your own critic and do not get influenced by the media critic’s joaquin phenix have made the challenge to get this joker at heath ledger level truely a great actor.,1
455,"Una obra maestra, que a logrado desafiar los estándares estúpidos que tenemos hoy en día, si la película es violenta pero para nada gore como muchas otras, segundo hay muchos seudocriticos estúpidos que dicen que es por ejemplo: basura... ¿pretenciosa?, ¿enserio?Es decir que esta página de porquería prefiere darle calificaciones mejores a estupideces como Avengers con 75,pero Joker que es una mejor película y mejor bien hecha tiene 58. Ya se ha dicho que cuando no puedes crear tu propio arte, juzgas al de los demás porque nunca lograste nada bueno en tu vida miserable. Eso es para todos esos críticos que piensan que todas las películas tienen que seguir el mismo estándar en estos días,. Yo que vivo en un país que es una porquería me doy cuenta que el problema no es el entretenimiento como Guason o películas de mas que llegan a dar un mensaje tan bien hecho que la prensa prefiere dar un mensaje de miedo e ignorancia. Simplemente me dan asco estúpidos críticos. La película es un 10 porque sabe como llevarse a flote, Phoenix hace un trabajo espectacular y épico.",1
456,Great. **** the critics and all that lame ass journalism. I would watch it ten times if i clould.,1
457,"Joker is a thrilling piece of twisted reality that touches on the dark conflicts of society and rejection of the insane, With a beautiful art style and incredible directory joker is well deserved to be up there with the greatest movies. Joaquin pheonix brings the long awaited origin to the joker we have all been waitng for "" the cause of the madness""",1
458,This is a must see film. Not just for comic book fans but for film fans in general. Todd Philips & Joaquin Phoenix have really made an extraordinary masterpiece. Psychologic. Intense & Beautiful,1
459,"Esta película, que me traía como loco por las expectativas de la actuación de Phoenix, además de superarlas en un nivel que no puedo explicar, nos trae un trabajo cinematógrafo de proporciones mayúsculas si cabe decir, y es que la dirección de Todd Phillips lo deja en un lugar reservado sólo para los grandes, si, las particulares influencias de Taxi Driver y el Rey de la comedia saltan a la vista, pero cada detalle y momento de este maremágnum psicológico a muchos de los que escribieron en este post con propiedad, les hará sentir que sus vidas tienen un sentido al apreciar esta obra, que resultó ser no sé si por meras coincidencias del destino, una obra magistral de la historia del cine del presente siglo y quizás sin ser pretensioso, de toda la vida del cine.",1
460,I’m convinced that every negative review of this movie is a flawed opinion of someone who didn’t take enough time to really digest this film and truly understand its goal. This film is a masterpiece.,1
461,I can only describe this film as 'kino'. A dark and visceral look into someone who snapped after every facet of his life dealt him a bad hand. I haven't liked many comic book movies in recent years but Joaquin Phoenix made me absolutely love this one.,1
462,Joaquin Phoenix in this movie is superb. A great telling of the Joker's back story.,1
463,Amazing acting and transformation of Arthur to the Joker. Bravo! Film making at its best (and the critics doing know their heads from their ass.,1
464,This movie makes me feel like their is still a chance in DC movies. Amazing acting chops from Mr. Phoenix,1
465,"the best movie about the origin of a comic book character, we can understand the motives of Arthur Fleck, and the producers did a great job of getting us close to the joker and making us like it. Joaquin Phoenix also greatly improves the experience.",1
466,"The best comic book movie from the time of the dark knight, on the spite of the day and psychological problems in a society of indifference. Joaquin Phoenix' acting is great!",1
467,"Story, Cinematography, Acting, Soundtrack etc everything in this movie is a masterpiece.11/10",1
468,"Joaquin's performance is Oscar worthy, the cinematography is superb, and the film score is brilliant. This movie is dark, gritty and depressing in the best ways imaginable. Masterpiece.",1
469,"I saw this last Friday and I still can't get it out of my head. For that fact alone, I think it's very special.",1
470,"Es asombrosa, me esperaba un drama de accion, pero me entregaron un drama psicológico y de critica social, pero igual me doy por satisfecho y aunque flaquee en el tema de adaptación de personaje, se dijo que seria una historia original, no vengan a llorar por tonterias.Joker sin duda es una obra maestra.",1
471,"I'm honestly torn between giving this film a 9 or a 10. Fact is this however, this film is Todd Phillip's freaking masterpiece! It's beautifully shot, scored, and acted. The story is compact, effective, well paced and a powerful ending.There is an excellent mix of reality and his delusions which leaves the viewer guessing(one of my favorite parts).There are some downsides that the character may be too sympathetic. That’s not the Joker from The Dark Knight, Dark Knight Returns or Killing Joke. Sure, he may eventually be the villain we know in the comics. But this isn’t the Joker we know. This is the Joker you sympathize with, and that makes Joker less scary. Disturbing, but not scary. The people he killed “deserved” it...or did they???Overall, this amazing origin story of an iconic comic book villain with a hint of a Scorsese style is a film that nobody deserves, but the one we needed.",1
472,This movie is absolutely a masterpiece!! An Oscar worthy for sure. You don't wanna miss this movie. Joaquin phoenix acting is outstanding it's like he really is the Joker itself. So drowning into the joker character. Best movie of the year!! Dear Todd phillips i need Joker movie 2 peaseee....!,1
473,"Small pacing issues that were overwhelmingly overshadowed by the beautiful cinematography, great acting, and the wonderful musical score. Must watch.",1
474,Oh my God!!!!!  thats a fantastic movie. Joaquin Phoenix made a best appearance  on a screen. According to my opinion this is the best thriller movie of 2019 and an Oscar award deserver. Joaquin Phoenix appeared as a best Villian on the cinema screen........,1
475,"Outsanding screenwriting. The portrayal of the  city of Gotham and the darkness of its streets is showns in the personality of the joker and the people of the city. His role in making ravolution in the city is chilling. Director of the movie managed to combine humor with extremely dark scenes filled with violence and aggression but it a way that it doesn't effect the seriousness of the situation at hand. Amazing. Joaquin's performance is the best acting I ever witnessed. It takes the 1st place, in front of DiCaprio's - The Revenant and Legder's - Joker. t. Oscar winning acting wihout a doubt, I have never experiences such mindblowing acting. Ledgers's Joker is a different type and thus I wouldn't dare to compare the status of each Joker, but this is another level of acting in my opinion. Overall a phenomenal movie with Oscar-winning acting without a doubt.",1
476,"Fantastic film with an outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Easily the best thing to come out so far this year. Music and score is top class. Enjoyed it even more the second time.It's a Joker movie, and maybe the best we'll ever get. Doesn't need to be any more than that, but it probably is given the outpouring of opinions.",1
477,"Wow.  Heavily inspired by Taxi Driver, but that's not a bad thing; this movie is executed very well.Cinematography, sound design and acting are all excellent.  My only nitpick is that some side plots aren't too important, but they aren't very much time wasted.  An emotionally powerful movie.",1
478,Astoundingly Dark just as it should be. Joaquin couldn't have been more amazing! But director put too much focus on his acting rather than on the story,1
479,Film's deeply touched me. It evokes empathy. Main hero is very miserable in too cruel world. Film reflects indifference of the modern society to the problems of ordinary people,1
480,It’s a masterpiece go watch it ASAPJoaquin Phoenix is the ultimate joker He nails everything from the laugh to the costumeThis movie will be the best thing you’ll see all yearDo yourself a favor and get a ticket and watch it,1
481,A movie which makes you understand the feelings of socially abused mind. Must watch once.,1
482,This is not a action packed comic book movie. Basically they showed the society from Arthur's POV.,1
483,This movie deserves more than 5 oscars! a cult movie! the academies of art and acting must analyze and study it for future subjects!,1
484,Absolument incroyable. Joachim Phoenix offre une performance extraordinaire.,1
485,"Despite being predictably difficult to watch, this was a very clever take on the Joker as a character (and make no mistake, he is a CHARACTER in this film). It was a very well done movie, that uses its tie-in to the Batman origin story very much as a quirk or a sideshow rather than the main event. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation, killing it in every scene, sometimes literally,  and the writing is so on point, with the buildup to its inevitable conclusion being both heartbreaking and an emotional roller coaster.",1
486,"La mejor pelicula nunca antes vista de Dc, excelente actor Joaquin, la risa, la danza , como se va enterando de su vida y le cambia la cara y su personalidad, excelente!",1
487,The Joker played  by Joaquin Phoenix was one of the best acting performances and gave DC what they truly deserved.The story wasn't predictable like other super hero movies and gave it a true dark and terrifying  picture of what made Joker.,1
488,I believe this is one of three movies that I am going to watch again and again for many years to come.It is pointless to try to review such a piece of art.Just go and see.,1
489,"Best joker movie, Phoenix just did the best role for the joker, and a very good story building for the character!",1
490,"Honestly, I wasn’t expecting much from the trailers and director’s track record. I was only interested in seeing how Phoenix does as Joker but I expected the film to be run of the mill and lack substance. Well, it was a masterpiece. I would just say to anyone judging without actually watching, give it a try. If only to see Joaquin Phoenix top Heath Ledger as Joker, which I didn’t think would ever happen after Dark Knight. There was a hell of a lot more substance to this than I expected. This was a masterful slow burning character study, showing the transformation of a downtrodden, mentally ill sociopath, into The Joker. And yeah, it’s one of the darkest and most uncomfortable comedies you will ever see but it’s set up and done very well. Visually great, soundtrack great and Phoenix was unbelievable. This is getting a lot of bad reviews from critics who I guess were made uncomfortable but there are thousands of senselessly violent movies and this was dark as you get, but not senseless. Metacritic currently has an average rating from critics of 57/100, with both the metacritic and imdb users rating it 9.2/10. It used to be that I’d put more stock in the critics than average viewer ratings but it’s getting really hard to take modern reviewers seriously when you see the countless generic and badly constructed comic book adaptations and new Star Wars films get a better critical response than an actual piece of art like Joker.",1
491,Its a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
492,"Breathtaking experience, Pheonix's performance was glorious. Lacked more violence though gore atmosphere compensated that",1
493,"Maravilhoso! Um filme que expressa a real emoção da insanidade, a forma que o Arthur progride no filme é algo fantástico",1
494,"I can't stop thinking about this movie. So many lectures! It is incredible well crafted, a round movie in every way. A movie I never thought I'd see in this time. Kudos to Philipps, Phoenix and everyone involved in this. And kudos to DC for taking the risk to do something like this. Thank you!",1
495,"First of all, the message in this film is great especially with what’s going on in the world. Everybody who goes to see this movie will probably walk away thinking the exact same thing and know what the message is. At this point I think it’s pretty obvious what everybody already knows and I’m just going to put in my five cents and that’s Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/Joker and he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. He went all-in with this character showing the different stages in his life and making everybody feel bad for him. At certain points in the film, I felt really bad for the guy and wanted to help him out because nobody deserves to be treated that way. It also helps that he didn’t start out as wanting to become the Joker but society just helped turn him into him. Robert De Niro, who plays Murray Franklin, probably won’t get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor but he still did a standout job with his character. Another thing that stood out to me was the cinematography of the movie and how it helped show Arthur’s slow descent into madness and how he views the world. I feel like some people are waiting for me to hate on the pacing of this film and honestly, I had no problem with it at all. If the movie was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on and any shorter and they would have rushed the Joker transformation. But with that in mind, this film is like most people have said already and that’s a character story. So, if you don’t want to watch a story about a man who’s driven to his breaking point and wants to see an action superhero then stay home and watch The Dark Knight. I love how the costume was different from any Joker suit we’ve seen before, though it’s hard to replicate without buying a store-bought costume. The music by Hildur Guonadottir was amazing. In the end, this movie is an amazing character story with an important message.",1
496,Great movie. Maybe too slow for some people but really glad they made a joker origin story that was realistic. I wonder how good batman could be if it was rated R,1
497,"The Joker has been done justice on the big screen. It's a good character study, and has some really important messages and I cried... a lot at the end. If you felt it, you felt it.",1
498,"Incredible movie. Excellent operator's work, great script and atmosphere. Joaquin Phoenix must get Oscar for this",1
499,"This is one of the strangest 10/10s I will ever give. I give Joker 10 because it executes what it advertises itself as flawlessly. Do you want to see what it would take to turn someone into the Joker? Do you want to see just how bad someone has to have it that it brings him joy to watch the world burn? This is your film. And there lies my personal problem with the film. It does this so well, that I genuinely felt disturbed watching it. Many of the scenes get real, and you might find yourself seeing people you know, or even yourself, in the Joker. I walked out of the theater just flat out uncomfortable, and a bit depressed. I recommend this movie to anyone looking to explore the things that can make one so miraculously cynical. The film does a phenomenal job looking into those themes. Just don't expect to have a good time watching it.",1
500,I'm just gonna say it: Best Controversial Movie I Have Ever Seen. Don't let politics cloud your judgement for art.,1
501,"Excellent movie. Had just the right tone, pacing, and twists for me. The cast did an amazing job.",1
502,"Todd Phillips has created a masterpiece origins story here. The cinematography is superb, the soundtrack is spot on and just the whole dark grittiness of the story is amazing. Joaquin Phoenix is just magnificent in this film. You really need to watch this film.",1
503,"Now I’ve seen the film, I can see why the media and ‘professional critics’ are terrified of it. They should be. Aside from being masterfully shot, edited, acted and directed, the film is dangerous for all the right reasons. It casts a revealing light against us as a society in 2019 - how we treat each other, brush anything we don’t like or aren’t prepared to deal with under the carpet and most of all how the media and social elites tell us what to think, who to idolise, what we can or can’t like or find funny. The socio-political commentary took me completely by surprise in what is also a fantastic character study of a poor, lonely loser struggling with mental illness -who goes completely ignored through life when he’s not being bullied- and how this person finds less and less reasons to be polite and ‘put on a happy face’. Arthur is an underdog we all recognise, regardless of our race or gender, and the film raises the question that perhaps we need to look at ourselves closer in how we treat those in less fortunate situations than our own. It’s easy in this age of electronic distractions to adopt an ‘I’m alright Jack’ attitude, and perhaps it’s this ignorance to the cries for help of others that creates the Jokers of the real world.This is the most relevant and important film of our time.",1
504,"Films based on comic books have been the craze over the last decade or so, to say the least. From Iron Man launching a franchise bigger than any interconnected cinematic franchise in history to The Dark Knight being known as one of the best films of all time, we're currently living in the golden age of comic book adaptations, so it should come as no surprise that a few unexpected outings would be attempted as well. Joker has now hit theatres and while I can say right off the top that it won't be for all moviegoers, this is a fantastic piece of storytelling. Being alone his entire life and thrown to the side by society, Arthur Fleck still lives with his mother well into adulthood and has a full-time job as a street clown. Having a condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh, this character study is engaging from start to finish. Slowly realizing the truth about his life, things begin to devolve into chaos in his mind. Joker is simply a study of the mind of someone who has nothing left to live for or be happy about. For this reason alone, this is going to be a tough watch for certain viewers. Having a homicidal maniac as your core focus is not exactly an easy sell.  Now, Joker shares quite a few similarities to other classic films, which is being criticized a lot throughout many reviews, but I didn't see that as a negative. There are so many formulas that have been emulated to create great works of fiction that calling this movie a rip-off would be an insult to the filmmakers. On top of that, this movie is held together by a performance by Joaquin Phoenix that's truly out of this world, so any minor issues I had were usually overshadowed by him.  Phoenix's portrayal of this character, like every actor who has played this character in the past, is extremely committed, whether or not you like the outcome. Thankfully, I think his portrayal is completely different from anyone who came before him, making this movie one that will be able to stand on its own for a long time. From his quirks when the film begins to where he ends up during the final act, each and every moment was riveting.  In the end, Joker does borrow a little too much from classic to really call it a masterpiece or perfect, but it's pretty close in my opinion, in terms of holding your interest for an unlikely anti-hero. It's directed very, very well by Todd Phillips and I was more than happy to see him evolve as a filmmaker here. This is something that I never thought I would see him do and, aside from the level of great comedy in a movie like The Hangover, this is probably his best work to date. I loved nearly everything about this movie, even though it will upset some viewers and make them feel very uncomfortable. In fact, for that reason alone, it has done its job very well. You're not supposed to root for him, but rather understand where his actions come from. This is a great film.",1
505,چیزی دیدم که قبلا مثلشو ندیده بودم. واقعا خاص بود,1
506,Movie of the year and one of the best Joker origin of all time. An oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix the best part was he didn't need joker makeup to be joker it was always very much visible in hi personality.,1
507,"The critics hate it so thought it was probably worth checking out. The critics just review everything in terms of their stupid politics, but this is a good film with an outstanding performance at the center from Joaquin Phoenix. This is black humor, but it is a study in how isolation and rejection lead to terrible results.",1
508,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance And best character development ever seenBest movie I've ever seen,1
509,"Quel film. Avec Joaquin Phoenix dans la peau du joker ce sera l’un des meilleur joker, et en effets ses le meilleur joker. On sent bien la réalisation de Todd Philips. La fin est très bonne aussi car comme dans ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA la fin nous laisse sur le doute que peut-être que tout le film est un rêve. Les nombreuses scènes de violence font légèrement pensé a Quentin Tarantino et Martin Scorsese. J’ai bien aimer les nombreuses références a THE KING OF COMEDY et TAXI DRIVER qui rappelle pour certain leur genèse. Même si on le vois peut a l’écran Robert De Niro est assez bon et drôle dans ce film.",1
510,"Gritty, dirty, sad, poetic and quite brilliant the build up of a maniac its mesmerizing to an extent, can you believe Joker has a movie on its own, that should be the punchline to one of his jokes. Sorry it didn't turn into a full blown, I hate the president movie like everything else that's coming out this days. Watch it there's no action just disturbing images of pure rage and incredible acting compose by the amazing score of music. Joker is Phoenix but the music its also Joker my god it's so great how well that blends from beginning to the very end. Gotham looks incredibly looks real and it felt real, this movie can stand on its own and DC can go suck it please let this be the route to more of this artistic masterpieces.",1
511,"The best comic book movie we have, but its not like some marvel **** its completely new cinematic experience for super-heroic films, you have to watch this. Perfomance of Phoenix is breathtaking.",1
512,"This movie is great! The Joker in this movie is very deep, and we see his dive into insanity. It's got great cinematography, an AMAZING score, wonderful acting, and beautiful colors. It's a movie that isn't afraid to show the dark side of mental illness. Absolutely marvelous!!",1
513,An instant classic. The performance no matter how big or small are all phenomenal. It's a movie where you'll sympathize for Arthur and laugh uncomfortably for doing so as he does to every stressful situation. This goes as one of my favorite top 10s  just have to figure out where.,1
514,it was a legendary moviejoaquin phoenix's acting was greatthat was amazing“I thought my life was a tragedy but then I learned it was a comedy.” -Joker,1
515,"This movie is dark, intense and makes you think twice on what you say to someone. DC did I great job at this movie easily 10/10",1
516,Joaquin Phoenix nailed it with his extraordinary performance. Almost equivalent to Heath Ledger.,1
517,"Busque cobre y encontré oro, es una película que puede ver un fan, una persona del común o cualquiera y al final le parecerá una hermosura del cine. Es preciosa de ver y la trama se desenvuelve tan bien que es imposible no aplaudirla.",1
518,"The movie is so well executed, Joaquin’s acting is outstanding. You will leave this movie not knowing what is real and what is fake.",1
519,"Phoenix delivers possibly his best performance yet. This dark, disturbing yet gripping performance has given this fabulous comic book character a new twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Will be in Oscar contention for Phoenix and the brilliant cinematography done throughout the entire film. Must see",1
520,"MASTERPIECE!!!! One of the best comic book movies ever made if not one of the top films ever made. The acting, cinematography, and score are all absolutely phenomenal! Do your self a favor and watch this movie even if you might not like it, it deserves to be seen 10/10",1

526,Best movie ever.best acting best story ,1
527,fenomenal movie. i dont understand why someone wouldnt like this. but keep in mind that the movie itself is pretty dark and by pretty i mean a lot,1
528,"It is great in impact levels, it is not a movie more than DC is the DC movie. It does not work well for people with little criteria you must have criteria to appreciate this work, understand what it means to reinvent a joker of loose origin in the comic comparing it with this one.",1
529,This is a truly masterpiece. I was really shocked when I saw the low score from the critics but seriously.. you need to watch it by yourself. This movie has made me register into metacritic to write a review after years.. Nothing more to say.,1
530,Its just spectacular. You won't be satisfied watching it once.. You will watch it again and again just to be able yo acknowledge how great phoenix was. The movie in total is a pure masterpiece,1
531,The best part is to watch the film by the joker's prespective and his decent into maddnes.,1
532,Joker is a great movie. It tells the story of Arthur who very naturally transforms into a Joker.,1
533,"Absolutely fantastic. The best movie I've seen this year. The acting is unbelievable, the direction and cinematography is extraordinary and the score... wow. I cant say anything negative about this movie! Its the ultimate comic book movie and the best movie of the year",1
534,Finally!  A really good movie that doesn't conform to PC culture.  Joaquin Phoenix's performance was brilliant.  An instant classic and a must see!,1
535,"Best Movie....Fantastic,aurther Fleck is Bruce Waynes Step Brother.",1
536,Amazing Movie. I dont know why so many critics don't like it but it's clear from the audience score that this is a masterpiece. Amazing acting and solid direction. Joaquin Phoenix is the best joker we can get today(rip heath ledger). It isn't fair to compare them though.,1
537,"The best movie in last 10 years, the movie is masterpiece in every way. The direct the story and especially the acting, Joaquin p definitely deserves an Oscar for his amazing unbelievable performance. What a fantastic movie.",1
538,"Wake up! We live in a world, where everybody could go insane! Even the mental ones!",1
539,"Those most realistic comic book movie ever made. From the cinematography to the acting, and everything in between, Joker delivers across the board. The bombastic third act will leave you riveted to your seat and craving more of Phoenix's Joker. One of the best origin stories ever put to film. A",1
540,"I never expected to be this affected by a movie, joker is a powerful and deep movie, really brings you inside the psychology of the character on his way.  MASTERPIECE",1
541,I love it how Metacritic is rating Joker lower than Batwoman. It should tell you all you need to know about the woke phase of the mental state they are in.,1
542,Simplemente extraordinary :)La actuación en verdad merece un Oscar. La volvería a ver nuevamente.Recomendable.,1
543,"Critics are dumb, reviews are not the place to vent politics. This movie is amazing, some of the best character development I've seen in a long time!",1
544,"It's just a masterpiece, nothing more. Joaquin Phoenix just gave me chills with this laugh.",1
545,"Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular and deserves the world of awards, even if he doesn’t get the Oscar we know the real winner and it would be barbaric if it doesn’t  happen.The Soundtrack is a delight and the Director had me fell in love.",1
546,This movie and joaquin phoenix's act was perfect idk wtf is wrong with those critics that say this movie is not good!!!,1
547,"Great performance and film. It’s getting hard to take critics seriously. The audience loves it and they hate it, it’s ridiculous.",1
548,10/10 will watch again soon! I can't believe how much I was surprised by this film... So good.,1
549,"Haunting and alluring. Joaquin Phoenix is the bei embodiment of a downtrodden member of society. Neglected, forgotten, and pained, we follow his character, Aurther Fleck down the rabbit hole to madness. A work of art.",1
550,"O filme é maravilhoso, uma obra de arte. Um dos filmes mais lindos que a Warner  fez nesses últimos tempos.",1
551,It was a beautiful film. It's a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips deserve Oscars.,1
552,"Amazing film, and it deserves more praise than the so called ""critics"" give it.",1
553,"Everyone in the cinema clapped in appreciation at the end of this film, have never seen or heard of this happening! ",1
554,"Joker is the troll of a film. It’s main business is provocation: making you feel bad for feeling happy, making you feel bad when you feel bad, shocking you with violence and gore and the indignities of being poor and sick and awkward. It hurts to watch Phoenix move. It hurts to watch him walk or dance or laugh. The rictus of pain in which his body is permanently placed. He is at times dainty and fey, then red-hot and blundering, slapdash, improvisational, weak, timid, meek, then conniving and smooth, impossibly suave and impossibly kind, caring, confident, self-possessed, then unhinged. But his swings don’t come off as random or unpredictable: Arthur is unraveling, shedding the his psychic blocks.I’m writing this review earlier than the others, because I’m a few (ten) behind, and it seemed like this would be an urgent one for people on the fence. I’ve been following this film for a while now, mostly because of my fascination with Joaquin Phoenix but also because I’ve been waiting for the Suicide Squad/Venom movie I was promised. One that would revel in the amorality of comic book villainy, spend some time in the mud, build the stakes for a confrontation, and push back on the platitudes of 21st century superheroism. That’s not what this is. This is more.I can see why someone would walk out. At multiple points. Or call this empty and soulless, void of any soul or moral inspection. In some ways the film feels like a polemic, like something that could be watched totally unironically. But I sort of like that it’s missing its compass, errant, rambling, has that sort of colorless feel of a once-vibrant shirt that’s spent too much time in the wash. Mysteries abound, fake news is unconfirmable, the past is a Gatsbian destination, out of reach. At the same time, it’s tidy: dreams die, lines land, set pieces are constructed, and people end neatly. Phoenix performs performance, rehearsal, the molding of self, the telling of fiction, the face he pulls in that hospital scene is so perfectly gleeful.Every moment of sympathy is undercut by our knowledge, our assumption of the end. Every decision is undermined by the murkiness of his decision-making, the chaos of his moral system, and the slow spiral out of control. And what is most exciting is that it does really feel like a new way to tell stories in a genre that has been painting itself into boxes for the last ten, fifteen years. They’ve scraped everything cheerful and fun out of movie and left the husk of a story, the pockmarked battlefield of the present American psyche, what Friend calls, “a time capsule” movie, somewhat in the same intention as The Dead Don’t Die. It feels like a high water mark for dark, mirthless self-seriousness, in a way that seems inimitable, even as it invites comparisons to classics like Taxi Driver and contemporary analogs that were passed up for Oscar attention not too long ago, like First Reformed (2018).But even as I mention Ethan Hawke’s performance, there’s something distinctly daring about doing this as a comic book movie, where expectations are so high for such a different brand of humor. Phoenix’s portrayal finally makes Heath Ledger’s performance feel cartoonish where it used to seem dark and threatening. Ledger’s Joker was a talker, his terror was psychological, but Pheonix’s is bottled up, repressed, his terror is social, cultural.Joker is a movie for people who like movies but hate superhero movies. It’s worth your attention and it’s likely to irritate.",1
555,"One of the best of the year, Joker is a brave,nuanced and thought provoking film that will likely, and hopefully, revolutionise the superhero genre. Todd Phillips clearly has eye for the camera, with every shot and colour choice dripping with symbolism. While some of the dialogue is a bit too on the nose and a certain plot twist could have been executed much more effectively if Phillips trusted his audience more, in the end joker is a smart, bleak and refreshing film which will likely be discussed for years to come.",1
556,Engaging from start to finish. Phoenix gives an excellent performance. I appreciated the way it ties into existing Batman lore.,1
557,Someone's finally standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ledger's Joker. A must-must-watch!!,1
558,"The acting, cinematography and score was excellent. My only problem is with the ending - it should've ended with Joker standing on the car and drawing a smile with his blood. That was the best shot in the whole movie and it was the highest point of the Joker's life. The ending with the asylum was too open and felt a bit toned down.",1
559,"Джокер отыграл как Бог.Готем уже надоел, пора бы сменить его, все фильмы DC только в нем, ставлю 10, чтобы уровнять баланс несправедливо малого рейтинга.",1
560,"Excelente película en todos los aspectos, gran actuación.No se que problema tendrán los críticos con esta película siento un poco que solo inflan algunas películas a conveniencia",1
561,Норм фильм. Слегка затянули но мне понравилось. Игра актеров на уровне.,1
562,Incredible. The bravest movie in the story of comic villain adaptation. Joaquin Phoenix is now in the acting Olimpus.,1
563,"Шикарная актерская игра,атмосфера, сценарий, операторская работа. Я конечно перед просмотром ожидал, что будет хорошо, но не думал, что настолько! Местами фильм тяжело и некомфортно смотреть.",1
564,Beautiful just simply one of the best performance and also the best movie of all time,1
565,"This movie took multiple days of processing for me to get to a place where i can divorce myself from the stress caused by what happens.  I saw it Saturday night, it was very difficult to deal with at the time but after digesting the movie over multiple days i've come to a place where I can honestly say I enjoyed the film very much.  This is not a film to bring the kids to.  this movie will challenge your perception of what's ok and what's not ok.  And, in that sense it does a wonderful job.  In addition to that the starring role played by Joaquin Phoenix is stellarly done.  I really don't think this movie could have worked with anyone else in the part.",1
566,"I am very proud of this movie, I have waited a long time for it and I was not disappointed.The revolutionary main actor Joaquin Phoenix, who was an amazing Joker, for which he deserved an Oscar, draws us to the image so that we can follow each subsequent move he makes as Arthur on the way to becoming the greatest criminal in all Gotham.Sensational soundtrack gives an unreliable atmosphere thanks to which we empathize with all this even more ...",1
567,"It's a psychological drama that portrays the path of a single individual, an underdog struggling with a society that cares nothing for him. The whole Batman-Joker brand is not even necessary for the story, but adds a nice, familiar touch.Joker strikes a cord with a lot of disenfranchised people in the film, and I guess he managed to touch me as well. An interesting twist on the perspective we usually get from Batman, with a relevance to today's world.",1
568,"The way in which Phoenix portraits both fragility and danger onto the same character was amazing, this movie was awkward, funny, sad, enraging, entertaining, all at once.",1
569,Only complaint is 8 shots are fired from a 6 cylinder revolver. Great movie making you feel uneasy the whole way.,1
570,"A beautiful, original movie. A character that we’ve known for years and years, reestablishes himself on the big screen, as one of the greatest comic book villains of all time.",1
571,"It is not an ""enjoyable"" movie, other than a few very dark jokes.... But it is very well done, Phoenix brings it; amazing acting. The movie really makes you think in many ways, and certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat.",1
572,The film is awesome! I've seen it twice in different languages - Ukrainian and English.,1
573,This was the best movie I’ve seen this year. Joaquin Phoenix should win an Oscar for that performance!,1
574,"Disturbingly funny, epic scenes, photography is amazing and how the joker is developed",1
575,"In the sense of how The Dark Knight changed the game so Does the Joker. I don't want other comic movies to imitate the formula here but for some Characters, the narrow scope and relatablness is fantastic",1
576,was the first time in the history of the world that I would have to go back and reflect on the way I feel about the loss of the country and the way that the mountains are going to have to go through and it will take time for the rest to get back down there,1
577,"Its a movie that the Joker is a human version of Gotham City. Phoenix is an amazing performance, like I havent seen in a lot of years. Its a movie that makes you think about what are we doing with all the social media controlling our life.",1
578,"Joaquin pheonix was extremely phenomenol in the movie , the direction of the movie was mind blowing and , THE JOKERS'S laugh is more terrifying then ever (ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF 2019 ).",1
579,I cant believe how well done this movie was. The acting was impeccable and shows Joaquin at his best. They way everything connects with the overall theme of mental illness and society is incredible. Do not pass this one up.,1
580,"Film yang bagus, mulai dari segi plot,karakter,pembawaan emosional,latar belakang, action dll.",1
581,Very Expensive and tragedy movie. Actors playing Phoenix is awesome. Best movie in 2019,1
582,"Best movie of the year, a masterpiece! Joaquin Phoenix give the best performance of his career with this Joker.",1
583,Filme muito bom. Só foi desnecessário aquele  flashback. Atuação do Joaquim foi espetacular. Muito mimimi dos que acham um filme perigoso.,1
584,"Easily one of the best movies of the last decade. Political activists, uh I mean collectivists, uh no, movie critics will rant against it for not spewing the same WOKE nonsense as every other movie is doing. So if you're tired of MAN BAD, WAHMEN PERFECT being forced down your throat every single time you try to watch a movie or a TV show, Joker is for you. Dark, grimy, bleak, honest and real, the way no WOKE movie could ever be, Joker is an oasis of cinematic art in a wasteland of political fanaticism. Go watch it at once. The negative reviews of ""professional"" critics should tell you just what a rare gem this movie is.Just ten more years to wait for the next good Hollywood movie, if the past decade is anything to go by. Thanks for ruining entertainment, SJWs everywhere!",1
585,Everything in this movie is great.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is magnetic.,1
586,"Над кем смеётесь? Над...Когда рэпер Oxxxymiron на батле с Гнойным спрашивал: ""Почему например у Джокера нет своего кино?"", дельного разъяснения, Мирон Янович не дал. На сегодняшний день, по сути, сольник состоялся, но не про клоуна, что терроризирует Готэм, а про мир, который создаёт символ ""праведной"" агрессии своим же безразличием.

Хоакин Феникс со всей съёмочной площадкой ярчайшим образом обыгрывают мысль, что ты либо умираешь героем, который всегда шёл по лестнице к небу, или же живёшь до тех пор, пока не становишься злодеем, что, пританцовывая, кубарем падает с неё вниз.",1
587,A poetic journey through the madness of a man and the harsh reality of our modern society. The movie pushs you to ask fondamental psychological questions about human behaviors.The Joker is an absolute masterpiece.,1
588,"Without a doubt it is one of the best movies for the last decade, I never wanted to rewatch any movie so badly as this.",1
589,It was one of a kind movie. Straight away it a hit. It's not about how good or bad the movie was. It's like the fans and your audience wanted a joker oriented solo movie. It's certainly lived up to the expectations. I wish they make a sequence on joker. Joker vs Batman but from the jokers point of you.,1
590,"'Joker' doesn't let you leave cinema without putting a smile on your face! (Or perhaps some of you will leave the theater with millions of possible theories for the ending)As a Ledger's Joker fan, I'm now also a fan of Joaquin Phoenix's - because he is the Joker. They both are.From his Oscar-worthy (and more) performance of this legendary character, to the cinematography, and dare I say, everything else - the movie is either a 110 out of 100, or nothing. It takes a person who understands what they're watching here to love this movie. This movie is everything to those who get it, and nothing to those, who don't want to try to understand it. I loved every single scene. It was extraordinary. It was brilliant. 'Joker' is a masterpiece you haven't seen yet.It is a ""dream come true"" piece of art, something that will leave you wondering for hours, days, and if you're a movie-lover like me, decades. It is that captivating & magnificently beautiful!Joker is the film of the decade, and I'm not alone who would say this.",1
591,Fantastic movie that is more performance art that a normal movie. Main media is trashing it because show them in a poor light and they have no taste.,1
592,"A dark movie in every way. Folks that are bombing on it see this and it frankly depresses them and robs them of hope. After seeing it, I left the theater knowing what the Joker may have been feeling, likewise depressed and hopeless. The gaps left in the Jokers life story before we come to where he has arrived in the movie are easy enough to fill in just because it's the same sad story we have played witness to on the web and in the news for decades now.  It's a cruel, cruel world indeed. A movie with a message many folks have obviously already tuned into.  It asks if maybe we should all  buckle up, this could become a bumpy ride.  Thought provoking for sure!",1
593,"Kacau gilanya! Kacau sintingnya! Kacau edannya! Jelas salah satu produk Warner Bros. terbaik tahun ini, bahkan dekade ini. “Joker” tegas, berani, provokatif, emosional, sekaligus mengerikan. Jika “Midsommar” sekadar mengganggu batin, “Joker” dengan nyata mengacaukan jiwa dan pikiran kalian ke tingkat di mana kalian menyadari turut delusional akibat sebuah film.Kewarasan kalian akan dipertanyakan kala menghadapi untuk harus bersikap simpatik terhadap karakter ini sebagai dampak dari kesehatan mentalnya atau mempertanyakan tindak kejahatannya yang semakin tidak terkendali. Tapi itulah Joker, bernama asli Arthur Fleck, salah seorang karakter antagonis legenda dan fenomenal dari sebuah karya fiksi. Film ini menghantarkan kita cerita lahirnya kriminal tersebut menjadi psikopat nomor 1 di Gotham. Di balik kisah asal muasalnya, “Joker” menyimpan lebih banyak isu dari yang dibayangkan. Sampah menumpuk di mana-mana, aksi berujung ricuh mengisi jalanan, hingga elit politik dan media tidak tahu diri yang terus meninggi di tengah kalang kabut segala konflik ini. Menonton “Joker” yang penuh ironi seakan menyaksikan dengan miris cerminan kondisi negara kita saat ini. “Perasaanku saja atau di luar sana semakin menggila?” tanya Joker.“Joker” memang berhasil menjadi sebuah tontonan kritik sosial yang provokatif. Namun, film ini punya isu lebih dari itu. “Joker” adalah sebuah drama-psikologis yang berdampak kuat pada kondisi mental personal seorang insan manusia, baik itu sang karakter maupun kita sebagai penonton.Joaquin Phoenix dalam penampilannya yang terus memukau di setiap film akhirnya tiba di puncaknya dalam film ini. Upayanya untuk menurunkan berat badan drastis tidak sia-sia. Sebagai Arthur, Phoenix dalam postur-postur mengerikan memutar anggota badannya seolah tulang-tulangnya terbuat dari plastik. Dan bagian terbaik adalah ketika ia berada di bawah tata rias badut dan tertawa maniak yang cukup untuk membuat bulu badan kalian tegak. Ini namanya penampilan ikonik! Kenapa Oscar masih begitu lama? Phoenix butuh penghargaan itu sekarang juga!Mau bagaimanapun, “Joker” tetap sebuah film yang diadaptasi dari karakter ‘villain’ Batman. Todd Phillips yang selain menjabat sebagai sutradara tapi juga salah satu penulis naskahnya melakukan segenap usaha untuk memasukkan Bruce Wayne alias Batman ke dalam film ini. Pada akhirnya, “Joker” memang sebuah prekuel kisah hidup Batman. Namun, kita semua tetap tahu bahwa “Joker” bukanlah film buku komik biasa. Ini adalah film dari komik yang menyakitkan dan realistis.Phillips mengaitkan Arthur dengan Wayne dalam sejumlah narasi dan momen yang mengejutkan. Ditambah beberapa adegan brutal bersimbah darah dan iringan musik pengiring mencekam dari Hildur Guðnadóttir, semua itu membuat kita sedikit teralihkan — atau malah kian stres — dari alur “Joker” yang sudah lebih dari cukup membuat kepala berat.Phillips yang dulunya menangani trilogi komedi-dewasa “The Hangover” sempat disangsikan untuk menggarap proyek ambisius ini. Namun setelah menyaksikan film ini, aku senang Phillips bisa mengaplikasikan keahliannya dengan baik dalam ‘humor’. Kita tahu bukan bahwa kehidupan itu perbedaan tipis antara komedi dan tragedi?Arthur di awal adalah sosok yang periang. Masih ada pula beberapa orang yang setidaknya melingkupinya dengan energi positif. Seperti ibunya yang renta sakit-sakitan tapi sangat menyayangi Arthur. Atau tetangganya, Sophie Dumond (diperankan oleh Zazie Beetz yang sayang tidak mendapat jatah pendalaman karakter lebih) yang sedikit menaruh perhatian. Dan ketika semua hal telah mencapai batasnya dan pilihan moral Arthur berubah, tidak ada yang bisa menghentikannya sebagai Yang Mulia Pangeran Badut Kejahatan dalam 15 menit terakhir film yang luar biasa!",1
594,This is one of the best comic drama history I've ever seen. That will be in my top list for a long time.,1
595,"Such an insanely beautiful film. How better to make honor to the most iconic villain of all time with this piece of art. JOKER slaps you hard in your mind. Every little part of the film is beautiful. The soundtrack, the drama, the twists, the plot, the history, the JOKER. What a movie. Joaquin Phoenix, the most underrated actor in Hollywood, will finally reach for that golden little piece by the name of Oscar. Even Todd Phillips can finally give a step up into the big boys league (maybe). The only point from a perfect 10 it's the fact that the film still holds itself to the batman Universe, in my opinion it could have gone even farther away from it. It's actually a 9.5 film. Enjoy it.",1
596,Critics differ greatly from the avg viewer' as they once agian put down a phenomenal movie!!!,1
597,First time writing a review just to say that the average film critic must have been completely drunk or high to say this film is not a masterpiece and a perfect representation of the Joker. Get your heads out of your asses for real,1
598,"Joker comments on mental health and classism in a way that provokes an uncomfortable feeling in everyone that watches. This is its purpose as it makes the audience question how we may treat others and what affects that has on them.  Do we have a role in creating 'the joker'.  Master class acting from Joaquin Phoenix and dark, gritty cinematography puts the film into the class of masterpiece.",1
599,"Such an aweosme movie, breathtaking and intense, will certainly mess you up",1
600,"Don't believe the critics on this one, they obviously have some sort of agenda against this movie.",1

602,"It was one of the best cinematic experience of my life. The gorgeous cinematography, the haunting score, the swift direction by Todd Phillips and ofcourse the performance of a lifetime by Joaquin made Joker one of the best in this decade.",1
603,"This is why film critics are no longer relevant, how can they give a film like this a group score of 59? What a Joke! hahaThis will be the benchmark of societal commentary for years to come.",1
604,By far the only lead actor who deserves an Oscar this year! Pheonix was completely flawless with his performance. Dark and tense from the get go!,1
605,A work of art to behold. A window into the perspective of mental illness. The effects of child abuse and neglect. Oscar worthy. XOXO,1
606,"This Movie is SUPERB, You will understand the whole story if you put yourself as Joker in this movie. You will give bad rating for this movie if you put yourself as a normal one happy human being.",1
607,"Shortly: It was amazing, for me movie of the year. I´m realy happy that it wasn´t a superhero movie.Full review: It was dark depresive exactly my style of movie.Acting was incredibly good Joaquin Phoenix is amazing actor and I hope he will get Oscar for acting.Soundtrack was also amazing it fit into this movie perfectly.Camera: great.Atmosphere: if you like dark and depresive atmosphere this is somethng for you.Side characters: Not that good but this is is understandable because main character was JokerJoker: He is amazing character and in this movie you can see transformation from Arthur to Joker and I was amazed how well it is shown in this movie. his laughter is incredible you can see haw he does not want to laught but he have to. And he is so good character sometimes I sympathized with him but then I realize who he realy is.",1
608,"Melhor coringa de todos .A história é muito boa e macabra, a história é lenta mas no final tudo se encaixa",1
609,Joker is the mirror of what happens in real life and that's why people find it uncomfortable 10/10. Phoenix made me believe that the one with mental problems was him instead of joker. That guy deserves the golden statue,1
610,"it is an Masterpiece. read some reviews first before watching where people said it a disappointment, too dark, but my they all where wrong. it the perfect combination. shivers your soul. make you look at the mirror and question your self. Movie never justified Jokers act but at the same time I'm sure we all loved em. made us face to face with the darker inner self. excellent performance. and yess it's dark. but I LOVE IT. Phoenix just raised to legend zone. 10/10. just watch it.",1
611,"Stanley Kubrik sends ""Hello"" in this one. The light/space play combining two key scenes which were pretty obviously taken from ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"". Hey, ""Joker"" is even the lead character in ""Full metal Jacket"". Joker is a film made with great detail in every scene. A beautifully developing story that only gets the downgrade from the ""professional"" critics because of the have/have-not meme.",1

614,"Suffering with mental health conditions myself such as OCD and GAD, I have never seen a film represent how scary mental disorders are and how little understanding people have of them who have never suffered themselves, judging by the 'pro' critics reviews except a few, very little of them seem to of felt the fear that the performance made me feel, I almost had to leave because I felt so anxious watching it, I managed to calm down and sit through it all and it blew my mind. Pheonix has to get an Oscar. The music, the miserable colours and feel of the city, horror movies don't scare me but this movie scared me to the point of feeling unwell.",1
615,"Joker is a fascinating film that every fan or non-fan will definitely enjoy, packed with phenomenal acting by Joaquin Phoenix, gorgeous cinematography, and a story that not only fits well with the character, but also brings us a different and realistic approach to comic book movies. It contains various breathtaking moments and an ending that will bring discussion and ambiguity, something that needed to be done for such a character. Definitely worth a couple of watches.",1
616,The movie is simply a Masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix is the best Joker ever and the movie was really amazing..,1
617,"Cinematography,music and most important Phoenix acted like the character deserves!!!There is no comparison out there",1
618,Joker retrata el por qué de los villanos así de simple. Y en este mundo lleno de humanos tan complejos es un simple vistazo a lo que puede llevar a pensar la mente humana a pesar de que sea un personaje ficticio.,1
619,Great Movie. Great Actor. I dont Can speak Good in Englisch because That in german. Dieser Film is einfach gut. Schön düster und passt perfekt. Er setzt den Joker perfekt in Szene und man sieht das der Schauspieler des Jokers ist einfach so unglaublich gut.,1
620,"jWhen Warner Bros first tried to make their DCEU it got off to a rocky start with some of their films struggling to find their own voice. Mostly since a lot of what they were doing was just trying to copy Marvel, ranging from an attempt at their own Guardians of the Galaxy with Suicide Squad or hiring Avengers scribe Joss Whedon to finish filming of the Justice League. But finally it seems DC has found its footing by focusing less on an extended universe and more on just making good standalone movies with tones playing to the strengths of their characters. We saw it earlier this year with the wholesomely hilarious Shazam and we’re definitely seeing it here with a film that completely upends all of our expectations for the comic book genre through Joker, a character drama which completely reinvents of DC’s most iconic villains.Taking place in a 70s version of Gotham (albeit a version of Gotham which looks strikingly similar to a 70s New York) the film follows Arthur Flecks descent into becoming the Joker. When we first meet him he’s already in a bad position. He’s stuck in a dead end job as a part time clown, caring for his frail mother in a rundown apartment, he’s taking seven different drugs to deal with his depression and keeps bursting into uncontrollable fits of laughter to the point where he’s in physical pain. Basically he’s just one bad day from complete lunacy and it seems that life is constantly beating him down to give him that one last push over the edge.Even the few lifelines that Arthur does have to his sanity seem to be brutally slashed over the course of the film, with many actions completely outside of Arthur’s control such as cuts to social care further isolating him from society. Bus riders treat him with disdain, kids beat him down in the street and we even get an interesting portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a snobby rich guy completely detached from the real problems faced by society. Though the way that almost every character in the city is completely unsympathetic is arguably done to a fault, as many characters in the film do end up being one dimensional characters with the sole goal of furthering Arthur’s descent. Though in showing us Arthur’s descent, Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the greatest performances of the year so far. The Joker has so many great portrayals, ranging from the pure chaos of Heath Ledger to the comically homicidal showmanship of Mark Hamil, but Phoenix has still found his own way to leave a mark on the character by layering him with a sense of tragedy as we see the pain that goes towards creating a maniac. It’s one of those incredible performances where the transformation is so fluid, but so monumental that we go from sympathising with a man beaten down by a cruel system to terrified at a madman capable of tearing a city down. There are so many small touches that really stood out to me like Joaquin’s slow transformation from self hatred in to turning his anger on to those around him and that laugh which constantly sounds as if he’s about to burst in to tears. Though the part of his performance that struck me the most was the extreme weight loss Joaquin underwent to portray the Joker. Beyond giving us an interesting insight in to his self-harming nature at the start of the film, there’s a level of visual discomfort whenever he’s on screen in a similar way to Chritian Bale in The Machinist. Beyond seeing his unnaturally frail boney structure, Joaquin said that the extreme weight loss gave him a sense of fluidity throughout the film which really showed throughout the film as Phoenix always appeared to move with such an unnatural liveliness. Some of the films most striking moments are some dancing sequences scattered throughout the film where the Jokers homicidal nature starts to peak out with as his rhythm begins to match up with the films haunting score.  It’s somewhat ironic that the film received so many criticisms for its sympathetic portrayal of a psychopath given that the same criticisms were previously thrown at the films like Fight Club and Taxi Driver that influenced it. Regardless, it’s important to realise that at no point does this film ever glorify violence. And the film does get us to empathise with the pain that Arthur goes through during the film, however it never condones his actions. A lot of credit needs to go to Warner Bros for being willing to provide such free roam to create such a chilling vision of one of their most valuable characters. And even more credit needs to go to Todd Phillips himself, who spent a year campaigning to get his r-rated character study off the ground at a time when action spectacles dominate the screens. Whilst he does cover similar ground to the Scorsese films that inspired him, this isn’t just a carbon copy and he really brought a unique vision to the Joker. I just hope that following this films success, Warner Bros continues to experiment with the rest of DC’s pantheon.",1
621,"Very well written, fantastic acting. An emotional movie and probably the best movie I've seen in a long time.",1
622,Best movie and performance of the decade. It’s a shame neither will be recognized by the absolute fraudulent and corrupt industry.,1
623,"Best movie I’ve seen in a loooooong time.  I’m really starting to believe that the critical reviews are fixed. This is an amazing film in every way possible, from the acting to the score, to the directing. Everything about it is magic.",1
624,"Great movie, you need to see it, HILARIOUS that the fake news sjw media rates it so low. That's how you know a movie is this good.",1
625,"The movie is breathtaking thrilling. Extraordinary story, sensational music & stunning performance by joaquin as JOKER. Its just mind blowing. First time i am seeing the real joker in movies. His laugh, his dance, him being completely unpredictable and the chaotic situation where a joker thrives are the ways i saw joker in cartoon. First time Todd Phillips introduces us the real JOKER .Joker is not super smart as shown in The Dark Knight, he thrives in chaos and he creates it by being unpredictable.... From the rating it received, i know there are plenty more people with my point of view...Keep Joaquin as joker, he is the best suited for this role...",1
626,"Insano, ultrapassou minhas expectativas , comedia e violência balanceadas , a atuação de Joaquim Phoenix é incrível , um ponto negativo é a morte dos pais do Bruce ,sinceramente não precisa , fora isso INCRÍVEL.",1
627,"Perfect! Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, excited for the next one in the series.",1
628,"The movie makes you understand the craziest supervillain of all time. What an achievement! Further than that the film makes you feel for him and you begin to understand, that even psychopaths have their reasons. I think many bad Reviews from the press are made because of a Moral viewpoint, but i think this film doesnt want to be a film about moral. It's a character Sketch (or ""Charakterstudie"" as it's called in German) and it is less about judging people… it's about understanding them. That does not mean automatically that anarchy or bad beheavior is praised or excused.",1
629,"The movie surprises you in a lot of ways. It's much more emotional, dark and cringy than what I was expecting but it's an incredible movie!",1
630,"Brilliant movie, incredible performance from Phoenix.Subtle and extreme in equal parts, definitely thought provoking but I just took it as the decent into madness of a already quite nuts fellas.",1
631,"Superb movie, Phoenix dominates the screen in every scene. The film is a breath of fresh air in a stale genre dominated by PG marvel films.",1
632,"Dark, gritty, and morbidly humorous, this character study based on fiction’s most famous villain is a true cinematic masterpiece that transcends the comic book movie genre.",1
633,"Simplemente la mejor actuación que he visto en mi vida. Todo es formidable, fotografía, dirección... Apasionante",1
634,Stunning movie! Gritty and dark from start to finish. Joaquin phoenix knocks it out of the park!,1
635,"Every aspect of a film, from cinematography, score, casting, performance, etc. Joker delivers all in spades. The movie touches on numerous sensitive subjects and there were all vital to explain how the character Joker could have come into existence. I assume the reason why people found the film disturbing was because they found themselves slightly sympathizing with the main character and they didn't want it to be so and overcompensated by damming it completely. This movie is lightning in a bottle and true storytelling by Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix and everyone involved. Thank you Warner Bros, for allowing this film to be made; don't mess it up.",1
636,"Who is the Joker, and why does he do the things he do? Is he a maniac created by an accidental fall into an acidic bath or is he a symptom of the society as a whole? Joker tries to answer these questions, while it also gives the audience an honest glimpse of our modern society, where the poor are forgotten and left in a system that is meant to keep taps on them more than help them.It is understandable why this movie has created so much controversy, because while it meant to be the backstory of Batman's arch-nemesis, it is firmly grounded in the reality and problems of today of today. problems that most people don't want to talk about or recognize.Because of this, and due in a large part to the stellar performance of Joaquin Phoenix, this movie deserves the highest of marks, no matter what the professional critics might think. The movie is just about two hours long, but time flies when you're having fun, and in my humble opinion this is a movie that everyone should watch.The best detail about this movie is the fact that it works perfectly as a standalone criticism of today's society, but it also works as a prequel to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" from 2008, as it tells a plausible backstory to Heath Ledgers Joker.In short; this movie should be seen by all, and it should be rewarded with as many rewards as possible.",1
637,"The film is not just Joaquim Phoenix's iconic performance, despite being its highlight.The character's dark mood and sense of deep sadness and despair are created with the director's hand in choosing frames, transitioning scenes, art direction and soundtrack.It is full cinema.",1
638,"MASTERPIECEOne Of The Best Movies I Ever SeenMovie are Great,Musics is Great,Storyline is GreatAtmosphere is Strong,very dark and tragic.Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Film Of The Year and Deserves Minimum 5 Oscars.Thanks To DC,WB,Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix.",1
639,"From the pitch trailer where Joaquin Phoenix donned the make up, and the trailers that followed after. Joker easily became one of my most anticipated films of 2019. I understood that it was taking a different approach, doing it's own thing outside of the Extended DC Universe. Reality can be a cruel mistress, along with life not being all sunshine and rainbows. It's unfortunate and sometimes we need movies to help us see that things can get crazier, it's unsettling though brutally beautiful there's no denying that. I'm not glorifying violence, though unfortunately when society, and communities fall. It's bound to happen, it's not going to be a light subject. It's going to be dark, grim, and dirty. Each kill or violent act we can see the madness growing until it reaches it's crescendo. To see the journey towards madness unfold with every inconvenience, every emotional breakdown it's heartbreaking, unpleasant, and it just makes you feel unnerved. Those aren't exactly bad traits for the performances just sell it. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a hauntingly painful display, we can see a broken man just scatter and rebuild into something more sinister. When all hope is lost, what more do you have to give? Zazie Beets as Sophie also did a great job with her role, acting as one of the few hope spots for poor Arthur, and De Niro playing a talk show host who might be a slimeball for his ridicule is no slouch either.",1
640,I made my account with the solely purpose of writing this and give this movie a solid ten. I don't understand why the 58 in the critics review but God this movie is gold,1
641,Outstanding film. The cinematography is amazing. The music is perfect. Joaquin kills it. The supporting cast is equally good.,1
642,"San Francisco Chronicle: Zombieland 2 = 75San Francisco Chronicle: Joker = 75The Seattle Times: Zombieland 2 = 75The Seattle Times: Joker = 63The right guys at the right spot - job well done, congrats you guys know exactly what you're doing. Real professionals. Is there really someone out there paying you?Best Joker ever.",1
643,"Es una obra de arte, la cinematografia y el soundtrack son excelsos, la interpretacion de PHOENIX es de lo mejor, esta llena de simbolismos y referencias a los comics, cinematografia clasica, Scorsese como TAXI DRIVER y EL REY DE LA COMEDIA, hasta a la filmografia de BALE como lo son AMERICAN PSYCHO, EMPYRE OF THE SUN y THE MACHINIST, pero quitando esos referentes la pelicula esta hecha desde la vision de una persona con una patologia mental que solo quienes padezcan algun trastorno por lo mas leve que sea se sentiran identificados y empatizaran con el personaje de Arthur Fleck, en un mundo que esta corrompido por lo politicamente hipocrita, la mercadotecnia de una inclusion forzada y donde todo el sistema se cae en una distopia estilo SOLENT GREEN, 1984, A SOUND OF THUNDER, donde tienes que tener una sonrisa forzada y si algo sale mal ser indiferente o voltear a otro lado en donde los desvalidos caen en la podredumbre y miseria, que los politicos y los empresarios mismos han producido y que tratan de apaciguar con historias y libros escritos por COEHLO por ejemplificar alguno, creo que simplemente JOKER no trata de justificar la violencia o la miseria sino darle un sentido a que todo un sistema podrido puede crear a un JOKER dentro de cada uno de nosotros, ASI COMO SPIDERVERSE DICE QUE TODOS PODEMOS SER UN SPIDERMAN, TODOS PODEMOS SER UN JOKER",1
644,This movie is fantastic. I wouldn't put this in my top 10 movies but it would be in a top 100. It makes you feel bad for Arthur and Joaquin Phoenix is probably the best part of the movie. I don't really understand why people don't like it.,1
645,"A good movie that I'll definitely see again, but I felt that this was less a Movie about the DC Super Villain Joker, and more a movie about a Man's descent into madness, and they just threw in a bunch of Batman references to help market the movie better.",1
646,"""I want just a little bit of f***king decency! What is it with you CRiTiCS?""^^The movie shows incredible compassion torwards the ill mind of the broken human being, in the tragedy of our lives we find ways of being beautiful and essentially good. But there is a loneliness in this world that ultimatly is going to corrupt the most weak willed(I hope this doesn't come out as harsh), and I'm not talking about Joker in this case, because that's something he didn't lack near the end lol. When he reveals himself as a super villain.So basically this movie is a lot of things, before it's a character bit, it's a great story and an incredible adaptation. And it is heartwarming and gutwrenching on a psychological level. The reason I like this Joker so much is because he is a real person, that we can relate to, and again just up untill he becomes a super villain, that's the line that separated entertainment fiction from the realistic initial approach, which worked fantastically.We need more movies that inspire people to delve into their own psyche, to learn empathy and compassion torwards other human beings, this might be a bit strange to say but I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Everyone has a little Joker inside of them.Thank you very much Todd Phillips, all the members of production and of course the cast, big cheers for Joaquin Phoenix for creating this incredibly relatable and awe inspiring movie.",1
647,This movie is absolute fire!!! Every aspect is brilliant! It’s one of those movies that’s makes you wish you could forget it just to see it for the first time over and over again!,1
648,Just Look and enjoy this masterpieceQuite disturbing but fantastic acting :),1
649,Amazing film! One of the best movies of our time I could say its next to Ghostbusters and the Empire strikes back. The movie took me for a rollercoaster ride of emotions I was even crying at one point. A refreshing movie from the non-stop action that modern comic book movies have become. If you are only interested in special effects and action set peaces this movie is not for you also if you have a weak stomach. I enjoyed my time with this movie and to see that it comes from the director of The Hangover was eye opening as there was no Shot that I did not want to frame. 10/10 iMO,1
650,"Outstanding Masterpiece! An artistic depiction of a mentally ill mind, with a plead for empathy and humaneness towards those who have to live alone and segregated from the society.",1
651,A masterpiece. A must see. So much to think about. I honestly didn't want it to end. The music was beautiful for such a tragic story. The awkward humour was  very clever.,1
652,"Isso é o Coringa!Um dos melhores filmes já criados, com um desenvolvimento de um personagem antigo de uma maneira nova, cenas impactantes e inesperadas, críticas negativas sem base e completamente parcial.",1
653,"By far one of the best movies I have seen lately, even people who don't like superhero movies will be pleased with it.",1
654,"It’s the best film ever since Godfather ! I don’t understand why the metacritics are rating it so low. Are you maybe jealous that J Phoenix has become the number one star and surpassed Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise? Is it because you’re not making money out of the film Joker. You the metacritics are a disgrace to the industry and if you like or not it will amass all oscars. So ask yourself why ? Is it because we (millions on this planet) are dumb and you’re smart? It’s obvious, the politics that you in the US create according to who fills your pockets. No wonder your country is going down the drain because of your ignorance ! Metacritics go home !",1
655,Absolutely terrific. The descent of Arthur's state of mind is captured beautifully. Joaquin Phoenix should at least get nominated for an Oscar for his performance. In the end he's your favourite character you love to hate.,1
656,"What a film, seriously what a film. It does frustrate me that DC can create masterpieces like this yet can't do this consistency. This was a harrowing descent of a man who gets brought down further and further to the birth of the character. Stand out moments like Murray being shot or the subway scene felt impacting. It felt like it made sense. As for Phoenix, my god that man can act. He managed to convey an entire spectrum of emotions. You can see the tears in his eyes as he laughs, seeing the pain that Arthur feels. Or when he laughs at Murray's body, its as if Phoenix enjoyed the scene. I wish more films like this was so impacting, harrowing and very little flaw in writing. This is how to do an origin story that's worthy of Joker and this hopefully will change DC and the genre to be more accepting of films like these.",1
657,Performance wise...Amazing. He deserves an award for the weight loss alone.,1
658,Awesome performance from Joaquin and beautiful operator work alongside with atmospheric soundtrack.,1
659,"Best Movie Ever. Governments and Private-Sectors been screwing people since the start. The system is run by mentally ill Sociopaths, they Fo-uck everything they touch. These Sociopaths think Democracy is great when it's just another corrupt government/private-sector dictatorship. The system can't be reasoned with, I don't want to hear no Bit-ching when Anarchy hits and everyone is Brutal as Fo-uck. Justice will be served!",1
660,"There’s something beautifully hypnotic about Joaquin Phoenix.Everytime I try to figure out why, but nothing will come closer to the answer. How lucky are we to go to the cinema and watch one of the greatest livings actors of our generation in his prime giving us a performance that we will never forget. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely phenomenal as Arthur Fleck, or his stage name ‘Joker’. Some of the best acting I’ve seen all year.Phoenix lost a staggering 50 Pounds for the role and there’s plenty of scenes where we see his whole body in frame. You literally see every bone in this guys body, and at times it makes him look ghoulish. Oddly shaped and mangled. With his shoulder blades in clear sight, you could metaphorically say he’s an angel fallen to hell after losing his wings, or something like that. When he laughs I feel his pain, because the character has a mental condition where he has episodes of uncontrollable laughter that doesn’t reflect his actual mood. A real life condition that’s so awful to imagine. Phoenix can act with his eyes where you see the pain and anxiety from Arthur's mental state.Whenever Arthur feels like he’s in control of something in his life, he dances. There’s a bathroom scene where we first see his dance, which looks a lot like Tai chi while displaying such power. Its also when darkness started to crawl into his soul. Something so simple can speak more than a million words. And what’s more impressive he completely improvised that scene. I like when directors let actors play around.I felt sorry for Arthur, not because I related to him or I saw myself in him, but because Phoenix is that brilliant of an actor that you struggle to pick a side to root for or against. Despite the questionable and straight up horrific acts he commits, but you understand how he got to this point and it dawns on you how much of a tragedy it is.‘Joker’ has already divided people like no movie ever. People say the movie is empty and has nothing to say. I don’t agree, because the message is loud and clear - don’t be a dick to your fellow neighbor. Todd Philips never intended to make a political statement, but to hold up a mirror to reflect the ugliness in people and the filth in our “improved” society.When I heard that Todd Philips was going to be directing, I thought it made perfect sense. Just watch the ‘Hangover 2 & 3’, the two most uncomfortable comedies he’s ever directed that felt more crime drama than anything funny. There’s also some dark humor in ‘Joker’ that involves a door chain. It’s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that’s why I think it’s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.The cinematography was gorgeous and there’s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.I like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than “guy gets shot in alleyway”. He’s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He’s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it’s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody’s else perspective.Now lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:This is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If “Joker” is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. And sure, there’s some brutal and raw approach to violence in ‘Joker’, but we all have seen worst. ‘Deadpool’ is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.Anywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.",1
661,"This movie is just excellent, character perfectly treated a new freshness for him",1
662,"Wonderful ode to Taxi Driver. I really enjoyed it's take on what happens to individuals with mental health issues during times of austerity. The Joker is no hero, but a very decent anti-hero.",1
663,"O melhor filme desse ano, revoluciona o gênero, com grande roteiro, atuações, fotografia e trilha sonoras, esse filme certamente deve ser lembrado no Oscar",1
664,"Love it awsome. Boot what media said, not controversial. Not even that crazy. Pretty grounded. Better than a hero movie like Avengers, but not better than Dark Knight.  For grown ups, kids will be bored.",1
665,Brilliant film that shines a spotlight on mental illness and the pitfalls people with those illnesses endure in a modern day society. Joaquin Phoenix was simply incredible and captivating in his portrayal of the Joker.,1
666,"The movie is a masterpiece which does not appeal to many people who can't put up with the dark and intensive theme and are disliked by critics for its violence. It's So sad because for me, Joker is undoubtedly my most valuable cinematic experience which i could never get back.",1
667,"Everything about this movie was great. Acting, writing,  directing, score, all awesome.",1
668,"Great movie.  Brilliant acting by Phoenix.  Infinitely watchable.  Most of the negative reviews are coming out of a misguided notion of what the movie is actually trying to accomplish.  If it makes you uncomfortable, that's the point.",1
669,a movie that builds the joker and gothem city in a beautiful way like non outer before even tho you know hes going to be the joker at the start of the film you will think that theres no way that hes the joker but at the end of it you will not be able to see anyone else as the joker but him,1
670,"Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker so well. Honestly, probably the best film I have seen in my entire life. No other movie had so many mixed emotions. You never know when to feel bad for the Joker or when to despise him. You don't know wether to cry or to laugh and what's real and what's hallucinations. So well done. The camera angles and everything is just delightful.",1
671,"This is a fantastic movie. It's worth noting maybe not for everyone, as drawing empathy towards a killer is not going to be to everyone's taste, but it's so refreshing and interesting in the middle of mainstream movies that I can only give it a 10.",1
672,Best villain ever ,1
673,"Amazing movie, not too much action and isnt filled with crazy set pieces but that would probably be why i love it so much. The writing and characters are amazing and i think that Joaquin Phoenix's laugh is IMO the best joker laugh to date.",1
674,One of the best movies of 2019. Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job as Joker. This is the Joker we wanted to see after Ledger.,1
675,"A work of art. Joker is everything I wanted it to be and more. If you haven't, do yourself a favor and go see it. You deserve it.",1
676,"Phenomenal movie. Best movie of the year, so much foreshadowing and attention to detail. A true work of art portrayed from a fantastic perspective. No saturated political agenda, both equally portrays chaos from both sides of rich and poor. Although if you get triggered easily by sad or sensitive topics it can be heavy to watch.",1
677,"Todd Phillips’ Joker is the most radical film released by a major studio since Fight Club in 1999. In fact, I find it amazing that Phillips was allowed pretty much free reign for what amounts to the most shocking and disturbing film based on a comic book. And here’s what you may find the most disturbing, that Joker is relatable because just like Arthur Fleck, we all have negative thoughts sometimes. We all face bullies in some form. And we all struggle in some way just to get by and hold onto some form of sanity in this increasingly crazy world.",1
678,An absolute marvelous movie with amazing visual style and extraordinary play of Joaquin Phoenix.,1
679,"My only concern about the movie was the scene of Thomas Wayne going with his family to the theater on that specific day knowing that there's was going to be a possible riot in the afternoon. The scene going trough the alley was perfect at first, but knowing what was going to happen was pointless. The scene could have been better if a police's officer told him to go trough the alley so nothing happens to the Wayne's family. But then a thug kill the police officer making Thomas Wayne's getting shot an Martha too. Other than that i loved the hole movie.",1
680,"Brilliant movie, amazing story and acting all round, but it is a one time watch as it is quite disturbing. One of my favourite movies by far though!",1
681,"Dark as hell, Joker takes u through the disturbing journey of Arthur Fleck, from being a clown & a wanna be stand- up comedian (with only one joke in his hand.....his life) to become THE ""JOKER""......this journey never looked unreal though, unlike that of a hulk or a spider man....as this journey was quite human, logical and beautifully graphed and captured(of course) !!!Heath Ledger from the 'Dark Knight' was my personal favourite joker till date & Joaquin Phoenix took the legacy of Heath to another level altogether.....that laugh, that dance, that sprint, that walk....uff....can't get over that !!!Talking about the other aspects of the movie....the background music was the soul of the movie, if not the psyche and the madness of joker itself,,,,,the cinematography, the supporting cast, the direction...everything thing was right on money , the movie very smartly dealt with the then situation of America (the Gotham city),,,,,the unemployment, the raising power in the hands of the rich....all it took was a stand and a voice (be it good or bad) against the established power to become the 'HERO'...which further became the reason of the rise in murders & crime in the city !!!In his small appearance, the legend Robert De Niro was exceptionally awesome, something that u would expect from him everytime u see him on the screen.....that small conversation at the end btwn joker and De Niro was cinematic beauty and looked damn organic....an absolute treat to watch !!!Don't know about the oscars, but it was once in the lifetime performance by Joaquin Phoenix....and would remain in my heart for years & in my brain for days to come,,,may be.....The best portrayal of a psycho character that i have seen...was that of Christian Bale in 'American Psycho'.....Phoenix was right up there too if not above, not only the craziness, disturbance and madness but also the physical transformation was quite commendable.!! IF HEATH HAS GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR THE JOKER THEN I WOULD SAY PHOENIX HAS GIVEN A LIFE TO THE JOKER !!My one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,""I used to think that my life is a TRAGEDY but now i realise that it is nothing but COMEDY""....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it's theme being 'TRAGEDY=COMEDY'...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to of or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!It has got those 'Dark Knight' (arguably one of the finest superhero movie ever made) vibes...i had an emotional ride, watching small Bruce Wane (Nolan's batman) meeting Joker, getting to know the pre batman story of the Gotham city and the back story or the building-up of the 'Joker the villain' of dark night.....IT WAS QUITE NOSTALGIC FOR ME IN THAT WAY !!!If i would have maximum of 5 stars to give to this movie, i would have simply divided it by zero (0).....i write about movies all the time but this one has that 'something' that forced me to type and share my views with u guys instead of writing it in my diary.....on that note i would like to finish this review with one line....""THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IN LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT I SAW....& U CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T MISS IT"" !!!",1

689,"The reviews of the Big Media exactly shows US what the movie was trying to say. But the ""Journalists"" just dont seem to get it. Their view and the general consensus are far apart. So long Story Shirt, If you studied journalism you better Not watch this movie because you wont like it. But if you are just a normal neighbourhood kinda Guy/girl you will absolutely love this masterpiece!",1

692,"Great movie! The story is deep and make the audience uncomfortable, as a Joker movie shoud be.",1
693,"Amazing story, incredible acting by Joaquin Phoenix. It definitely deserves a few Oscar's, such as best movie, best actor and best screenplay. It attracts fans and non fans of Batman/superheros.",1

700,Loved it great acting. GREAT MUSIC. GREAT ALL AROUND. THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH,1
701,"best ""REALISIC"" Batman movie.  There are no fake characters that would never show up in real life.  Everything in this movie could happen to anybody and if this is actually what the Joker's backstory is... then I sympathize with all of this.",1
702,Omggg this movie is so gargantuan i mean the composition of fish oil doesn't stand a chance against this crazily manufactured movie. I would 100% 10/10 a+ perfectly absolutely recommend. I would trade my grandma for this movie 100% .,1
703,"An absolutely amazing movie about mental health issues and how society leaves people perceived as different or weird behind. It's a portrait of a society that is failing to help it's poorest and sickest members. Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job of showing us how Joker establishes his character and grows more resentful of the society he lives in. Outstanding performance throughout, great character development. A must see!!! Most amazing origin story!",1
704,Hands down the best movie of the year! This is the best comic book adaptation ever! Love this movie saw it three times in the theater and now I own it. Fantastic on every level!,1

706,"Best movie 2019, é muito incrivel, do começo ao fim pois o mesmo basea na vida de sofrida!!",1
707,"This film is a masterpiece. Every element of filmmaking utilised is both individually brilliant, but more importantly reflexively cohesive. The music, the cinematography, Joaquins performance - it is all oscar-winningly superb, and all adds up to something greater than the sum of its parts. Many people put '10' or '0' in large user review pools so their review has maximum impact. In this instance however, Joker is a 10 any which way you look at it.",1
708,"I can't think of anything they could have done to make this movie better, it was perfect in my eyes. One of my favorite movies now.",1
709,"Finally watched this film. It is such an amazing film - incredibly disturbing but amazing! Fantastic cinematography, amazing acting, superbly written. Joaquin Phoenix's version of the Joker really connected with Heath Ledger's version. Joaquin's performance is riveting.",1
710,That is why I am love DC now. It is a point of start of the brand new DC Universe films about Batman and others. Absolutely awesome atmosphere and dramatic storyline. Powerful and Faithful.,1
711,"Not often do you see a film like this these days, it's definitely worth a watch but don't expect your average superhero movie, it's less action packed and more atmospherical and incredibly dark.",1
712,"Joker.A masterpiece of staging, with a perfect performance and a very careful photography.I'll be direct: this film has minutes to spare.Everything it shows is correct, but there are elements that are not necessary.",1
713,just give Joaquin phoenix an oscar already. this movie is amazing from start to finish,1
714,OBRA MAESTRA de las mejores películas del año y de las mejores en los últimos tiempos el oscar a mejor actor ya tiene nombre y apellido JOAQUIN PHOENIX,1
715,"This movie is exactly what i wanted to a Joker movie, it's uncomfortable (in a good way), it's acid and it's shocking, all of this are not just things for the sake of ""impact"", it's exactly what a story about Joker should be. Joaquim Phoenix perfomance is phenomenal, it's the first time i saw someone laughing and crying at the same time, the way that you can feel the pain in his laughter it's truly mindblowing, here we see Arthur (his character) expressing all kinds of emotion, from anger to happinnes, from sorrow to confusion, and so on, the movie was made for him and we couldn't had a better Joker than Joaquim. The nods to old movies like: Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (both of Scorsese) are really interesting and they never felt forced to me, it has everything to do with that whole ""character study"" that Joker masterfully achieves. That movie is like a rollercoaster, it's start kinda of slow but when the moment comes it has that habilty to make you feel on the edge of your seat. The story construction was pretty well made as well, it makes sense that the poor people are upset about the situation of the city, it makes sense that they see Joker as a symbol, this is not saying where they are right or wrong, it just brings the consequences of a sick society, the same circustamces that made a mentally-ill person at a dangerous psychopat who laughs of the tragedy he's been trough. For me it's a masterful example of how you should make a Origin story, that's why i think this movie is a instant classic and a masterpiece.It's a shame that a movie like Joker isn't get the praise that it deserves for the critics, that's why nobody cares about them anymore, people are much more interested to see opinions from guys the people who are up-voting this movie than a person that is much more concerned to try to put political agenda in his analisis instead of view the movie as a art.",1
716,"Muito bom!!! Ator fez o papel do coringa muito bem. Faltou um pouco de ação, mas ótimo filme!!!",1
717,"Acabo de ver esta magnífica y espectacular obra de arte que puedo asegurar que es en definitiva la película del año.Todo aquí cumple y supera ampliamente las expectativas, pero si esperan ver una película de acción y de superhéroes o algo convencional al respecto saldrán decepcionados.Aquí es Joaquin Phoenix quien se lleva todos los elogios, ésta es SU PELÍCULA y posiblemente sea esta la actuación de su vida, es trabajada, elaborada, bien ejecutada, es demencial, creíble, atrapante y por sobre todas las cosas es sumamente perfecta y a el se le ve extremadamente cómodo tomando en cuenta el hecho de que está permanentemente expuesto a la cámara, en fin, me faltan palabras para elogiar a este hombre que todo lo hace bien, pero en esta ocasión se supera a si mismo con diferencia y si con esta película no gana el Oscar, sería una de las peores injusticias habidas y por haber.Personalmente no pude evitar enamorarme literalmente de Phoenix y su desempeño como actor, supongo que mi locura interior se conectó con la suya, pero eso es un tema aparte.Negativamente no tengo absolutamente nada que decir, quizás a los fans acérrimos del ya fallecido Heath Ledger les cueste lidiar con esto y abrir sus mentes, hay que seguir siempre hacia adelante y saber apreciar el trabajo de los demás.En cuanto a lo positivo, ya está todo dicho.Con respecto a la valoración que debo darle, me faltarían estrellas de al menos 10 películas.He dicho ",1
718,"Trilha sonora assustadora, direção impecável, fotografia de encher os olhos e uma atuação revolucionária de Joaquin Phoenix elevam Coringa, filme dirigido por Todd Phillips, ao patamar de clássico.",1
719,"Me acabo de ver esta joya, con el corazón estrujado desde el inicio hasta el final... Ojalá las películas de DC tomen este rumbo humano, verosímil-oscuro que ya estoy cansado de tanta parafernalia colorida llena de súper poderes y marcianitos de Marvel la cual para mí muere con la última de Avengers y más cuando empiece su fase woke., Es como volver a la trilogía deB atma de Nolan, pero más sicológica, un diez más que merecido",1
720,"One of the craziest movie and a mist watch.It has got the ralaistic acting and a intense and ideological theme,although it cannot match the madness of heath ledger but it is amazing and a mist watch",1
721,A modern masterpiece. Sad that almost everything ends up in controversy these days in America!,1
722,This was a masterpiece! Finally a comic book interpretation that takes its characters seriously!,1
723,"It's a mastapiece, pop the champagne. No seriously, it is Joaquin Phoenix is incredible in this. Watch it now.",1
724,The best possible take on the villainous character Joaquin Phoenix delivers a terrific performanceThe film has so many awesome things to see and is awesomely crafted.The violence problem that critics are highlighting is just **** does not promote any kind of violence and does not promote the evilness,1
725,"One of the best movies i have seen in a long long time.Joaquin Phoenix delivers again, what an incredible superb actor. Also special mention to De Niro's acting which was amazing.One thing i loved about the movie was not only the character and his whole story, but also the amazing soundtrack which was composed by the same artist that created the music for Chernobyl series.I was completely blown away with this movie and it left me wanting for more. I will return to the cinema next week, i need to watch it again. What an absolute masterpiece.",1
726,"The film overall was stellar , the acting was amazing. Phoenix outdid himself converting himself into one of the most intriguing and Recognizable villains in comic book history. Good luck to any of the next contenders who try to fill the clown  shoes. You will have your work cut out for you.",1
727,"Absolutely amazing movie! Shows how someone can be driven to the edge of insanity when all that was needed was a hand reaching out or someone to talk to.This was truly Joaquin's best performance, and dare i say it??? Better than Ledger's? It really makes you sympathize with the joker and truly understand why he is the way he is. This is a must watch! People were clapping at the end and i had to join.",1
728,"I understand that people can have different opinions about movies, but a 58 score by critics...that is just extreme and unfair in my opinion. What a Masterful movie!!!...and Phoenix should at least be nominated for an Oscar.",1
729,A really well directed and acted movie of this decade. It may be the only movie which shocks you when i ends and i mean it in a good way.,1
730,This film is a work of art.It's really a pity that it grades are down because of not having a gay black person,1
731,Joaquin proved that he's a true contender for the Joker performance in a movie.,1
732,The story and plot were ok.  But man was Joaquin Phoenix amazing.  The guy is a true chameleon and was masterful in orchestrating the descent into madness.  You have to see this on the big screen also.  Some of the cinematography by Philips was awesome and had that 70s vibe.  Great movie.,1
733,"Una obra maestra, de lo mejor que he visto en mucho tiempo, pelicula redonda de principio a fin.",1
734,"Probably one of my favorite movies very relatable very real watch it , its worth it",1
735,"The movie excels at what it is trying to achieve - Realism and Relevance with today's society, skipping the traditional comic-book-movie approach. To truly appreciate the film you need to watch it as it is designed i.e a stand-alone film that has nothing to do with the Clown Prince of Crime from the pages of DC comics.  If you can do that, then perhaps you'll love it.",1
736,"""Joker"" is a film you need to go into without any spoilers or specific expectations of what the movie should be. Let the movie play out and be what it is, take in the experience. I personally gave the movie a perfect score based on my appreciation of Joker's inspiration from older films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". This is not an action packed comic film or follow a typical ""comic-movie"" formula (which is something I loved about it). It's character driven and artistic. If Joaquin Phoenix is not my new favorite Joker, then he's a damn close 2nd to Heath Ledger.",1
737,"Modern cinema truth.If it triggers SJWs, it is a masterpiece.Go see it, you will be delighted.",1
738,"I give it 8 out of 10.  A dark and disturbing plot which shines a light upon mental illness more than the comic book cover would otherwise suggest.  And it expertly takes the audience along for the ride so that by the end, you can really understand how the Joker may view chaos as the only state he is able to feel happy or content in.  I wouldnt say that its a film i would want to watch again and again.  But it is certainly powerful and profound in a way that most other films fail to achieve.",1
739,Great movie. Great story and acting. Go in the ass with your tolerance.The film does not go with modern trends that are bored with everything.,1
740,"One of the best movies i've seen so far.Joaquin phoenix's joker is proly the best villain ever in movie history. It is true, the movie is very dark and not for every audience.Kinda shame how SJWs and liberals bash this movie with low review scores.....",1
741,"Are you a crybaby SJW feminist soy boy leftist?  This movie probably isn't for you.Are you a normal person who enjoys amazing acting, meaningful social commentary, stylistic scenes, and a powerful message?  This is your movie.",1
742,"Just create a account to score with a perfect 10 this masterpiece. Loving how the cuck soyboys, mass sh*t media and sjw feminist toxic leftist are suffering. This is a new level of pure art and cinema.",1
743,"It is an absolute must watch movie. Incomparable, probably the top level of acting that has ever been done.",1
744,"This movie is a masterpiece in every aspect. The best HQ adaption since ever. Joaquim Phoenix is not good, he is PERFECT, really incredible.Left words to explain this movie... God, this is brilliant. Never se nothing how this in my life. JUST WATCH!",1
745,joker is a damn good movie. which is everything i wanted from DC. and for once they didn't disappoint.,1
746,"Está película es todo lo que debimos recibir del Joker, nos presenta un lado que todos pensamos que existía; pero que nadie se atrevía a explorar. Actuaciones magistrales, una dirección impecable, una fotografía que nos deja claro el mal estado de esta Gótica enferma, la.banda sonora es inmejorable. El final es sencillamente perfecto.",1
747,The movie was presented astonishingly well. It was a wonderful performance shown by Joaquin. He deserves an oscar for this role.,1
748,This movie majestically portrays how madness can eat up one's head. Joaquin Phoenix has truly mesmerised the audiences with his performance in depicting the protoganist of this dark slow burn. One of the best movies of 2019....,1
749,"Joker caminha numa profunda e sombria história de um homem que maltratado por Ghotan City, elevando o drama e a atuação de Joaquim Phoenix ao ápice da perfeição, sem dúvidas o melhor filme de 2019.",1
750,The best movie I have seen in 2k19...I'm sure the movie will bag many Oscars....The climax was so good I gave me goosebumps for almost 1and half minutes....,1
751,"2019's ""Joker"" is honestly a bit of an enigma, with controversy on one side, acclaim on the other, and a debate as to the film's true messages and quality raging all the while. So as someone who went in with next to no expectations, only a rudimentary knowledge of the background discussion, and a healthy distrust of many of DC's more recent film offerings, what did I think?I think ""Joker"" is most-definitely a good film, but not a great one, all down to one fatal flaw. It unfortunately never stops leaping for that mystical ""higher bar"", the legendary status enjoyed by films like The Dark Knight, and in that eagerness overreaches and kills its true potential. At its most sincere, ""Joker"" succeeds in being a convincingly fiery crucible to forge such a legendary villain, but especially in the beginning, turns up the heat even more to the point of self-parody.When we're first dropped onto the dismal-yet-familiar streets of Gotham, the film wastes no time in setting the world against Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, and that over-eagerness was my core issue. There's no buildup, no hope, no sense of potential wasted: Without any world-building or context, Fleck existing just to get beaten down and beaten down is shockingly ineffective, proving the film's priorities are focused on the goal, rather than the beginning. Gangs of bullies and ruthless bosses feel more forced than villainous, transparent mechanisms that exist solely to get the character where he needs to be, rather than to provide the organic descent and societal backdrop we were promised. It feels shallow, and in essence, the film would've benefited from taking its foot of the accelerator for a moment and smelling the roses, because as it stands, ""Joker"" starts off doing 90 mph in a fifty, and hits you with all the subtlety and depth of a freight train.However, once the wheels are in motion and Fleck's descent begins, director Todd Phillips and Phoenix are more able to run wild, and this is where the film truly shines. After a shaky opening, the ensuing roller-coaster ride is truly a sight to behold. And why wouldn't it be? Hasn't the Joker always been more effective in the present, did Heath Ledger need a backstory to succeed? No! As we watch both Gotham and Fleck unravel, every revelation and every depraved act comes as a gut-punch, all building up to a live finale that perfectly fits the tone of the film while feeling authentically Joker, and an ending that wisely avoids the expected cliches and ends on a note of glee. Here, the Joker becomes a twisted hero in his own way. It wasn't the success Arthur Fleck had hoped for, but it feels like destiny nonetheless, and by the end all force and stiffness from the start of ""Joker's"" world fades away into a feeling of chilling plausibility.So to conclude, I would recommend ""Joker"" for anyone looking for a fresh take on the classic character. This isn't your typical superhero flick, and while the darkness and violence may be a turn-off for some, it's an experience most will enjoy. It's a film that starts off unconvincingly, but is sure to leave an impact by the end. And with such large clown-shoes to fill, ""Joker"" more or less reaches the bar.",1
752,A great movie that leaves an impression on you after you leave the theater.  It exposes the mental health of America and shows and society that is okay ignoring thier lowest members get what they deserve.,1
753,"10/10, absolutely 10/10. Ignore all of the ridiculous and pathetic ""controversy"" **** and you'll be I'm for one of the best times you'll ever have at the cinema,  trust me. It's been said but phoenix is Oscars worthy here. I mean, seriously. You won't understand til you see it so I won't say Any more.just do it.go see it. Now And then go see it again because we have a 1 time opportunity to see a movie this good while it's on the big screen. Go.",1
754,This film was exactly what I expected it to be going in to it.  Phoenix was incredible.  The story was good.  Batman nuggets dropped in here and there but definitely all about the Joker.  Don't believe the critics.  This movie is very good.,1
755,"This movie was great. I honestly would give it a 9.3 out of 10, but feel I need to give it a 10/10 here to combatthe ridiculously out of touch critic score. They have an agenda and/or have a terrible taste in film.",1
756,"Don't mind the negative reviews, it's a masterpiece. Best superhero film since TDK.",1
757,MasterpieceJoker 2019 dark than dark night this joker is best joker ever made better than heath and Jack Todd Philips with this great movie its new start for his career,1
758,"Don't let the critics scores influence you, the media wants this movie grounded, they're trying to kill its reputation.But in reality, Joker is a masterpiece, an acting masterclass, beautifully written and directed drama.",1
759,Perfect . Perfect  . Perfect . Perfect . Perfect . Perfect . Perfect . Perfect,1
760,#Joker is a true game changer for the superhero genre. I was enthralled and can't wait to see it again. My YouTube review: https://youtu.be/WoKI9cjcSjs,1
761,The best movie I've ever seen!The best Joker so far!I don't understand why are there some people who dislike this movie. Because of the violence? How about John Wick? Damn!,1
762,This film is about us all. Joaquin's game is divine. the soundtrack is depressing. 10,1
763,"THIS IS WHAT THE COMIC BOOK MOVIE GENRE NEEDS After years of watching the same mundane comic book movies again and again, I needed something different and joker is exactly what I was looking. Think of all the comic book movie tropes you know it and toss it out the window. I wouldn’t call the story original, but damn if it isn’t the most intense, disturbing, impactful movie I have seen in years. This is without a doubt my favourite movie of this year and possibly many more years.",1
764,"I usually overeggagerate a lot of the movies I review. And usually, I give more positive reviews on things than negative. I am easily forgivable for the occasional bad movie, but this one was a movie I had to clear my conscious of. I didn't want all the press and early reviews to cloud my judgment on what I PERSONALLY thought of the film. So after seeing it, what do I think? I believe the hype. It's a true modern day masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets and none of the hate from naysayers. Phoenix gives a performance that rivals Ledger's and brings something never before seen to the comic book world. Todd Phillips has proven that he no longer needs the frat-boy comedies and that the world of dramas is where he thrives best. Lawrence Sharr, the man behind the cinematography, has brought to life some of the most gorgeous shots I have ever personally seen, even rivaling Roger Deakins from Blade Runner 2049. The score by Hildur is ecstatic and terrifying to listen to. I really love this movie, from its story -- while familiar -- fits within the world that has been established, to the acting FROM EVERYBODY, to the greater themes of bad days, society, and madness itself. It's sad to say that we will never get another look into the world of Joker because this movie left me wanting more, and that's a truly amazing thing for a movie to do. If it leaves you wanting more, then it did its job. Joker is a masterpiece, a true statement on the culture of cinema, and I hope that everyone who receives a nomination wins it, because this movie deserves it. And for the love of God, send in the clowns. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. HA HA HA. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!",1
765,How they managed to create such a deep understanding of such a screwed-up character as you repeatedly notice yourself sitting with a smile on your lips during the film's darkest scenes. Goosebumps.,1
766,"Dark and deep. Slow tempo but explodes at the end, amazing acting from Joaquin Phoenix.",1
767,"This film is soul of Joker as is. Pure evil without any morale in crazy Gotham. His insane and power of ""jokes"" will grow...",1
768,It's a dark slow-starting movie with an crazy amazinnngggg second half. And Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely incredible.,1
769,"The best movie of this year , Oscar to Joaquin. Amazing history with amazing end ! Thanks for this WB and DC",1
770,"There is a pity for hateful people. I cried five minutes before the movie started, although it may be that my own lacrimal gland is too developed. But as a person, when I see this society in the picture, this may be a society in the movie or a real life, and start to feel sad for those who need help.What are the conditions that make you think you can bully people?Who is deciding who's death is more worthy of being pity.The scene at Talkshow can be said to be the core concept of the film, completely bringing the existence of Joker and the morbidity of society to the table.What everyone is not willing to face is the person who called the indifference, so he chose to blame the murder, but he did not think that he was one of the murderers who led to the birth of the murderer.When he becomes Joker, you and I , The Society gives him a hand.Today, through the story, we watched the birth of a person who needed warmth and was cast aside by society, a person who was originally kind but was fooled and collapsed.It is not Arthur that is wrong, but the indifferent people of this society and those who think they are clever and bully.In contrast to Batman, I feel that Arthur is a flesh and blood.  It’s not spoiled here.At the end of the movie, I still vaguely remember what Arthur said. ""Please...don’t...i really love my job..."" Writing this eyelids began to turn red again. It is not difficult to imagine how much a person will be disappointed when he simply wants to bring laughter to the world, but is ridiculed and used by the world. You really can go see ""Joker"" After reading it, I just want to talk to everyone around me. Don't be indifferent to the people around you. Even if he is sick, he is very strange, and don't abandon him. Because you may be able to save it before the world changes. I don't want to talk too much here, because I know that film reviews or experiences will affect the shock and the point of entry for a person. If you see something else or have any feelings, go to the movies and taste! I just want to say after reading it. If I were Harleen Quinzel, I would probably also become Harley Quinn by listening to Joker's story. I am so distressed by Arthur and I feel bad for Arthur's kindness.",1
771,Kept me guessing throughout the film. An impressive adaptation of the joker.,1
772,"I didn't know how to rate this movie?Couple of things I didn't like was the biting/etchy cello/violin score which grated a bit. Joker's laugh was at times a bit much also but I guess they were part of the process.Now something I liked was the process of building a character. Whereas Dark knight's Joker pretty much turned up on the scene without much character buildup this Joker built the character like never before. As good as heath Ledger was this is on another lever in madness.    If Heath's Joker was Dark Knight, this Joker should be Midnight Black. Heath's Joker had method to his madness, this one is just well,, mad. You just don't know what he's gonna do. Very well played by Joaquin. Joker 2 in this franchise will be interesting. This is no lolly pop Marvel movie.",1
773,"I think Jeremy Jahns said it best, ""Joker gives movie fans and movie go-ers the ability to see what comic book fans have seen for years,"" and I agree.Granted, Joker is nowhere faithful to the comics' origin and that's okay, because the character Joker only has apocryphal origin. Todd Philips craft a story that reflects the spirit of it's comic book lore with skillful panache. Also true, is that this movie could not have worked half as good if it wasn't for Joaquin Phoenix - he is masterful in making you feel both uncomfortable but empathetic in understanding the mind of a psychotic killer and at once not justifying nor condoning the choices that his character makes.He is after all a villain, and Phoenix has shaped and chiseled a fine villain here.In a recent interview, Phoenix commented that he did not refer to any previous incarnations or interpretations of the Joker and I think it shows. He fully owns the character here; this is his Joker - a raw, gritty, grimy and unpolished Joker - and even though in my opinion it's not as good as Heath Ledger's, Phoenix's performance can proudly stand shoulder to shoulder with Ledger's.Other notables is the really good sound design, original soundtrack and score, of which really adds to the atmosphere of the film, I would recommend watching in a Dolby Atmos theater, as well as the above average cinematography that captures both figuratively and literally the filth and decay that infests Gotham.The movie is not perfect (though I understand why many would deem so). I find that in the end, I wanted more Joker. I am fine with Arthur Fleck and the buildup towards the Joker is necessary and I was entertained. But I wanted more Joker. I wanted more of the mayhem, more carnage, and more dark humor. Joker 2019 had some jokes, but it was contained in the last third of the movie.The movie is also deliberately slow paced, but the end is worth it. Arthur Flecks slow descent and ultimate transformation into the Joker is a gratifying moment for comic book fans and even non-comic book readers who have arduously discussed and imagined this character for decades. This is the best deep dive of Joker that you're going to get out a film.Still, I believe that this is a fantastic leap forward for comic book films, just as the Dark Knight was a leap forward of the genre in 2008. After the tiresome though admittedly entertaining decade of MCU popcorn flicks, we who grew up with them are ready for something more and Joker delivers.P.S. Pay no attention to the salty mainstream media reviewers being bitter about getting disinvited to the premiere. It's 2019 and we all know that mainstream critics are ****",1
774,Movie was Amazing Phoenix is best joker he deserves oscar. Everything in movie was great.,1
775,One of the best films I’ve seen in a while. All of the accolades are deserved.What Todd and Joaquin did is really mind blowing and the ending? WOW!,1
776,Had no business being that good! Anyone giving this movie less then a ten needs help.,1
777,"Descent into utter madness, the downward spiral of mania. A true villain soaring above all and lands with grace, disrupting the peaceful, even chaos raises its head and takes note as The Joker begins his journey into histarical destruction.",1
778,Must watch in imax get some quality content than marvel **** ,1
779,"Before writing this review I had to pick my jaw up off the floor, get over my speechlessness, and eat some crow.  Because when this movie was announced it sounded so ridiculous that I thought it might kill DC's cinematic endeavors.  And I did not support the idea of this movie at all.  But here I am, having just seen this movie, saying that not only is it good, it's certainly my favorite movie of the past year or so.I don't wanna spoil even the least bit of it, and there's no need for me to go on too long.  Just don't go in expecting something fun like the Marvel movies, or even occasionally lighthearted like Aquaman or Wonder Woman.  This is a drama, and a serious character study.  And an excellent one, at that",1
780,Must watch flimI don't compare with legend actor but  acting awoseme powerful,1
781,Pure ART! this is not a movie made for your entertainment.it is hard to watch it because it is so close to our real life.Only bullies gonna get triggered and offended by watching this movie!,1
782,"True madness in all the right ways. Amazing, award-worthy performance by Phoenix, beautiful, dark and thrilling sets and an awesome soundtrack in all the right places. Bravo! (Critics come on?)",1
783,I don’t understand why people comparing this with Taxi Driver ... Joker wins in all aspects. Appreciate the art.,1
784,Sem palavras...achei muito foda...um filme diferente para quem quer sair da mesmice dos filmes de super heróis.,1
785,"Best film of the year. The acting, the cinematography and the soundtrack is amazing.",1
786,"Лучшее что я когда-либо видел, сходил в кино два раза и каждый день переслушиваю саундтрек.",1
787,"One of the best (if not THE BEST) movies i've ever seen in my whole life! Joaquin Phoenix is utterly awesome, with one of the best performances of all time! The finale was totally mind blowing and chocking, i have no better words to discribe how incridible this movie was... Todd Philips gave us a masterpiece...",1
788,"One of the best movies I've ever watched. No one could've achieved what Joaquin did. The movie made me feel so many emotions, it's amazing.",1
789,"This is the sort of film that lingers with you -- over a week later, I keep thinking about it. Highly recommended.",1
790,"masterpiece movie,joaquin phoenix is incredible perfomance ,spectacular movie",1
791,Actually I am shocked to say this but I think this is the best movie on 2019,1
792,"Probably the best movie of the year so far, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was Oscar worthy. I wish they did more comic book villain movies like this.",1
793,"if you're expecting a normal action marvel superheroes forget it.this is not that kind of film this film is more of a story of character,it's very slow but at the same time it makes you sitting at the edge of your seat not knowing what will happen next.overall if you're the kinf of  person that likes dark,psychological,thriller movie i suggest you to watch this movie.",1
794,"Ignore negative critics reviews, literally makes no sense why there's been so much hate from 'professional critics'...might need some new people in to replace soon. Anyway, Joker is brilliant, even though an overused saying it is a piece of art. Phoenix's interpretation is fresh, immersive and utterly engaging. If you're a fan of the character, see the film. If you're not, still see the film. An honest 9/10 - I think (in a non spoilery way) that if instead of the film ending where it did, if it had an extra 15-20 mins then it would be a 10 from me, considering the contents of the final act.",1
795,I think this movie is almost perfect of o could I would give it a 9.9 critics don’t like it cause it shows he fault in humanity and still think that good films is **** like captain marvel,1
796,"This movie is very good, filmed in an European Style. This is not a blockbuster with special effects, it is about a man's drama. Joaquin Phoenix is for me The Joker. Great performance",1
797,"Its not what you would expect and i feel like a lot of people will be upset about how different it is than most comic book movies. In fact its not really a comic book movie, its more of a drama if anything. Tie ins with the Waynes and Gotham are pretty awesome because it sets the stage so i enjoyed that as a comic book fan. The movie is well acted, really well acted so credit should be given there. It was a bit overlong and dragged at points but the 3rd act somewhat made up for that. Its worth watching although it doesn't necessarily need to be watched ASAP in theaters, i would have been fine watching it on netflix later. Second viewing...Its even better on the second viewing, i might go see it a third time. Its def worth a watch so go see it lol",1
798,"An incredible piece of art about our lack of empathy and its consequences. Explaining where violence may come from doesn't equate to justifying it. If the movie parallel's real life so much, it's not the movie we should be criticizing.",1
799,Best ever comic book based movie. Acting directing and plot  in a whole new quality level. Dont believe in negative reviews. Go see it in cinema. Masterpiece,1
800,Jaoquin Phoenix's joker is a masterpiece...His acting is up to point and he's probably the best joker after Heath Ledger & Jared Leto,1
801,"Bold and gritty, a refreshing take on the Joker we thought we knew. Could easily be the best movie of 2019.",1
802,"Criminally False Critic score. Mr Phoenix deserves something better than an oscar for his performance. The direction taken with this movie is realistic, and it's scary. This is a movie you should watch, even if you dislike the outcome.",1
803,Mindblowing!!! The way they are showing the fact of joker lifecycle from good to bad,1
804,"My wife and I got to see a sneak preview of The Joker last night here in Thailand. All I can say is WOW! Hands down the greatest acting performance and perhaps movie I’ve ever seen. Do not listen to the “safe space” critics that think this movie is a giant dog whistle for Donald Trump.  This movie is a masterpiece in the same league as Taxi Driver. The movie received a standing ovation here in Thailand. Considering that most of the audience was reading subtitles, that’s pretty amazing.This Joker movie embodies the ethos of ""cheerful nihilism"" / “Clown World”. Clown World is the idea that the world is becoming more and more like a grotesque freakshow, with degeneration on various fronts becoming worse (social, political, racial, etc.). Instead of bearing the emotional burden of what some believe is the multi-faceted downturn of society, ""honk honk"" ""Put on your smiley face"" ""Why so serious?"" represents the option of cheerful nihilism, where one acknowledges the world's absurdity but decides to laugh and make fun of it. ""Why get riled up when none of it matters anyways?"" “I thought my life was a tragedy, then I realized it was a comedy” says the Joker.",1
805,Most hyped movie by me and was all worth it (12 months). I was so stunned by this movie and got emotional after movie. Tears was dropping and havent before cried. Masterpiece i was seeing how much Joaquin was putting effort for the role. Heath Ledger friend of Joaquin would like the movie.,1
806,"O filme é uma obra de arte, reflete com tanta fidelidade a nossa sociedade cada vez mais podre e nos coloca a reflexão sobre o que teremos no futuro. Um ótimo acerto da DC, trazendo algo a frente de seu tempo, com certeza abrindo portas.",1
807,"intense, scary, disturbing & utterly beautiful.This is reality.. we are all joker",1
808,It's awesome... Loved every second of it... Words are not enough for the acting,1
809,"A masterpiece - well done to all involved, we will all be thinking about this movie for years to come!",1
810,"This movie is badass. Each and everything is perfect writing,cinematography,bgm, and the acting is surely oscar winning. DC at its best..",1
811,"One of the best DC movies till date! , Joaquin phoenix has set the benchmark too high with this performance. Someone else now playing joker in any other live action movie will just a be a downgrade. Cinematography and Direction is perfect followed by great background music which gives you goosebumps. Ignore the critics , They've propaganda against DC anyway. Enjoy the movie.",1
812,Best movie of all time. Movie stays true to the comics. Where marvel movies are dumb and funny. Joker is dark and real. Even better than any Batman movie.,1
813,Great movie that makes your want a new chapter to the batman universe. Will see again!!,1
814,"Those that don't understand it will give it a 0, those that do will love almost every second of it, the Joker movie is so good, its not a batman movie with joker in it, its a joker movie, those that are hesitating to see it, should go see it, Enjoyed it very much and will probably watch it again.",1
815,"Awesome! The best DC movie since The Dark Knight. Very real, dark and gritty.",1
816,"Absolute masterpiece - Todd's magnum opus, a Mona Lisa of today's reality that will be forever looked down upon by shallow, mindless husks of people (you know the exact type).",1
817,Y’all just sensitive ass people this movie was a masterpiece! Period.This generation is a fail,1
818,Perfection. Acting is best seen in cinema in years. Infinite meaning in this meaningless modern world. Story grows perfectly. Ignore the negative views as they have made this movie a form of strawman for their psychosis. Go see this movie.,1
819,"Absolute Masterpiece! Joaquin Phoenix is a GOD, This movie is an eye opener which shows the world through the eyes of those who are Underprivileged, how society treats them and how a few events can turn their life upside down, Direction by Todd Phillips is Utterly Beautiful, Sound Score is fantastic, it's a 100% movie, Joaquin phoenix is a GOD,a pure masterpiece!",1
820,The best comic book movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
821,"DONT LISTEN TO THESE CRITICS! the movie is awesome i really enjoyed it and after i watched it i said dam boi what the fu did i watch i've never felt like that in years and i bet the people who didn't understand it would give it a 0-2, a true masterpiece hands down one of the best films i've ever watched.",1
822,"One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, it is a masterpiece. Words can't do this movie justice, you have to go see it. Thank you to everyone that was involved with creating this fantastic art, truly thank you.",1
823,just perfect. cant explain. cant imagine how fantastic it is. its masterpice,1
824,"Funny how critics will praise exploitative trash but when a realistic, hard hitting film like this comes out they shy away from it just because it makes them uncomfortable. Yes this is hard viewing, but it's supposed to be. Joker is every person you've ever ridiculed, every person with mental illness you've stared at funny on the bus and judged. This is a harrowing account of how people really feel in our society, taken to an extreme of course, but this is really where we're headed if our politics  don't change along with the scapegoating and shunning of those are less fortunate or different in a way that scares us. Critics call it cynical. I say, wake up, take a look outside. Sure its not all awful, but this is a dramatisation of a very real phenomenon. It begs us all to be a little nicer to each other and acts as a stark warning of what can happen when people aren't heard or seen. A powerful film. I just hope we don't see any copycat crimes. This is the only thing that scares me. I'm surprised this film was allowed to made at all, but glad it was",1
825,The whole theater was dead silent. I've never experienced this much agony watching a movie. Fantastic performance by Joaquim Phoenix. Truly a life-time achievement. I can only imagine how much it must've hurt him to portray the character. Everything felt painfully real.,1
826,Masterpiece... as simple as that. Superlatives wouldn't be enough to qualify that glorious piece of cinema,1
827,"This movie had it's own way with the joker and i like that , they didn't follow the comic's backstory instead they went with a different and more realistic backstory where it's can show you the effect of society on the character (Arthur), and i can say that this backstory is equal if not better than the original comic version or from the animated movie the killing joke",1
828,"I've been looking forward to Joker for months now and I can safely assure all of you to believe the hype. It’s everything you’ve heard it would be and more. DC descended into a pit of bad movies in recent years, frantically searching for a balance between dark and gritty or laugh out loud comedies. So not only is it refreshing to see a successful, well-written, stripped back comic book movie but it’s also one of the darkest films I’ve seen in years and definitely pushes the comic book genre into new territory.Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a man who has been forgotten by society, neglected and living in poverty with his mother in Gotham. Working as a clown for hire and desperately trying to make it as a stand-up comedian. A character study very much grounded in reality. It may be too real or too dark for some viewers, watch the trailer if you’re in any doubt, it will give you just a taste of what’s in store if you decide to see Joker.There was always going to be the problem of taking on an iconic character like the Joker on the big screen again. Anyone portraying that role can’t help but be stuck in the shadow of Heath Ledger’s performance. A performance so brilliant the Oscars decided it was deserving of a win. The abysmal Suicide Squad gave us a very different take on the Joker with Jared Leto. Hardly a memorable performance though in his defence he didn’t exactly get a fair shot as Suicide Squad appeared to be hacked to pieces in the editing room and stitched back together at random. That is the only logical conclusion I can draw from one of the worst comic book films I’ve ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix was an ideal casting choice for a Joker origin movie, it’s not an over the top CGI flashy film by any means. Phoenix is one of those few actors that puts everything into a role, you can see him disappear and transform into the Joker. It’s terrifyingly brilliant and I’ll be shocked if he doesn’t walk away with an Oscar for his portrayal as the Joker. He’s one of the only actors who could possibly match Heath Ledger’s standard. Just don’t ask me to choose a favourite because there’s no way I could do that.Everything from Joaquin Phoenix’s onscreen presence to the chilling soundtrack sets out to unsettle you constantly. I was incredibly tense for this whole film and I know I’ll still be thinking about Joker for a long time afterwards. A deep look into the mind of a man pushed beyond his limits. Phoenix’s manic laugh alone is enough to send chills down your spine. Frightening, disturbing and at times it’s almost like a horror movie. It doesn’t matter what kind of comic book movie you prefer Joker is recommended for all you film fans.",1
829,"Oh my god....oh my goodness, oh my goddamn jesus mother of christ....thats all i have to say",1
830,The movie offers a unique case study into the life of one Arthur Fleq and his descent into madness as he becomes the joker. It also offers a unique insight into some societal issues faced today using this as one of the many accusations for his descent into madness.,1
831,"i just wanted to express this was everything i wanted it to be and i implore you to go watch it as soon as possible. this movie makes you go in trance for two hours, mesmerized by the joaquin phoenix performance and the world created around the joker character. an overall masterpiece.",1
832,This was one of the greatest films I’ve ever seen in my life. In an age where everything is created by corporate committee and has to make everyone feel warm and fuzzy its a godsend to find a major studio take a risk. It’s not a happy film and it’s not meant to be. It’s here to show arrogant narcissistic unsympathetic a-holds that there are lots of people in the world who struggle every day just to survive. How you choose to treat these people can have serious consequences. Pheonix was outstanding and if that’s not an Oscar worthy performance then just stop the Oscars because they’re a joke. The Joker is here!,1
833,The best of movie of 2019. A definite Oscar contender. Joaquin Pheonix puts on a splendid and an amazing performance as The Joker.,1
834,"I am not a professional film critic, but this movie is a complete work of art. The soundtrack really adds tension to the scenes, and Phoenix's laugh is torturous (he deserves an oscar, and I'm not exaggerating). I felt sorry for Arthur Fleck for most of the movie, but in the end he became the scary and inhuman Joker.   I didn't find this movie violent, in fact the violent scenes are raw and well filmed. I feel sick for ideological critics who see politics in everything and think this movie can have a bad influence. **** Art is not intended to moralize anyone.   Although I don't like comic books, it's a realistic movie and I liked this style! I hope to watch again to capture all the details.",1
835,I suggest people to just go watch it and stop believing what the propaganda media say about the movie. it is also one of the best movie and thee eprformance of Joaquin Phoenix is a Masterpiece. Must watch,1
836,Incredible movie. A cgaracters study of mental illness in a world with a severe lack of empathy,1
837,The critics here are wrong yet again! The joker is a masterful performance showing true character development with an amazing response. The cruelty that Arthur faces to become the joker are so foul that hey feel even more real. This was a wonderful backstory to everyone’s favorite clown.,1

844,"A depressingly refreshing movie that adds an entirely different taste to the superhero genre which is riddled with formulaic rehashes of good guys saving the world. Joker is a masterful showcase of what happens to a mentally ill man who loses everything (or maybe realising he never had anything to lose). Joaquin puts on a fantastic peformance that will leave you unsettled and shaken which expresses how social apathy, isolation and economic issues can lead to disastrous consequences for an already distraught person.",1
845,"Don't listen to trolls reviewing this movie. It's a masterpiece.Needless to say, Joaquin Phoenix's acting is beyond perfection on this movie.The plot is very intriguing and makes the viewer question oneself about the protagonist behaviour and reality.It shows its boldness on the terrific atmosphere of an ill man on an ill world: violence, lack of compassion and education. This movie really surprised me - a lot - dealing with a deep and serious tone, and unpredictable plot twists.Camera did an astonishing work to maintain the setting. Character builds properly with an ultimate crescendo pacing. Music is great.I was not a huge fan of Joker or DC related characters, neither I know if it's true to its comics inception, but it's a hell of a movie.",1
846,Best DC movie. Best movie of 2019. It's definitely how DC movies should look like.,1
847,"Uma visão dos mundo de loucura dos anos 90, numa visão psicótica do coadjuvante.",1
848,"Definitely one of the better films this year, but that doesn't speak much to this movie's credit as it does to almost everything else being trash.The Joker feels like someone wanting to make a Taxi Driver style character drama(heck, they even have DeNiro in it and I can't think of any other reason than that) but somehow knew they can't sell it in the age of capecrap unless you slap the name of a comic book character on it. And that is where the movie shines; everything related to Arthur is pretty good but once he slowly starts turning into the Joker it starts falling apart.The attempt to ground this movie in the Gotham mythos is what keeps it from being anything else than an above average one as there are many inconsistencies with the source material, rangig from the superficial, like the age difference between Bruce and the Arthur(judging by the timeline of the movie, the Joker will walk with a cane by the time Bruce starts kicking ass), to more profound ones, like the fact that this Joker doesn't really resemble the Clown Prince of Crime. I know this is only his origin story, but even so he feels kind of dumb and at the end you are left feeling rather sorry for him than afraid.Now, what most feel is the highlight of the film is Joaquin's performance, but I wasn't very impressed by it. It isn't bad, in fact it's quite good, but every time I look at him I can see it's an actor playing a role instead of an actual person. I think a more subtle approach would have been better since I haven't watched anyone be so desperate for an Oscar since that time DiCaprio crawled naked from an animal carcass. What really stands out in the movie however is its world. It's dark, it's gritty, and not in a Zack Snyder stlized way, rather here filth looks like filth, everything seems old and decayed and enhances the feeling of a world fallen to despair, where madness breeds more madness, so props to the director and cinematographer.All in all, a pretty good movie. Not only in the Comic book genre, but in general. I would have given it a 6, but since it triggers snowflakes and Disney shills it deserves one extra point. And maybe an extra rewatch.",1
849,"'Joker' is indeed my favorite movie of the year. Forget everything I said about 'Avengers: Endgame'. Marvel has been completely body-shamed by a fifty-million dollar budgeted film. Joaquin Phoenix eats the screen as Arthur Fleck and deserves the Oscar NOW. The film is so visually beautiful. Every shot is like staring into a painting. Tragic, brutal, DARK, this film offers it all. With a stellar ensemble cast, incredible performances, an intriguing story, striking visuals, brutal violence, and an overall general feeling of uneasiness, this film is my pick for best of the year and most possibly my favorite movie of all time.",1
850,One word MASTERPIECE in every form..The way Phoenix played the joker is mind blowing last 20 minute was some best moments of the movie..,1
851,Please do not go expecting Entertainment. This is a Dark and Emotional film. Worth your while. Just give the Oscar to Joaquin already! 10/10.,1
852,"The constantly down trodden Arthur Fleck dreams of making it as an entertainer, but his failure ultimately leads him down a dark path.Set in the early 80’s this is essentially (as the title suggests) a stand alone origin story for Batman’s most famous foe ‘The Joker’. Despite the comic book inspiration however this really has more in common with Scorsese movies like Taxi Driver or King of Comedy in the way it provides an intense character study into one mans battle with mental illness.With a brilliant lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix ‘Joker’ makes for a captivating watch and is one of those movies that people will be talking about for years to come. The only disappointment is we won’t see this version of The Joker on the big screen again...",1

But these lists are so useless like the lists of best wine, pizzas, ... it's all up to your liking.Yes the joker performance of Ledger puts you on the edge of your seat - but so do Phoenix's - but for different reasons. People forget that this is a Joker movie, not a Batman movie. Such a bitter sweet Joker origin story simply didn't exist. The lonliness, the frustration just everything is so well played you can feel it deep inside your guts. And it's the first time EVER you really sympathize with and care about the character out of compassion rather then just because the joker is a ""cool"" character like in all the other performances. But again, that's because it's a joker movie while all the others are batman movies. Joaquin Phoenix's Performance is just outstanding. I personally would rather watch two more hours of ""Joker"" then two more hours of ""The Dark Knight"". ""Batman Begins"" and ""Joker"" are the two best origin movies ever created. Best Batman - Best Joker.",1
863,I have no idea why this film is getting the immense hate it has from the critics. It is a great origin story and really lacks nothing. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Its on par with the Dark Knight trilogy... now to get the Joaquin Phoenix Joker to fight the Christian Bale Batman!,1

In a world where critics give something so dull and predictable as Wonder Woman raving reviews but can’t seem to appreciate something pretty complex like The Joker, well I think I’ve finally joined the majority in saying they don’t understand jack. I thoroughly enjoyed The Joker. In fact, I stayed up all night because I couldn’t stop thinking about the possibilities or wrap my mind around",1

887,"Joker it's a masterpiece. I think he has a potential to be a ""cult"" movie in the future. Like, Blade Runner and Taxi Driver. The atmosphere, the soundtrack and Phoenix acting it's marvelous. It's a dense and dark movie about mental sickness and a sick society. Second best movie of 2019. Don't believe on the especialized reviews. It's a masterpiece movie.",1
888,"A good movie, which will make you cry at the end.Adding extra things to post this.",1
889,Ignore the haters Epic movie and an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix A must watch,1
890,"To hell with the critics. This is a superlative film about the human condition, our modern-day disconnection, mental health and failing institutions. It's masterfully directed and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is absolutely out of this world.",1
891,"One of the best film ever. Nothing else to say, just to watch and truly analyse.",1
892,"This movie comes to show how disconnected from the audience critics are, thus being unable to provide a frank, credible and useful review or opinion.Go watch this piece of art. You won't see something like this in a very long time. Enjoy it.",1
893,"Mass media hates it...Great movie. Acting, atmosphere, script it's just... amazing",1
894,"Best  after a long long time ago. Best actor, best story, best dialogue,  best sound, every thing is perfect.",1
895,I loved every second of this film. Such a Masterpiece! I really hope we get to see Joaquin return as Arthur Fleck.,1
896,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times! ..Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker. ..Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time. ..My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total f**king bulls**t. ..Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold. ..Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+",1
897,Amazing! Fantastic! Dark! Film of the year! Scary! It’s a shame critics can’t see the beauty in this film.,1
898,"The metacritic reviews different views of ""Establishment"" professional critics (bad) to ""people of the street"" (fantastic) is exactly what this movie transports. It makes people which are swimming on the mainstreams wave to success with their strong ideologies and knowledges very insecure and leave them in a struggle of feelings. J. Phoenix masterful play reminds me of the best Moments of Jack Nicholsen in ""Shining"". This Movie is a Masterpiece.",1
899,Fantastic...!Beautiful critic of the capitalist sociality. Everybody must watch this movie on time!,1
900,"Ignore the critics and the media spewing nonsense.Get a ticket, go see it for yourself.",1
901,Why rating is so **** low? Its because joker isn't black gay transgender and feminist?,1
902,"Superb acting, writing, and directing. Only one word can really describe this movie, and that's Masterpiece!",1
903,Modern day masterpiece. Joker calls society for its **** Splendid acting and imaging! 10/10,1
904,¡Un film único! Realmente es electrizante. Tanto la interpretación excepcional de Joaquin Phoenix como la dirección de Todd Phillips. Una de las películas del año. Y seguro que de nominaciones a los Oscars de 2019.,1
905,Another movie where critics can blow it out their ass. In our day of sheltered offense and blame game culture this movie is such a relief and is a perfect portrayal of the descent into madnesses and current society’s views on mental health. Only a Femoid soyboy or boomer wouldn’t like this movie.,1
906,"I don't usually write movie reviews but Joker is such a good movie that I just feel like letting other people know. Great messages, great characters, great performances, great picture, I wouldn't know where to start. It's so good it'll make you a bigger fan of the Joker than of Batman. Go see it. And after you see it, go laugh with anyone who rated it under a 7.",1
907,Excellent movie! No politics in the movie either. I loved the ending too. Must see!,1
908,"A masterpiece, phoenix performance is outstanding, dont mind the bad reviews, go to see the movie and watch art in its most poetic, horrific and stunning form.",1
909,"A-MA-zing simply amazing don't even pay attention to the old dumb ""movie critics"" those picky hicky fatards doesn't like their own families",1
910,This is one of the best films to have come out in my lifetime. Its message is powerful and clear. Don't fall for the hype. See this film in the theater,1
911,Solid movie.  Nothing is over the top.  Phoenix as usual disappears into his role and nails it.  Looks like the critics that can't get enough Marvel garbage crammed down their throats 4 times a year gave this one a poor review.It's a semi realistic portrayal of an actual villain.  I'll keep coming back for more if they keep the gritty reality alive.,1
912,Good movie critics panicked over nothing the media sucks. I love the plot of the story the moral premises of the movie. That we have hand creating the joker also this movie is not violent how do you know if you haven't watched it like seriously the media.,1
913,"It's one of the most beautiful pictures,that I have ever seen!!!! Critics are not competent!",1
914,"This is an amazing film, its musical accompaniment, plot and acting game bring you into a state of enjoyment",1
915,Unfortunatly the German Press does not write enough about that great movie!,1
916,"Easily one of the best movies I have watched. A MASTERPIECE, if I can describe like this. WATCH IT!",1
917,"It's a shame how political views are controlling random things such as movie reviews.  Critics know this movie is amazing, yet they review it poorly due to an agenda.  Luckily, user reviews reveal the truth about this one.  An absolutely fantastic film.  Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job.  His performance is one of the best I have seen in years.  This movie, and particularly Joaquin, deserve many awards.",1
919,"Easily the best movie of 2019. Critics don't like this movie because it is a personal attack on the culture of the media, and presents a different point of view that does not resonate well with that crowd. Great interpretation of the character, great cinematography, and a great story in general. The critics got this one completely wrong.",1
921,It was a wonderful movie. You literally see how Arthur slowly turns into Joker.,1
922,"The overhype around this movie is kind of annoying, but it's still very good.",1
923,"It’s a simple film. Normal superhero films takes the audience on an adventure with the hero. This is the opposite. You’re a spectator to an unwell man who has been broken by the system since his birth. He’s fallen through all the cracks, and eventually he chooses to embrace his vulnerabilities instead of being hurt by society. We are that society watching one of our own struggle, and eventually become the man he is as a result of our failures.",1
924,"Its a fantastic movie and entertaining, I don't understand how can 2 hours movie can be dangerous for people. According to me its an must watch movie for people who loves comic characters movie and acting is unbelievable, i am sure it will be nominated for oscar for best acting.",1
925,"I believe this movie is something that really shows how **** retarded movie critics are. It's absolutely phenomenal, a goddam masterpiece. Mark the names of anyone who gave it low score and never trust their opinion ever again. Go watch this, it's a treat!",1
926,It was really good and definitely the best villain movie around. My only criticism is not not much really happened in the movie. Other than that everything was beautiful.,1
927,"beautifully filmed, complex story that would leave you thinking and some of the greatest performances I have seen in a long time.  oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix",1
928,"Beautiful in a sad way. Best Joker I have ever seen, sorry Heath Ledger. Maybe not savage enough for my taste, but definitely a performance that can not be ignored or diminished.",1
929,"Amazing. This is what i was weiting for, this movie is the movie of the year.",1
930,"Amazing film. It portrays the decay of a mans pschyche and soul because of the constant transgressions of a cruel and apathic society. Joaquin Phoenix performance is volcanic, phenomenal, out of this world, and it represents this situation to perfection, letting the spectators feel his painwithout idolozing him, or justifying his actions. This film always leaves a room for surprise, just when you think you understand the character or have sern enough pf him, PHoenix comes eith a magical gesture or laughter that leaves you speechless. Amazing soundtrack the fits the emotional tone of the movie.",1
931,"It's a good film, nothing more, nothing less. Based on all the talk about this film last month, id expected it to be really impactful, but it's not really any darker or any more shocking than what we've seen before. Joaquin Phoenix does a fantastic job as the lead roll; scenes with his forced laughter are some of the best in the film. However outside of his acting, nothing about this film really stands out. - 7/10 expected more.",1
932,One of the best mainstream movies I have seen in years with exclusion of the recent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.,1
933,It's a masterpiece never seen a movie like this it wakes up the darkness inside every person who watch it so perfect,1
934,"This movie will appeal to your inner demons...its dark, disturbing and deliciously deranged.I'm not much of a reviewer or writer, so I'll just say this; this film is beguiling like nothing I've seen before. It's my favourite cinematic experience to date, and I'm a hardcore fan of cinema and film. JP is Oscar worthy as is the picture. I must see it again.",1
935,"Honestly a 9...there are some small flaws...but the 10 is to counter the ridiculously low ""critics"" score. The Joker works on many levels. Most importantly, identifying with the main character. Tension...great tension builds at multiple points as you keep hoping something will go right for this poor guy...but know it won't. Joker is anathema to the woke, (a white male turns against society not because of ""toxic masculinity"" or hatred of minorities/gays/women, but because those in society have abused and neglected him) but makes PERFECT sense to the rest of us. Joker has no political overtones, but does deal with some real world issues such as mental illness and the elite/lower class.",1
936,"The movie is a critic too society and its right in this point, the movie is for peoples How Care with other peoples",1
937,"Truly a brave 10/10 masterpiece, by both Phoenix & Phillips, a 2019's must-watch and a long-awaited fresh air breath of comic universe adaptation. It's also amazing to see synchronized whine of, lets say, some critics' clique, but the real question is - how has it turned so, that the Joker role is in fact, has become a contemporary version of a Hamlet/Macbeth? A pinnacle role to measure the skill of the greatest? And no matter how long I mediate upon its answer - I still don't like it",1
938,What were these critics thinking when they gave this masterpiece a 58. Oscor worthy performance from joaquin phoenix finally getting the recognition he deserves,1
939,"Absolutely mind-blowing. Comic book Filmmakers take note. This is how it's done. Phoenix took us on a trip into the mind of a madman, and what a ride! Although this movie draws influence from art-house cinema, there is very much still a Comic book feel to it.Everything from art direction to music, to the cinematography, and the performance by Phoenix, was perfection.I hope that DC continues down that road and experiments more with this tired genre.",1
940,To anyone who don´t like the movie or thing it is dangerous to society I wanna say you that or you are stupid or you haven´t understood the movie. This is the best comic based film ever and Joaquin Phoenix is splendorous in this film. 10/10,1
941,"This movie is, in my opinion, the best origin story I have seen so far. Phoenix's performance was just incredible !!!",1
942,"Was too sad! Didn't have any explosions or real actions scenes, didn't push any social politics aside from 'wah, society don't treat me right' SHUT THE **** UP WHITIE Haha, made me use my brain, who even uses that ****ing thingBaaa, moooo1.5",1
943,Phenomenal movie going experience... Must experience in big screen... Loved how the director  shows great amount of violence yet not glorifying main characters insane actions.. Well crafted.,1
944,It's the best movie ever.No other movie can be as good as Joker.....Joaquin Love u Man❤️,1
945,Movie is outstanding. A comic book series give a realistic sense. Everyone should watch.,1
946,"This one of the best movies portraying a comics character ever made. Joaquin Phoenix's performance, the direction of the movie, the soundtrack are all outstanding.",1
947,"Awesome movie,  slow burner but the last 20 minutes ",1
948,"Absolutely magnificent. One of a kind movie. Fantastic build-up with great plot twists etc. ""Joker"" - itself is not your typical superhero blockbuster. It's a dark drama/thriller about a good man with a uncommon condition trying his best to live a normal life in this cruel cruel world and most importantly to not stop smiling on stage even though everything and everyone around is against him. He's slowly getting fed up with his miserable life while the ""rich"" have a great life and nothing to worry about. He's sick that no one cares about people like him which is why he's slowly turning into a psychopath/agent of chaos. But still, the fact that this man is tried his best to make everyone around happy even children at the hospital, while he himself is a sad being and overall a broken man - is truly powerful and something to admire.",1
949,"This movie unbelievably stunning, I heard from people U must watch this masterpiece, so they were totally right. That movie gives you the magic of the cinema atmosphere, energy to going through. I love WB and DC they try an experiment I hope they avoid cliche what MARVEL did and will continue doing.  P.S. (did you know how metacritic algorithm works? So, what they idea is if ten critics made an excellent review and give for example 100 and one critics give 30 total scores going to be crap because those 10 had lower ratings then those who have higher. Which does make sense they a too smart enough then others or what? If you already know you dot like this or prefer different WTF that person did watch and make a point with no sense go and pardon ********** **** **** **** ****",1
950,"This thing is a spectacle, amazing performance, score and story that’s although reliant on taxi driver and king if comedy, is a great interpretation of sanity crumbling from a man in society.  It’s much different and I don’t think all the critics saying the flick used those two other movies as crutches because they rely on characters that have different stories but similarly go down a unfortunate path, Arthur’s being much more traumatic by far.",1
951,"Everything about this film was perfect. The cinematography, the well curated music, the storyline, the acting, the dialog. I just can't stress enough how perfect this film is.",1
952,"Good movie of showing how joker became what he is in the DC universe, not to mention how much the effort it takes to act as a depressed man into a psychopath",1
953,Phoenix delivered an amazing performance and such a well crafted film!! Super dark and twisted and leaves your heart beating not know what the Joker’s next move will be!,1
954,"O que incomoda as pessoas nesse filme é o fato de a história ser materialista. As pessoas querem acreditar que o Coringa é uma força da natureza e que a sociedade não tem nada a ver com isso. Ledo engano. As críticas a respeito da violência ou do ""incel-friendly"" não fazem o menor sentido. Se vocês se incomodam tão facilmente, talvez a arte não seja pra vocês.",1
955,"Before anything else: this film deserves Oscar wins, not just nominations, for Lead Actor, Cinematography, and Original Score. It is visually beautiful and the music serves as a  perfect supporting actor to enhance the insanity into which Arthur Fleck degenerates. Society causes an already mentally ill loner to finish losing his mind and digress from wanting to spread joy and laughter throughout the world to wanting to kill those he feels have wronged him.Phoenix's performance is not necessarily better than Heath Ledger's, but it is more riveting, and that's saying something because I never really expected anyone to top any aspect of Ledger's take on Joker. I consider Ledger's Joker a bit more sadistic, but that's only because now we know one vision of where Joker came from. The most fun aspect of the character is that you can play him any way you want and it's still correct. He might tell you a knock knock joke or he might shoot your daughter through the spine just to see the look on your face. And anything in between.There really are no words to express how good this movie is. It is as perfect a film, in its genre, as The Godfather, or Schindler's List, or Casablanca, or Lawrence of Arabia. The professional critics, the ones who get paid by major newspapers to say how much they hate a movie, most of them despise this one because it appears to be a social commentary on what a mentally ill loner will do if society pushes him too far. Many critics call it dangerous and incendiary because it may incite some - well, mentally ill loner out there - to do what he sees Joker do in the movie.Guess what, critics? You're right. It is incendiary. Because it tells the truth. Unflinchingly. Without euphemisms. Anyone who hates this movie as a social commentary is probably part of the problem our society has right now. At least in America, mental disorders and diseases are spurned by those who don't have them as not real medical problems. This isn't true. The film sympathizes with Fleck for a good reason: if society had treated him better, he wouldn't have become the most evil monster in the history of comic book literature.That movie critics are writing such vituperative reviews of the film only proves the film's point: those critics hate it because it holds up a mirror to nature and forces them to confront their hatred of the truth of reality.Because of the controversy I can't predict its Oscar chances, but I believe they're good. Phoenix is genuinely unnerving in every single scene and the intensity gets tighter and tighter toward the end until it becomes absolutely unbearable during the scene on the Murray Franklin Show when Joker appears as a guest. De Niro may also deserve an Oscar nod. He supports the lead performance with perfect experience.How do I summarize such a masterpiece? If I had to use only one word, I think I'd say ""devastating."" But there's more to it than that. It's equal parts gritty crime drama, comic book movie, horror movie, and tear-jerker. At the end, when Joker is in Arkham Asylum running from the guards, everything is white and it reminds you of A Clockwork Orange. The whole film is inspired by Taxi Driver.Those who call it ""too dark, too violent and bloody"" must not have understood what they were getting into when buying a ticket to see any kind of film about the Joker character. He's dark and violent in the comic books. We live in an age of PG-13, which permits a larger audience and thus more money, but this film is no bloodier or violent than the average nasty action movie from the '80s and early '90s. The body count is about 10, most of them Joker's victims. The difference is that the violence hits hard! If you can stomach Saving Private Ryan or The Passion of the Christ, this film's violence is a walk in the park.You will leave the theater feeling devastated, overwhelmed by its magnificence, and yes, you'll feel inspired, but not to commit acts of violence. The critics don't seem to understand. This film does not glorify mental illness or the online ""incel"" community. It doesn't just try to speak to the latent anger of lonely, anti-social white guys who really need to vent their anger and frustration. It tells the entire world the following, very simple statement: the mentally ill need to be helped, loved, hugged, encouraged to seek treatment, be it medication or therapeutic conversations. They need to be shown in some way that there's no shame in being mentally ill. The only shame is in not seeking help.At the end, Joker tells Murray Franklin, on live TV, ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? I'll tell you what you get! You get what you **** deserve!"" Then he blows Franklin's brains out.It's unfortunate. It's painful and deplorable to look at. But Fleck is right. The writers and actors are right. In real life that is exactly what you get.",1
956,"I enjoyed it so much I'm going to see it again, I love how Joaquin portrays the joker and how you can feel bad for him and see his change into the Batman Villian the joker.",1
957,"Cannot fault this film. It deserves a 10. Maybe a 9.something just because of the age difference it puts between Bruce and the Joker, but really that can still be accepted.",1
958,"the movie has amazing story, brilliant acting, magnificent cinematography and awesome music. this movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality. It is the masterpiece and maybe the best film of 2019. But I would say this movie is not for all people, if you belong to the people who only looks for unrealistic action sequences or can't accept terrible reality of today's world, then don't watch it because, ""you wouldn't get it"".",1
959,Instant classic ! Joaquin Phoenix best performance ever! Best DC movie ever!,1
960,Watched it for 4th time. Never get bored. Amused every time. Learned new details. Invested more into the narrative and character development.,1

963,Great movie and its a must watch one.Acting is superb leaves you baffled and ask you some serious questions,1

965,"Never ever compare it with Heath ledger as it visualises the mannerisms of established ""JOKER"",Mr. Phoenix shows how he was made as a classic villian",1
966,"Ha! as it stands now, user score 9.3/10 Critics 58/100. So it's doesn't hit the dot points critics look for. does that matter? Obviously not. So who are Critics Critiquing for?

967,"Review Joker (2019)This is a much of feelings, this movie is incredible, raw, and necessary to the society who we live today, this movie is better than hype, photography, Phoenix, is fenomenal, and he deserve a nomination in the Oscar, I don’t like so much to compare movies, but I’m sorry, this movie is the best of the year, go to the cinema, don’t afraid, because ever moment in this movie is a punch in your stomach, If you like the joker character, You love this movie, because Arthur fleack is insane, crazy mind, and you have compassion for him, but in the same time you understood what he did is wrong, that’s is the duality, and the movie is very influenced by movie of Scorsese, How taxi driver, king of Comedy, and doses of ultra violence, clockwork orange, or the Phoenix movies too, you never really here, it’s a social critic of your society, Gotham is a dirty, corrupt, don’t have health, safety, the government don’t give a sh@&, it your own citizens, the citizens don’t have job, this is a movie to think, a lot, rethink “polemical themes”, who is the better government, people who have mental issues, deserve treatment, and stop the bullying your the fake news, don’t matter, who is your political position, see the people, have empathy for them, when a society is sick, the retreat is a problem candidate, Joker so is a movie adaptation of the comics, have similarities with Dark knight, by Frank Miller comics, and the killing Joke, By Alan Moore, I think now is the best adaptation of a movie adaptation of a comic book, Phoenix honors Heath Ledger, this movie is euphoric, phenomenal, and deserve your time, go to the cinema, and watch this movie!!!This movie is hard to digest, heavy, and don’t let kids watch this movie, is a adult movie, one study of human Psyche, you imerge in the mind of joker, this movie will be a classic over de years",1
968,"Just Awesome! I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong. The critics whining reviews were successfully received and sent to the F**k Department.",1
969,All good... But average metascore for this movie should be 64.92 (65) if calculate properly,1

971,A must watch movie.... Brilliant story.... Classic performance from Joaquin phoenix .,1
972,1st movie I ever seen twice in theaters. DC please make more movies dark and realistic.,1
973,"My heart was in my chest when he went on the Murray show. Joker had a slow, yet rewarding buildup. Had me intrigued with every minute of it.",1
974,This movie is one of my favorite movies now I really like how the character change,1
975,Awesome dramatic movie DC born from the ashes like a phoenix. I think this movie can make 3 oscars,1
976,"I was wondering why the critic score was low. Then I saw that most of the critics were giving it reviews based on political theology. I said the Joker is an amazing movie. People that haven't seen it yet should be reminded that its more ""Taxi Driver"" and ""American Psycho"" and less ""Batman"" and ""The Dark Knight"". It's not a comic book movie, there's more drama than action. No big explosions or battle scenes. There is violence, goring violence, some scenes that made me feel uncomfortable but in a good way. Not like oh this is cringe, just uncomfortable from the tension. Todd Phillips made a really good film, and Joaquin Phoenix should definitely be nominated for best actor. watching him transform into the Joker. You don't empathize at all. I think Phillips did a good job not just blaming mental illness, but blaming the lack of love and support people with mental illness need and can easily lack.",1
977,"wow what a movie. The acting, the direction.... but its a bit too violent. hats off to Jacques phoenix",1
978,Joker is a magistral movie. Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in this movie. His interpretation of the Joker is very impressive. Watch Joker if you can.,1
979,I think this is masterpiece i watched it for the second time and i think it's the best work in 2019 or in last 5 years,1
980,"Joker is absolutely deserving of all the praise its getting. It may just be one of, if not the absolute best movie based on a comic book character. The film will make you feel uncomfortable and make you feel for Arthur(Joker). Just go out and see it, you need to.",1
981,"Dark, chaotic, crazy, shakes your mind and challenges your empathy. Great acting and aesthetically dark theme.",1
982,"Good movie, good game. Compared to the upcoming Batwoman movie ... this will be ****",1
983,"It is an amazing movie, With a massive seriousness, and Joker with having a dangerous and a fantastic mindset, This movie deserves to win Oscar for the Best Movie and The Best Male Actor should be given to Joaquin Phoenix for playing the role of The Joker. The Joker has a different mindset and different way to express himself",1
984,"It's a great movie, I would tive 8,5 but i can't in this site, it is not a masterpiece, and not the best comics book movie, but it's a Very well made movie in many aspects, the only Negative aspectso of the movie are the lack of originalty in the plot and there's not a clear message in the movie.",1
985,Must watch movie. An absolute masterpiece. Give Joaquin Phoenix an oscar please!,1
986,"То,что я посмотрел это трэш. Больше мне нечего сказать 10/10 Хоакин и Филлипс просто браво вы заслужили оскар.Глоры и ""объективные критики"" Marvel , вы даже можете не стараться . Фильм не унылый , ваша ""rкритика"" унылая",1

988,"My personal favorite film of the year. Captivating and extremely interesting. It somehow manages to have you sympathize with a psychopath and understand him, yet look forward in hopes of justice being served.",1
989,"This movie is a masterpiece. This is the best movie of the 2010's.A must see for everyone who isn't ""woke"".",1
990,"I've thought Dark Knight is the best movie ever based on the comics, then Logan. Now. Well. This Joker probably the most comics-like ever. Probably could be the Ledger's Joker pre-history.",1
991,"Отличный психологический триллер, чтобы там не говорили критики. Игра Хоакина Феникса заслуживает Оскара.",1
992,"A breath of fresh air amid recent mediocre films. DC does not need to do as MARVEL does, but rather follow its noir style (and then masterpieces are obtained). Watch this movie, it's awesome!",1
993,"Great movie! Don't listen to the snow flakes  critics, this will be a classic one day!",1
994,"This movie is extremely disturbing and creepy.  However, it works.  It works.  The amazing, disturbing acting by Joaquin Phoenix is amazing and he delivers an amazing, realistic appearance of a man who goes insane.",1
995,Its one of the best movies ive seen  a story about a man who trys to live with a mental illness and give his all through society but society doesnt do the same in return and spits on him ever cornor.  Pacing is good and Joaquin Phoenix  killed it,1
996,"Joker is hands down the best movie of 2019 and one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time.  In a medium where the ""comic book"" movie has become little more than a bloated, endless theme park attraction, Joker arrives amidst a barrage of hype and (frankly) utter ****  Maybe I am a little bias, as I have been a huge Batman fan since I can remember and have read and re-read most of the comics over the years.  I also loved Christopher Nolan's first two Dark Knight movies as well as Tim Burton's take on the character.  This movie however elevates Bob Kane and Bill Finger's creation to an entirely new dimension.  With obvious comparisons to Martin Scorsese's classic gritty movies of the 1970's (Taxi Driver especially), Joker is simply stunning.  A scary, jaw-dropping and unflinching delve into madness, seen through the eyes of Arthur Fleck, played to utter perfection by Joaquin Phoenix.  Don't listen to the hyper-ventilated hysteria surrounding the movie, just go and watch this masterwork of perfection.  10/10.",1
997,"Amazing film that will leave you thinking about the awful reality of our society for days, don't trust the critics, they're trash..",1
998,"A masterpiece, loved every minute of this movie. Already seen it two times, last movie I did multiple screenings was Logan, another masterpiece.Go see this movie, you won't regret it.",1
999,One of the best movie's I ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix did the great job. Very professional film.,1
1000,This movie is the depiction in the how privilege and mental health can affect someone through the worst of times now in the world mental health can affect people very horribly and how it would change someone for the words someone like Arthur this movie shows that. This movie has murders it shows them very graphically so you have a negative reaction to them because obviously murder is the negative thing but with that you also have to be mature about it and do understand that one of these things can happen that they could happen in real life because this movie is very grounded with no superhero shenanigans it is just about a person who is out of the worst of times it has themes of privilege and it shows this very strategically and openly when joker kills 3 Wall Street kids on a train it's not shown to be a good thing but also shows how they would have the privilege to be seen as the victim's when they were beating up joker on a on the train it also shows the side between poverty in the rich and people not communicating properly with the subplot of joker and Thomas Wayne being son and father this movie is an edgy it doesn't show the things that joker does is in a good way because he is a hurt character end he's it shows the turn of the good person that Arthur was through the bad person that you ever was because of his mental health and the things that he went through and it demonstrates this in this film it's not saying that they're okay but it is showing it because it's an origin story and if you're going to show a villains origin story it's not going to be very nice.,1
1001,Purely incredible. In every aspect this is an all time masterpiece. I saw it 4 days ago and I’ve thought about it everyday since.,1
1002,The way that Phoenix is acting and how the story leads to Bruce Wayne childhood and the reality that Joker could be anywhere today in our societies is making this movie a masterpiece.,1
1003,Nice try Disney. Your **** critics newer gave up. At least Metacritic owners earn their money) But nothing can hide the masterpiece.,1
1004,"The joker everyone was waiting for. Actually there is nothing more to say.But after seeing the new avatar, I can't stop myself from applauding the performance of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal. It's darkness and madness to the very core which is what joker is.",1
1005,"Great movie, Phoenix deserves the Oscar this time, great acting performance.",1
1006,"Todd Philips entrega o que pode ser a maior obra de sua carreira, tudo no filme  consegue ser incrível desde a atuação digna de Oscar do Joaquin Phoenix a espetacular fotografia, o lado técnico desse filme em si é impecável. E na minha opinião o melhor filme da DC até  agora e um forte concorrente ao Oscar. Entreguem um Oscar pro Phoenix",1
1007,One of the best movies ever produced.  A fantastic performance by Joaquim Phoenix.  A wonderful photograph.  Amazing script.  I think these expert critics are eating ****,1
1008,Finally a movie about the bad guy not this anti-hero crap one of the best films I've seen in a long time,1
1009,"Probably the best movie of the year, immersive captivating dark drama not to be missed",1
1010,"Phillips make a deep travel (social and political) into the reality of mental illness trough the life of Arthur Fleck, travel that feels so close and so touchable by the magnificent acting of Joaquin Phoenix, even if you haven't lived some situation like that. The music by Hildur Guðnadóttir makes you almost touch the feeling of every scene, so we might feel sometimes sad, angry, happy even confused and surprised by the things that we can see during the movie. This elements got together for the Joker's apparition, and when we finally see him every scene feels so different. This new Joker aren't an anarchist or a gangster, this version was created to be the most human between the humans, Phillips got that way and he showed us that. The beautiful photography, the colors, every take, were made to complement the wonderful story and they helped so well on the purpose of the movie. That purpose/message that we can understand from the movie isn't just the violence or the fight against the richest searching for a more fair world; the message goes beyond that, exploring the hard life (of mentally ill) and making us reflect about how we (you, me, everybody) treat those that are different to us in a world that falls piece by piece (not so different to ours). The violence and the fights were a consequence of that, but the origin is in the real treat with people. That was Joker to me, a confused but pleasant (and amazing) travel around the hard life of Arthur Fleck.",1
1011,"A pretty amazing new take on the Joker's origin story, couldn't recommend it enough.",1
1012,"Absolutely outstanding performance. This had everything I could of dreamed of in a Joker origin story, must see for anyone invested in the darker side of DC universe.",1
1013,This movie is both disturbing and incredible all at once. Amazing visuals and it leaves you wanting more,1
1014,Ahh... feels good to exist in time where Joker exists. There is hope for humanity.,1
1015,The perfect movie he stay at the top because it contain all parts of perfect movie,1
1016,"Great, just great. I maybe have to watch this movie again to grasp all of it  but what I've seen was a realy good, dark movie about one man falling down and turn mad.",1
1017,Just amazing! In a very chilling dark touching kind of way... My heart beat raced through the whole movie.,1
1018,Joker is a rare treat with all the mainstream movie of late falling sort. Joker portray mental illness masterfully and how society of Gotham treat the poor and mental ill like trash. This ultimately creating the monster that Joker will become. I love this movie and I hope more mainstream movie take after Joker.,1
1019,"Fantastic movie, definitely shows the decent into maddness beautifully. Must watch.",1
1020,"Amazing movie!Joaquin Phoenix's acting is fantastic, I haven't seen such a sensational performance for years.",1
1021,"A mind-plowing and tragedy movie that MUST be seen. But in my opinion, it should be allowed for +21 only not because of nudity or any sexual stuff. But because of the hard and social scenes.",1
1022,Incredible performance from Joaquin Phoenix. A new take on a legendary character.,1
1023,Amazing because it is a comic book movie out of the ordinary. Phoenix gives an outstanding performance and should be considered for an Academy Award.,1
1024,"This “critics” dont mean **** for the movie. Who are the ones that makes a movie successful? Us. This movie was something incredible, i didn't have so much fun in a theater in a long time. 10/10",1
1025,"This movie is dark and beautiful. The Joker's pain is brought to life by Phoenix in a way that makes you feel sad and sickened with guilt because it captures the realities of the mental health spectrum. As a society we know there's a problem but if it's not affecting us we look the other way and hope it goes away.I have watched comic book movies in the past and not one of them made me feel the way I feel about this movie. Sure this is not your typical comic book movie (thank God)  but it does portray a comic book villain in a way that it had never been done before. Phoenix left me wanting more. He is a genius at his craft and hopefully, we will s him portray this character again in the future.",1
1026,"This is a fascinating, complex character piece assessing a deeply psychologically troubled but long time favourite villain, and his history and development.  Phoenix's performance is amazing throughout, with great support and characters.Ignore the pointless critics - they're getting more and more detached from reality and audience opinion.  This is a must see.",1
1027,"Phoenix delivers and he delivers big time!!! A slow and delicate road to the madness festin that reveal the dark universe of the Joker. Todd Phillips bring a new eye, a innovative twist, a greater sense to how a comic book character should reborn on a big screen. Bravo!!! 10/10",1
1028,Esta película es increíble. Ignoren a la critica. La forma en la que maneja su tesis es increíble. Y la critica de la sociedad actual es muy real. Ojala las películas actuales fueran así y rindieran culto a la inteligencia.,1
1029,"This is a fascinating look at a man trying to work with society to maintain normalcy, but when social services are cut (sounds familiar) he then spirals into mental illness with grave consequences.  My wife and I saw this and were mesmerized for the entire movie.  I saw only one mistake in the movie and it was minor.  This is absolutely an incredible origin story and I honestly think the ""professional"" critics (many of which only write for blogs) can't seperate their personal biases from their critique of this movie.  Go see this movie.",1
1030,"Filme sensacional,  quem avaliou baixo não entende nada de cinema de verdade ou é mimizento",1
1031,"The ambiguity of this disturbingly uncomfortable film is its genius, and likely why the critics are so divided. This is a film devoid of morality, and social commentary despite being at its core a morality play. In all things the viewer is left to draw their own conclusions, interpret what was real or fantasy and ultimately fill in the blanks with their own beliefs.Joker touches on many issues and treats them with all the disdain that the main character exhibits: mental health services, gun control, workplace bullying, class divides, exploitative reality tv, anarchism, abuse of power, and sexual rejection are showcased, but each simultaneously argued from both sides in a quantum superposition of cinematography.This is a film with dichotomy as its only key theme.One of Joker’s most controversial scenes is the apartment invasion by Fleck on his neighbour and fantasy love interest Sophie, and the resolution is left entirely ambiguous. At the completion of the film like Schrodinger’s cat she remains simultaneously; alive and unharmed by her close encounter with a confused yet sympathetic mentally ill neighbour, and violated and possibly murdered in cold blood by an incel like maniac. How you choose to interpret this scene (and interpret you must) to complete the viewing will radically colour your opinion of Fleck’s actions and alter your final judgment of his actions.The possession and use of firearms is given a similar treatment by Joker, on one hand a dangerously unstable and disbarred man is given an unlicensed gun for ‘protection’ by a ‘concerned’ colleague, and it does end up saving Fleck’s life. On the face of it this illegal possession of a firearm is morally justified, however he uses it gratuitously, chasing and murdering a fleeing assailant and eventually as his descent continues even murdering innocents in a manner even the most debased are likely to find unpalatable.The ambiguities continue in the treatment of the rich and powerful as personified by Thomas Wayne an abusive, cheating millionaire using his power to exploit a vulnerable employee, deny his child aid, and run a cynical political campaign for personal gain. Or perhaps he is a fair man unjustly persecuted by a delusional former employee, with high morale standards and an agenda to fight corruption and bring social reform to Gotham. Joker goes out of its way to ensure that you can never truly know which permutation of these traits is real, and leaves the viewer as sole arbiter of their personal truthThe film piles these ambiguities decadently and aggressively, and at face value without subtlety, however I feel that the smartest aspect of the film is the careful balance and layering of these competing value judgements in a manner that seems to have confounded the critics. I have read many reviews decrying the lack of political and morale stance from the filmmakers, but I truly believe that this was a deliberate attempt by the creators to make a movie where the viewer is free to construct their own morale narrative.The main character Arthur Fleck brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix treats life with disdain, chain smoking his way through a miserable existence and deteriorating mental state with a slowly building anger and latterly a sense of empowerment through violence. Despite this he provides very little verbal exposition for his deeds allowing the viewer to project motive and ultimately judgement on his character.The multitude of narrative and morale ambiguities in the movie mean that by the conclusion each viewer has experienced their own personal Joker who largely reflects their own experience and worldview in a manner that few other stories have achieved. There exist infinitely as many Jokers as viewers, and fittingly this idea is visualised in the film with the proliferation of clowns as the film progresses.I believe that this is truly groundbreaking  storytelling combined with exemplary cinematography and that Joker will stand the test of time.",1
1032,Absolutely amazing movie ! Dark but so grounded in realism. Anyone can be the joker if pushed to that capacity.,1
1033,"Before I touch upon the content of the movie , I have to say the vibe it creates is like a Taxi Driver of the modern age with super villain in the making overtones ; which is funny because Deniro is in the joker , I wonder if the director did this purposefully ? Anyways , this movie was an amalgamation of emotions stirred up for a person I didn’t think I ever cared for , aside from being a badass in a previous portrayal by Heath. Let’s put this to rest right now ; Joaquin’s Joker was so real to the point that I connected on a more personal level (than previous jokers including heaths) and I can see authenticity in this joker being THE joker that eventually faces off with Bats - even in this “depressing” formative period of his .... despite being exposed to an action packed super intelligent Heath Joker years before this . The feeling of powerlessness and a world against you is really what gets you down through your first 40 minutes or so in the movie but it’s not a depressingly down feeling it’s more of a contemplatively-down feeling for Arthur’s condition and his situation in life . Essentially , it’s hard to NOT feel for Arthur as opposed to what previous movies would conjure up in us for the joker - which always painted him as a one sided villain as opposed to the complex more than human Joker we see in this film.Overall the scenes were shot so well I felt like I was watching an old movie, which also helped complete the feeling of taxi driver (also that revolver Joker gets seems like a snubbed version of it), but also gave the setting of the film a perfect alibi - this WAS INDEED the time before Batman ; and we can tell from the scenery , the outfits and the props ... very well done.I feel although there’s no promise of a sequel , the director and cast HAS to deliver a sequel - as the roller coaster ride of this journey has just begun and they really pulled the tempo of the film off correctly as to really entice us to be hungry for more screen time of Arthur In his very earliest joker years .If I could , I would see this made into a tv series as it seems so realistic with the way it displayed this joker , and the action was spread out enough to create suspense and many other emotions . If this was done I would expect them to cast Joaquin , due to his great performance , or at least someone that can emulate his exact performance and demeanor - as this was a performance I didn’t expect to “attract” me so much as it did .Great film , 10/10 for me - if it weren’t for the critics mindlessly bashing this title I wouldn’t have written this review , but I feel like this is something we need to speak up about because everyone seeing this film either really likes it or LOVES it - BESIDES the critics ... hmmm I wonder why ? Maybe it has something to do with the AGENDA of those that wish to push a specific NARRATIVE for their platform? Look that’s fine and all but please be a bit more transparent with your bias if you choose to run a review website . Compare the critics to the user reviews , how many of each one and you will see who the liars are and who is telling the truth about the movie . Everythings an “opinion” they will say after slanging dirt in an untruthful review ... ok that’s fine but don’t go bashing something that was shot , edited , directed , and written WELL and try to pretend like it’s just some unbiased opinion, we can see through that ! I, like thousands of others , went into the film UNBIASED and loved it , do the same and you will too ; go in there thinking the movie will have your incel neighbor boy kill you , you will leave there confused just to go on your critic profile on meta critic and bash for no reason and that will guarantee you have a bad time under the guise of social semantics .",1
1034,"Sobrevivió mis expectativas, al principio tenía mis dudas pero entre mas avanzaba la pelicula más me iba convenciendo que la espera valió cada segundo",1
1035,Best movie in a long long time. Finally. I’ve been waiting for it since the trailer came out and I’m so happy I even watched it twice in cinema already!!!!! It’s a great movie for real.,1
1036,"The film is a masterpiece! I could rant for hours about how much I love this film but instead I urge you to go and see this film for yourself, make up your own mind and don’t base your opinion off of what critics say.",1
1037,"Was an absolute crazy good movie. Kept you in suspense the entire movie. Just when you thought you had it figured out, it all was changed..  Loved the segway into another movie..",1
1038,"Really good and realistic. If Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar, we'll have solid proof that the Oscars are rigid.",1
1039,"Fantastic film, great acting, and a score that gave me goosebumps on multiple occasions.  Well worth the watch and the publicity!",1
1040,The darkness and realness in this makes Lars von Trier's looks like a kid's movie director.,1
1041,Very good movie and suggest everyone to watch it Also the ending is one of the best scenes,1
1042,"Violento, perigoso e louco esse é o resumo desse filme do coringa que é um filme fantastico, não fica cansativo em nenhum momento, a forma como ele sofre faz você sentir pena e quase torcer por ele",1
1043,"Absolutely phenomenal. I totally recommend this movie, avoid spoilers at all cost.",1
1044,"'Joker' is raw, real.  It does not seek to impress but it does, and in what way.  Todd Phillips manages to give a new air to the genre of superheroes, and Joaquin Phoenix is ​​sublime in his performance ... Not only does he understand the complicated character, but he makes it his own, something very difficult considering the iconic performances of Jack Nicholson and Heath  Ledger. Future cult movie.",1
1045,"Honestly was uncomfortable the whole way through, I think many people miss the core message at the heart of this film but it was something to behold. Truely a masterpiece. Critics don't know what their on about.",1
1046,The whole movie makes you think. From the first scene until the end. There are things that happen. Things to make you think. I like the way the film made you think one way. It goes into the characters head. His mind set. How and what he sees to feels. The whole movie keeps you guessing. The best thing about it was the cigarette. Notice every scene with his cigarette. Every scene of the film that he has the cigarette he always has it lit. Never does the film show him start the fire/cigarette. It’s already in the characters hand or mouth and he’s already smoking it. Play close attention to this Joker because he’ll have you played through out the entire movie. The fact is the film never showed the character(Joker) start the cigarette because in the end he’s never smoking it. Well played. Great acting. Killer performance from Joaquin Phoenix. A must see film!,1
1047,One of the best movie of DCThe way they direct the movie is awesomeAnd acting of every single person is adding more sparkles,1
1048,It was the best movie of my whole life. The pictur es are just crazy and every scene so real.,1
1049,"Grim.No special fx.No superheros.No ****Great character development.Sympathy for the joker.Brutal homicides.Atmosphere: music, setting, shots.I'm not even into the world of Batman. This is a standalone prequel.",1
1050,"This is a fantastic movie, but not for the faint of heart. The last movie that got me so disturbed when exiting the theater was Funny Games US...Well acted, well written, unpredictable, I loved it. Great acting by Joaquin Phoenix who really carries the movie.",1
1051,"Even though for some may appear slow, the pace is necessary to deliver. It is hard to watch sometimes, but it's because of its rawness and sincerity. This movie is not meant for the regular audience who just go to the movies to be entertained by pompousness and effects.",1
1052,"The tone, performance, score and cinematography harken back to an era where simple movies were made well. Amazing experience in 2019. Multiple veiwings recommended.",1
1053,"Gripping story, natural acting and perfect background music . It's not a movie. It's reality.",1
1054,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ just incredible,1
1055,I watched this movie twice....and can even watch it a couple more times. This is a great movie.,1
1056,"Español: No puedo decir que sea la mejor película en su genero, esta claro decir, pero el papel de Joker había quedado vacío desde la muerte de Ledger. Es aquí donde Joaquin Phoenix, hace de nuevo vibrar nuestros sentidos al interpretar a un personaje icónico de la franquicia de BATMAN. Sin embargo su protagonismo nos hace sentir con el personaje ante la falta de empatia de la sociedad hacía las clases mas marginadas. En este caso, el giro de la trama sobre las diferencias que crecen día con día entre las clases sociales. Sin mas, es muy recomendable y sin duda formara parte junto con otros títulos, en las películas mas aclamadas de la historia.",1
1057,"Dark, sinister and close to the truth a little to much at times. A brilliant film and an incredible use of audio and visual effects.",1
1058,"I loved this. Don’t miss it, you will enjoy as much as I did. I didn’t think that after the great movie “The Dark Knight” I will see another movie with a Great Joker.   A great performance thanks to everyone and especially thanks to  Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Philips. This movie transmit very strong messages that are worth every time. Thank you for making this movie, a masterpiece of art.  I will definitely watch it again.",1
1059,"The joker is brilliant. Music, composition, cinematography and story is beautiful. It’s a must see. Joaquin Phoenix should be treasured.",1
1060,Phoenix carga (magistralmente) sobre sus hombros el peso de una historia oscura y cruda cuyo guión ocasionalmente falla.,1
1061,"Best batman movie ever!! A better batman origin story than any other before, without being a movie about batman.",1
1062,"Es una película impresionante, de niveles de actuación y dirección nunca antes vistos en un filme de su género. La actuación de Joaquín Phoenix es de otro nivel, merecido para estar candidato al Oscar al igual que la fotografía, guión, musica y dirección de esta misma. La película no sólo cambia el antes visto, sino que lo transforma. Una película que qué a consideración del público no es para todos, pero que siendo seguro los fascinará. Joker es una película 10/10, y aunque me decepcione el puntaje dado por esta misma página (metacritic) no significa que sea mala película, solo con ver que a la audiencia o los ""users"" la califiquen con más de un 9 y aunque se merece más que eso, ya da a entender lo que está obra de arte transmite al verdadero público al que fue dirigido esta película. Un joker que de estar tomado de la mano de Heath Ledger, se ha visto complementado de una manera magistral por Joaquín Phoenix.",1
1063,"This movie was magnificent, terrifying, and seriously disturbing. I might be riding on a wave because I just saw it, but it's definitely my favorite portrayal of Joker (and I still adore Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight). This isn't a superhero movie; it's the story of how someone who is already mentally unstable can lose their **** mind and descend into absolute madness, unintentionally inspiring a whole subsection of the population that is likewise susceptible. You're supposed to feel empathy for him, but no one should worship a madman. I do not recommend this movie to everyone because it's very hard to handle, and that's probably why I loved it so much.",1
1064,"Perfect acting. I think everyone can relate on a deeper level. The main character joker played the role perfectly in a way that this can happen in real life which one of the reasons why its so good. Other thing is that it has a fee messages as well which is perfect for our society right now. So many people have problems even me but instead most times people just judge or get angry or dont even listen to why your acting the way you are or what your saying, this movie demonstrates that if you just take time to truly listen to someone instead of judging them or jumping to accusations it can change a whole lot",1
1065,An incredible display of emotion and platitudinous amounts of insanity.I would absolutely say this deserves an Oscar in any category it's nominated for.,1
1066,Masterpiece. Joaquin was mesmerizing and De Niro was fantastic. Please go see this!,1
1067,Best film of the year. Young filmmakers should watch this just for the cinematography alone.,1
1068,"Absolute masterpiece. Perfect cinematography, accompanied by sincere, yet scary acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Don't listen to the media headlines or critic reviews about this movie, they have got an agenda to keep pushing. Go out and see this movie. Best cinema experience. 10/10",1
1069,Masterpiece. A hauntingly beautiful film shot with top notch technical expertise and with a knockout performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role.,1
1070,Best dark movie ever watched with oscer winning acting and direction ,1
1071,"Great movie, I really enjoyed the story even if it doesn’t follow the original Joker origin. Don’t believe the critics! Definitely recommend",1
1072,"I really love it.Dengan alur cerita yang tersusun dengan rapi, mampu membuat hanyut dalam cerita, tentang Arthur Fleck yang mungkim bisa dikatakan sebagai penjahat, atau justru dikatakan sebagai pahlawan",1
1073,"This was probably one of the most unussual comics movie. Even most,I would say it actually even was not a comics. It was very hard, intance, personal story of the broken man. The acting of Pheonix was brilliant. He managed to show a new face of  one the most famous character. His body and  moving every muscul on his face was breathtaking, huge job.",1
1074,A descent into madness with one of the greatest villians of all time the point of which is finally knowing your place in society is pure happiness.,1

1076,"Самый реалистичный джокер из всех, и самый психологический фильм DC из всех!",1
1077,"Absurd ratings from the access media, which seem to be basing their opinions on their own political agendas. This is one of the very best films of the year and during any other time period it would be praised by both fans and critics alike. Brilliant, bold, and necessary.",1
1078,Le film m'a provoquer une émotion qui m'étais pas arrivé depuis un bon moment au cinéma je le recommande fortement,1

1088,Você provavelmente não gostará mas terá de admitir que é bom. Provavelmente um Oscar.,1
1089,Really dark and twisted take on the jokers origin story.  Certainly worth watching,1
1090,Massive character development. Toatal madness of joker is so sick. Can't take of your eye from the screen. The whole movie develops from the beginning ends with a twist.,1
1091,"I saw Joker today.  I’m not sure what I was expecting but I was very disturbed while watching this movie. I disagree with many who assess the Joker as an anti-hero.  There’s absolutely nothing even remotely heroic about this character.  In fact, I think the movie is commenting on how absurd the notion is at the end of the movie. The Joker character does nothing out of a political motivation. It’s all reaction and anger. Sure, he enjoys the attention it gets him but to call him a hero out of the insanity spiral that he rides to the end is absurd.  The movement he sparks is entirely accidental and watching the crowd cheer him at the end is the pinnacle of deluded idiocy. They’ve turned a psychotic murderer into some kind of folk hero and I think the scene was intentionally meant to show this craziness for what it is. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t hate this movie.  It was harrowing to watch this man come apart and descend into madness. It was well made but I think everyone is missing the point of Joker. He’s a villain and this movie show how he got there and how ridiculous it is to view him as anything else but a villain.",1
1092,"Best DC movie maybe ever loved every second of this dark, disturbing, and ingaging masterpiece",1
1093,Good acting and entertained me for the duration of the film. Not as thought provoking or deep as critics lead me to believe. Good film but not one I would watch again.,1
1094,I was uncomfortable during the entirety of the movie and I loved it. But definitely not perfect.,1
1095,Acting and Atmosphere is superb. The director and cast has expertly created a masterpiece of recent years!,1
1096,amazing movie. so real and believable. amazing act by Phoenix.I. watched it for the second time and I love it more even.,1
1097,Masterpiece of the year. Great acting of jp along with the great music on the background.,1
1098,Absolutely amazing! Joaquin done a great job as Joker. Its definitely the best film I have seen in a good while!,1
1099,"El único error que le veo a esta película sería que el Joker se vuelve el Joker porque un compañero de su trabajo por alguna razón decidió darle un revólver, el cual a la larga acaacabaríabaria condenando su carrera y por eso mismo tendría más tiempo para darse cuenta De que la vida le trata realmente mal, Pues el averigaveriguariauaria cosas que estaba mejor sin saber, y eso hace que el tenga te decías realmente violentas las cuales le convierten el el ministerio del final de la película",1
1100,Realista e aterrador. Um filme de anti heróis mas muito apropriado para os tempos em que vivemos.,1
1101,"Es una película excelente, ver como el Joker se hunde en la locura es impresionante y lo muestran de forma muy gráfica, explícita y decadente, lo que lo hace más dura de ver. La ambientación, banda sonora y violencia genera una gran complementación y el film se hace más sólido y se consolida aún más. La actuación de Joaquin Phoenix da para un oscar, realmente se lo merece. Incluso la risa tuvo que aprender. Esa ""performance"" que realizó en este film ya es increíble, no se necesita más nada de él, pues ya se comprobó que es un gran actor y está hecho para ganarse un oscar. Esta actuación que nos brindó hizo que la película sea mucho más interesante y triste, contemplábamos cómo su enfermedad mental crecía a pasos agigantados. El clímax está muy bien logrado y ejecutado, es lo mejor que tiene el film. En cuanto a ambientación, se mostraba lo peor de las calles de NY, los lugares más lúgubres y oscuros. Hay algunas escenas en particular que son completamente inquietantes, pero que a su vez, son espectaculares. Joker, sin dudas, es un film muy sólido y estructurado, a base de la notable actuación de Joaquin Phoenix y su violencia explícita y dura, además de sus complementos adicionales como la banda sonora, escenografías, los planos y ambientación generan que la película sea aún más perfecta. En pocas palabras, es una película impresionante.",1
1102,Fantastic performance. Fantastic direction. Fantastic cinematography. Fantastic score. Fantastic soundtrack. What more do you want in a film?,1
1103,"Esa película es el Joker de todos nosotros y tener las ganas de vengar a las personas no solo a de la calle si no que los más cercanos, y que uno no elige dónde nacer y se hace sentir identificado",1
1104,"One of the darkest, grittiest depictions of mental health I've ever seen. A true PSA on why these things shouldn't go overlooked and should be treated with the utmost care.",1
1105,"Don't listen to the so called ""critics"" and go see for yourself. This movie is amazing and terrifying at the same time. You simply can't get your eyes out of the screen",1
1106,"By the first 40 minutes of the film, I'd decided it was a shallow attempt at something profound, but once things kick into gear (no spoilers) I found myself invested and entertained by the Joker's journey. The ambiguous nature of the ending feels contrived, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Requiem for a Dream meets Taxi Driver as envisioned by a director whose sole concern is entertaining a crowd.",1
1107,"A Masterpiece movie. Ha ha haa... Even now it is resonating in my ears. Intriguing, interesting, dark and disturbing, this film is not for faint hearted people. If many critics are concerned about the message or impact of the movie, why only this movie many earlier Hollywood films are so very negative still its fine. See it as a film and not as an entertaining factor.",1
1108,"The most gloomy, depressing and cruel film on the comics ever. DC returned their game, fans can be proud of their idols, and director Todd Phillips finally found where to attach his darkest and most terrible jokes.",1
1109,Magnífica. Los mierdas de críticos ya no saben lo que es el verdadero arte del cine,1
1110,"The second greatest movie of all time. Only second to the Dark Knight. Take that, Marvel.",1
1111,"One of the best movies I've seen this year. Excellent performance, very entertaining, 100% recommended.",1
1112,Phonix was trying to do his best and show his dissapointment of society ...i belive him and all his character and movie could amuse me and say a good story of destroyig ....for these times it was terrific movie,1
1113,"Joker, based on the DC villian, is a drama movie about Arthur Fleck who through a life of hardship becomes the calamity that is called Joker. It is dark, it is brutal and it is a good movie.Arthur Fleck was dealt the worst hand imaginable when he was born. He was adopted by a delusional, mentally ill woman that had an abusive boyfriend. Other than that, she stood by as this man beat and abused her adopted son... You feel that? That depression? Well now imagine if that kid grows up, becomes a clown while having mental problems, and the city is going through a recess of sorts that cuts the funding of his social worker that prescribes his anti-depressive medication! We meet Arthur when he's already at the edge of falling down, but when he stops receiving his medication and accepts his own emotions towards society's standards, he finally finds himself. And with him Gotham city takes justice in its own hands, becoming sodom and gomorra. What is great, is how we see a very different perspective of Thomas Wayne and the elite class then we are used to from the Batman movies. It is refreshing.It was an enjoyable watch, with a good performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I give it a 7/10. Though this version of the Joker is interesting, i can't help but feel that Heath ledger's version was more impactfull.",1
1114,"after a couple of days of processing this film as one really needs to do afterwards, here are my thoughts on itI very much enjoyed this film. It's a really gritty character study of quite possibly the most popular villian in all of comics which sets itself apart from all other films in the superhero/supervillian genre.As the viewer we are invited to empathise with our protagonist Arthur Flack, an already very damaged man when we meet him, yet the degree of how damaged is only revealed later in the film. For the message of this film is monsters are rarely born, but created by other monsters. A statement which is very true in the world we live in. And yet still while making this point the film still successfully falls short of trying to justify any of his horrible actions he makes later as the joker. While at first it seems like a very straight forward narrative. As the film progresses it becomes increasingly clear that there is a lot more going on as it draws inspiration from some very prominent graphic novels such as The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns, and I do feel a second viewing may be required. Being set around the late 70s/early 80s, the film is made to look, though a combination of camera angles and colour palettes very much like films made in that era with a soundtrack to suit. It even intentionally parodies key films from that era, the 2 obvious ones being Taxi Driver and King of Comedy with Robert De Niro being cast as a very clear homage. Reasons for such parodies become clear upon the completion of the film.The standout feature of this film is Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which is comparable to but still distinguished from Heath Ledgers Joker. I still don't know which one I prefer or if I prefer one over the other, as both work perfectly within their own films and I think can both sit at the top next to each other for their own reasons. Early on in the film there is a very specific and brilliant character trait revealed about Joaquin's character Arthur Fleck which completely alters the context of all his self expressions throughout the film.Personally I think this film is best viewed as a very black comedy. And while it is probably not the best film made this year, it is still a very good film and is exactly what you want in a Joker movie, so from me gets 8/10P.S. anyone going into this film expecting an incel hero worship narrative as promised in various articles online, you will not find that here, unless you go in completely ignorant of what is presented in front of you",1
1115,"A phenomenal movie with stellar performances, no element of this movie should go unnoticed. The slow methodical pacing matching Arthur's hit after hit to his sense of self and the combined growing anger if the city around him, perfectly in step with the tense and impeccable score. It appropriately comments of today's resentment towards the super  Rich and thier abuse of the common people and those who need the most help in order to make themselves more money. You can understand Arthur's transformation in the extreme situation he is in. The tension carries on into the final act where you can tell from the get go that it will all come to a boil, but you don't know exactly how. Complaints about violence in this movie are unfounded and foolish. It is frankly mild compared to other movies but touches on volatile issues that effect many people around the world. And if it doesn't scare you in that aspect, then it wouldn't have done it's job.My only criticisms of the movie would be the amount in which it overtly pulls from other movies, sometimes past the point of homages to feeling a tad weak on it's own feet. But if nothing else it managed to bring the same elements of those movies into a more socially relevant story about an iconic character.It's just a true shame we won't see this Joker outside of his microcosm.Go see this movie.",1
1116,It's a masterpiece...Joaquin Phoenix nailed it..A must watch..Heath ledger must be proud of him,1
1117,Absolutely fantastic! This is the super vallian back story movie we all deserve.,1
1118,Great and Intriguing story. Very bold movie which is a quite a rarity nowadays. 10/10 OSCAR,1
1119,"The brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix is just the tip of the iceberg that seems to draw people's attention. But the further combination of directing, screenplay, music, all set the stage for something that is quite unsettling.",1
1120,"I Loved it...Then again Id list King of Comedy and Taxi Driver in my top 100 films so I'm gonna love it aren't I. Some of the shots are jaw droppingly beautiful, from the bathroom dance scene to THAT scene atop the car. I got goosebumps. My 10/10 is not a reaction to the critics score, it is genuinely one of the greatest films I've seen. That the new batwoman is currently ranked higher than this by critics on rotten tomatoes tells a very disturbing story. I refuse to take part in any score bombing, but I will remember the publications and reviewers. I won't take part in your games any longer.",1
1121,"The darkness and tone of This movie set off the correct path for an origin story of possibly the best we've ever seen, don’t listen to the critics go see this movie yourself seeing is believing and you will see a great film the entire cast and crew put together for us to enjoy.",1
1122,"Must see! Joaquin don't need Oscar, Oscars needs Joaquin... thanks for this movie!",1
1123,"An amazing and insane movie. The Joker is near perfection, one of the best movie I have ever seen, and probably the best comics related movie for me. This is a masterpiece, the actor, the camera, the lights, everything is excellent. The scenario was maybe a bit slow at the start, but it was necessary for the movie to develope the main character, and the heavy and insane aura of the movie.(I just saw it, I may be unobjective)",1
1124,"This movie is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. From the direction, the scores, Joaquin's acting and the important message that it portrays it's an absolute must-see and (in my opinion) one of the best movies to date. This is what cinematography is about.",1
1125,"I don't understand the low critical review scores! Absolutely loved it. From the acting and sound track to the filmography and storyline, for me it was a great 2 hours well spent.",1
1126,"Joker is the tragic and cruel history of the man, who lives in society with a lot of sins, including appaty and hatred. Arthur Fleck trying to live in this madness city, but in one moment this world being funny joke. Todd Philips made something amazing - he created movie, which can exsist without background represented by DC's legacy. Joker is a movie of generation! P.S. The Joaquin Phoenix's game really is masterpiece. Critics are wrong about the Joker!",1
1127,"Excelente pelicula trasmite varios sentimientos , la actuacion de Joaquin es soberbia ,merece el oscar sin duda , la banda sonora es perfecta en los momentos que tiene que sonar,  es la mejor pelicula del año",1
1128,Best movie in 20 years.  I have watched 4 times now and I want more.  Wish I had 4k blu-ray so I could play it everyday. :-D,1
1129,"When I see negative scores from the critic all I can think is that there is something going on. Cause, unless you are a blind or something, you can't talk bad about this masterpiece. Cause this is a true masterpiece, in every aspect. I hope this movie gets some well deserved oscars.",1
1130,"masterpiece! with love from Russia! Joaquin Phoenix  deserves an oscar! Already had to receive, please ... don't upset us! Todd Phillips is genius",1
1131,"One of the most profound and immersive interpretations of the pop culture canon, Joker is a dark psychological masterpiece.",1
1132,"Honestly I loved this movie so much. One of the best films I have seen all year. What bothers me about other reviews is that they felt uncomfortable so that's why they rate it so low. That makes zero sense, this movie does not glorify anything, it has a great message about classism, society, and the media's role in giving maniacs the time of day.",1
1133,Stellar film! The acting by Phoenix is damn near perfect and his interpretation is just as good as ledgers!,1
1134,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,1

1139,"Не часто ставлю фільму 10,але це саме той випадок.",1
1140,"Most introspective movie I've ever seen. Joaquin lives and breaths Joker, and the fact that the movie is 95% focused on the main character makes it more immersive into its profile.Definitely worth watching, and please give that man an oscar.",1
1141,Not sure why there's so much hate from the critics. Thought that this was a brilliant movie that uncomfortably mirrors the issues we are facing now in society.,1
1142,The attempt to make a movie that show audience the inner person of the joker was successful. Acting of Joaquin Phoenix was unbelievably good.,1
1143,Riveting and thought-provoking from start to finish. A modern masterpiece - go see it.,1
1144,First half features what may be the most relatable and depressing portrayal of modern lower class inner city living featured on screen. Cue descent of a man into madness. Last third competes with Ledger's take for the best portrayal of Joker media yet. Highly recommended.,1
1145,"Amazing! One of the beet movies I have seen ever in my life! These people did a great job, this is truly breathtaking.",1
1146,"I want this to be a non-spoiler review on the bases that *everyone* should watch this movie. All you really need to know is how the main critics (I mean look at their score) don't understand what makes this movie great. If you want to know going in it's a movie about how you should treat your fellow man with dignity and respect because you have no idea what they're going through and we all have to share this terrible world together. No politics. No message. No ""appealing to incels."" Just a movie being a movie with a message that reaches every single person to our core. This movie should be a fun uniting movie not one that divides. The only valid complaint could be the violence but come on does anyone know who the Joker is? You should know what you're signing up for...",1
1147,"“Joker” is a lot like the musical “Wicked.”  Both offer backstories for iconic characters.  “Wicked” retells “The Wizard of Oz”; “Joker” explains the genesis of Batman’s arch-nemesis.  “Joker,” however, is “Wicked” without the upbeat music, the dancing, the redemptive friendships of key characters or songs with original, cleverly observational lyrics.What makes this film worth watching is Joaquin Phoenix, once again fully immersed in a troubled character.  When Phoenix steps into the role of Joker, his devotion to the role is absolute, his commitment is complete.  His presence is so commanding that the moviegoer simply can’t look away.  With the exception of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight series, “Joker” soars high above the other films that have addressed this comic book series.  Some will even see elements of Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” at various points.  Director Phillips clearly aspires to offer much more than most of the films in this franchise.  Because of Phoenix, he succeeds.    The fatal flaw for “Joker” is that it is a one-note tune.  In the vision of Writer/Director Todd Phillips, life is tedium interspersed with cruelty and violence, some of it random, some intentional.  With one small exception, any sense of kindness or human connection is just a hallucination.  In other words, apparently, it’s 42nd Street in New York City in the 1970s.Against this barren landscape, Phillips engages in a little social commentary – the impact of the disintegrating mental health safety net, the grinding consequences for most when they are caught in the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.  Clearly, these are topics with current relevance, but the subjects receive only glancing blows, not deep consideration.What’s more frustrating, though, is that the script assumes that offering a chronology of events about Joker eliminates any obligation to engage in actual character development.  We are given information about Joker’s tragic childhood, we observe him in his occupation as a low-level clown (in case we don’t get the point, the song “Send in the Clowns” is deployed to underline the idea), we see the consequences of his complete social isolation.  But, critically, we never see Joker evolve in any way.  He is no more self-aware than when the film begins.  He’s just a tragic character lurching from one day to the next, moving closer and closer to a boiling point, heading toward a conclusion as obvious as it is unfortunate.“Joker” is depressing, frustrating, upsetting, powerful and riveting.  You can’t take your eyes off Joaquin Phoenix and the spectacle he ultimately creates.  Sometimes, you may wish you had.",1
1148,"It's been long since a movie has taken me through so many emotional states, made me uncomfortable from beginning to end, felt impossible to stand, and yet, it may be the best film of the year, and might even be like the Taxi Driver of our generation.I thought (don't know why, honestly) this was going to be a progressive critique of today, trying to make us hate ourselves for our ""privilege"" or our attitudes, and how the rise of a madman is ""our"" fault somehow. Quite the contrary, it focuses on the Joker and how someone can take (and finish) the slow, safe and utterly dangerous descent into madness. Which is, as Ledger said, one little push away, but in order to be that way, it needs the guidance of someone who has walked the walk and been through every step.I wanted to hate this movie. I hated it for moths, even before I knew how it was going to be. I was wrong. For the performances, the story, the screenplay, the photography, the symbolism, the score (the score!), the soundtrack (THE SOUNDTRACK!) and what it ultimately is: the story of the Joker, as it should, or at least could, be.",1
1149,"I didn't know what to expect when going to watch this movie, but it has a really good story towards mental health and previous treatment towards it, we now feel for the villain which is done due to the phenomenal acting done by all the cast, specifically Pheonix. The audiovisual design and dark humour topped it off! Pheonix should get an Oscar!",1
1150,"What a masterpiece. I was sceptical about the tone and scenes the first 20 minutes, but wow it builds up for an amazing and powerful finale. Everything makes sense in the end. Phoenix absolutely nails it!",1
1151,"This **** deserves an oscar, outstanding performance and a really dark story line. Absolute masterpiece",1
1152,Brilliant film! Joequin's acting is Oscar worthy and the shots are amazing!,1
1153,Probably the best movie about mental illness and the falling down of a man crushed by a ruthless society ever created.Phoenix have given the best performance of his life here and frankly deserve an Oscar.The overall cinematography and sound design is also extremely good.,1
1154,"Absolutely incredible. Phoenix captivates, manipulates and leaves you eating out of the palm of his hand.",1
1155,"This really does say a lot about society, yet we live in one. Over 2 hours of edge-of-your-seat bruh moments.It's good to see villain movies, especially origin stories when they're so well done. A lot of suspense and little bits of action to get your heart racing. As for the bored reviewers, they must've been looking for more action/ didn't understand this was a psychological thriller that illustrates the downward spiral of a mentally-disturbed outcast before assuming the identity that all of us (correction: SOME OF US) have come to know and love for its tension.All these people weren't paying attention much during their childhoods when first being exposed to comics, superheroes, the DC universe, etc. Joker's a serial killer? A psychotic vengeful man? O my God! Who woulda thunk?! 200 iq! Brain blast big brain time for connecting the dots! Go see it!",1
1156,"Wanna hear a joke?  What do you get when the media attempts to slander a film against their own nonsensical agenda?  You get a damn near masterpiece!  Joker, a highly anticipated film of 2019 directed from the man who brought you The Hangover trilogy, Todd Phillips and starring multi award winning/nominee Joaquin Phoenix as the infamous jester of crime play into one of this year's best cinema.  Truly, this movie is a must see for mature audiences and must I say, there is no danger to concern one's self with as there has been far more violently created pictures before.  The story is carried vigorously throughout by Mr. Phoenix as a mentally ill man who descends further into his own madness; is well thought and wonderfully played.  A multitude of emotion this movie may convey to it's viewer as it will range from dark and sad to some humor with moments of joy when the character reaches his downfall.  Much like proven personality disorders that an individual can wildly change their current state of emotion within a short period of time, this movie understands the topic of discussion and is something I appreciate.  Robert De Niro, though a short screen time; gives a fair performance and for the remaining supporting cast does equally well.  And composer, Hildur Guðnadóttir who also elevated her work into the hit miniseries Chernobyl, brings a harmonious though haunting score that gives the character Arthur Fleck/Joker balletic virtuosity.  The only fault I can suggest of the movie is that I feel the protagonist's bullying can be seen as a bit cliché.  Again, if you appreciate good filming to an artistically sense of purpose similarly to that of a Martin Scorsese piece, this is a definite must see!",1
1157,An amazing film from beginning to end Aarons Descent Into Madness when his life Falls around him and the ending was amazing especially that kill live on tv - PTSD for life,1
1158,The movie that successfully proves that movies based off comics can go beyond simple superhero vs. supervilian theme. Probably the first comic related movie that went completely in drama direction and for that I can only appreciate it more. Hard but unforgettable watch.,1
1159,It's a really nice movie Joaquin Phoenix deserves Oscar for his acting don't believe the review given by marvel fans or some other jerks,1
1160,"Thrilling, shocking, and an Oscar-worthy performance by Phoenix. I feel like those who oppose it’s depiction of mental health issues, must just be so used to being on the opposite side of the struggle.",1
1161,IGNORE the SJW oversensitive critics. One of them who gave this a 2 gave the new Ghostbusters movie an 8. Let that speak for itself. This movie is an absolute masterpiece,1

1163,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time. this is far froma typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie  it's a proper psychological thriller/ drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.",1
1164,очень тяжёлый и прекрасный фильм он заставляет плакать и смеяться одновременно но то что такой классный фильм снят про супер злодея это удивляет,1
1165,This movie is well crafted and well acted.  Very elegantly made.  Clear vision.  Phoenix is absolutely amazing!,1
1166,A great adaptation of my favourite movie villain. Very dark and violent but shot excellently well. Joaquin Phoenix performance is amazing and certainly is Oscar worthy. Best movie I've seen in a long time and one of the best of the year by far. Kept my mind racing and kept thinking about the movie long after the credits rolled.,1
1167,"Outstanding. A must watch for any fans of the iconic DC villain. They’ve reimagined the character, whilst keeping the cor elements of the Joker there.",1
1168,Really great movie. Solid performance by Joaquin and a satisfying payoff. Music and visuals were excellent. Can’t wait to see it again.,1
1169,"The first proper movie I have seen in far too long. A smart plot with well-crafted characters acted by superior actors. All this crafted by a director that gets his own material. A movie that will resonate in a 'similar' way to ""A Clockwork Orange"" in crafting an anvil for you to think about what you have just seen. Well worth the price of a movie ticket.",1
1170,"forget about the incels trying to make this movie about them. forget about the critics worried that it might glorify a murderous, psychotic clown. this is a great, dark origin story, with an amazing actor (let's not ruin it by comparing him to other Jokers) enriching what already is one of the most interesting characters of pop culture. go watch it and form your own opinion.",1
1171,"JOKER is one of the most famous villain in the film universe, and this movie does not represent that face of this character. This movie represents the human part of someone who made one of the most dangerous and emblematic villains. The movie works so well from the beginning to the end, representing the life of a normal person that has serious mental problems and that is refused by the society in general. Joaquin Phoenix acted marvelous, he could hold the character until the end, giving us a credible version of someone who just wanted to seek his happiness, but that the reality was that he always lived in a lie. The rest of the elements such as the music, the screenplay, photography are in a high level which gave us a very solid movie in all its sections. Recommended.--9/10--",1

1177,"The movie is a damn masterpiece, it is incomprehensible that the **** of The Last Jedi have 85/100 while this wonder is only 59/100, fortunately here the public is right",1
1178,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Joker is Oscar-worthy. I think there is no question about that. The film is great, too. I think there are some choices the creative team made about how the story flows, particularly in the first hour, that feel a bit out of place and do show that while Todd Phillips clearly is more than just a ""comedy director"" he has plenty of room to improve. The last hour of Joker is really what makes it worth the watch. That's when all of the best moments happen, and of course when Arthur becomes Joker. The ending ties it all together very well, too, and gives the audience something to ponder on as they leave the theater. I wouldn't mind seeing this version of the Joker return, but I'm also perfectly fine with this being a one-off for the character.",1
1179,"Joker is not just a portrayal of a villain. And violence per se is not usually a problem for critics and media, or the real reason behind the controversies surrounding this movie. There is plenty of movies that have critical acclaim despite the fact they are glorifying violence.Their problem seems to be in the fact that Joker is more than just a story of a villain committing acts of violence. It's also a genuine portrayal of a society in decay. This movie shows us what broken society does to people living in it. It's a psychological study of people not just on individual level. Also a movie full of plot twists which make you question what we see, trying to make you think about it and recognize deception from reality.That's why media and some acclaimed critics are targeting Joker, labeling the movie as dangerous. Well, at least those who understand the movies underlying implications. There are many critics who are just condemning the movie from a very superficial standpoint or even without seeing it, just blindly embracing the narrative created around it. Joker is, apart from its multiple messages it tries to convey to us, also a beautifully made piece of cinematography done on a relatively low budget. Acting, visuals and music score are masterful.",1
1180,Excellent! A masterpiece. One of the best movies I've in years. Joaquin is captivating throughout,1
1181,"When I get Oscar Award, can you introduce me as Joker..Great performance by joaquin phoenix, unique portray as Joker. I been glue on my seat throughout the show.",1
1182,"Excelente película, escenas muy dinámicas, te envuelve en el personaje, te hace sentir esa desesperación que Arthur siente. Joaquin consiguió dar vida a un personaje y lo moldeó durante el rodaje.",1
1183,"Despite a few slow moments and being a bit overwrought in showing how miserable the protagonist's life is, Joker is largely entrancing. Phoenix's performance is brilliant, full of hurt and pathos while managing to be sympathetic. Phillips' direction is mostly tight and stylish.And while the movie generally plays how the trailers suggested, it still manages to be powerful, to be moving, to be affecting.It's a difficult watch at times, but the few moments of humor, though dark, land quite well. Watch it and reflect. This is a movie that perfectly encapsulates the current political climate despite being apolitical. It is not pushing for violence (not is it condemning it, per se). It is not praising Incel culture. It is none of the things most of the media suggest.Rather, Joker is a movie about pain, mental health, abandonment, austerity, and class warfare. In other words, a near-perfect movie for our time.",1
1184,"The best Joker ever, honestly Phoenix Rivals Heath Ledger, This movie is The Joker's descent into madness",1
1185,"Delivering not only a compelling character study for Batman's main nemesis, but also an important cautionary tale when it comes to society and the government abandoning a mentally ill individual, ""Joker"" is a rare comic book film that thrills while leaving plenty of food for thought.",1
1186,"Filme incrível, impecável e historia muito realista. Sem palavras pra atuação do Phoenix .",1
1187,Don’t make any judgements about this film before going to watch it. If it was called ‘The Madness of Arthur Fleck’ you wouldn’t know it was based on a comic book Villian.,1
1188,"This movie has shocked me, disturbed and made me laugh in the most uncomfortable of ways. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, tho maybe that's because of cultural differences (not from the US here). Regardless, it is a really well crafted movie, that left me holding my breath most of the time and incredibly confused. I absolutely recommend it.",1
1189,The critic reviews are cute. Ignore them. They're obviously disconnected from reality. Movie of the year and worth seeing in theaters.,1
1190,افضل فلم شفته حتى الان افضل تمثيل واكثر فلم يفضح توجه او قصر نظر بعض النقاد,1
1191,"This is a great movie, dont believe garbage sjw media and other activists saying otherwise.",1
1192,Very nice movie about a man slowly loosing his sanity because of the people around him that treated him badly,1
1193,"It justifies the madness behind this character. It makes a statement about humour: ""Comedy is subjective, Murray. Isn’t that what they say? All of you, the system that knows so much, you decide what’s right or wrong. The same way that you decide what’s funny or not."" It has a good ending. Offtopic: It is very satisfying to see what happens to De Niro, guy had it coming since he started swearing uncontrollably all over the place cause he's old and irrelevant these days. All in all, I'd rewatch it anytime",1
1194,"This was the best movie for me in terms of acting and story , unless you only go to the cinema for non-stop action movies you are going to love this.",1
1195,"A movie where you can perfectly see a man unfairly treated by society as a freak, turn into the insane clown we all know and love from the comics. A message that’s painfully true that’s been told by the brilliant writers that worked on this movie that society can be cruel, and society is also the reason behind all the rioting, murder, stealing, etc, that’s in the world. A movie that has deep characters, interesting story, realistic acting combined with realistic action, and a powerful ending (that some people might have missed the mark at what it meant,) is worthy of a 10/10 flick.",1
1196,"The perfect example of why you can't trust critics. It's ok when handsome, patriotic wise cracking heroes are kicking CGI ass for the 40th movie in a row. But take the most infamous villain in fictional history and tell his tragic backstory in a way that an audience can sympathise with...god forbid.",1
1197,"La película es de lo mejor que ha sacado el universo de DC buen drama, buenos efectos especiales, además Joaquin Fenix hace el papel de maravilla, en definitiva esta en el top 3 de mejores películas de DC",1
1198,"Joker puts a  backstory to one of the most notorious comic book villains while keeping it grounded in reality. Amazing acting performance, intriguing story, gripping musical score, and tension that you can feel makes for a phenomenal experience. The ""controversy"" around this film is completely unwarranted, just typical media outlets looking for attention.",1
1199,Great performance of joker must watch this movie DC best movie for me. Should oscar winning actor,1
1200,"Posiblemente la mejor película del año, me encanto de principio a fin, no tienen ni una cosa mala. Joaquin Phoenix como el Joker es impresionante, y como reacciona ante los acontecimientos que le presenta la trama es simplemente grandioso. Muero de ganas de ver The Batman.",1
1201,"Slow burn origin story worth your time! We finally get to see the man behind the paint. The music perfectly compliments the music, i would say it even drives the movie.Highly recommended! Don't trust the critic scores as critic scores mean nothing these days.",1
1202,Wow.. I can still feel the chills from the ending scene even though I watched it weeks ago.I'm going for a repeat viewing.,1
1203,"""Joker"", and Joaquin Phoenix, dance rhythmically, hypnotically, without caring who's watching, winning our empathy, our sympathy, tracing the surprising path of a mentally ill man from being an optimistic victim living the edge of non-existence to an inspired truth-teller commanding a city's attention.  Phoenix's uncompromisingly realistic portrait of Joker's illness is the rarest of acting feats: it teaches us about ourselves and our choices, as it shows how the Joker can do what he does, in the way that he does it: he can't stop himself, and we wonder why we keep stopping ourselves. As we should, every day.",1
1204,This is Art. I love this movie because it’s reality and shows different perspectives and personalities.,1
1205,8/10 on the first viewing. 10/10 on the second viewing. Rewards multiple viewings. A post-structural masterpiece!,1
1206,"Minor spoiler alert here. I found this to be an excellent character study, and Phoenix’ performance is phenomenal! I loved the music, the lighting, and the feel of the film. It gives us a look at a young Bruce Wayne, and his first interaction with the Joker. it’s also a comment on the times we live in, where some feel marginalized and some react with violence. If clowns freak you out, prepare yo be freaked out!",1
1207,"Truly the best acting I have ever seen. Countless times throughout the film I found myself sitting with my mouth agape in awe of Phoenix's portrayal of this character I thought I knew so well after decades of Batman movies. Tonight, I finally saw the real Joker. And I want more. Outstanding film from top to bottom.",1
1208,"Beautiful. Image, filming, feeling, acting and mostly the script. This movie represents not only the joker but what it really feels like for many people to live in this world.",1
1209,Must watch.Best Movie 2019: Joker. MASTERPIECE!!!This movie has it all!!!,1
1210,"Superb performance from Phoenix as usual, but the whole film just 'works' as a story. It must have been tempting to add more and bloat this film out to 2.5-3hrs as tends to be the norm, but it ties everything together perfectly within 2hrs with a slap of the hands and a ""job done"". You simply cannot compare this to Ledger's Joker in the same way you shouldn't compare this film to the Avengers - it's not really the same genre, and a character with a different on-screen purpose.",1
1211,"Joker(2019) is the best film I have ever seen. This is coming from a person that watched AFI's top 100 in my teenage years and I am always interested in films that have a deeper meaning beyond the surface. The only way you wouldn't feel sorry for Arthur Fleck(Joker) in this movie is if you were a Sociopath, or a Psychopath. For those of us that do empathize with others; you will feel broken while watching this movie. The depth of sadness, and level of acting Joaquin Phoenix brings to this film may haunt you for weeks. I have been desperate and nearly homeless for a decade of my life. I know the depth of sadness that Arthur Fleck felt before breaking down completely in this film to become The Joker. Life experiences like those portrayed in this film are why suicides in America have skyrocketed. This film is not only important for the perspective it provides, but to reveal those critics in the media that do not appreciate the deeply emotional art of acting at the highest level humanity can achieve. I am glad someone has finally told the story of the forgotten people in society with mental illness, and what monsters we could have become if we lost grip with our humanity and love for others in the process of fighting our inner demons.",1
1212,Masterpiece. Terrifying story.Some of the best acting i have ever seen in my life.,1
1213,"What an awesome movie, the trailer gives nothing away. This is a must see, amazing masterpiece. Go watch it.",1
1214,"If you love joker as the character you will love this movie. I does take some concepts from the comics but it is it own story. At the end of the movie will be inspirational and depressing at the same time,  it will leave you wondering and asking questions of the meaning of life.  This my opinion but overall a awesome thrill for 2019 worth to watch in theaters.",1
1215,This is a really good take on the character. Phoenix gives us one of the best adaption of the character.,1
1216,"I strongly dislike the character of the Joker, so when DC announced that they would be making a Joker solo film, I expected it to be terrible. Once the trailers started coming out, it became clear that the film would go in a very different direction than any previous movie featuring the Joker, and that it (very shockingly) had the potential to be actually good. After hearing great things about it which indicated that it wouldn’t be at all like I originally expected, I decided to see the film.Arthur Fleck is so unlike previous incarnations of the Joker that it’s insulting to even consider him to be the same character. Instead of another badly written, disgusting, and monstrous überedgelord, we got a believable, lifelike, and compelling character who barely resembles the Joker. To put it more simply, other Jokers are characters written  for edgelords, while Arthur is a realistic portrayal of an edgelord.The film reflects America’s current fears of political violence, violent mobs, and spree killers. Arthur is white, male, mentally ill, has become misanthropic due to feeling that society has abused and abandoned him, and seeks attention from committing atrocities, all of which are common traits among today’s spree killers. The film is not an endorsement of violence, but an exploration of the mindset of a killer. The film is very melodramatic, but that isn’t a bad thing. Each incident that pushes Arthur further into evil is reminiscent of situations that inspire real life violence, not to endorse the violent acts, but to explain the motives behind them. A film tackling a question of “why” these acts of violence happen is needed in an age where they seem to happen so often.Part of the reason that Black Panther was good was because it greatly distanced itself from the shared universe that it was part of. Joker takes this further by distancing itself from the entire superhero genre. In fact, the only reason that this is a superhero movie are a few place and character names that could’ve been changed without impacting the plot, but as nice as it would be, a major studio would never put so much money and effort into a film like this unless it was tied to a lucrative franchise like DC/Batman. I’ve previously said that Black Panther is the only superhero film that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar other than Best Visual Effects, but I believe that not only does Joker also deserve to be nominated in several Oscar categories, it possibly even deserves to win them. Like how I expect Black Panther to be a fluke for Marvel, I expect Joker to be a fluke for DC, being the one example of the company making a good film despite the odds.Talking about the film’s context and comparing it to other works doesn’t really capture everything that went into making this movie good. The cinematography was better than any film I’ve seen recently, with most shots seeming to be carefully and deliberately constructed, the original score is haunting and sets the mood perfectly, dialogue is consistently well written, the actors do a great job of bringing the characters to life, and every scene stands out as memorable and potential classics. Overall, a very well made film.9/10",1
1217,"Um dos melhores filmes de 2019, com roteiro,atuações,trilha sonora e fotografia magnifica, Coringa eleva um personagem de quadrinhos a uma obra de arte cinematográfica, mas um acerto na DC/Warner",1
1218,"This is the story of a man who stumbles his way through a mixed-up city, in a very twisted way.  It's also a solid reminder that without the over~the~top hijinx or cotton candy humor, we get real storytelling from Gotham City and DC.  The Jokers not meant to be a  hero and this movie is a reminder that no one should ever want to be like him.  With that said, all those involved with making this film deserve a round of applause.",1
1219,"this movie was pretty good, i liked how they made the movie realistic, which is kinda scary in my opinion, this really happens in the real world (well besides the ending part) but yeah, this movie is really good.",1
1220,"Joker's incredible box-office hit is not without a certain irony for a film that is so inspired by the new Hollywood.The new Hollywood is this period of American filmmaking, where filmmakers start making small and medium-budget films that are part of a counter-culture, in stark contrast to the Pharaonic budgets of the big Hollywood machines of previous years, and achieve unexpected public successes for this kind of film, leading to a whole decade where audiences rush to the cinema to see films where ""people in suits talk in the dark"", to use Coppola's famous phrase to describe the Godfather.Given the success of Todd Philips's reasonably priced film compared to recent blockbusters, it is hoped that this joker will pave the way for a ""Hollywood renewal"".Joker even opens with the old Warner logo (the one used from 1972 to 1984), immediately marking the dark aesthetics typical of those years, and unfolds as a study of character that is reminiscent of some films of the period like Midnight Cowboy (a film filled with losers who are not without Arthur Fleck) but especially two films by Martin Scorsese: Taxi Driver at the King of Comedy (de Niro taking Lewis's place).But the film is not just a nostalgic trip back to a bygone era, so much so that its subject is rooted in our time by talking about the ever-increasing disparity between rich and poor, by pinpointing the current political and economic discourse of the elites through the figure of Thomas Wayne, who resembles to be mistaken for a clever mix of Trump and Macron.The film, in an obvious parallel with the society in which we live, holds out a mirror and pushes the nail down: cuts in social assistance budgets and a whole section of the society that has been abandoned will inevitably end up generating all kinds of abominations on the fertile ground that is poverty.It is quite striking to note the similarities between the demonstrations of the Gotham subjects dressed as clown, and other mass citizen movements that can be observed in France or elsewhere at this time.Nevertheless, beyond the question of society's collective responsibility in creating its own monsters, the film is more about studying a character who is going mad than about burning politics.And what a character! Joaquin Phoenix masters his subject and is as touching in some scenes as he is disturbing in others, and we feel as much empathy for him as we do disgust.And then, this laugh, which seems to physically hurt Arthur Fleck and which is an essential part of the role's panoply, this laugh, is particularly well found and defines the character perfectly, not the joker in general, but the joker in particular.In short, a role to the disproportionate size of this talented actor.In the end, Joker is a successful film, even if it is not without some flaws or elements that are sometimes too heavily endorsed both in its content and its staging. And while it is true that I am less enthusiastic than the average, I am delighted with the success of a film that places characters above effects and that we hope to see emulators in the future.",1
1221,"Elements of fantasy and fiction are still present in this Joker film, but the more realistic spice of conflict is one of the keys to the success of character building and the dark atmosphere until the end of the story. This film does not present a variety of exciting action scenes, but rather is focused on the drama of life as a Gotham society whose situation is not conducive for everyone. Conflict that can be better understood and coupled with how Arthur sees the world and his surroundings which is heavily influenced by his mental health condition, we are invited to take part in falling into the madness he experiences throughout the film. There is greater sympathy for the character of the Joker this time, but it also creates a conflict in your mind that what the Joker himself did cannot be fully justified.",1
1222,This movie might have broken every single record for an awesome masterpiece of a movie. It had everything we wanted in a Joker movie and even more.,1
1223,Really Good! finally the best  laught of the  joker great acting!! another story for the origine of the character!,1
1224,Amazing film all the way through.  Highly recommend.  Oscar worthy.  Joker like you've never seen him.,1
1225,"A brilliant and utterly gripping film, from start to finish. My heart was pounding.",1
1226,Magnifique film ! Rien à dire le meilleur Joker .Du début à la fin on nous montre toute son histoire et la fin peut nous mettre le doute sur tous se qu'on a vu j'ai adorer !,1
1227,"this is a masterpiece, it's not like other films in this ""gender"", it's a drama, spectacular, Joaquin Phoenix is a great Joker, thank you Todd Philips",1
1228,"The movie starts off methodically slow. But once it gets going, wow! This is a movie where 'the villain' is not a villain. This is a movie where the world is the villain. And then, of course, there's Joaquin Phoenix with that worryingly amazing performance. The 5.9 rating here is an absolute insult to this instant classic!",1
1229,"Joker separates itself from the DCEU and after watching it, I am completely on board with it. Not only is this a great comic book movie and a great movie in general, this is a staple in comic book movies and a staple in Joaquin Phoenix’s career just like The Dark Knight was for Heath Ledger. As much as I would be excited for this Joker to go against Batman I don’t want to see a movie of that. I feel like it would ruin the point of what Todd Phillips was trying to make.",1
1230,"A movie for our times. A must see, don’t be left in the darkness about the urgent alarm this movie sounds off. Those who fear its content do not understand the importance of its message. What happens when society gives careless hate to someone for far too long?",1
1231,"Is probably not cannon but shows depth of the Joker how it begins , it takes only few bad days to turn .",1
1232,"Слишком спорное отношение к фильму. Потому и не слишком понятно по каким критериям выставлять оценку. Не то, что фильм отвратителен или ещё чего. Нет. Великолепная игра Хоакина Феникса, отличная работа кинооператора и идеально подобранный сауднтрек, все это есть в этом фильме. А спорное отношение потому, что ты не знаешь - можно отнести этот фильм полноценно к кинокомиксам или ко взрослой картине про окончательно съехавшего с катушек психопата. Да, может действие картины и происходит по вселенной DC, но при всем при этом чувствуется некая отчужденность от классической серии. Если в""Хранителях"", которые не менее мрачны, ещё чувствуется, что это вселенная DC, то в данном фильме, как я уже и сказал, не особо.Непосредственно, сам Джокер появится в конце да и то, хочется сказать, что вот, да, это тот самый Джокер, который творит просто безбашеные поступки, приходя на телевидение и заявляя, что это он убил тех парней, а в итоге и затреливает самого ведущего. Это похоже на Джокера. Но ключевое слово - похоже. Это не Джокер. Это просто психопат, который на него похож.Ах, и да. Чудесный киноляп - на моменте, когда Артур расстреливает тех трех парней в метро, он стреляет семь раз из шестизарядного револьвера. ",1
1233,"Absolute masterpiece.If you enjoy movies, you need to see this one.Awesome performance, probably the best origin story Ive ever seen.",1

1235,Obra de Arte! Sensacional! Oscar de melhor ator para Phoenix! Esse filme mudou algumas das minhas atitudes. Obrigada ao criador!,1
1236,One of the most interesting movies this year. Phoenix is fantastic. I  am not a fan of these comic-based movies generally but this is a new take entirely. Where did the critics reviews come from ??,1
1237,Simple the best film ever. Easily a top10 must watch. You can really relate to the character in this film.,1
1238,"I v been monitoring this movie from very first picture that been reveleated.For first half hour I thought, oh okay, high hopes again, + - hollywood **** than things get a interesting path and at finish I was crying, smile, laughting, and for first quite disturbed with ending when till I finally get the joke, and that this is 1. The Joker origin if you like it that way or just great movie or 2. just a narative from mad man locked in Arkham Asylum who imagined everything in his head, both of these versions are real and more or less confirmed with author and Phoenix. So how many heartbreaking, social study movies with two separate endings did you dear paid hax Journalists seen, pretty much anytime ? Oh from 59% propably a lot huh, weeb pseudo intellectuals.",1
1239,A masterpiece which describes the society we're living in and a real character with real emotions. This movie criticise a certain group of people and critics who has given low ratings for this movie are amongst them.,1
1240,C’était vraiment malade for real un très bon film. Je vais rarement au cinéma revoir le même film pourtant celui-ci me donne envi d’aller le revoir. J’ai bien aimé la morale et le côté psychopathe du joker dans ce film. Je le recommande,1
1241,"Ignore the critics trashing the movie for political reasons. This film is mindblowing and the performance by Phoenix is astonishing. One of the most powerful films I’ve ever seen. A masterpiece of filmmaking, and visually spellbinding. The pacing, score, cinematography, editing, everything, the film is nearly flawless and the message is powerful. A directing tour de force and one of the finest acting performances ever captured on screen. If this film doesn’t sweep the Oscars shame on the Academy for letting politics get in the way.",1

1246,How useless are critic reviews when they don't even come close to predicting whether an audience will enjoy a movie or even whether a film will receive major awards for outstanding performances? Critics are a remnant of the past that are just not relevant anymore.,1

1253,Brilliant film. One of the best I’ve seen in years! Very thought provoking.,1
1254,"Ignore the critics in the American media.  They have a political agenda, they don't like the directors politics so they reviewed his movie badly.  The movie is not political in the slightest.  It is a meaningful deconstruction of society and the development of mental illness.  The acting is phenomenal  and the dialogue is excellent.   It is a comic book movie for fans of Martin Scorsese.",1
1255,MASTERPIECE!!This movie is extra special because it comes out in a time where every critic is a SJW PC wannabe..~every critic that gave this movie a bad review is on-record with betraying honesty/integrity for $..,1

1264,You don't need to be comics fan to love this piece of art. One of the best movies of all time. Pure joy.,1
1265,"Joker isn't that original, but creates an unique and convinving atmosphere that totally make justice to this villian's story. It's visceral, dirty, heavy, dense and painfully sarcastic, everything that a film like this asks for.",1
1266,"Great movie, but not a masterpiece. The movie excels on telling a story about a slowly growing psychopath that gets where he is due to the society rejecting him, by showing it oppress Joker in a lot of ways that, while we don't agree at all with what he does at the end of the movie, we can't stop but feel sorry about him and even understand him a little. Speaking of the Joker, holy s*it, Joaquim Phoenix nailed on the role of the character! He managed to show us how a mentally ill man behaves without getting too much exaggerated to sound forced, he managed to give to us a brand new version of the character, which I enjoy WAY more than the original one, and it rivals with Robert Downey Jr to be the best actor to portray a comic book character until now. The direction is pretty solid, without any points where the quality of it decreases but without any highlights, and the soundtrack is really good. There are only two problems with the movie, the first being the guy that runs the television show, what he does during the movie doesn't make so much sense and it gets a bit ridiculous, I know that he is egocentric and all but that was simply way to unrealistic for me to ignore. The second one is that, despite Joaquim amazing performance, Arthur was not the most charismatic I have seen in a movie, outside of all the suffering and madness he goes through, I can't find much more character identity on him, we never saw him outside of an endless wheel of suffering that, I must admit, while good, started to get me tired on the last third of the movie. With that being said, the qualities overthrow the flaws, and the movie is really good, I just think while he performs everything very well, he excels at nothing outside Joaquim performance, and those two problems I stated previously really stop him from being a masterpiece, but he is worth your time. 8.5/10 Best DC movie.",1
1267,"Joker is a good movie that wants to think it's the film of a decade. Interesting, irreverent but still falls into the well know good vs. evil war, where things are never really full represented, but one way viewed. Essentially, joker is a film that emerged for the audience due an enormous identification with a character's resentment over others, society and the self failure he blaimes the world for. Still, can't find the subtlety the theme needs to find truth and dimension on the character construction. Again, Joker (2019) is a beautiful film that needs to understand it's nature and stop pretending to be a life changing story telling, accepting it's faults and growing on them.",1
1268,"the best film 2019! becouse actor plays this role so proffesionally.Joker is one of those rare movies that my only regret in watching it is that I can never watch it again for the first time.The film is an excellent story of origin, departs from comics, and allows you to see the psychology of the character.",1
1269,"Would you like to see something really funny? Go to the critic reviews and sort by rating. If this is exactly how would you rate them from best to completely out of touch, go see the movie.",1
1270,"As a cinephile i was blown away by this.  Joaquin Phoenix is my favourite actor for starters but this just confirmed it for me.  I'm really gobsmacked by the mediocre critics rating.  And I also understand why the movie got a prolonged standing ovation at Cannes.  I really don't like super hero movies - I agree with Scorcese on that point - and this doesn't feel like one.  I think it would be awesome for Phoenix to get the oscar, his performance is incredible.",1
1271,I like it. Watched twice. Joker is an amazing film. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is spectacular!,1
1272,One of the best movies and saddest I've ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix is really good.,1

1277,"Una de las mejores películas del año, junto con The Irishman y Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, nada más que decir. Joaquin Phoenix va directo a candidato seguro al Oscar, de lo contrario sería un robo y una verguenza.",1
1278,"my #2 movie for 2019, behind Freaks.  I normally feel lukewarm towards Joaquin Phoenix, because he usually has a narrow range (same reason I don't really care for Will Smith, The Rock, Chris Pine or Chris Evans.  The only Chris I like is Chris Pratt, he has a charming vulnerability), but here he was magnificent.  I am a sucker for 'flawed narrative', where the star has denial which colors the facts of the movie (the best example id The Sixth Sense, 2nd best is the old silent movie The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari).  The director also made the Hangover series, of which the first one is excellent (mostly due to Mike Tyson and Bradley Cooper), this puts him in a whole other league, like Scorsese light. The cinematographer also did career best work here, everything looks like its inside an aquarium with beautiful muted greens and no primary colors anywhere.  This movie grossed almost $1b, an amazing feat in the time of cgi sequels, a real testament to the character and work of everyone involved.  I really think as the internet brings a comprehension of psychology to the masses, that is really the untapped future of film. there is PT Anderson doing Jungian philosophy and very little else.",1
1279,"What a ride, i wasn't expecting this disturbing and awkward rollercoster. J. Phoenix is amazing.This is the kind of movies we will still talking about in 10 years.",1
1280,Nice,1
1281,"Joker is a bit of an odd beast in the 'comic book genre' of movies. Definitely more along the lines of Logan than any lighter material could've been. The most impressive aspect is the focus on the titular supervillan whom we meet before he becomes the icon we all know from the lore of the batverse. Phoenix shines here playing off kilter to the max with a director that makes you feel the claustrophobic journey of Authur's decent (or ascent for the character's perspective!) from neurosis to phychosis with a dash of ultraviolence to seal the deal. The only area I felt lacking was the screenplay/plot which felt quite mundane to the genre, almost to the point of being too much an imitation of life. None the less, this is a very entertaining watch and well worth your time if you like this genre.",1
1282,"I sincerely believed that the Joker character died with the legend Heath Ledger. Every attempt at the Joker character since Heath's passing has been an epic failure time and time again. So, I had my bias and skepticism of this movie beforehand. Even after watching the trailers I was still pessimistic.Well. I admit to my faults. I was very stupid to think irrationally about this movie prior to watching it. The Joker blew all of my expectations away. I watched it three times in theater, and four times so far after purchasing the movie on Amazon. To be honest, I am probably going to watch it again within the week.In addition, the Joker shines light on how Hollywood has lost its way (just like Gotham :)). Contemporary movies lack all of the essentials of a good movie whereas the Joker capitalizes and delivers on those lost arts. The plot, settings, characters, theme, conflict all work so well off of each other - ""perfectly balanced, as all things should be.""Lastly, I always believed that Joaquin Phoenix is a talented actor. After watching his role in Joker, I have a new found level of respect for the guy. Holy moly can he act. He deserves nothing but the best. And, we cannot forget about the man who made this possible, Todd Philips. His level of skill for movie production and quality is uncontested. Hats off good sir.Joker is incredible. Even that is an understatement. Go watch it!",1
1283,"You probably need to go into this without the ‘Batman’ baggage although there are some nods directed to the world that bore him. The true beauty of this film is as an allegory of the societal treatment of the ‘have nots’ who can only have so much taken from them before they have nothing to lose. Superb performances and directing make this descent into madness seem unsettlingly rational.    If you’re looking for light action you will not enjoy this film - it’s dark, and many will find it slow. But for those who can appreciate, and are not afraid of tension and discomfort as tools of cinematography, may find a poignancy and depth that make this film stand out.",1
1284,"This is the only film that I’ve ever seen that left me speechless. The acting is amazing, the score is excellent, the story is engaging, the directing is solid, the Joker’s design is perfect, etc. Everything about this movie is PERFECT!!",1
1285,"In combination with a powerful script and amazing acting, Joaquin Phoenix turns out to be one of the best comic book films that is not suitable for everyone",1
1286,"Great cinematography, beautifully shot and directed, good color-grading and a lot of love went into this film... But the story feels empty and just dragging along. This could have been a great short-film. There could have been a bit more development in character or story. And they could have just let go of the whole Batman Universe, it doesn't add anything special...  It's not a movie I would watch a second time.",1
1287,"This movie makes the whole Oscar **** obsolete, only for critic awards to be save by the Golden Globe. The Joker, alongside Midsommar and maybe Parasite, are by far the very best movies of the year and it's good for once that there is no hesitation.",1
1288,"Фильм хороший, но не идеальный. Так сюжет самой картины достоин уважения, актерская игра Хоакина Феникса превосходная, и по моему мнению превышает игру Леонардо Ди Каприо. В общем сюжет картины превосходен, но в реализации чувствуется небольшой бюджет, и из за этого имеются касяки в самом фильме: в моменте когда Феникс выходит на сцену в облике джокера, выбрасывая сигарету, видно как за кулисами один из людей съемочной группы убирает данную сигарету. Касяк был в стабилизации камеры: в некоторых моментах было поддергивание камеры. Касяк в пулевых ранениях: когда Феникс кого то убивал, то сзади жертвы вылетала кровь, но этого не могло быть, тк пистолет из которого убивали не мог сделать сквозное пулевое отверстие. Но все технические касяки не портят картину.",1
1289,"This is sort of a prequel to the crazy Joker we know. I don’t think this can be considered Canon, because the Joker origin story is a bit of a mystery. I’d recommend seeing King of Comedy first, because it feels somewhat connected.  It is a slow physiological drama. The last half hour is when the movie got interesting with the pace picking up. An excellent job of showing how mental health is so important to control  The movie may appear better with a part 2 showing the evolution as the mad Joker we are familiar with.",1
1290,"Um dos melhores filmes que eu assisti na minha vida,vale muito apena assistir",1
1291,"Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) está lutando para encontrar seu caminho na sociedade fraturada de Gotham. Palhaço de aluguel durante o dia, ele aspira ser um gibi de stand-up à noite ... mas acha que a piada sempre parece estar nele. Preso em uma existência cíclica entre apatia e crueldade, Arthur toma uma decisão ruim que provoca uma reação em cadeia de eventos crescente.",1
1292,Definitely the best movie of 2019 so far. Excellent very well-acted and very engaging,1
1293,Absolutely excellent. I never give a movie over an 9 except for Scarface and The Gentlemen. Tickled all my tastes.,1
1294,A masterpiece. I think it's great that we had a chance to see Gotham from the point of view of a villain who's just ridiculously insane.,1
1295,"Es una OBRA MAESTRA, no hay otra forma de describir está pieza del séptimo arte, realmente buenísima",1
1296,It felt so real. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Better than the cheesy movies of MCU and DCEU,1
1297,"Отличный сюжет с кучей отсылок и аллегорий на реальные проблемы общества уже делают этому фильму отличную оценку, а так если без лишней воды то просто 10/10.",1
1298,Best movie of the year. The Joaquin Phoenix perfomance is stunning. Masterpiece,1
1299,"Last decade DC has shown that some directors really ruin some legends, but 2k19 showed us this amazing, well written movie. Heath ledger's performance as the joker was in my opinion better. But Joaquin Phoenix gave us another great joker performance. He cleary showed Jared Letto that joker isn't just a character that anyone can play. The movie itself, is a masterpiece. Every performance in it is played so well. I also like how society reacts on the riots that happaned because of three killed people. Amazing! It begins with the sad life of Arthur Morgan, after the murder at the subway it begins to be a dramatic origin of the joker.",1
1300,Joaquin phoenix's performance is amazing but the film itself is a bit messy and some odd choices overall its a solid film with a good main performance,1
1301,"What makes a good movie? For me it’s one that tells a story, makes you want to keep watching, evokes emotion, makes you forget you are merely watching actors on a set interpreting a script. The joker did all this for me.A fly on the wall you watch as a man tries to keep it together, with a brutal childhood he holds on to the only nice reassuring sentence ever spoken to him. That his existence was to make people laugh & be happy. With this idea in mind & Band-Aid fix medication a schizophrenic suicidal maniac courageously keeps it together & but it’s not enough. The world in all its selfish cruelty coupled with his disability hindering his mission, the very idea of himself is chipped away.  Slowly the Band-Aid comes off and with the right amount of cruelty he is pushed over the edge with deadly release.  You watch on as a monster emerges in front of your eyes. He sheds the past memories & his old skin, off the leash not caring if he lives or dies. Do you like him? No, but can you hate him? Finally accepted with the open arms of Gotham’s downtrodden he learns his true purpose. To entertain though misery & chaos. Well cast, acted & directed mature depiction of the Joker. Was the director trying to make a statement on the real world about nature of nature & victim blaming? Who knows it’s irrelevant because all that matters is the Joker’s reality as we sit back and watch his story emerge not yours.",1
1302,What the Way to show and feel this evolution and transition the Soul of human ، its not specific DC character ، Joker is US ...,1
1303,"Being a fan of the Dark knight and Killing Joke comics this is the Joker story that I was waiting for. It was disturbing and kept me on the edge of my seat. Not normally a fan of Todd Phillips but this was knocked out of the park by him and Joaquin. Fitting that deniro was in it, seeing the similarities to taxi driver.",1
1304,"It was a pleasant surprise, I didn't expect to love it so much, Phoenix is an amazing actor!",1
1305,"Good performance of main actor, interesting story about mental illness and the birth of a madman.",1
1306,not bad not bad not bad not bad not bad not bad not bad not bad not bad not bad,1
1307,This is a great movie which tells us in a more realistic way the character of the Joker today where comic-based movies depend on CGI. This movie shows us that no special effects or fictional stories are needed to tell the story of a villain as is the joker this movie is a masterpiece,1
1308,Great movie. Dark. Couldn’t turn away. Phoenix never disappoints. Ready for a sequel,1
1309,De um filme que não parecia ter razão para existir para um filme excelente. Transcende a bolha dos fás de quadrinhos e entrega um conteúdo bem bacana de ser consumido e debatido por semanas. Um dos melhores filmes de 2019.,1
1310,Quando eu saí do cinema eu não sabia exatamente o que dizer sobre o filme por me faltarem palavras.,1
1311,"Buena, pero algo sobrevalorada solo por llamarse JOKER, un guion con mula profundidad que se basó demasiado en 2 peliculas de Martin scorsesse",1
1312,Ахуенный фильм от dc наконецто про джокера выпустили фильм и он ахуенный и я ебал всех метокритиков,1
1313,Uma suculenta melancia no meio dos tão comuns filmes baseados em quadrinhos,1
1314,"Один из лучших фильмов по комиксам после Тёмного Рыцаря. Сюжет, операторская работа, звук, всё на высоте.",1
1315,"Wow, I was thinking it would be good but I was wrong, it is amazing. This film is a must-watch!  It is a nice break from the action-packed hero stuff we've gotten used to and I'd rewatch this in a heartbeat. Weird how we had something amazing and different with Joker, then shortly after, something as bad as the batgirl series.",1
1316,"I like the movie so much, I don't know, Is it because I was depressed and weak to or whatever. I was satisfied with the end of the movie it, and phoenix was Excell in this role.",1
1317,"Ignore the negative reviews.'Joker' predictably alienates soft, cowardly critics and viewers who are too politically-obtuse and morally irresponsible to acknowledge the atomic force and brutal truth of the ugly, devastating dilemma that is wrought out to perfection by Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips. Of the two I've spoken to that walked out halfway through the film, both are delusionally cynical, falsely optimistic people who are excruciating to deal with, so devoid of genuine humanism they are.And that's the point. The critics who insult this film with their offensively ignorant and dismissive reviews are the morally aloof, narcissistic tunnel-visionists who refuse to accept that their failure to acknowledge and grasp the pain and suffering of the most unfortunate and abused members of society is precisely what turns the Arthur Flecks of this world into Jokers. This film puts them on trial, and the verdict is guilty.Beautiful, haunting, and unforgettable, Joker offers a rare glimpse into how and why a heart can sink into darkness. Phoenix's brilliant, selfless performance fills that space in the shadow cast by the nearsighted, villainous Ayn Rands of this world, the ones who fail to offer compassion and understanding to those who need it most.This is the desperately necessary, bloody-brush-stroked 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' that sensitive, disgusted millennials have been waiting for. It's a hymn of outrage in a time of political despair and tyranny of truth, and it's the best picture of 2019.",1
1318,"This movie it’s perfect. A masterpiece, film of the decade! It’s all perfect. 100/10",1
1319,"Joker is the latest film to illustrate the disparity between audience and critic scores. Some criticized that the film portrayed him as a sympathetic character. They warned about the social and political repercussions for doing so in today's society. While there are certain parallels that can be drawn with regards to the treatment of mental illness and other issues? Arthur Fleck / Joker is a violent character. We are never asked/expected to forgive Arthur/The Joker for his actions. The film is able to walk that line (pun not intended) between offering a commentary on our own society and that of portraying a notorious maniac that has endured as one of the best foils and villains in pop culture to date. In fact it's a testament to how well executed this film is that you only are given the slightest connection to the greater Batman canon. Joker has always been more compelling as a psychological villain and we see that transformation unfold on screen. Due to Phoenix's excellent performance the film stands on it's own as one of the best adaptations of a comic book character. Whether you prefer Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger or Joqauin Phoenix? Each actor has offered their own take on the devious clown prince of crime and they all still are fantastic in their own right.",1
1320,"Unexpecdetly ,this film from director ,who directed only comedy-films,is great.Of course,it has some disadvantages,but in general,it`s good movie.Undoubtedly ,Joaquin is one of the greatest actors now and he proved it again  in this film.",1
1321,The best part of the film was where I was judging Joaquin Phoenix for not being 'together'. I know a lot of mentally ill people and I judge them too harshly... not that their mental health excuses them for saying/doing mean things but I could always be more compassionate.,1
1322,"“Joker” is a thought-provoking despite depressing movie. Joaquin Phoenix’s acting fitted surprisingly well with the character, giving the film one last touch of what turned out to be a wonderful movie about a serious subject that not everyone seem to understand.",1
1323,"Joker is one of those good rare movies that you won't find easily these days. The acting was incredible, the story, the cinematography, the score, everything was perfect. It was dark, yet so beautiful. Among many other boring superhero movies with overused CGI, SJW agendas, and cringe jokes, finally, Joker was exactly the movie we needed and we deserved today.",1
1324,"Everyone knows about the hyperbole sorrounding this movie, it's either the worst thing ever or the greatest masterpeice. In my opinion having actually watched the movie, is that Joker is a great movie and Wakeen Phoenix played his role wonderfully. Turning comic book story about a clown criminal into a movie with some substance and worth watching is difficult, especially of a character that already has multiple popular interpretations. That said, it's not like it's the best thing that's ever happened since sliced bread.",1
1325,luxusně natočený zahraný film :) je to náhodný slet událostí které zrodí zabijáka který se mstí.pár drastických scén a je složitější na pochopení. těším se na pokračování,1
1326,"Joaquin Phoenix's acting is obviously the center of the movie as the plot revolves around the slow paced decay of Arthur (a.k.a. Joker) mixed with the acceptance of himself. you can't really predict where the movie is going to take you, but that's the point. There's no hero and villain, this is not a standard comic book movie as it's closer in ""style"" to Birdman than to The Dark Knight. The idea here is to build a character, is to give a reason and an explanation to the mysteriousness of the Joker's past.The role of the joker is one the most serious (pum kind of intended) nowadays and requires a lot of dedication from the actor as well as the writers and directors (otherwise you get Suicide Squad Joker) as you need to feel in the shoes of Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson and although I don't believe Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is the best here, he did his research and really commited to the role and the result was so good that it's worth being mentioned alongside these names.Joker is not a perfect masterpiece, but it's worth every Oscar nomination it got, especially for best actor. I definitely recommend watching this movie.",1
1327,"Despite Phoenix's huge performance that deserves an oscar ,the film hasn't anything more to give.",1
1328,"Film tout simplement magnifique, une énorme performance d'acteur, ce film mérite tout simplement un oscar",1
1329,"To put it plainly, this feels like a masterpiece but it isn't really yet still it moves like one. To have a movie about a character in a comic book world portray a message so important in the real world and almost necessary makes this somewhat A- yet masterfully directed and acted movie a masterpiece. 10 out of 10 for me and I will dare again and call it a masterpiece. Its view may scar you but more so it will make you wonder how much possible it is.",1
1330,"Esse filme, ele faz com que nos sintamos uma dó do personagem, e aos poucos mostra como o Coringa se torna um monstro e destrata muito bem a nossa sociedade",1
1331,"There will be inevitable comparisons between Heath Ledger’s Joker in 2008’s “The Dark Knight” for which he won a thoroughly deserved posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and Joaquin Phoenix’ interpretation in 2019’s “Joker”. They however differ in their raison d’être. Ledger’s Joker was already a villain and showed up as Batman’s formidable foe, and did he show up. Phoenix’ Joker on the other hand gives the origin story, key word ""story"", of how Arthur Fleck came to be Joker. What makes this movie worth watching is Phoenix’ performance which is nothing short of a tour de force, based on a well-crafted story. Granted, there is violence in the movie, some of which may be over-the-top but it is in no way gratuitous because it makes up an important element of the story.",1
1332,"I have watched 3 times since release. And created an account just to submit this review. Joker is a phenomenal performance, from ever single actor in the movie. Perfect direction as well, every scene is well thought out, and integral to the plot of the movie. This movie is not boring and does not drag out as other reviews have stated. Every scene has a purpose, and is perfectly executed. Joker is undoubtedly the best movie of 2019. Now in my top 10 favorite movies.",1
1333,"One of the best, if not the best movie I have ever seen.I would argue, that it even improves upon the origin story of Batman.I hope for a decent sequel.",1
1334,My favorite film. The best of my life. I think this film make me so happy!!,1
1335,You’ll be emotionally drenched after watching this.. Amazong.. Absolutely amazing,1
1336,The joke is on us and most won't get it. Sublime from beginning to end. Would be a 10 aave for the script losing itself in places and perhaps leans too heavily on Taxi Driver / Outsider movies.,1
1337,This film is just extraordinary at every level Joaquins performance is absolutely incredible He deserved the oscar.,1
1338,"Great film about great Gamer. Yeah, theain character doesn't really resemble Ledger's Joker until the very end, but as for me - that's for good. Very powerful OST, excellent acting of Joaquin. Pace of film has its problems, but it's not critical. SHUE PPSH!",1
1339,Saw this in theatres. You could switch the name of this movie to Arthur and it wouldn’t change anything about how lacking this movie was of anything to do with DC’s Joker villain. It was a story about a villain who excelled at one thing and that was to COMPLAIN. The character was absent of the ingenuity and dark cunning that are the fundamental characteristics that make its famous anti-hero the Joker. The characters story is all nearly encased in the typical socialist narrative to appeal to modern popular ideology. I don’t know what this movie was but if you are looking to enjoy the cunning genius shared by the greats like Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill you won’t find it in this movie. Just an empty prettied up nobody with flashy dance moves and a running mouth.,0
1340,"This is a must-watch! Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Joker. At first, I was skeptical but he might be the best Joker yet!",1
1341,"Es una buena pelicula, no se dejen llevar por algunos críticos de cine que lo que hacen es quejarse y hecharle agua sucia. Hay que verla interiorizando al personaje y de alguna manera entenderlo y como es que se va transformando en el Joker!",1
1342,His laugh is (literally) his cry for help and yet no one hears. Arthur flack struggles with serious mental illness and the Joker is born. The ties to reality are striking and it speaks to many current woes in society. Bringing an understanding to mental illness is the movies forte. It is a masterpiece.,1
1343,Epic movie about mental health. It's a movie where you feel sorry about ppl being bullied,1
1345,Great movie. Many of the reviews are riddled with hyperbole about real violence instead of enjoying an adult comic movie.,1
1347,"havent seen worst joker then this one. The creators neglected his cleverness, dangerous and other things. I hoped to see how a guy will become the most dangerous criminal in Gotham. but what i've seen. Some guy with laugh disorder kills few people and gets to madhouse beacause of because of resentment of surrounding world. Just weak guy. yeah there's a story but you've forgotten who joker is!!! I'd prefer 10th time rewatch Dark Knight instead of this long story of nothing which make me feel sorry for main charachter... This is not Joker.",0
1350,Masterpiece 10/10Joaquin Phoenix really deserve Oscar for this role.He is the joker,1
1351,Good jfjfnwisndndkwnd d jdbsjbwnwjdlsksdjdndidndndnsindndndnsnsjansjsbfndndldmdkdldl,1
1352,"This takes the idea of darker, gritter, 'more realistic' version of DC characters that we saw with the with the Christopher Nolan Batman movies to a pointless extreme.  ""Joker"" strips everything away from what makes this character the Joker, and leaves nothing but a mentally unstable and angry person from which to make a movie about. If this move wasn't titled Joker you would never even know it's about Batman's nemesis. Boring, Over indulgent, pretentious.  A single actor cant save this movie.",0
1353,"This is one rare case when I mostly agree with critics. Unfortunately I found this movie quite dull and artificial. Sure Batman movies are all fairy-tail type of stories, but we know that and that what it makes the story special. Joker is pretending to be real story which is dark and unpleasant to see most of the time.",0
1354,"Except for Phoenix's actuation and the responsibility of DC and Warner Bros. to bring us a good movie (cinematographic quality), this is garbage. I totally agree with the review of The New York Times: it's incoherence and violence for free.",0
1355,"I am sick and tired of people praising this garbage film. It's just Taxi Driver and Kings of Comedy frankensteined together. This is the Joker, we should not feel bad for the Joker, this was a chance for DC to make a real villain focused movie where we truly see a mans fall to madness. This guy is a whiny loser who doesn't like people being mean to him. The score is not good, it's obnoxious. The dance scenes are so on the nose with its oscar baiting that it's embarrassing. How about make Phoenix do some real blood curdling acting to win an oscar, but nope, we need dance sequences. Todd Philips made a mediocre, boring film that only succeeded because it had the greatest comic villains name on it. Shame on people for calling this quality when all it is, is recycled stories from great filmmakers who had to actually work for their classics.",0
1356,As you now we do not now any thing about the history of 'joker' in comic books and this movie tell us about it in its way.BEST movie that I have ever seen after interstellar.❤,1
1357,"Amazing, simply the best movie ive seen in the past 5 years. Immediately going to get tickets to see again. The way he inspires the people of gotham at the end was chilling.",1
1358,"Definitely a movie of the year. A masterpiece, a perfectly crafted story and characters.It has no flaws. Top performance from Joaquin Phoenix.Even with my 4 hours of sleep i just couldn't blink at all, the movie keeps you on the edge the whole runtime.And about the score of the movie, for a long time i've not heard this much emotional sound and perfectly fitting one for a character like Arthur Fleck.One of the best DC movies ever. That's all. Watch it!",1
1359,"Joker is the darkest movie I've ever seen since Taxi Driver. A very cohesive story with a brilliant direction and score. Joaquin Phoenix is a living God portraying one of the best performances of his entire career among The Master, with an oscar-worthy role for the best actor in this era, period.",1
1360,"This movie is awesome, shocking and brilliant. Phoenix deserves an Oscar, he's pure talent",1
1361,"When the movie end, most of people in cinema were disappointed, they were expect to see the smartest evil character with his amazing tricks that we had watched before in previous Joker performed by the legend Heath Ledger in ""Dark Knight"", but unfortunately we just see a stupid psycho character, besides that the Joker looks old while Bruce Wayne child !! how they will face each other in future !? I think until Bruce become a Batman the Joker will be died at this time.The performance of Joaquin was amazing with no doubts, also the pictures was stunning and remind us of the masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"".Finally, the movie is worth to watch, but If Christopher Nolan direct or write ""Joker"", I think we would watch a masterpiece.",1
1362,"Лучший фильм который я видел, мы с Fo4ix в восторге!!!The best movie I've seen, Fo4ix and I are thrilled!!!",1
1363,"Definitely one of the best and most expressive Joaquin Phoenix performances. it has a fantastic  art direction and color pallet and immersive soundtrack. Storywise, the plot is simple but set up perfectly by the social critic it carries. There are some minor flaws, but they're bearable.",1
1364,"Настоящее произведение, саундтрек к фильму цепляет и не отпускает до самого конца, актёрская игра на уровне маэстро, Хоакин Феникс серьёзно постарался чтобы вжиться в эту роль: состояние Джокера можно понять как по диалогам, так и по движениям актёра. Фильм всё время держит в напряжении, он изобилует как в меру кровавыми сценами, так и душещипательными моментами. Мы с ivanbaikin23 оценили фильм, действительно шедеврально",1
1365,Not for the faint of heart. Beautiful unique take on comic books movies of the descent into madness of a comic book villain. I can't stand Marvel movies but this movie was not like those at all and thats maybe what I loved about it. Loved it,1
1366,"I just saw a movie about a villain that I have always imagined and remembered from the comics and finally, they showed THAT Joker on a big screen. Movie is like Killing Joke theys show you the story but there is a catch. This sounds weird, but it feels like I'm making a dream dish and more than I but thought on it, taste becomes more delicious. The score is haunting and beautiful, acting is wonderful, themes are sad and dark but real, camera work is beautiful and there were many scenes that made me want to but them on my walls as a poster. Thank you WB and DC, right now this is my top 2019 movie.",1
1367,It is a masterpiece! It gets you to think about deep issues in society today. The acting is excellent.,1
1368,Fantastic performance by Mr.Phoenixe.  Fantastic movie.  Best movie of the year.,1
1369,"I simply can't say anything bad about this movie. There wasn't a second where I was bored. There wasn't a second where I didn't believe. There was no stupid out of nowhere joke moments, there was no unnecessary action. This film is very well paced, very well shot and has a damn good acting. The story is strong and captivating, descend into madness step by step. Truly a masterpiece, exactly what I want to see from DC.",1
1370,"Excelente adaptación, muy bien construida y explica con detalle y “justificadamente” cómo llegó a ser el Joker",1
1371,"Best movie of 2019 by far, dc should keep making this kind of movies and not the same crap like marvel.",1
1372,"Joaquin Phoenix gave one one of the most painful and hard to watch performances in film history. He is completely vulnerable, intense and brutally brilliant to the very core.",1
1373,This may be the absolutely perfect movie! Only The Shawshank Redemption is a better for me,1
1374,"This is a great movie y'all. Not a crowd pleaser, not easy to watch, but authentic and almost too real. Phoenix is superb. The director gets a lot of credit here for sticking to his vision, not even a tiny bit playing to the crowd.This is like a memoir come to life on film. Highly recommended.",1
1375,"Uma obra polêmica, que faz jus à todos os murmúrios conquistados, Phoenix entrega uma atuação assustadora e incrivelmente realista, em um estudo de personagem, que abre debate para todo tipo de assunto sobre a sociedade atual é as consequências da podridão humana. Inquietante, visceral, violento e magnífico, uma obra-prima",1
1376,Colossal movie. Astonishing. The best thing i've ever seen un a movie theatre,1
1377,"The movie is awesome and Joaquin Phoenix is incredible! One of the best, if not the best, comic book movie of all time.",1
1378,What a movie. No words. Masterpiece and one of the most thought provoking films of the last decade.,1
1379,"The movie I NEEDED to watch, i've been done with the Marvel / DC superheroes (could watch Wonder Woman 2 though) for the longest time. Joaquin Phoenix DOES deserve to at the bare minimum be nominated to an Oscar (which most likely wont seeing as it's an insider's event).All the woke journalists giving it a 0~4 are too high on themselves, just on the acting alone (everything else being c**p) the minimum it deserves is a 5, and that's low-balling it",1
1380,Amazing. Can't wait to see it again. The way that they structured the film was absolutely flawless.,1
1381,Brilliant experience in the cinema and would definitely recommend to everyone!,1
1382,"Joaquin Phoenix is just amazing ! He deserves at least an Oscar nomination ! All the movie is great, the story, the soundtrack, the direction, everything is amazing in this movie !",1
1383,"Кино с большой буквы. Рекомендую всем его посмотреть, это событие года.",1
1384,"Brilliant. At once, real grown cinema related with comics. Epic efforts of all team: director, operator, sound-man.. every frame is genius and work of Fenix - that is beyond human possibilities. I am so glad I’ve seen this in the theater just in the day of release. Brilliant.",1
1385,OSCAR. This is real art. This film is exactly what an adult comic book film should be.,1
1386,"Great performance of J.Phoenix, one of best that he did until today. In fact this movie summarize about it. Joker story's that everyone knows, and this time's not different....only thing that's is unusual of his story's that this time's more realistic and dramactic than another times. its ok too, 'cause shows the joker mental issues and what driven him to did all those creepy things.So, this a 'must see' movie, and J. Phoenix was splendid!",1
1387,pretty nice like nice nice nice nice nice nice nice mhm yes nice yed mhm byes yes yea ye mhm ayup yhup ayup,1
1388,10/10 deserves nothing less. Not sure why it has such a low rating from critics. They obviously have no idea,1
1389,Very strong movie. The best I've seen in years. Relevant.Powerful.    Art.,1
1390,"10/10 masterpiece. The critical are too fearful of PC culture and the rating discrepancy between viewers and critics is the clear evidence anyone needs. The film is dark in the best way possible. The acting is phenomenal, the art direction and filming is mind blowing, the violence is sudden a d makes your uncomfortable",1
1391,"Suck my balls sjw bastrads, go away into your cave from where they got out!",1
1392,I really loved it. ,1
1393,"I never made a review, but this movie deserve it... I cant understand the ""professional critics"", to be honest.",1
1394,Joaquin Pheonix gave a career best performance but Screenplay and story took away that Masterpiece crown from this film. It's Excellent but not Masterpiece. Acting - 5/5Direction - 4/5BGM - 4/5Screenplay - 3/5Story - 3/5,1
1395,"Despite the score from the critic reviews, I feel as this movie was a masterpiece. I’ve had the opportunity to watch it twice now, which if you haven’t, you should. Todd Phillips did an outstanding job directing this film, to my surprise. I watched a video where he said that he had the musical composer read the screenplay and make the music based off of that alone. Phillips then made the scenes with the influence from the music, letting the acting and the tone to go with it as well. Genius. Don’t even get me started on Joaquin Phoenix’s performance. Phenomenal. He is so enticing and believable when he plays Arthur Fleck, from his walking/ mannerisms to the way he laughs. One big thing of previous actors who have portrayed the Joker is to have their own flavor when it comes the “Joker’s laugh”. Joaquin took a more natural and painful laugh with Arthur having Pseudo-bulbar Affect and not being able to control his laughter, even in awkward situations. The fact you can see the pain in his eyes even when he’s uncontrollably laughing just shows how outstanding of an actor Joaquin is. Even though Arthur gets most of the screen time in a movie about him (lol), all the other side characters still feel extremely real. One thing that I’ve come to appreciate a lot about this film and about Todd Phillips, is that it’s not afraid to make you uncomfortable. It makes you question if it’s alright to have sympathy for a psychopath. It shows what can happen when the government and others choose to ignore the mentally ill, and just think nothing of those that it affects. Overall an outstanding movie, I suggest anyone that hasn’t seen it in theaters yet to go watch it! I know I’ll go a few more times!",1
1396,Amazing! One of the best movies I've seen in my life. Everyman should watch it.,1
1397,"O filme mais criativo do ano! Gostei muito do fato o enredo não é tão absurdo, e sim muito realista!  O Coringa pode sim existir na nossa sociedade atual.",1
1398,"it's very telling that the user score, people like us, rates this movie highly - and yet companies like The New Yorker, The Wallstreet Journal, Time magazine, have given it a 2/10.",1
1399,"Joker was a fantastic movie. I honestly have no idea why the critics gave it such low scores but as you can see the general audience loved it, myself included. This movie is dark, carnal, and psychopathic. Joker plays the role as an antagonistic hero. You want to root for him, but his actions strongly disagree. This is not a feel good movie but a well done and thought provoking movie. Recommended to the right audience who can handle (strong bloody violent scenes with disturbing behavior) and appreciate it (great acting, cinematography, and a well done soundtrack).",1
1400,How is this Movie getting 58% on Metacritic ???Every review I see on Metacritic is positive mostly 10/10This movie was perfect.,1
1401,"Once again these ""civilized"" reviewers pushing their SJW narrative on ""how violent this is, depressing"" blah blah blah .This movie is not a monster, it's just ahead of the curve.",1
1402,"Joker is... amazing. This film is a stand alone film for the clown prince of crime & it's just great. The visuals, the acting from J. Phoenix's performance to just the dark humor & how it tackles Mental Illness while still being a DC  movie. Yes, it has some violence but Deadpool 2 is worse. So yeah the only negative is pacing. - Bryce C.  Harrington",1
1403,"An excellent and amazing movie, I could end up here, but this movie is something so complex and with such a deep level of history that goes beyond: simply Joaquin Phoenix played the best Joker we have ever seen on Cinema screens (My opinion), he simply took the whole essence of the character, after going through a lot of terrible situations, a man already full of life's troubles, creates a sociopathic or psychopathic personality (call it what you want) and starts killing people and creates chaos in the city, this is Arthur Fleck or ""Joker"".In my opinion, this is the best movie of a villain ever made in history that hardly another will surpass.",1
1404,"good job todd philips, its a good movie, this movie goes to oscar and got a medal",1
1405,"Personally, I love how believable this film is. From Phoenix's acting to the disturbed world of Gotham, this really depicts a stunning and entertaining conflict of man Vs the world. Don't let Sjws politics take away the dignity this film deserves, that's why I'm giving it a ten,. So it counteracts all those political reviewers. In reality I would probably give it an 8/10",1
1406,"One excellent movie, I recommend obvious for people with more eighteen years old",1
1407,Everything in this movie mattered and it rewards you for watching. An absolute must see,1
1408,"This Movie is not the best Movie of the Year, no. Its best Movie of the whole Last Decade....And naturally Joaquin Phoenix should recieve an Oscar. This Movie will be a ""MUST SEE""...",1
1409,"Very dark and disturbing in the batman tradition, but very well done.  J. Phoenix gives an award winning performance and is some of the best acting on film.",1
1410,"I'm not good at English, but as for me the best part of this movie is acting. Joaquin moves, his voice and of course his look, i had goosebumps when have seen him at first time.",1
1411,"Joker is a film that grabs you and never lets go. Phoenix should win easily with his creepy and mesmerizing portrayal of the disturbed Joker, from which all other Jokers before and after— will be judged against. Hard to believe this incredible film was directed by the same director of the Hangover! But Philips has not trouble sinking his teeth into this dark and distributing subject matter that will have you thinking and talking about it, long after the final scene.It's too bad film critics cannot separate their own political views from honestly reviewing the film on its own merits. I understood film critics were supposed to be professional. Over the years I have seen that they as a community that is more a group of individuals who can be bought, swayed and do not always give their true opinion regarding the films they review. So now i tend to turn to the audience, like Cinemascore and fans ratings, rather than film critics. They are losing their value and worth. Much like award ceremonies today.",1
1412,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.!!!!!!!!!!.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
1414,The best movie of 2019. I loved the movie the actor the best performance and Joaquin desires the Oscar without doubt,1
1418,One of the best movies I have ever seen.. and that's really saying something for me.,1
1420,An instant classic. One of the best films ever made. Dont listen to the woke crowd they dont know what art is.,1
1421,"The best acting I’ve ever seen. With Joaquins performance, its a movie with emotion. Audience rating should be taken more seriously.",1
1422,This is the best movie I've ever been on and all negative opinions are written by 9yo marvel fanboys or stupid feminists.,1
1424,"The Joker is my favorite cartoon character, but this movie doesn't do him justice. It doesn't feel like it's about the actual Joker, it's more like it was made by people who don't understand Joker and never read the actual comics. They wanted to make something for a mainstream audience. So they cast some old actor who was terrible for the role and tried to make the Joker something he never was. They should have cast Jared Leto, who had already proven himsef as the perfect Joker. But Leto probably read the script and noped out. Can't really blame him..",0
1425,"The film, in a nutshell, shows what people are as a society. Its a cheap trick. Phoenix's ridiculous overacting lets people see depth that doesnt exist. People watch the film thinking iits about some madman dancing to music created by pedophile gary glitter.... its simply a cash grab. Looking for depth of a character with a ridiculous laugh..... and attempting to call iself ""deep"".This is definately a movie for 2019......where so many sheep exist.... but for some reason, see themselves as ""individual thinkers""... This is absolutely a terrible film..... Its a shame so many people fell for its indoctrination",0
1426,"A waste of my time. I expected a movie about a supervillain with warped ideas about society that loves trolling everyone, you know, something more akin to the actual Joker. Instead I got a movie about an insane beta-male nobody that has no existential purpose and therefore has nothing to lose when he decides to level up and become a homicidal insane beta-male nobody.",0
1429,"This film is a malignant tumor on the collective psyche of society. I left the film feeling violated and disgusted. The only message this film sends is that the world is cold, cruel and uncaring and everyone in it is TERRIBLE. The plot is poorly constructed, the characters (ALL without exception) are flat, two dimensional and amoral. The rich are all insensitive pigs, and the poor are filthy, violent anarchists. No one has to take responsibility for their actions, because everyone else is to blame. The mental illness is poorly developed, he's supposed to be a vulnerable narcissist with some variation of tourette's, but instead he portrays as a schizophrenic with flat effect. Joaquin in this film has none of the Joker's infamous charisma or confidence. Instead he's portrayed as pathetic, grotesque and detestable. Furthermore, in this film the Joker is mentally, developmentally challenged, none of the Joker's ingenuity or wit. The whole film translates as a sob story told by a creatively challenged man. Maybe this whole film was supposed to be a sob story told to the psychiatrist, that would make it slightly less awful than it is. But not by a lot. This film is emotionally, narratively and cinematically flat.",0
1430,We truly live in a society when killing people as a good looking man (John Wick) is praised but as an unattractive sad incel you are a terrorist. Rise up.,1

1434,My favourite movie. It's just awesome and I really don't care what the critics say.,1
1435,"It is a very good film. It is actually art, it creates beauty, not just entertainment. Right after the first scene, it made me think of the opening scenes in (Tarkovsky's) Andrei Rublev where the town jester  succombs to melancholy (and the Tartar horde) amid the utter despair of the Russian folks. The Joker is the face of human spirit resisting and subliming nihilism, just like Rublev's bellboy is, despite having to go very different routes.Phoenix is phenomenal. He makes De Niro's acting look wooden and, simply, bad, in the only weak scene of the film.  So-called professional critics should take a good look in the mirror to see if they have the same courage to face the truth the Joker reveals about all of us.",1
1436,"Joaquin Phoenix did a stellar job conveying crazy, but the weak & predictable writing disabled my ability to suspend disbelief as the movie slogged through the same formula ad nauseam. A series of unfortunate events and the resulting heavy handed depiction of ""crazy"" got dull fast, leading up to an ending that made little sense in the context of the first half of this film. Would not watch again.",0
1442,Too much violence. Movies with super villains  are supposed to be to be family friendly ,1
1446,"A miss understood of batman world. Welcome joker to real world!!! He is a modrate director with money hungry. If he was making a film, it would be so...",0
1447,"It’s not that good, wish it was better. Script was weak and dialogue was cliche",0
1448,"If you are looking at this film as an extreme warning against ignoring the struggles of everyday life and of ignoring struggles of people with mental disabilities then congratulations.As a film, as a piece of art meant to entertain, this was a joke. Pun completely intended.The joker some how manages to be as boring as a movie as it is twisted. Even the darkest parts of the film fall flat because of its sedated pace. Even if you are trying to make a statement, your film still has to be good. You don’t get a pass on being entertaining for the sake of having a message. I know pretentious people will claim the movie was entertaining in an attempt to be deep. The only person who could genuinely like this film is Joaquin Phoenix playing Arthur Fleck playing Arthur Fleck. I would say people struggling to find someway to like this movie is a whole lot more dangerous than monotony.As as a score I give this a slow shot to the head full of regret. More valuable than the price of the ticket, is the time spent watching this movie and the several hours wondering why, how this could ever be made. I will never get back the time i’ve wasted back but hey “that’s life.”",0
1450,"This movie is not as original as people are claiming, there have been a number of films like it which are much better most notably Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy. I'm assuming most of the people claiming this to be the best film ever have seen little more than comic book superhero movies and big-budget popular film series, therefore I understand why this film may seem different but hopefully, this allows these people to see more films and realize how good the art of filmmaking can be .",0
1452,"Joaquin Phoenix was the only good thing about this movie. Poor writing, awful directing and a god awful ending that feels like it’s written & directed by a 13 year old on his fifth Red Bull. The two clear conclusions I came to after watching this flick are that Joaquin Phoenix can give a solid performance in just about anything and that Todd Phillips is definitely NOT a good director.",0
1454,"i donot love nolan movies , but after see the joker movie , now i am nolan fan ,joker its so bad. todd philips just normal director in hangover genre",0

1457,"If I was the Joker, I'd want to murder the writer and director. I can't wait for all of the wannabe nerds to try to explain how deep this shallow try-hard attempt at filmmaking was by Todd Phillips, and somehow not just a complete mess of a movie. Joaquin Phoenix was it's only saving grace. His performance and technique were solid, but the writing was hot garbage and the direction was absolutely terrible. Just laugh-out-loud awful at times. Over-stylized, heavy-handed, and took itself WAY too seriously given the low competency of writing/directing behind this production. I feel bad for Phoenix to have been attached to a steaming pile like this. Oh well. Despite Joker being a critical failure, at least Jouquin will probably still have a big payday with comic book culture being as devoted as it is.",0
1458,"The movie is vapid in its own special way. It asks you to dissect it while you watch, and then simultaneously punishes you for looking for depth. If you want a movie about a guy going insane because of society, just watch Taxi Driver, Todd Philips obviously did.",0
1459,"The music, cinematography, and the lead actor were incredible! The plot, pacing, and the idea that this was so supposed to be the Joker is the real joke here. Practically nothing was portrayed correctly in this movie from the comics or even other films or cartoons, and all that could be forgiven if they at least captured the essence of the character  however they did not. He was never really funny (even though comedy is subjective as Arthur states himself) he isn't really a criminal he just kind of stumbles and fumbles through every situation, and most importantly he wasn't smart or conniving. This is supposed to the legendary, the infamous, the iconic villain of Batman in the future? A weak, pathetic, mentally ill  clown that can't even keep a job or take care of his mother. Everything is handed to this character through plot driven circumstances. Oh the crowd just happens to get riled up just in time so he can slip through and meet Thomas Wayne. He didn't rile up the crowd, or plan a diversion how did he get a service outfit to blend in? Oh it was just laying around in a service closet just his size. The real Joker is smart and that is what allows him to go to to toe with the greatest detective of all time. He doesn't just get the luckiest circumstances in the world and just happens to beat Batman. He plans and schemes and puts on a show and actually knows how to be funny if he wants to be. The only reason I think this has good reviews is because my generation doesn't know the characters, and joaquin phoenix is an amazing artist bringing the role he was told to play to life. If this was a random movie about a random clown with mental illness and tragic story it would be a decent movie. As a movie supposedly portraying the Joker it was the worst movie DC has made so far. It was a movie made is if they don't understand their own character or why he is even so iconic or infamous in the first place.  Sincerely  a huge Joker fan",0
1460,This movie is so boring and not innovative. people gets hype that is all. There is nothing about with Joker's origin. Joker has mental illness. Not a 'like we all know' criminal mastermind.,0
1461,"Nope. Joker is a mish-mash of all sorts of other, better, movies and themes. It's painfully unaware of it's woefully ignorant political and cultural nature. It thinks it's art masquerading as a superhero villain origin story, but it's just an uninformed mess. Mental health, Abuse, Violence, Bullying are all topics it fails to understand, instead relying on cliches and tired white male drama. Oh, a supervillain is created from an abusive home, some bullying, and the loss of a job? Then everyone would be a supervillain, eff off. Joaquin Phoenix is a complete mess, not able to keep his own interpretation consistent from moment to moment in the same scene. It's a painful wreck, and offensive to anyone who's ever actually dealt with mental health and/or abuse issues. In the back of my mind I feel like this was the first movie written by an AI computer program. Utter trash.",0
1462,"Awful movie. Just misery porn 4 upper class airheads. Absolutamente torpe, abyecto y carente de sentido del humor.",0
1463,"Remake of Taxi Driver with clown makeup, Phoenix acting can't save this hollow husk of a movie.  Would have been better as an off broadway single man performance with just Phoenix on stage for 2 hours ranting an raving about how terrible life has treated him.",0
1464,One word..Pathetic.This movie is an insult for The Joker characters and to DC Comics fans! Seriously.. Do you think that The Prince of Crime of Gotham city needs your sympathy!,0
1465,"Let me start by saying that Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job at portraying an unnerving malnourished mess. The movie even did a terrific job at transporting us to 1970s crumbling Gotham city gripped in turmoil.However, the movie failed to portray any resemblance of Joker and seemingly attempted to justify his extremist violent behavior.If any resemblance of the real joker were in this movie it would have been something fairly small that would have caused him to crack or perhaps he would have started killing just for the hell of it. The monster that is joker would've seeded protests, manipulated the police against the protesters, and ultimately incited chaos in some genius orchestration just to counterbalance justice...That's not Arthur. Arthur seems to be a character on the surface that might have been plucked from Clockwork Orange, Falling Down, or Taxi Driver... but he's actually something new. you see none of those potential inspirations repeatedly make a defense or justification for the characters decent. The movie repeatedly attempts (unsuccessfully) to garner sympathy for Arthur. first off it's not his fault as he is mentally I'll die to a brain injury he sustained as an abused child. he's next repeatedly bullied throughout the movie. the state then cuts off his medical supplies due to budget cuts. he becomes delusional off his meds and starts to fall deeper through the cracks whilst accidentally inspiring class warfare that parallels the occupy movement in its adoption of a symbolic mask and anger against wealth inequality. He finally becomes ""the joker"" giving a speech about how general society never thinks about what the bad guy might be going through (please don't try to make me feel for the criminally insane) and how society failed him and he was only brought on the show to be bullied. he then shoots the host and the protesters turn to violent rioters.in short the cold calculating jokers have all been replaced by a fumbling mentally ill sad victim. the movie seems to attempt justification for violent incels while villainizing the disgruntled lower class. for a hero movie it had some warped political narratives embedded.As I said though... Phoenix was amazing.",0
1474,People keep saying this is a phenomenal portrayal of people with mental health problems. It’s not it’s damaging and not like any people I’ve come across. The vast majority of people who have been hurt in childhood and suffered trauma do not hurt anyone. The only person they hurt are themselves because they struggle to deal with the trauma they have and they are often not getting the support they need. To suggest trauma means you can go crazy and commit horrific crimes is rare and unfair to people with mental health issues. The film is also boring.,0
1475,"I have no idea what the jurors at Venice were smoking when they picked Joker for their grand prize because this sucker is a snore-fest, from beginning to end.  There’s nothing exciting about it – there’s only a modicum of violence (if you want violence in a much better movie, go see the latest Rambo).  And Phoenix doesn’t hold a candle to Heath Ledger’s Joker.  I mean, in that movie, there’s a palpable sense of dread throughout.  You could cut the tension with a knife.  This one?  It’s just there. Inert.  Tedious.  I checked my watch maybe 4 times, which is bad.  Whoever has been calling this movie “dangerous”, or a movie of its time…. Please.  I’d love to see a movie in which people so fed up over political talk all day and all night go out and cause mayhem.  There’s nothing remotely like that here.  And let me take a moment to call out DeNiro.  He’s entirely mis-cast.  What’s more, he totally mailed this performance in.  Maybe he saved his best (or even “good”) stuff for The Irishman. The only really good performance in this film is by the actress from Atlanta. Actually, Paperboy from Atlanta is also very good in a tiny role.  I was pumped up to see this – what a letdown.  Now let’s bring on the quality – The Lighthouse, Parasite, and Marriage Story.",0
1476,"Phoenix acts his ass off and does a great job, but the film itself is pretentious garbage with nothing to say. It was like a film school major saying ""LOOK HOW DEEP I AM"" while shouting talking points and not following any of them up with context. Like they throw out buzzwords about the mental health system, antipsychotics being bad, the majority vs the 1% etc and just doesn't really say anything or follow through on any of the ideas. Hope you like slow motion 'dancing' because there's a lot of it here.",0
1477,"I can't understand all the fuss made about this movie, it didn't go to my expectations, it's more of a drama than a comedy, it's trying so hard to make sense, but it just cant, i didn't like the two personalities switching : Joker must only be Joker, not some crazy who doesn't know how to speak, joker can play with people's minds, he is a player, not some crazy criminal killing people just like that for no reason",0
1478,I want to know which movie all these users went to because this movie sucked royally. I would have rather sat in my car outside the movie theater for 2.5 hours staring at a bush. I will say that Joaquin Phoenix did a good job being a nut job but that's as far as this goes. I wish I could get my $75 back along with the time. I feel like a poor excuse of a father after subjecting my teenage such to such a **** factory of a flick. Damn you Rave cinema for not having 3 seats together for IT. Damn you to hell!,0
1479,"Simply boring.Uninspired social commentary, with half baked ideas and little to keep the audience engaged. Sadly there is little reason to see this film - the entirety of its nuances and messages (which in principle would be interesting) may be experienced in the trailer.",0
1483,"Cheap movie. Acting is in high level, also cinematography and the music, but in total it's disgusting.",0
1486,"How it's possible that a mental disorder ends in a brilliant, creative and funny criminal mind?",0
1487,"Yes, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. Also, the direction and cinematography in this films is very good. But what's the takeaway here? The Joker is crazy. Yeah, we know. We knew that already. Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor? Yeah we knew that also. If anything, it's an essay on mental illness. At a time when we need more compassion and resources towards mental illness, the film shocks the viewer in to out-right fearing it. Sure, maybe that's not the intention, but that's the result. Or maybe it's just a movie about a comic book character and I shouldn't take it so literally. Either way, it's not something I'd recommend to people, and I won't watch it again. In the end, it's just not fun. Go watch one of the many other (superior) Joaquin Phoenix films instead.",0
1488,"Director failed miserably, it lacked plot. Only the acting was good of phoenix but director let down badly. It lacked logic. Its not dark",0

1490,only the part he killed his friend and let other one go is good. otherwise it is a complete trash.,0
1491,Boring and uninspired. Just watch the better films that this is trying to be.,0

1493,"This incel porn is neither provocative nor deep, but it certainly makes for good marketing via controversy.",0
1495,"Here’s the thing, it fails too tell the story of the Joker, and this movie has really no purpose. Phoenix performance was good, but the rest of the movie is flat.",0
1496,One of the few movies I have been too where I felt bored but held out hope for some excitement. There a couple scenes of excitement and that is purely it. No real action or excitement. While the plot goes through his history and how he came to be. It's just utterly empty and not interesting. I think Phoenix played the character they made greatly. It's just the writing and lack of intrigue and excitement is grossly lacking.,0
1497,"I was dissapointed, the hype for the movie was too much, i thought the film will be a great one, the only good thing is the acting, just that",0
1500,Far and away the most overrated film of our time. The writing is terrible and pretentious. Joaquin Phoenix is my favorite actor and this is by far his worst performance ever. It's just one long joke at the expense of anyone who paid to see this.,0
1501,Worst garbage movie I have ever seen.I don't understand the good reviews. Probably paid reviewers.One and a half hours into the movie and it is dragging and dragging. So boring ans senseless it is not even funny.,0
1502,"A longer version of this review appears on my site.If Todd Phillip’s Joker has anything going for it, it is an attempted down-to-earth take on super-villainy in a world we know will eventually be filled with spandex and superheroes, free from the constraints and expectations of comic book trappings. This trash-strewn Gotham City of 1981 invokes a dirty, grimier period of cinema and city. In that end, Lawrence Sher’s cinematography nails the feel of the films the movies desperately wants to emulate. It’s far away from the cheery and essentially light MCU  and it’s more dour than the much maligned other DC films, none of which really connect to Joker. This is fine. This is still Batman’s world, but not any version seen previously. In case you thought this stand on its own, there are many direct connections, all forced and inspiring everything from a “really” look to my eyes rolling hard.Joker aka Arthur Fleck has no power in life except accidentally starting a revolution with shooting three Yuppies in self-defense. Stripping away the theatricality of the Clown to attempt to present a story of that One Bad Day that made the villain is a refreshing take. But, It is rather unnecessary. It’s been said that Joker is what it would look like if Scorsese tried his hand at a comic-book movie. Joker is someone who saw Scorsese films, particularly Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy but doesn’t understand why they work. As Scorsese often does, Joker presents a villain as a hero in his own story. His heroes are often far from good people. That’s why we love to watch Travis Bickle or Jordan Belfort. We get into the head of someone we cannot truly identify with as they tell us their actions are justified. But we also know teye aren’t. They are kept an arm’s distance away, with a level of satire or social-commentary. However, Joker leaves out the satire, presenting Fleck as a direct protagonist: a man who cracks after being broken by the system. He’s had enough, and society must crumble.One feels we’re meant to follow his action as justified and ultimately the “hero” Gotham needs and deserves. There is a kernel of truth and reason mixed in. The system fails those who need it most. Fleck loses access to his medication and social worker when the social worker’s entire department is closed for budget cuts. We live in a world where people in need, whether it be from mental illness, addiction, or poverty. These people keep finding their support cut off, and society then get upset with bad things happen.This is lost in a mishmash of undercooked and misguided ideas. Fleck is a manifesto of the angry male loner. He works an underwhelming job as a party-clown. He lives with his mother in his forties. He desires the woman down the hall, but she barely knows his name – and considers him to be a threat. He’s told he creeps people out, and not to talk to their kids. He just can’t get a break. The whole world is against him, no one listens to him Everyone but his mother is the enemy. What’s worse, his actions are blamed on mental illness, directly stated in the climax, giving more backing to presenting the mentally ill as a threat rather than regular people.Phoenix is forced to try to make a compelling performance from this. He’s a fantastic actor who gives care to his roles. He’s saddled with a script that gives little. He surely gives an interesting performance in the same way Jack Nicholson does as Jack in The Shining. Both of these are starting at 11, already lost-causes, two seconds away from violence. There is no arc. Performance wise they can be moved around their films with no difference in how they are behaving.  The character’s an empty cipher meant for the viewer to pour into. For an origin story, there is precious little true backstory. A moment of abuse, a life-time of caring for his mother, and a mention of committal. Who is Fleck, really? Phillips doesn’t care. Joker is a tone-deaf film, providing either wrong-headed commentary directly or underdone ideas it feels are grander. Through all its pomp and anger and muddled messaging, Joker doesn’t work. It’s dull and repetitive, slogging on from one scene to another, powered by an awkward and on the nose script. Any time the hammer Phillips wields hits the nail, it is purely by accident. There are moments that almost work, where a glimmer of a good film shines through and where it almost feels poignant with something to actually say. But each time this occurs it’s soon lost in the weeds.",0

1504,"A sickening movie with a great actor. If you like disturbing, ugly, sick storylines, here's the one for you. It portrays mental illness in a way that is very sad and untrue. Sick.",0
1505,"You're straight-up lying to anyone and yourself if you say ""This is my favorite movie."" Either that or you haven't seen enough movies to know how unimaginative the direction, cinematography, writing, acting, etc. is. Joaquin Phoenix is overrated. I'm gonna go watch Taxi Driver again, to rinse Joker from my conscious memory.",0
1507,"To say that Todd Phillip’s ‘Joker’ is a dangerous movie is to give it too much credence, but it is a deeply offensive one.  Ultimately, it’s just a silly superhero origin story, but it’s presented in such a ‘realist’ style, and so forcefully, that people might actually take it as a serious movie.  It has all the style and surface veneer of a classic 1970s movie, as has been pointed out by numerous reviewers.  Visually, it can’t be faulted for its cinematography.  It’s the script and characterisation that are lacking.  Nobody would go into a film based on a comic book expecting a serious character study, but, by tackling the genre in the style of such a movie, that is what you are falsely enticed to expect.  Unfortunately, that is not what you get.  The viewer is presented with a mentally ill man, living with his disabled mother, who becomes a deranged serial killer who incites mass violence.  This could have been an in-depth psychological exploration of one man’s descent into the maelstrom, that gives the viewer some insight into how a corrupt and insensitive society can push a vulnerable individual over the edge, as those well-known seventies movies did to some extent.  Such a narrative requires nuance, sensitivity, compassion and tact, or risk demonising the vulnerable.  The very lack of any of the aforementioned does just that – it sets back the mentally ill fifty years or more.  What we have here is a series of episodic vignettes – admittedly in the style of a comic book – in which, through a series of gross oversimplifications, the put-upon protagonist slowly loses his grip on reality and descends into graphic violence.  Each prior vignette is treated in such a superficial manner that they serve merely as lame justification for the gory set pieces.Joaquin Phoenix’s performance is intense and physical, but, in the absence of any human depth, proves to be nothing more than a leering caricature.  Lingering, over-stylised shots of his manic posturing does not equate to a meaningful performance, however fully the actor has thrown himself into the part.  Instead, when the movie reaches its riotous denouement, rather than a criticism of the society that led to his downfall, we are presented with a film that seems to celebrate and encourage the very ills that incites his violence.  Points of comparison are ‘Assassination Nation’ and, to a lesser extent, ‘Spring Breakers’.  It is this very confusion, simultaneously vilifying the vulnerable and championing them as an anarchic anti-hero, undercutting the capitalist ruling class, that serves to further stigmatise the mentally ill.  At the risk of sounding alarmist, younger viewers - older teenagers and those in their early twenties - the very audience that such a film is aimed at, or anyone else with a naïve lack of understanding of mental health, for that matter, could come away from this movie with less empathy for the isolated and marginalised than they went in, thinking the film is cool, when it’s far from that.  For that reason, it is reckless and misjudged, but what should we expect from the director of puerile frat movie ‘Old School’ and laddy stag film ‘The Hangover’?",0
1508,"The ‘Joker’ is a disturbing movie. The storyline is easy to understand but there where a lot of inappropriate jokes. These jokes where for example: he just killed someone and he tells the other person that he’s a good guy and he will not get killed. Which made everything weird about the movie, also because people really thought it was funny. I think that it brings the wrong ideas to solve that problem (the rich stay rich, the poor stay poor).The actors and visuals are really good. That made it seems very realistic and also grose because when he killed someone I couldn’t watch it. It’s very uncomfortable to watch and afterwards the feeling haunted me. It wasn’t like an horror movie that you’re scared and people also pass away, it was just very different than that. It gave a weird feeling because there are people at the moment that think like him, which is kind of scary. I do not recommend to watch it. If you do wanna watch it, I would wait until it airs on tv, that way you don’t spend your money on it.",0

And why use Pink and Blue Boy in his apartment?  odd choices.  JP doesn't hold a candle to Ledger or Romero.... maybe a little better than Nicholson, but that movie sucked the big one.  If the Academy awards this because of the hype after having face-palmed The Dark Knight, you'll know that that event isn't worthy watching again.",0
1516,"I was cautiously optimistic when this movie was announced. The Joker has always been one of my favorite comic book characters. I've always known Joaquin Phoenix to be a phenomenal actor so I was interested to see what he could bring to the character. After watching the film, I can't explain the amount of disappointment I felt. The movie itself is an incredibly slow burn that takes quite a bit of patience to endure. This movie is extremely loosely connected to the Batman mythos and that is putting it mildly. The title of the film is probably the only thing ""Joker"" about this movie. The film portrays itself as a deep, methodical view on mental health struggles and how society treats those that struggle from them. This would have been a better film if it was not in any way connected to the comic character. Not basing this portrayal on any story from the comics was a very bold move and one that made me worried and rigtfully so it would seem. The movie doesn't really know what kind of story it wants to tell. I wouldn't call this an origin story since Arthur Fleck is in no way the Joker that we all know and love. He is like the Party City version of the beloved character. Imagine if some fanboy tried to emulate what being the joker is like for college film project and that's what you get with this film. I felt like I had wasted two hours watching this disaster. The only bright spot in this movie would be Phoenix's acting. He did the best with what the script gave him.",0
1517,This movie was so bad don’t waste your money It’s nothing like The joker that were used to seeing. The outfit looks like he fell in a bucket of peach paint the make up he looks like he’s trying to audition for a job at McDonald’s this movie was atrocious,0
1518,"The only part of the entire film that makes sense is the credits. The storyline and script are horrendous. The acting is distasteful at best. Pheonix does try with the script but still he is very contradicting. It shows proof he has this illness, then he acts like he doesn’t, back and forth over the entire film. It’s awful, forgetful, and doesn’t make any attempt of continuing the story from previous installments besides attempting to show his Batman’s parents death which still directly contradicts what has been told since the beginning.",0

The cinematography, direction and story are all top notch and handled with so much care. It's extremely obvious that the negative critical reception is do to bias and pushing an agenda. I hate being the person to say that because at this point it's a cliche but if this film were starring a person of color, it's obvious that the critical reception would be different. The ""imminent violence"" narrative that's been pushed by media outlets is nothing more than wishful thinking. This movie is like the opposite of Captain Marvel in terms of critics/media pushing their agenda. Honestly, it's baffling. They didn't have a problem with Nightcrawler, which is an extremely similar film, they lauded The Dark Knight. So it's honestly just a sign of the times that critics will let their own political and moral biases dictate their reception of a film. No longer rating it on performance, nuance or technicality. This is an incredible film.",1

This is a work of art that uses all elements of the drama flawlessly. The good fantastic movies and science fiction movies describe the present metaphorically, just like Joker. It tells story of the evil in a harsh way and from the other side where we people usually don’t see or ignore; how the evil turned evil. This isn’t glorifying, it criticizes people who marginalize, externalize and humiliate others who are weaker. One of best anarchist film ever I saw.",1

1636,"JOKER is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. It pains me that so many ""critics"" rip into this movie for absolutely absurd reasons. This film is probably the best ""superhero"" movie produced since 2008. Of course, it isn't a superhero film, but it is made by DC with a comic character as the protagonist. I have seen this movie TWICE and I am more impressed with this solo project than I am with the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe AND 20th Century Fox X-Men Universe combined. Movies like The Dark Knight and Logan have proved superhero movies can be as much a brilliant art-piece as the most beautiful films ever made (Films like The Green Mile, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc..), and so does JOKER.Joaquin Phoenix is goddamn phenomenal in the role, he absolutely carries this character the whole way through and I could not see a single other person playing this character so well. Joaquin terrifies me in this movie; it's honestly insane how crazy and scary he is, while also evoking a ton of sympathy from me in the opening act.If I could describe his portrayal in the best way I could, I would say: at the start of this film, he makes me want to curl up and cry. At the end of this film, he makes me want to cry for an entirely different reason. And that's not even all down to Joaquin.Todd Phillips has crafted the PERFECT comic book movie in my eyes. The camera work, the directing, the writing, the story, the plot twists... It is all amazing. This film truly messes with you in the most incredible way a movie could with some very Fight Club style plot twists that left me stunned. I remember being sat in the cinema for my first viewing gawking at the whole thing with my hands behind my head and my eyes widened watching in disbelief and horror and pure amusement and entertainment. And on my second viewing, I remember being so entertained by the amount of things you pick up after the first watch: all the dots that connect together, all the foreshadowing and clues and hints... It's truly magnificent how a movie can make me walk out giving it a 10/10 TWICE. I'd be willing to say on second viewing it is a lot more entertaining than the first viewing in multiple ways, which is surprising seeing as I left the first time utterly mesmerized. To say the body count in this film is rather low, the violence and brutality is extremely high. It's not like any other basic blockbuster that presents killing as an easy one-shot and dead scenario... No. This film presents killing as insanely harsh and difficult. Even the character Arthur Fleck shooting someone with a handgun once comes across as terrifying, in one of the final scenes. And that scissors kill was absolutely paralyzing. I sat there in my seat in utter dread and... well, horror. I don't know how else to describe it. HORROR.The critics are saying this film glamorizes violence and many other ridiculous things. But, at its core, no it does not glamorize violence. It discourages it, if anything. It discourages a lot of things. This is a very accurate representation of the every man who is constantly picked on and wronged by society. It presents the world outside of the ivory tower every movie protagonist seems to live in. I know a lot of people like those that pick on Arthur Fleck in this film. And the film should be a lesson for people to not act like this at all, otherwise extreme events may ensue. And it glamorizing violence is a ridiculous statement, as it presents killing as horrifying, dark and difficult. It shook me to the core seeing deaths in this movie, and definitely gave me the opposite opinion on ""cool, brutal"" kills in movies, like in the John Wick movies. Now, I cannot talk about this film without briefly mentioning Gotham City. The best representation of Gotham City in any DC movie.The Dark Knight Trilogy presented it as gritty and chaotic, but again that was through the eyes of Batman. And it was always full of explosions and action and riots. The Tim Burton movies presented it as an over-the-top, steampunk and bleak area. The DCEU presents it as... Nothing. And the Arkham games present it as gritty and crime infested. JOKER presents it as an awful place to live, full of stuck-up, rich pricks who pick on the less fortunate. Much like any city, but it gets its own character. It's compact, it's corrupted, and it's dirty. It's like a mirror image of Arthur Fleck's mental state. It's run down and it's getting worse and worse without the help of Thomas Wayne, who acts like he cares about the events occurring within the city and the protagonist, but really he's selfish and only cares for himself and his family. It's incredibly poetic.And the scene with the Waynes... I needn't say much but... It's possibly the best representation of the murders made, and the poetry of Joker's birth happening with Batman's birth is incredible.The ending, too, left me speechless and in awe.This film is very well deserving of a 10/10",1
1637,"Very impressive. Joaquim Phoenix on fire. Even though storyline includes some stuff to discuss about, you gotta see it as what it is. A movie. And as such it is a masterpiece",1
1638,Best movie of the year. I had chills all the time. Epic. Why should mental illnesses make you uncomfortable?,1
1639,Just amazing. I already watch 2 times in the cinema.  One of the best movies I already saw,1
1640,"Another thumbs up here. Why on earth is there a media backlash? If they think this movie is going to be responsible for “copycat” people are they the same people that think GTA and computer games are responsible for society’s problems? Or the Beatles? This is a film. It’s nothing new, but it’s something great. Chill out and enjoy it.",1
1641,J'suis dans la voiture à Batman !!JuljuljuuuuulAller donnez lui l'Oscar Biz,1
1642,It talk about psychatry disorder with the prisme of the hero which is not seeming mad in his viewpoint. It is a masterpiece to describe Complexe situations and mind states that causes Rage access we Can all see character that coUnfronting one way ore an other are horrible without finding words to describe it.emotions are in contradiction with murders wich is really disrbuing,1
1643,"The best movie I ever seen, Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur and as Joker is very good, the movie makes you fell uncomfortable and you lose more and more sympathy with Arthur. the final scene of the blood smile gave me the chills, the only thing I did not like was the end , I hope they can can give him a second part as good as this one, it would be great to see this joker fight with his brother once.",1
1644,"This movie is a masterpiece; a must-watch movie for many years to come. This is not a superhero type of film, but a in-depth character study of a face that all of us are familiar with. Joker, in my honest opinion, has to be one of if not the best movie I have seen all year. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix with the direction of Todd Phillips is simply amazing. The movie is deep, powerful as we see the portrayal of Phoenix to the most iconic villain in comic book history. The movie is really, really amazing, but I'm only giving it a 9/10 because I left the cinema wanting more, and not necessarily in a good or bad way. Overall, a must-watch masterpiece.",1

1646,"Amazing movie, so moving. A much needed eye opener to how villains are created not born.",1
1647,"Of course this is not a perfect movie, but it's definitely worth seeing! Joaquin Phoenix acting is genious!",1
1648,"It's a way too good movie , it's very dark you have to make your mind think too much. Go watch it.",1
1649,If you haven’t seen the joker do yourself a favor and go watch it like right now,1
1650,"This film messes with your emotions. There are scenes where you are not sure if you should laugh or feel sad (kind of how Fry from Futurama was conflicted with fear and joy when sentenced to death by snu-snu). There are moments that make you laugh (if you like dark humor like me). The comedy is similar to Joan Cornella’s morbid comedic illustrations. Joaquin Phoenix’s acting makes the character believable. His unique laughter sounds a bit painful and sad. When the situation goes south, the actor does a great job of performing the fight or flight behavior. Joaquin has an interesting and kind of silly way of running that fits the clown character appropriately (because he is a clown, it makes sense to me). The character is not a simple, black and white personality, instead he is a complex multi-layered individual that makes him entertaining to observe.The movie is realistic/grounded. Corrupt behavior is created and not born and there is tons of research to back this up. The Joker was not born with a corrupt mind. The film does a great job showing how the environment molded his corrupt behavior. Thomas Wayne’s portrayal is believable because someone in his position of wealth and power would behave the way he does (although there are a few wealthy people out there that are cool). The film has high quality violence (laugh out loud). This movie makes the violence feel shocking and serious. Other movies have too much violence that it starts to feel cheap and not a big deal (these films are still fun to watch though).This is one of the reasons why I love video games like The Last of Us or movies like Coco because they put plenty of effort in all of the departments (story, character development, believable acting, and an effective atmosphere). It is a memorable experience, it has substance, and it made me feel like this **** matters. Movie of the year for me.",1
1651,"One of the best movies i've ever seen. Left me at the edge of my seat with it's tense, nerve wrecking scenes that just inspire pure unfiltered dread in me.It's great, buy a ticket. Then get a friend and buy one for him and another for you",1
1652,"Absolutely fantastic film. Do not listen to the radical left, this is truly one of the greats and Joaquin Phoenix is a so absolutely unreal in his performance. This is a must even for this who are not fans of comics. Be prepared to be disturbed nonetheless.",1
1653,"It feels like critics are panning this film; I'm not sure why.  The movie is great.  Disturbing, yes.  But to say that it doesn't have depth is absolutely outrageous.",1
1654,"Though it may have upset some sensitive individuals, Joker was a very well produced movie and made you feel for Arthur.",1
1655,"Much has been talked about how Joker is not original. Honestly, the film plays a different role than Taxi Driver, for example. The goals are far from being the same. In the present case, it is not about glorifying a killer as if he was a hero, but rather a precise investigation on what exactly is causing so much trouble in people's heads, these days. Mental illness rating is increasing, and this is not arbitrary.But it is not like there are a bunch of Jokers out there. Arthur Fleck is unique. He has serious conditions that have nothing to do with ""incells"" or ""white people problems"". And as we watch the movie, we can feel like him. We can feel what is like to suffer what he suffers. His unique and extreme conditions. It is two hours of how is it like to be utterly depressive, and it makes you reconsider how you treat people and how horrible and sadistic society can be without even noticing.",1
1656,It's great. The film that really deserves to be called with a Joker logo. Watch it guys.,1
1657,"this film is very well done, Joaquin Phoenix  plays very well the role of the joker. it's been a long time since I've been watching a good movie at the cinema.",1
1658,This is by far the best movie i've Ever seen Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job of portraying the Joker I hope he gets nominated for the Oscars,1
1659,"Это шедевр!! Хоакин Феникс сыграл великолепно, сюжет тоже хороший, после просмотра я был в шоке от увиденного. Браво!!",1
1660,"Outstanding performance, great audio, heavy mood. Joker didn't disappoint - that's a 'super hero' movie that we need right now.",1
1661,This movie take you step by step in the degradation of a mental ill man. A hard truth for many in that situation is that nobody will help you and everybody finally will be against you. In order to survive you do what it needs. Very good interpretation I belived him.,1
1662,One of the best movies of all time.Even if you do not like comics I still advise you to go to this masterpiece.,1
1663,joker is a masterpiece movie I enjoyed watching it I hope this movie win oscar this year,1
1664,All Jokers are different. This one is my favourite. Definitely one of the best DC movies.,1
1665,"Joker es perfectamente la mejor película a que e visto en años, con la grandisima actuacion de Joaquin phoenix joker te hace sentir la pena y misera que siente el protagonista a lo largo de la película juntando eso con los momentos que te dejan con la boca abierta, joker se merece todas las buenas notas y premios que le den al largometraje",1
1666,I hope they get an oscar for this one – they deserve it so much. It‘s a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix‘s acting is amazing.,1
1667,Don't look the result of the press ..this movie is the greatest movie of dc for a long time.,1
1668,Two words: brilliant masterpiece!Moviecritics who disliked this movie better find a new job/hobby.,1
1669,"Increndible. Loved it. The joker's peformance was blessing, and the blood and gore i'ts the more realistic part. And if you're sensitive, don't watch this movie, it's one of the most shocking feature films i ever watched.",1
1670,Masterpiece. An acerbic critique of our modern societies. A demonstration of how social and economical violence leads to physical violence.,1
1671,"Once again the ""critics"" were wrong. This was a well written and acted movie. Very much enjoyed.",1
1672,"Amazing cinematography, absolutely phenomenal acting. Great job by the director and a very well written plot. Absolutely loved this movie I’ve seen it already 3 times in the theaters would go a 4th time.",1
1673,The film was a pure masterpiece and has the ability to completely entrance you through the viewing.All these film critics are clearly out of touch or marvel fanboys. When Black panther is rated higher than this film--you know something is truly off.,1
1674,Отличный фильм! Это очень тяжёлая драма. Во время просмотра получил удовольствие. Также хочу отметить великолепную игру Хоакина Феникса. Рекомендую всем фильм к просмотру!,1
1675,"I have cried very few times at a movie but in this movie, I cry 5 times it felt real but more than that it felt human this film shows how people truly live poor and **** up people hurt people because they can this film shows you what life is and how most of us can't seem to get a break in life.",1
1676,Очень мрачно и очень жестоко. Отличный фильм и прекрасная игра Феникса. Смотреть всем.,1
1677,I think it's the best movie of this year! Joaquin Phoenix was should get Osсar!,1
1678,Don't expect it to be the average superhero or comic movie! It's much more than that!,1
1679,"Beautifully written, acted, and well-paced. Joaquin Phoenix is transfixing, portraying a downtrodden mentally ill man so well, he's easily empathized with and unnerved by. A raw, unbelievably powerful film.",1
1680,"I loved this movie. Joaquin Pheonix's performance is absolutely incredible and he should win an Oscar for it. The score is also great. The dialogue was good but I feel as though that it was overly long and that some scenes should've been cut entirely like the scene where Joker is dancing in the washroom. Some characters also didn't need to be in the movie at all and that's disheartening. The movie brings up tons of great questions however and I've been thinking about it ever since I left the theatre. This movie gets a recommendation from me. I would avoid this one if you don't enjoy disturbing content because this movie is more disturbing than most horror movies from the past ten years.Overall, my current score is 8.5/10 but since Metacritic won't let me add a decimal to my score, it displays a score of 8/10. I might change my personal score to a 9/10 however. To not confuse you any further, this movie is not lower than an 8 but it's not higher than a 9.",1
1681,"A Great Movie !Phoenix really did this role with a new style. It's REALLY PERFECT... Pheonix roll is CRAZY! I am a Joker top fan and I really loved it. The plot is amazing, and most importantly the message! Now Ledger is a thing and Pheonix is another. Everyone of them has his own style and taste. We can't compare them they're both great.",1
1682,"Фильм качественный с задумкой фильм очень классный звукои, звук сопровождение музыкальная потом игра качественное самый классный сюжет поставила правильно это иногда смешно когда я неловко иногда мерзко иногда очень-очень завораживающим Но не знаю почему но да такое бывает что что-то тут не хватает вот у многих такое чувство что что-то должно произойти сейчас но этого не происходит так 8 балкон заслуженно получает Я думаю актёр заслуживает Оскара",1
1683,Never watched a movie with so much emotions in my life. In addition the hype that was built pre-release just shows how much weight Joaquin Phoenix had to carry on his shoulder. He certainly proved himself to deserve an oscar after this.,1
1684,"One of the best movie of 2019. All actors have given their best performances especially jacqueline phoenix. Story is about a person, who is going down a dark path as his own mental health deteriorate because of cruel society and nobody to guide and support him. It is dark, gritty and realistic. Storytelling is just perfect. A must watch for everyone.",1
1685,"The story developed in the movie makes sense of the phrase ""It only takes a bad day to reduce the sane of men to a lunatic."" His upset with his laughter and psychological problems makes the character's story more interesting in terms of how his problems with people are presented and the part of Gotham's society that fits him.A conflict in Gotham's society and in his mind makes things harder for the character to understand, and also makes it more enigmatic for the public.Good references are used and embedded that make sense of the story and make the movie even better.[written in Portuguese and Translating, Sorry for any informality.]",1
1686,Finally a good adult comic movie adaption. I am a bit sick of all these age 13 Marvel stuff. Awesome!,1
1687,"Obra de arte! No puedo expresar todos los sentimientos que atravesé desde el primer minuto! La actuación de Joaquín es impresionante, Magnífico!",1
1688,"Best movie of 2019, give this guy an Oscar!He played soooo realistically, that I felt sorry for Joker.",1
1689,Its the best film i have ever seen!!!Top-level camera shooting.The actor played this role very well.,1
1690,"Охуенный фильм, спустя день после просмотра все ещё чувство тревоги и сопереживания.",1
1691,"Una hermosa película, junto a una actuación magistral de Joaquín phoenix, cinematográficamente bella acompañada de una banda Sonora muy bien seleccionada, un JOKER que nos genera el miedo que tendríamos si en la vida real nos toparamos con alguien ASÍ. PERFECTA PELÍCULA!!!",1
1692,"It's a true masterpiece,everyone should see it ,a must watch film.joaquin's acting is beyond belief.",1
1693,"I really enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end, it never drags or gets boring, it'll keep you interested from start to finish. And yes as most people said it already, Joaquin Pheonix' performance is incredible, the way he portrays the emotions and the development of his character through the film is just insanely good. Also the story and the music gives the movie such a great atmosphere. -SPOILER-The only real thing i do dislike about the movie was when i got home and read a lot of theories and statements of the director where he says the ending is ""Multiple choice"". I'd hate if some of the parts of the ending would only be taking place in Arthur Flecks mind, because i really think this is a great origin story for the joker and in my opinion i'd love to see this version of the joker in the future too.but all in all, this movie is a masterpiece.",1
1694,Its really good film.Just watch this film and did a comment to metacritic.Bye.,1
1695,"The newest installment of DC’s Joker is a revelation!In a world surrounded by so much social issues and one sidedness, this movie shines a light in a most controversial direction.Say hello to Arthur Fleck, a man that has been put in the same social grinder in which many Americans find themselves in today. Abandoned, abused, humiliated for the sake of ratings and ultimately judged for unluckily being the final cog in a corrupt unsympathetic system.You can literally see Arthur Fleck grow and slowly transition into one of the most iconic and challenging villains ever thought up.At one point in time Arthur writes something on a piece of stationary that literally made my eyes open and my heart sink into my throat.“The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.”In no other point in history would a movie and saying like this have struck a nerve so intensely than now.The joker shows a point of view that we rarely get to see. It shows us the role many of us play in the lives of those that suffer in ways we could only imagine. It does what many directors are too afraid to do, it says what many people will never admit to saying.That in the world of the mentally ill, many times... we are the monsters. Our abusive nature breaths life into the jokers of our time and we cannot remove ourselves from their process of birth.Phoenix gives a moving performance as only a man that has seen his level of troubled life could deliver. He fills each scene with peculiar movements and if I may be so bold, gives us the Joker we always knew loved behind the paint.As a long time watcher of DC animated movies one will find deep appreciation and even nostalgia in the movements, the running/ sliding and the laughs that have become permanently attached to this most infamous villain. I personally believe that this is the best Joker yet and that no one will be able to give this level of performance again. Bravo DC! This was desperately needed. Not only for the DC universe but for 2019. You may agree with my opinion... you may disagree... and that is what makes everything about a movie like this relevant. Your opinion... my opinion... based on our chosen perspective will matter most depending on which side we chose to stand.",1
1696,"A ""Monumental film"", that's what I would call ""Joker"". The narrative which gives us a peek into the consciousness of the protagonist is extremely disturbing, yet so real. The direction, screenplay, cinematography and the background score are outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix has given life to the character of Arthur Fleck with such grace and that you get sucked into his realm within no time. More than just another film, Joker can be categorized as one of the best documentaries on the human mind, a documentary that makes you question what's right , what's wrong and at the same time entertains you to the maximum. Joker is just like a ticking bomb !!! Tick tok !! Tick tok!!",1
1697,Joker- Movie of the yearJoaquin Phoenix- Actor of the yearTodd Phillips- Director of the year One of the greatest films I’ve ever. This film has too much depth for its critics.,1
1698,The best movie of the year and the best comic book movie of our generation.,1
1699,Complete work of inexplicable art. The acting the direction the sublime beauty inherited in the film is just so difficult to get anywhere. Film of the decade needless to say,1
1700,"Ce film est génial, c un chef d'oeuvre, il est gloque, trash, gore, drôle bref À VOIR ABSOLUMENT",1
1701,DC has the potential to take a movie to the blockbuster with just a single ViIlain/hero.,1
1702,This movie is amazing although very disturbing. The actor play is masterpiece.,1
1703,"Awesome movie, the difference in user score and critic just goes to show the majority of critics are irrelevant and have no idea what they're talking about, most giving this film a low score a pushing a political agenda!",1
1704,"This movie was excellent. The way that it slowly built this main character until the big ""reveal"" was so engaging and well done. It was dark and disturbing but also revealing and intriguing. The movie of the year for sure.",1
1705,THIS FILM NOT A MASTERPIECE BUT ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES BASED ON A COMIC FILM. BECAUSE THIS WASNT A SUPERHERO FILM. THIS IS A REAL FILM ABOUT HUMAN INTERIORS. How to become alienated And start a revolution.,1
1706,"I admire Joaquin Phoenix as an actor, hell he should have had the Oscar for Gladiator!! Though I am no fan of Marvel or any comic films, this film, putting aside the title is a Masterpiece.This film is dark and deals with the slow torment of a tortured soul who is slowly waking up to the reality of his true existence.The direction, music, acting and script left you leaving the cinema with true awe and satisfaction knowing you paid money for a god damn great movie.",1
1707,Best film of the deceny ever what a story and what actor thankyou Joaquin !,1
1708,A must watch movie. Critics who don't rate it high just never had any interest in rating the movie from the start. They don't just want to like it,1
1709,Best movie I’ve seen in a while! Really makes you think. Great take on insanity and mental illness.,1
1710,"I don't see myself watching this film again, but it has to be seen by everyone.",1
1711,"Critics are a bunch of hack frauds, their opinions mean nothing. I’ve been thinking about this movie for a while and will probably see it again.",1
1712,"A movie such this should be made every single year. Soundtrack, wardrobe and director an Óscar please! Thanks for writing an original Joker story.",1
1713,"Supported by an interesting story, good cinematography, a fun soundtrack and an absolutely mesmerizing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is a more than decent origin movie. It's no masterpiece, but it's worth watching if you're a joker fan.",1
1714,"Good acting; direction; staging and cinematography; atmosphere; photography; and score and Original Soundtrack. But in some moments it is a bit slow and when the good thing starts, it suddenly end. There are also certain predictable parts and does not deliver anything new with the plot twist imitating Fight Club.",1
1715,"This is definitely one of the most unique and well acted comic book movies of the decade, this film is filled with award deserving performances and an excellent direction from Todd Phillips. This film is shot and edited so marvellously and this is probably my favourite score of the year. However this movie does have its flaws and the first being it took way to long for the film to get into the meat of its story. For the first hour the film takes us in so many directions and introduces so many messages and themes that I struggled to identify what the film was trying to be. There were also some character decisions made that I didn't appreciate. I know Todd Phillips is trying to make something different compared to most comic book movies, but some of the decisions made to Jokers origin and how they treated some of the supporting characters bugged me. there's also a point where the film should have ended, but it didn't and another scene is added, instantly I knew the film should've ended when it did, the last 4 minutes make no sense and add an extra few minutes to the film that doesn't need to be there. Overall I did enjoy this movie, very fresh and I am glad we didn't just get another comic book movie with end of the world plots and big action scenes. Definitely a recommendation for all film lovers.",1
1716,"I loved joker. It is a nice change of pace from all the other comic book movies. It isn’t over the top action like avengers, it is more realistic and more violent. From the start you are hooked and can connect with Arthur. You want to feel sympathy for him, but as the movie goes on you may start to feel less and less sympathetic for him because of the choices he makes. The climax of the movie is very satisfying yet very dark, you feel good for Arthur but you don’t want to. The ending is also very good, it lets you choose what parts of the movie are real and what parts are just Arthur’s hallucinations or fantasies. My only problem with the film is that the movie has a very slow climb to the climax with only two or three scenes that have good action.",1
1717,"Excellent, of course this movie is not for everybody, but for me, this is one of the best Actor performance and history so far....I really enjoy from start to finish and when final credits appears in the screen I really feel bad and think to myself: I really want more. Of course the blu-ray need to be in my home collection and watch again on my projector",1
1718,"Great movie, great acting - super sad story. He did an amazing job in this film.",1
1719,"A modern masterpiece, loved every minute of it!a new and nuanced approach to Arthur Fleck’s Origin by making him a terrible result of a bad Society (Gotham)",1
1720,"Movie is breathtaking. Couldnt look away. Score and music are enchanting and hauntingly beautiful. Joaquin is mezmerising and todd phillips, amazing director. 10 out of 10 movie oscar of the decade!",1
1721,Best movie ever! It is 100% better than batwoman! If only more movies could be like this! The critics tried so hard to bring this movie down but the people's rateings speak for themself!,1
1722,"I think you have to see the film for understand the positive reaction. Phoenix is unbelievable, it's a sad story, a mirror of our society. It is a more real joker, mixing pain and misunderstanding, a performance very different from other jokers.",1
1723,Once in a century movie . Joaquin Phoenix's acting was just mind blowing and Todd Phillips's direction was also excellent. Background music were too good.,1
1724,"Subverts narratives and forces the audience to confront a reality that terrifies; that each and every one of us is instrumental in hastening cultural decline through our groupthink divisions and neglect/disdain of ""the other"".",1
1725,"Overall, decent movie sold by amazing acting. I appreciate the more serious, less campy take on the character. My only complaints would probably boil down to editing choices. Would love to see a director's cut.",1
1726,"Loved it, especially the last half of the movie was amazing. If you're Joker fan then must watch",1
1727,"A film that makes simplicity and boldness an extraordinary experience, with impeccable character construction, breathtaking photographs, a mix and soundtrack that leaves you magnetized in the mind of the character, combine this with the most formidable  interpretation of the brilliant career of  Joaquin Phoenix and we have a unique comic-inspired movie that addresses complex issues about society and social relationships, may even dislike the movie but not talking about it is impossible.  Memorable!",1
1728,"Why in the hell is this only a 59 when the user rating is a 93! The directing, acting and atmosphere is phenomenal and I would even say better than Heath ledgers.",1
1729,so very good yes one of the best movies ever made in the history of movies in the world it is the most beautiful most biggest and most best movies ever!!!!!!,1
1730,"This movie really makes you FEEL like a gamer. Thank you Todd Phillips, very cool. GAMERS RISE UP.",1

1733,Gamers rise upGamers rise upGamers rise upGamers rise upGamers rise upGamers rise up,1
1734,Amazing! This was definitely the best joker. Flawless acting. It makes us uncomfortable.,1
1735,"Everything about this movie is brilliant. From the great details in writing and acting that manages to portray mental illness and how society can isolate and radicalize a man who is damaged by his environment, but good in his core and trying. To the cinematography and music that manages to immerse the audience like only a few films have been able to before.",1
1736,"This movie was brilliant.I was spellbounded, this movie left such a mark. There were parts where i was shaking and was getting goosebumps, there were dialogues that didn't fail to reach my heart. Joaquin Phoenix, you won my heart my man. Your laughter made my heart ache. Joaquin Phoenix, you've created such a masterpiece here, thank you.",1
1737,"Phenomenal, mind blowing, brutally honest, raw, uncomfortable, real, thought provoking",1
1738,"Excelente! Una obra que interpela, moviliza y genera reflexión sobre la salud mental y su estigmatización.",1
1739,"New and refreshing. A great origins movie, DC finally did a good movie. Great casting.",1

1745,An enjoyable movie!!!;) Joaquin acting was really an oscar deserved must! hope that success help him to get it!,1
1746,"Ignore the critics. They rated this movie low because the film is not politically correct. If you see the user ratings on any site, the ratings are high. Its a great movie. Its dark, but very dramatic. In a nutshell, Michael Moore said it perfectly in his review. Critics dont want to support it out of fear when really these are the times we need movies like this.",1
1747,"on the topic of clowns, the media is acting quite like a clown. and they're doing a good job, as they're making me laugh. this movie is great. it tells a competent story which while it may be too like Scorsese movies and like King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, but it tells a different experience with this one. It differentiates itself enough to stay true to movies like that but be different enough to be original, daring, and Oscar worthy as it can be. Joaquin deserves that Oscar, darn it.",1
1748,It`s just one of the best Films i`ve ever seen. The Charakters are incredible good. Tod Philips done a great Job in writing a new Story about a joker Who is more a joker then ever before.,1
1749,"What a masterpiece, I absolutely love the small subtle comical elements that find their place in really tense moments of this movie. In my opinion this is a must-see!",1
1750,"Seen a lot of yellow-toothed Jokers in my life, from Cesar Romero to Heath Ledger. They've all brought something to the part but none gave the character the fragility and psychosis of Joaquin Phoenix's desperate and desperately sad Joker.",1
1751,a couple of mistakes in the script were not enough to bury the amazing performance of phoenix,1
1752,Enfin un film orignal qui na rien avoir avec les Marvel partout.Et sur tous le jeux d'acteur il les excellent comme je n'ai jamais vue dans le cinéma actuel.,1
1753,The movie is just awesome...it nails the comic book genre of movies. Never in the movie I thought that it is justifying the acts of Joker. His gradual descent into madness is gripping and full of surprises. There are some flaws in the movie cause no movie is a masterpiece. The Batman origin connection was surprising and a bit clumsy too. But the movie really does a good job. Joaquin is phenomenal and the direction by Todd Phillips is to the point. Lastly the movie makes you think about our society and the class division. It's social message is clear. It tells about mental illness and the child abuse. The movie's message and art is brought to life by Joaquin phoenix. He will hold you and never let you leave his grief and his belief. Definitely an Oscar worthy performance.In the last scene the fully fledged joker is dancing on a wrecked police car. Symbolising whenever law is at its loose end(symbolised by the wrecked police car) a joker is born i.e. an evil entity is born. When society is damaged joker is born. It's upto us now to think whether we need a joker or a society that is clean and fit for all,1
1754,"Something that shocked me last night at the Joker movie, especially after I had survived the roller coaster of emotions was how many younger kids were there - under 12 that is. I watched as two groups were seated together by at least one adult. My first reaction was ""yikes! not appropriate!"" Now that I have thought more about it, I can see how watching and later discussing its meanings with others, including adults, could be quite useful. I have no doubt that any thinking being who sees the film must have questions and quite possibly answers. I must say that I have not been this moved by a film for a very long time. I have heard that viewers either love it or hate it. I agree with both sides. I loved it because of how brilliantly it was put together and how haunting was Phoenix's portrayal. I hated it because it showed the deep pain caused by bullying and betrayal in our society and our culture. It is uncomfortable to feel the pain as well as the responsibility we all must share.",1
1755,"I don't understand all the fuss around this movie : the criticism of our society through its violence etc etc ... It's a take on the origin of a famous villain in comics.. not bamby... what were expecting, the Note Book ! Yes it takes inspiration of today's news like many movies took inspiration of their present. Is it the movie of the century ? No. Is it a really good movie ? Yes. Phoenix delivers once again (but he's been an amazing actor for a long time !). Todd Phillips came a long way from Very Bad Trip (which was also neurotic and chaotic ... so maybe he was the right director !). The rest of the cast is solid but not a lot of on-screen time (but hey, the movie is about one person).The script, the music, the picture, there are really no false note ! My biggest thumbs up is to have re-imagined a story many times told in an intelligent way. We all know who is Joker and what he'll be... still, we spend the movie stressed by the built up. Go see it, it's worth it.",1
1756,"everything about this movie is outstanding: specially the script and the wonderful Joaquin performance. oh my god, if this ain't one of the best performances of all time in a movie.",1
1757,"Give him the Oscar.The movie is just perfect, all the acting, production, directing, soundtrack is just amazing",1
1758,Brilliant just a really excellent all round cinematic experience in my opinion,1
1759,This is a great movie but it was haunting. This was dark and it passed my expectations. It's a cautionary tale and it was chilling. It's a reflection on the world we live in and how people treat each other. It fell flat in a couple spots but overall it's a movie I will never forget.,1
1760,"Fantástico!!!!! Atuação SURREAL de Joaquin, direção incrível, roteiro genial, fotografia, música tudo perfeito. Melhor filme de 2019",1
1761,Masterpiece movie This why joker always the best villain I hope DC make great movie again like this,1
1762,"I loved it ! First DC movie that got me laughing in a while ! Joke aside its fun, well done, and it might sound wierd but it fell like a real film, something i was not able to say about anything i saw in cinema for the past few years",1
1763,"Brillant Joaquin performance, deep music and script. Pheonix performance deserves an Oscar !",1
1764,"Do not watch this movie as a typical Batman continuity piece, featuring a typical Batman continuity dilemma. What this movie should be perceived as is a plain and simple reflection of the f*** up society ganging up on everyone, who are easy to prey on. Which is... the everyday reality all around the globe, across all skin colors, sexual orientation, political stance, and whatnot. You feel disgusted? You feel uneasy? Good, you should be. That's the bloody point!",1
1765,Masterpiece!!  The media hates that it’s been so successful! Phoenix gives one of the best acting performances of all time!,1
1766,What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?,1
1767,"This film is a close twin with heath ledger’s performance as the dark night. The music was perfect for every scene, the story line made the mood so much more dark,yet satisfying where the viewer can relate on a whole new level with the joker and Gotham’s citizens. I feel if this movie came out in 2020 before United state’s elections it could’ve brought a lot more viewers, but caused more issues with fights in theaters.    The joker does have a point... people these days just aren’t civil any more.This definitely deserves a nomination or two though. Overall, couldn’t have done any better.    Hopefully in the near future we see him battle Batman. The darkness is what will bring everyone in for sure.",1
1768,"This movie is just brilliant. It came up to be one of the best films done in the decade. Its direction and photography are really pleasing and excellent. Joaquin Phoenix acting is spectacular. And it's a powerful competitor for the Best Actor in a Leading Role and the movie itself for the Best Picture award. When I saw this movie it remembered me a lot to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) due to its cinematic references to the classic. It was definitely worth the money and time. And after years of a lot of superhero movies coming from Marvel Studios, this one comes (in my opinion) as a very needful type of movie these days. A serious, dark, with a bit of funny moments movie. To see Arthur Fleck A.K.A. Joker, (Joaquin Phoenix) transform from a relatively ""normal"" guy to a crazy, obscure man because of all the revelations and life problems he has to go through, is just, as mentioned before, brilliant. Also adding that the script, was written as a new origin for Batman's enemy, the direction and acting from Phoenix and that its final minutes are just excellent, makes this movie as named in the title, an authentic masterpiece.",1
1769,"Going into this movie I wanted to hate it. Huge dc comics fan (hate dcu current movies /snyder verse) Dont like idea of mutiple incarnations of charcaters. Cw verse,movie verse , joker 2019 verse, dc streaming verse. But holy crap this needs to be pinacle of dc movie verse.",1
1770,I have no idea what the critics are on about with this one but this movie is absolutely phenomenal. Completely ignore the critic reviews.,1
1771,"truly exhilarating and a surprise thrill ride. LOVED the multiple undertones and layers of the joker and pheonix's performance is pure gold, he definitely deserves a best actor nom at the 2020 oscars.",1
1772,A very belivevable descent into madness. But I don't belive this character can become the mastermind that is the Joker,1
1773,"Well worth a watch, best film of the year for me. Beware not a comic book film. Not for the faint hearted.",1
1774,Dark and intense. It is thought provoking. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job!,1
1775,"Una excelente película, creada para incomodar más de la mitad de la proyección, genera mucha tensión en el transcurso de la gran actuación de Phoenix, pero lo espectacular de todo es que en los últimos minutos 20 min suelta toda esa tensión. Un 10.",1
1776,"Es la llamada obra maestra, te deja pensando en muchas cosas sobre la sociedad actual, todos los prejuicios y características que suelen tener diversas personas, es una crítica de lo que somos",1
1777,GeniusA slow growing movie. But with a great believable payout. Great performance. And no sjw ****,1
1778,"This was by far the best depiction of a joker I have ever seen. It really takes its time to depict the slow decent into madness that spur on the joker to become what we know him as. It is a gritty, dark and real look at the joker we know in popular cinema. To top it off this is to my knowledge the only real supervillain origin story we have ever been given and it is amazingly done. DC needs to make more movies like this.",1
1779,Clearly a masterpiece. It’s been a long time since I seen such a movie! Joaquin Phoenix’s work is unbelievable.,1
1780,Wonderfully made movie that makes you think. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that has so much complexity baked into its many layers.,1
1781,It's an amazing movie with an amazing lead actor with strong acting it's a this movie deserves an oscar,1
1782,"Amazing, picture, direction and specially the acting, with amazing techniques, as an actress surprised with the transformation of this character.   I can’t explain how they make you feel identified with this villain and feel glad about an anarchic society rebellion against the most powerful",1
1783,This movie was amazing. It did something I personally rarely see and that's the fact that I forgot Jaoquin was just playing a character; I actually thought the character was just a lunatic. The only downside is it is slow to start.,1
1784,"Joker has received great reviews, and take a walk around ‘’rotten tomatoes’’ and read there to see that just about all the negative criticism is from people who do not realize that this is not a marvel or DC movie with lots of action and superheroes. And it shouldn't be. The film should take itself seriously, and present the world from Arthur's perspective, which means it must be dark and grim, have poor humor, and often some strange dialogues. The transformation itself is masterfully handled, showing how bad it can actually go if you don't give people with mental health problems the right help, and at the same time plant the wrong idea in their head.Phoenix deserves an Oscar nomination.This is a masterpiece of a movie and it will be talked about for several years.",1
1785,I really enjoyed it! Tod Phillips is going to do great stuff in the near future.,1
1786,The best film of the last few years by far. Phoenix's performance is oscar worthy.,1
1787,"Coringa é uma verdadeira obra de arte! Excelente roteiro, ótima fotografia, trilha sonora hipnotizante e uma atuação majestosa se Joaquin Phoenix!",1
1788,"Gold movie, with dark atmosphere and an incredible actor: Joaquín Phoenix. His performance is very amazing.",1
1789,"Joker is an incredibly twisted and gritty movie about the tragic story of Arthur Fleck, a man who is constantly challenged by the society he lives in and goes on a dark path because of his countless misfortunes. The film's cinematography, acting and visuals are excellent, together along with the mesmerizing score. It is also a great character study of a mentally ill man who struggles with how he's mistreated on a daily basis and humiliated in the worst ways possible, whilst taking care of his sick mother. It may not be wholly original, however it pushes the industry to a new level of cinematography and storytelling.",1
1790,Good film. All of my friends like it. It is Best film of 2019! I was amasied!,1
1791,Masterpiece. Best movie of the year. Oscar deserves Joaquin Phoenix. Not opposite.,1
1792,"In my opiniom this movie is a phenomenon in category of super Heroes movies, i think it's must see!",1
1793,Excellent movie. Really sheds light on mental illness and the lack of individual responsibility we all take in acknowledging others’ struggles.,1
1794,A thought-provoking movie that tries to ask various questions about relations between an individual and society. Beautifully shot and well written.,1
1795,"It's a masterpiece. This is no ordinary movie. Such a beautiful cinematography, it's just perfect,the lighting the colors...just perfect. The soundtrack is so great and emotional.The acting is in a different kind of level,on top, i could say that Joaquinn's acting is not from this planet, so brilliant ! Everything comes together to this movie, it's so outstanding.",1
1796,"Joaquin Phoenix as Joker holds your heart in his hand throughout the film. The only words that come to mind when I try to describe this film is ""hauntingly beautiful"". There is such a tremendous amount of artistic value to this film and Joaquin Pheonix's rendition of the Joker.",1
1797,Loved the contents of it and it's one of the realest movies I've seen in forever,1
1798,-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,1
1799,Very good film for all family. My mom said that I hadcome in this world to bring happiness. And I will put on happy face on every person  in my town by the benis.,1
1800,"One of the best movies in years. Superb acting, cinematography and score. The movie leaves you reflecting on many things for days.",1
1801,Joker!!!....chilling terrific performance from joaquin phoenix. The last 20 minutes of the film was awesome.,1
1802,"If someone is trying to keep you from this masterpiece, they are doing you a disservice, no matter their motive.",1
1803,"One of the finest movies ever created...I loved the performance of Joaquin phoneix ,, he was truely exceptional,,,,",1
1804,"Nothing short of a masterpiece. There is no point in comparing Joaquin Phenix to Heath Ledger, both had their on take on the character and the movies are vastly different.But nonetheless, this is one of the greatest performances captured on film.",1
1805,I have no words. **** awesome! This film makes you empathize with the sick psycho that society has made.,1
1806,"Holly molly! This movie is truly a masterpiece, a version of Joker which didn't exist before. I can't wait for the sequel. If you haven't seen this movie. Go watch it it's worth every cent!",1
1807,Good movie Everyone needs to watch it good acting script and everything about it good,1
1808,"First off - **** you Stephanie from TiMe MaGAzInE. Why are you so salty in your review? You need to sit back and review yourself honestly. Joaquin’s performance was immersive as always. I liked the movie. It’s pretty much what you’d expect from the trailers so if you’re already triggered by those I’d advise you not to see it. Once you realize it’s just a movie though it’s pretty damn good. Also, no this movie is not going to “make people act like the joker” wtf? Whoever says that is retarded. The only people “acting like the joker” are mentally ill people and I’m sorry to break it to you but a movie will not give you a mental illness.",1
1809,This is the first time since very long where my expectations were exceeded for a big movie like this. joaquin phoenix just knocked it out of the park with his spectacular performance.,1
1810,"This movie was a masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix was amazing and Todd Phillips is a genius I love this movie it’s the best movie I’ve ever watched",1
1811,Believe the hype this film is a masterpiece. I've always loved the joker so I was extremely excited and had high hopes for this one. I'm happy to say it was damn sure worth it. Joaquin pheonix does the character pure justice. His performance is Oscar worthy. It's a bit slow start and if you go in thinking it's a full blown marvel style action movie you're gonna be disappointed. It's a drama thriller and a near perfect one. If you've seen films like taxi driver or king of comedy you will love this film. I really want to see a sequel but it ended perfectly so I wouldn't mind if it was a one and done film. It's excellent cinema go watch it!,1
1812,Superb lead performance at times disturbing and brutal but always engrossing,1
1813,"La mejor película que eh visto en mi vida, graciosa,casi me entra algo de tanto reír,le doy un 10.",1
1814,When I left the theater I was left with mixed emotions aw stricken because of the way the joker and his decent into madness into what he his and very impressed and wanting to re-watch it over and over again. This movie is very grounded in reality from the scenery and the amazing acting with a emotional performance from Joaquin Phoenix. It also gives a really dark a gritty tone that really make you feel. Overall a amazing cinematic experience,1
1815,"If you were expecting an action movie or a superhero movie, you will be disappointed! This is a real masterpiece. The acting, the screen play.. wow simply amazing! Some scenes are lengendary!",1
1816,A very unsettling film - the performances across the board are seared into your memory. No idea how or why there are so many 10 reviews here. What is going on?,1
1817,"If the movie left you feeling uncomfortable, it did its job. More than creating a villain with sympathetic motives, Joker has created a complex, complicated character with so much in common with the people living in today's cruel world. If Batman is a fairytale about a Billionaire saving Gotham, then Joker is the cold, ugly truth: that people like Bruce Wayne can never be a hero.",1
1818,"The best movie of any comic book universe, and the best movie of the year, while most of Comic book movies are just entertainment and CGI fest, Joker is real cinema, it's a masterclass in storytelling. People can watch the Joker without even knowing the character and freaking enjoy the movie. It's beautiful, haunting, terrifying, psychological.",1
1819,"Amazing movie!! Joker is just perfect. Joaquin Phoenix awesome, stunning actor!!! Hope he gets an Oscar!!",1
1820,Awesome movie! Far better and much more interesting/thought-provoking than the typical superhero movie that's cranked-out en masse these days. I will watch it again.,1
1821,"Wonderful acting by Joaquim Phoenix. This movie dives into the madness of a society that ignores and humiliates its poorest citizens, with some touches of humor, but most of the time really dark.",1
1822,Joker is perhaps the best movie of the year and it is worth watching because it tells a story that is both truly inspired and original.,1
1823,A mind blowing acting and one of the best screenplay and direction and a good Martin Scorsese's vibe just don't compare it to any of the Marvel movies because its way more better than marvels just no one accepts it.....,1
1824,A slow build thats worth the wait! Definitely buying a physical copy when its released.,1
1825,"If Taxi Driver and Requiem for a Dream had a son, it would be Joker. Maybe you will love it, maybe you will hate it, anyway you have to go see it.",1
1827,Compelling and dark. Joaquin Phoenix did an outstanding performance. Must watch,1
1828,Exelente pelicula de lo mejor del año. Lo que la hace más grandiosa es que a pesar del boicot mediático que intentaron hacerle está variando records.,1
1829,"We had a very good time at Joker. It's got a solid plot, a very strong performance from its titular protagonist and showed restraint from jump-scare violence or most of the stunts you might expect from a movie like this. I look forward to seeing it again.",1
1830,It was bad from beginning to end. Only a few funny parts. And the critics even got the score right,0
1831,"There's no denying the depth of Phoenix's performance, but it boils down to watching an entire movie featuring a tortured soul's life coming apart.  It is slow and grating, with some nod to the origin and interrelation of the Joker and Batman, but it's not worth the wait in the dark of the theater of of the Joke's life.  There is no real rhyme or reason to his elevation to folk hero for his murders, other than to introduce a ""commentary"" on the media's (now the  internet's) sudden ignition of wildfires of celebrity and the ""Resist"" movement in a bid for contemporary relevance. They should have introduced testimony from the woman on the train as to the dark side of the three ""preppy"" victims in order to make some sense of the riots, etc.  Without it, there's no reason for the uprisings.  Plus, I've got to say that the level of violence is way below what I expected in light of the controversy preceding the film's release. I was actually just at the point of asking the usher how long was left in the film (I was thinking of leaving) when it ended.  Should have asked earlier.",0
1832,"Not interesting, a failed attempt to explain the Joker's sick mind. They passed away.",0
1833,"Slow film. And dangerous for some insane persons. However, Joaquín Phonix Is The best of The film. There are so much better films.",0
1835,"Kind of like a derivative Taxi Driver fused with Clockwork Orange, only slightly made watchable by Phoenix playing a crazy person. Basically a pointless exercise with no redeeming value.",0
1836,"It doesn't respect to the source material so if you expect a comic accurate Joker origin story you'll be disappointed. There are some nods to different storylines of the Joker but not enough to make us feel like we are watching ""The Clown Prince of Crime"". Only thing really shines about this movie is Phoenix's acting performance. Basically it's a descending into madness story with borrowed popularity of The Joker.",1
1839,Joker Is A Great Movie That Shows Arthur Fleck Was A Normal Person And That Beast (Joker) Made  By The Gotham's Crueling Behavior With Him And A SPECIAL Thanks To Joaquin Phoenix That He Played Well And Held The Legacy Of Joker After Heath Ledger,1
1840,"reason signin in this siteJoker is a symbol of honesty and courage, not a negative characterJoker means complete wisdomThe man who demands justice with his madmanviva Jokers",1
1841,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, joker is really a rollercoaster of emotions. From the beautifully shot frames to the intense yet simplistic soundtrack. Joaquin Phoenix is is captivating, never once did I want to take my eyes off the screen. This movie definitely deserves an Oscar.",1
1842,"Joker es la película basada de un cómic más poderosa, bella y trascendental desde El Caballero de la Noche de Christopher Nolan. La belleza de Joker está envuelta por una ambientación tétrica, depresiva, caótica, en una ciudad sucia, corrompida política y socialmente. Todo esto converge con un sentimiento poderoso de humanidad a través de los ojos de un hombre solitario, dolido y quebrantado.Hay dos puntos que me gustaría resaltar, primero, esta cinta puede parecer pretenciosa para algunas personas, hay mucho diálogo de exposición que resaltan lo obvio, empero, hay momentos sin diálogo que, a través de la música, de la fantástica fotografía y de la magistral interpretación de Joaquin Phoenix, la audiencia puede apreciar la caída de Arthur y el nacimiento de su alter ego, el Joker. -la escena del baile en el baño es un claro ejemplo de lo anterior-. La crudeza de las imágenes, la violencia, y una clara crítica al sistema capitalista hacen de Joker una cinta compleja y para nada olvidable. Es bastante obvia la inspiración sacada del maestro Scorsese en sus cintas “Taxi Driver” y “El Rey de la Comedia” -ambas interpretadas por Robert De Niro que también aparece en esta cinta-. Segundo, ignoren la controversia sobre la tonta idea de que esta cinta incita a la sociedad a cometer actos ilícitos, los críticos solo analizan la forma pero ignoran el fondo, lo cual es triste pues esta película transmite valiosos, bestiales y poderosos mensajes que son de gran relevancia en la actualidad.",1
1843,Amazing.    .,1
1844,"I'm happy to say that Joker did not disappoint. I went to see this film with quite high of expectations and still came out of the cinema impressed. Sound design, acting and the story itself are all responsible for me making a decision to watch this film again. As soon as possible.",1
1845,"This is a joke, right? How can Joker have a 59 overall from these wack-ass critics? No dude, no. This is the best film I've seen in the past decade. His performance: amazingThe cinematography: mind-blowingThe score: perfectHOW DOES THIS HAVE A 59 on metacritic? Something is wrong here. Go see it, best film of the year, you'll truly believe his arc from sad crazy loser to happy crazy winner.",1
1846,I can't begin to describe how much I enjoyed this movie. I sincerely don't understand the critics.Go see this movie!!!,1
1847,ÓTIMO FILME. Mostrar a historia do coringa (eu não sou fã de batman) é muito legal e o filme retrata bem a formação de assassinos. RECOMENDO.,1
1848,"Amazing movie, very entretaining, very good acting, the Joker character is portrayed perfectly and very nice soundtrack.",1
1849,"Hands down an absolute masterpiece, never has there been a comic book movie with this much soul.",1
1850,"loved this movie, if they do another i know it will be just as good or if not then it would be an amazing stand alone",1
1851,"Everything you expect from the DC universe, from a batman villain, from the Joker character. Just fantastic.",1
1852,"Joker isn't a ""Batman"" film, it's a deep and harrowing journey into mental illness and the human condition we've creates for ourselves.This film scares people, it shakes the establishment to its very core and it has politically biased journalists and news media quaking in their boots over the strong and thought-provoking message this film masterfully delivers.Look at the critic reviews compared to the user reviews. Judge for yourself.",1
1853,The best movie in the world !!! Metacritic 59 re you crazy!!! I think the critic is really bad this movie is really asom i love it !!!,1
1854,"The Joker makes its move on the brokenness of capitalism at a crucial moment. Gritty period uptown scenes, turbulent low strings, powerful method acting. Believable.",1
1855,Masterpiece. Everybody should watch it! Don't read idiot critics reviews. Go and enjoy it!,1
1856,"Best movie of dc till now , most amazing acting ever dc need to make joker 2 with Joaquin Phoenix and other crew it will be awesome.",1
1857,"Best movie ever , every one most watch it.i loved Joaquin Phoenix performance He is amazing.",1
1858,"Masterpiece movie of the decade to influence generations.Joker is a Traumatizing psychological drama/thriller that puts the spotlight on a comic book villian called joker.Though the movie is inspired by the comic world which is imaginary, the movie feels real and authentic. Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil. The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.Joker might be one of the darkest movies made in decades but definitely deserves to be watched with patience and attention because it's one of the few movies that besides giving audience entertainment it tries to make people think.",1
1859,Definitely my favourite movie of 2019 and a real masterpiece of acting and story,1
1860,The best Joker acting since Jack Nicholson. So deep and detailed emotion expressions. Dancing scenes absolutely gorgeus. Real masterpiece of 2019!,1
1861,Disturbing as it is enticing. An atmospheric film that triumphs at rendering hopelessness and insanity,1
1862,"This movie is my favourite superhero movie of all time and one of my favourite movies of all time. Joaquin-phoenix (the actor who plays the joker) is outstanding. This movie is a perfect joker origin story and perfect story of how a man in real life can end up losing his sh***. This movie is violent dark and does not hold back and I love every second of it. Do not watch this movie if your a Democrat,liberal,SJW,Feminist, or is easily triggered by violence. This is a movie for a person who is mentally mature. Not just mature in age.",1
1863,"It's Just amazing, indescribable. The movie is interesting from start to finish.",1
1864,"So fascinating,thrilling,entertaining and violent in a very amazing way.Phoenix is mesmerizing and utterly captivating.Definitely the best movie of the year and one of the best of all times.",1
1865,"the performance by Joaquin Phoenix is truly an acting benchmark for the movie industry and all other actors; the organic and realistic way in which they've created a villian is the best I've seen ever, you can easily tell the script writer knows a good deal about psychology, and cinematographicaly speaking this movie is quite the masterpiece!",1
1866,"I think some people in the theater, okay most of the people, were confused why I was laughing. Well they will all get the joke one day.",1
1867,"It was great, one of the best movies i've seen, as I was watching I felt like I was him it made me hurt when he hurted, when he was happy i was happy so it really had some effect on me.",1
1868,"Joker é bom; mas não é tudo isso, é um filme que carece de uma emoção e de uma caminhada que cative, o filme tenta ser complexo e profundo mas só o que consegue é uma abordagem seca e sem filtro, no final das contas a única coisa que vale a pena aqui é atuação de Joaquin Phoenix,um filme que só tem uma boa atuação não faz dele automaticamente bom",1
1869,"Best DC movie since The Dark Knight. Tense, emotional and has a touch of realism.",1
1870,"First off, Joaquin Phoenix murders his Joker role.Joker is an uncomfortable watch, but fascinating too. Bleak, vicious and bruising, it might be a slow-burner, but the punchline is well worth waiting for.",1
1871,"Man, holy **** I don't why I waited so long to see this. This film isn't even about the joker, it's about Arthur. It's so good. future me, when you forget about it, this a really good **** movie",1
1872,It was amazing i loved every bit of it!! Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor!! I’d say he plays the joker very well!,1
1873,"Great  Cinematography, Shady Dark Ugly Retro settings, and music was good for normal person. I didn’t think to get such a Violent Deep scary movie from a director who directed all funny movies like The Hangover series..!! Secondly the name of Movie was quite oppotise to story. No doubt, ground breaking performance by Jaoquin. The person who lost his  20kg wight for pscyhc role.  Story of  Arthur Fleck ( Joker) A person who has history of multiple psychic disorders because of his horrible childhood, his mother also faced some mental issues. Arthur chooses to express his anger by killing the bad people, who didn't understood his mental condition, disporportional laugh according to situations.His expression of intolerance starts with killings of 3 men in a subway teasing a girl in a metro then his collegue who guides him in wrong way to take away his job,  then his colleague, his mom, then kills his favourite host of a famous reality show who uses people like him and mean while his expression of suppression gives him craze in old suppressed society which makes Joker feels Proud about him and ends up killing Thomas Wayne, the mayor of  Gotham and finally lands him in a Psychiatric ward. #PersonalOpinion: I think, there are two ways to express extreme level of  depression, one is by killing yourself ( Sucide), other is by killing those, who are reason of your depression. People reach at this Extreme level, when we ignore them, we don't listen what they exactly want to say, what they want us to understand, we simply assume more, reach at conculsions. If our so called civilized society will continue, this behaviour with one another, it will lead to a dark, disorganized and full of people with paradoxical laughter only.",1

1880,"Without a doubt the movie of the decade. Phenomenal performance from Joaquin Phoenix - his ability to slowly depict Arthur's decent into insanity is both unsettling and brilliant. Of course the movie wouldn't be complete without all other parts of the crew, and with Todd Philips in control, makes for some of the most impressive visuals cinema has ever seen. Not to mention the beautiful composition from Hildur Guðnadóttir which sets a perfect tone for the direction of the movie. 10/10.",1

1892,"The movie ""Joker"" presents the story of another side of the DCU's anti-hero character, named ""The Joker"". The movie has some similarities with the comics, but the idea of construction of a different and unique joker is amazing. During the show, it takes place the transformation and fall of Arthur Fleck, which is becoming later, the renowned character. The action takes place in the Gotham City, as dark as this one can be, and makes the people wondering what is real and what is not. This way, the mind of the protagonist can be more easily understood. The movie is original, dark, realistic and deserves a sequel for sure.",1
1893,"Stunning acting from Joaquin Phoenix. Great movie.The story of the life of a modern man in a society where only one person's identity is how much zero he has in his bank account, how much money he has.the money is power.

His impressive skills are diluted by repetition, the movie just alternates between socially awkward scenes and shots of him shirtless so we can see his ribs.The movie and story is extremely boring.  The other characters in the movie could be replaced by cardboard cutouts, as they add nothing to the experience; the 'Fight Club girlfriend' was uninspired and a let down.There aren't many movies that I wish I hadn't gone to see, and this is one of them.",0
1900,"An absolute masterstroke of a film. Joachim Phoenix knocks the performance out of the park as the film explores the monsters that society itself creates. You can't help but sympathise with the Joker, even as you are horrified by his acts.

1908,"This is going to be one of those posts where I go against the mainstream but my reaction when I watched this movie was: You got to be f… kidding me?The only resemblance to the REAL joker in this movie is the name. As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.The “Joker” in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.The REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.The movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it’s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.However, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that’s Hollywood today.That the politically biased and elitist so called “critics” on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy “review” site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.",0
1909,"Ce type-là, ce clochard, ce pauvre hère lamentable, ce simple maniaco-dépressif est censé... être... le fameux, l'illustre Joker ?! les bras m'en tombent ! mais de toute façon, c'est quoi ce film social à la mords-moi-le-noeud où il ne se passe strictement... rien ? à part une sorte de soubresaut au bout d'une heure et demi... et encore !C'est quoi ce misérabilisme à deux balles ? franchement, ça fait pitié, le Joker fait pitié, tout le film fait pitié... et c'est carrément insultant pour le personnage lui-même qui n'avait jamais demandé pareil traitement... Non, le Joker, c'est Nicholson dans Batman : frappadingue, taré, excentrique, drôle, cinglé, très dangereux et le genre de type qui a du charisme à revendre dans sa folie psychotique...Ce n'est pas cette larve qu'on constate et voit et méprise dans ce pseudo-film psychodramatique qui se regarde le nombril à dormir debout pendant deux heures ! non seulement, c'est chiant mais c'est surtout carrément insultant pour l'un des meilleurs méchants de la culture populaire.Ce film, cet ersatz de film n'a absolument aucun intérêt et le gars Phoenix s'est avili et ridiculisé là-dedans comme un pauvre tocard.

In reality it’s a bear bones take on an indie movie. That has simple themes that people think “big brain” too much joker 7/10,0
1917,"What a huge disappointment, I was expecting so much more!The movie sets out to sell me a point that's already sold, namely that a society that forgets and marginalizes have-nots is a bad idea, even leaving ethics alone. People robbed of all hope and with nothing to lose, will not play by the rules, it's something Dickens made crystal clear in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" almost two centuries ago.And yet the protagonist almost manages to sway me towards the despicable Thomas Wayne's selfish, paternalistic plutocracy. Fortuna may be Imperatrix Mundi, but you are rarely completely powerless in the face of events. Arthur is unlucky, but not as much as he thinks. Just like you are not fit to be an angel for Victoria's Secret if you are an obese, ugly, middle-aged man, you are not fit to be a stand-up comedian if you are a tragically unfunny guy, with a condition that makes you break up in laughter at the worst possible moment. Wanna make one of those schmaltzy, inspirational movies about pursuing a dream in the face of adversity? Well, the people in those, WORK HARD to fulfil their dream. Arthur does absolutely nothing but wallow in excessive self-pity, while smoking one cigarette after the other after the other after the other after the other... does he accept any job to make ends meet, while perfecting his act? Oh noes, that would be sooo below him. He's ""made to spread joy onto the world"", so he should be handed his dream on a plate. And hey, he's too busy pitying himself to get a new job, after he lost the one he had because of *his* incredible stupidity. But no, it's not his fault, right? It's society's, and mainly rich people's, so he's perfectly right in spending his days crying and smoking and laughing maniacally.Really, I'm so angry that a perfectly valid message gets wasted this way! If you really are interested in some good and lucid social analysis, I suggest you watch something by Ken Loach, it's a world apart in quality.",0
1918,"This movie is a masterpiece. Yet it is hard to process, it actually makes you think; I had, to about this movie and my opinion about it for at least a hour to know, kind of, what’s my opinion about it. The reason why people are saying it’s a bad movie it’s because they’re confused and scared, talking from personal experience, since they find frightening that we can actually relate to such a messed up character or show, not approval, but understanding of some of his horrible actions. But that’s the beauty of it. It doesn’t say “no, no, no this is bad and that is good”, it says “I know this might seem bad, but is it THAT bad?” and it plays around with your thoughts, this movie actually challenges your beliefs. Joker is NOT a superhero movie, it’s a drama one.The acting in every single character is convincing, yet Joaquin Phoenix might’ve overacted in 1 or 2 scenes, but then that’s just it, that’s as bad as it gets, obviously, excluding the fact this movie is NOT for sensitive people, it might be too realistic and dark for them, since the kills ARE cold blooded, it’s just like “POOM, that guy’s dead now, his entire life just ended, meaninglessly and it’s your fault”. The good thing about it being THAT realistic is that you are not entirely sure about everything, like those moments in life where there’s this version that seems more likely, yet there’s still this other version that can be possible, and you just believe in the first option, since it’s more probable, even if you have no proof about it or that “proof” you have could’ve been easily manipulated; that extra layer of realism, plus the acting, makes you feel like you’re seeing a real person, not Joaquin Phoenix acting as the Arthur Fleck. You can see and feel that Joaquin Phoenix gave his all to this role. There’s symbolism  within the art, which would be the movie, of course(every movie is art). That symbolism being when Arthur is a thoughtful person, but is mistreated, he walks upstairs in dejection, meaning that he is, morally, a good man, but he just doesn’t feel good about himself and he’s empty. But when he is the exact opposite of that, non the less he is treated like an icon, he walks downstairs in joy, meaning that when he forgets about morality and does whatever he wants, he feels relieved and actually, for once in his life, happy, even if it means becoming not even the shadow of what he used to be, morally and ethically. The music blends in perfectly in every scene, it might overload the feeling of sadness in some parts, but then again this IS a drama movie.The backstory of the joker being told ruins NOTHING at all, it still gives you a great character. To make a good movie doesn’t always mean that the character has to learn to be a better version of himself, or improve, to make a good movie you have to see the development of that character into what he came to be and at least have compassion for him and that’s what joker did. It’s not about the ending, it’s about the route that the character took towards that ending. This story is NOT venerating violence, it’s a warning of how people end up like that and it tells you to be careful, while telling you a story of how Arthur Fleck is neither white or black, he is just man who never got to take a break in life, even though he always tried to show the best of himself, it was just never enough, so he just gave up and out of fear he committed horrible/regrettable actions. He just snapped. You get to know his ambitions, dreams and current state from the beginning of the movie in the result that’ll make you have compassion for him, so in moments where he commits a horrible act you feel disappointed, yet still have hope for his redemption. We normally see the redemption or rise of the character at the epilogue of the movies, but this one is here to show us that’s not always like that and that it shouldn’t be.Joker is a messed up masterpiece.",1
1919,"Fantastic acting, fantastic music, fantastic movie. Finally a breath of fresh air from all other comic movies.",1
1920,"Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.",1
1921,"Not your regular entertainment any means. Quite hard to watch, as we see a regular Joe abused and demeaned until...well you know. It has excellent production values and is very well acted. Phoenix is perfectly cast being a serious oddball in real life anyway. It's basically a remake of a Taxi Driver/The King of Comedy mash-up. Good but a bit overrated.",1

I’m glad I did, as very soon everything starts to fit just right and despite it is definitely is not a “fast action movie”, the 140 minutes of it didn’t feel too long at all. The only ”downside” - I will never look at the Joker and the Wayne family the same - nothing is black and white anymore. But I think that this was the idea in the first place...",1
1926,"Breathtaking. Stunning. Gorgeous. Phoenix delivers a true masterpiece. Honestly, I cannot understand the current 56 score on Critics reviews. Even with quite some licenses which divert from the comic material, the writers kept the soul essence of the comic Joker intact. Probably the most accurate depiction of the “Classic” DC Joker, ironically from the movie which more deviates from the source material.",1
1927,"A masterpiece for a standalone movie, bring a new version of joker in more realistic way. This joaquin's joker version is simple yet so real kind of a joker that u can find in your everyday life. The story is so deep and dark like what dc movie should be, and that's the point. One thing that todd missed here is, the real joker is a mastermind supervillain. Joker is a genius level archenemy of batman, that could beat batman anytime but he wont. Despite of that, this movie is insane !",1
1928,"The Joker is a stand-alone film outside the DC Universe which is an origin story for the Batman villain. I don't think that since The Rocky Horror Picture Show's sequel Shock Treatment that I've had such a conflict over how I feel about a film. I think I equally like and dislike this movie.First off, I'll confirm most of the good things that everyone's been saying: This has some very interesting looks at wealth inequality, the failings of mental health care, what can cause the result of psychopathic attacks, and the basic human apathy and failure of humankid to take care of itself in general. There are a lot of really top notch lines and scenes in this. The final act is something. It leaves quite the impression.The whole things looks great. Director Todd Phillips provides such an impressive look and sound to the film. Some great cinematography. Dirty, crowded, crime-laden Gotham looks great. Both score and song selections really guide the mood.Again I must parrot what everyone's saying: Joaquin Phoenix delivers what could be an Oscar-winning performance as the lead. He is so nuanced and excels at making you feel uncomfortable. Joaquin has such a unique body language in this. This version of the Joker has a condition where he can laugh uncontrollably, and the actor does a great job of making it feel realistic and unpleasant. He also appears to have lost a lot of weight in this. The Joker is traditionally portrayed as a skinny feller but here the movie uses this to make the character feel at times downright primal or sickly, matching his mental state.However, the movie should not have been two hours long. In order to show the events that create the Joker, Phillips over-compensates and throws way too many plot points at the guy. There are moments that are quite tedious, especially in the middle. There is a also a subplot I was really not found of that reeks of uninspired fan-fiction.To be honest, this was such a grounded piece by superhero comic standards that it could've been a non-comic book film. Yeah, DC is trying to show that these films can be more prestigious and serious, but by taking out the over-the-top parts of the superhero genre, I feel we may lose what made them special in the first place.This is the first real comic supervillain movie. (Venom's movie was an anti-hero flick.) But taking the comics into account: his isn't the first attempt to redo a supervillain's origina story. I feat that a lot of these stories frustratingly tend to recycle concepts and this is no exception. These include: 1) Make the villain's story darker than previous incarnations. 2) Have one of their few connections be with a mother and/or romantic interest or fixation (Zazie Beets' character could've been cut out of this completely without changing anything).Considering that this is about a burgeoning psychopath, you can probably guess, but just to confirm: this is a REALLy dark movie. Violence doesn't happen all the time but when it does: Whoo-boy! Phillips has publicly mentioned that the films of Scorses, such as Taxi Driver and The Comedian, greatly influenced him. So, be forewarned if that's not your thing.I really had a hard time deciding on the rating for this. On one hand, Phillips, who has directed comedies up till now, surprisingly pulls off quite a confident, intriguing cinematic experience. The movie managed to elicit an emotional response from me that very few films have. However, the issues I mentioned prevented me from loving this or watching a second time. Some of the theater audience at the end clapped, but I personally don't think the movie was strong enough to justify that.",1
1929,Three words: American Psycho 3   If you watch the movie you know what I mean.,1
1930,"Although surrounded by controversy. The movie is a simple but engaging dark Peek at a man surrounded by a bad world finally letting go of being normal... To the detriment of the rest of the city. While some of the content might be relative to curent events or sentiment, its dairly a political outside of thgeneric poor people and rich people divide and its never really the focus of the story. Arthur Fleck steals the show as a sad but ultimately haunting and detached figure. Over all 9s foe the acting and filming and score and the movie itswlf is a solid 8. Not enjoyable... But engaging 2 hours felt like 1 and i was left wamtimg to see more of this take on joker.",1

1939,"For decades now, the comic book genre has always seen spectacle, fantasy, powers and it's mostly fantastical. However, in recent years, we have seen them evolve and try to put characters in the front, there have been many great deep character moments in the genre with films from; 'The Dark Knight' (2008), 'Logan' (2017) and even 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019) focusing greatly on characters dealing with the situations they are in with those respective stories. Enter 'Joker', the latest standalone DC film from director Todd Phillips ('The Hangover') and he uses Joaquin Phoenix in the title role to tell this story of a man named Arthur Fleck. Arthur lives a very quiet, if not, insignificant life as a clown who holds up sale signs, he aspires to be a stand-up comedian and lives in a small apartment with his mother whose mental issues seem to pass onto him. Every night, Arthur and his mother like to watch ""Live with Murray Franklin"", and enjoy watching the talk show host Franklin (Robert DeNiro) bringing a sense of light and fun into their lives. The movie mainly focuses greatly on Arthur, and his turn from socially awkward individual, into a psychologically damaged sociopath. He has a condition which makes him laugh out loud uncontrollably in awkward situations, and he gets medication regularly to keep him sane. However, when a series of bad things happen to him day after day, and nothing seems to improve, Arthur then begins to question if it's him that's the problem, or is it the outside world. The film is appropriately bleak, and sets a very uncomfortable tone, with Phillips deliberately holding onto long shots for extended periods of time to create a sense of unease. Not to mention that you do feel bad for Arthur, the movie is very much told from his point of view, so you come to understand why Arthur behaves the way he does, not that it's justified, but it's in the nature of his character. As you know, the Joker has an infamously non-existent origin story. We just know him as a deranged clown who murders for the thrill. Here, Phillips has given the character, not only a name, but a plausible origin story that could work as a prequel to 'The Dark Knight' (2008), with some things altered here and there, of course. Phoenix is also terrific in the role, as his presence makes you feel unclean and uncomfortable, his voice and mannerisms convey a sympathetic sociopath, and there is even some subtlety to it as well. He doesn't try too hard to chew up the scenery, he just behaves appropriately to the environment that surrounds him. Not since the late Heath Ledger, have we seen this iconic Batman villain portrayed with such skill. Placing a comic book character and grounding him in a more realistic reality, just as James Mangold did to Wolverine with 'Logan' (2017), was definitely a smart move. It will remind you of two Scorsese classics such as; 'Taxi Driver' (1976) and 'The King of Comedy' (1982), both of which also star Robert DeNiro. I think it's great that the comic book genre was able to arrive at a point to tell a psychopathic story, we've never seen that in this genre before. Who knows when it will be the next time we see another comic film like this, but the fact that they can mix it up means this genre can bring surprises and is here to stay.",1
1940,"Audio and video effects: 8 few scenes, but there are many vistas of the scene, the protagonist is delicate and close-up, the face emotions are obviously capturedRhythm of the plot: 7 The overall slow spread, for the climax of the back, the mood is too strong, does not clearly express the wisdom of the clown character, but the charm is full, there is no gorgeous scene with the stage name, but the small person gesture is close to the audience, the bloody darkness is not brought to the individual Gotham City level.Actor acting: 9.5 distinctive dance twists and strange and uncomfortable laughter, with the undulating performances of various stages of the plot, the multi-scene exposed thin and thin body contrasts with increasing pressure, the action of painting the clown makeup many times is considered The plot is high, but the hard part is that there is no makeup to interpret the increasingly distorted situation.",1

1943,"Just like with a multitude of other films, we see again that our technocracy, obsessed with laundering money into censorship-based special interests, digital surveillance, and military intervention, also has its claws deeply entrenched in art/film reviews- as it has, esp since the advent of Project Mockingbird, which never got more than a slap on the wrist for it's activities. Only in fascist countries do the financial elite try and shackle, completely propagandize the creative process, reduce it purely to politics- and in our case, also clickbait headlines for social media 'engagement' i.e. ad revenue. It's manipulative and degenerative, and until the root of the problem is addressed, namely authoritarian control of the press w almost no transparency, oversight, or accountability- and digital, algorithmic suppression of alternative points of view- you will see what you do with the Joker- a very good film, which wins awards, people enjoy as a majority, but that CIA/Pentagon/Silicon Valley mouthpiece news critics, placed on high on their neoliberal/neocon pedestals for either side of the reactonary circus, will always be ready to try and ram some other idea of a film, book, music down everyone's throat, not because it's what they think, but because they are hired PR goons paid to anger people for maximum coverage. It makes it all less enjoyable, totally degrades the experience all around. If you are sick of seeing this happen- look into #1vs5i . Whether on the net, or on YT- genuine films like the Joker need to be received with genuine journalism- not revolving-door fascism.",1

This Joker that just dances non stop after finding his real self is brilliant. No doubt worthy of Ledger's legacy. Outstanding movie.,1
1953,"Joker its a great movie! That's what happens when Warner Bros. does not prevent the creator from creating art. Joaquin Phoenix perfectly played psychologically sick person, living in a rotten, gloomy and cruel Gotham. In general, I can safely say that the film is a masterpiece and after a year it will become a classic, and those who did not go to it, then be sure to ALWAYS go, you will not regret it.",1
1954,An amazing adaption of the joker. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is outstanding. The movie is really deep and psychological. I just watched it and i already want to watch it again.,1
1955,"Joker is a brilliantly constructed film. The character development of Arthur is something to behold and by the time the film ends, it is almost unbelievable that it is the same actor portraying the stories protagonist. I am shocked by the reviews of some of the critics who are supposed to be 'in the known' of what makes a movie a classic. It actually makes you wonder whether some of them even watched it...",1
1956,"This movie is a masterpiece. I am convinced that Joaquin Phoenix is the greatest actor to ever live. When watching this movie you are watching Arthur, not an actor. My heart was racing throughout the majority of this film. Arthur is unpredictable. In fact everything is unpredictable. No matter what your expectations are, this movie is not what you expect. You are not watching a DC film. You are not watching a movie about the classic villain we've all come to know and love. This movie is about a man who you may think loses himself, or finds himself. I think that he was only able to find himself after losing himself. But the one thing that makes this Joker so unique is that he's human. You can see the man behind the makeup, a man who's just hurting.""The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave like you don't have one"" - Joker",1
1957,"Épico demais, toda a arte nesse filme é incrível, principalmente a fotografia acho q nunca um filme tão lindo.",1
1958,Fantastic performance. The entire film is mesmerizing - beautiful yet ugly. It’s not set in reality but touches our reality so closely that it will leave you thinking for days.,1
1959,Absolutely must watch. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an oscar. A deep critic about society.,1
1960,"There is only one honk in the movie, so it's only a 9.5/10.Truly great movie, it doesn't get boring at any point and it's canon too. Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, great story and great moments. I can see how many people will get inspired by this movie, and why the rich are so upset with this movie (a.k.a. the ""expert"" critics. I seriously hope journalists get massively fired to experience what poverty is like and why this isn't just another cliched movie but a masterpiece.And no, I'm not a ""Stupid hateful guy"". I'm a CS student, so apart of HONK HONK I'm gonna say you should learn how to code before we finally kick you out of power.",1
1961,The more you think about thus movie the more you'll appreciate the experience.,1
1962,Great movie. Maybe too slow for some people but really glad they made a joker origin story that was realistic. I wonder how good batman could be if it was rated R,1
1963,"In movie hero have a problem with head and bad society ignore him, move can share how people can be bad for people, and what was when WB don't touch and give imagination interesting creator to do GREAT MOVIE",1
1964,"Cinematography, lighting, score, the acting, it was amazing. Joaquin Phoenix poured his heart out in this one and I implore any and everyone to watch the movie. Support this film so we can get more masterclasses such as this.",1
1965,Wonderful movie and deserved every penny from the price of ticket. Joaquin Phoenix was sensational.,1
1966,One of the best movies I have watched this year. All the performances were fantastic. Jacquine Phoenix has done a incredible job. The direction was good. Background I also loved it.,1
1967,"Instant classic, without a doubt one of my top 5 all-time movies. JP keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Love the shock factor as well in unexpected moments througout the film.",1
1968,Just the masterpiece we deserved...now joker can finally rest as the best movie of the year.,1
1969,Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix.. dark movie i can see why he became the Joker,1
1970,"I can resiliently say that Joker is a movie the world needed.  Most critics get carried away by political, personal and sometimes illicit influences as they review it.  In this way it presents a disturbed view of masterful works.  Joker touches delicate subjects in a way that is rarely seen in today's theaters. If the world can't handle a profound work like, then it means the world needs to change. And change the way we view complex social issues, which we prefer to isolate it from debate because of the high diversity of opinion.  Very well built and set, Joker brings big holes that society has, and are covered.",1
1971,This film will go down as one of the greatest ever made. It is a master class in all aspects. Phoenix has EARNED his Oscar.,1
1972,A masterpiece that for some reason is being greatly misunderstood by both audiences and critics alike. Get behind this film.,1
1973,"This was not type of movie I would usually enjoy, and yet I cannot stop thinking about it, it's a piece of art.",1
1974,"Great film. A master class on direction, action and film music. Phillips expertly weaves it all together.",1

1976,"Score: 9.8/10Go into the cinema thinking it is a movie about a mentally disabled person. IGNORE THE DC WORLD or anything related to comics. If they do not give an oscar to joaquin phoenix for his performance as a mentally disabled person, it will only prove to me that the academy understands nothing about films. Everything is amazing, it is a drama, it puts your head in a position of being uncomfortable and it makes you think hard. Visuals, sounds and music are exceptionally executed. Love comics and this film makes justice on its own, telling the origin story of the joker. Although some parts new mixed with prior versions, it works phenomenally.",1
1977,"Una excepcional muestra de la realidad de muchos, que el joker ha ejecutado al extremo.",1
1978,Incredible. Better than anything marvel has produced. Joaquin is great Phillips is great Im asthonished by the work done here. There is a love to moment and my pp hard.,1
1979,This movie is a MASTERPIECE. Joaquin is AWESOME! WHAT A MOVIE! This is the Joker Origin that we deserved.,1
1980,A great commentary on how as we as a society deal with mental illness - Joaquin Phoenix was scary good in this one.,1
1981,"Joker is such a powerful film which at a certain point makes you feel uncomfortable, showing you what you don't want to see about society. With a stunning performance by Joaquin Phoenix and an amazing direction by Todd Phillips, this is one of the greatest films of the year.",1
1982,"Filme perfeito para TODO público exceto para meia dúzia de críticos mimizentos que não correspondem a 0,0001 dos expectadores. Chorem... O filme é um sucesso.",1

1986,"Dont listen to the critics, this is an amazing film I thought it was great.",1
1987,"Mindbending, strong acting, goosebumps , shocking and a must watch movie.   .",1
1988,First thing Joaquin phoenix is spectacular.And Never expected this from Todd Phillips.Still the movie has some flaws but they overwritten by many more good things we should look up to.,1
1989,The movie did a great job to making myself feel the emotion & also swayed to the unreliable narration by the arthur himself. It left us thinking with the open ending which story is true / not. In the end this is the Joker movie that has been lived up my expectation where his past has a multiple version and stay mysterious. The soundtrack is awesome & the cinematography just astoundingly beautiful. Joaquin Phoenix performance was awesome as I predicted & I can't wait to see his future movie he will work  soon.,1
1990,"Was it dark, yes, was it violent, yes, was it incredible, hell yes. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely brilliant and this film is a must see.",1
1991,Dark and intense this movie is definitely movie of the year ................,1
1992,Really shines a light on mental health and shows his descent to madness .a must see,1
1993,"It's very thought provoking, insightful and challenges one's thinking. They built his character very well and found myself sympathetic to him. It's not for the faint of heart, easily disturbed or the ignorant.",1
1994,"The press rating for this film is so incredibly wrong. This movie is uncomfortable to watch in the absolute best way. The message in the film is what is offending these ""critics"". They are sitting in their multi-million dollar homes, and don't like what the film has to say about the rich. Cry me a river critics...",1
1995,This movie is a deep character study about a guy suffering from mental illness. But this movie is also about the clown prince of crime so don't go in expecting that this is a light-hearted tale. This movie is for entertainment and it shouldn't be taken too seriously. And this movie is about the clown prince of crime so if you are one of those people who can't stomach hard hitting honesty this movie isn't for you,1
1996,"A beautiful masterpiece highlighting the internal struggles all of us face as human beings (isolation, depression, failure) compounded with the devastating effects of living in a society.The story of Arthur Fleck is not unlike your typical loner/outcast. He is a simple man with dreams and a good heart. However, dreams can't fall short and hearts can blacken. The people in Arthur's life are selfish, cruel, and humiliating to the point of corrupting Arthur into the anti-hero we know and love, Joker.Joker's message isn't a political statement. It isn't meant to sound any alarms. It's the purest form of rebellion against the society that cast him down: chaos.In this character-driven movie that takes its time and leaves you clutching at the edge of your seat, you will be absorbed in the waking nightmare of a desolate soul. The level of tension this movie brings is indescribable. It is a must see for anyone thrown into the thorny clutches of society, ready and willing to drag themselves out. Thank you Todd Phillips. Thank you.BOTTOM TEXT",1
1997,"Una obra maestra, soundtrack, actuación... Todo, no puedo hacer más que recomendarla.",1
1998,"Firstly for majority of people who are thinking that it's a super villain movie with action so it's not . the basic plot is based on how Aurthur a real comedian goes thorough series of events that lead him to be what he is now and that's ""JOKER"". Storyline. ",1
1999,A mix of elements from films like American Psycho set within the background of Gotham. This film allows the audience to see who the man is behind the mask for themselves.,1
2000,這個世界上的每一個人都應該要看這部電影。另外美術攝影劇本全都是最高水準！,1
2001,It was the best movie I have seen in 2019. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely crushed it. It is a wonderful piece of art. The musical score is also phenomenal and works with the movie really well. Phoenix's laugh was so on point it was terrifying at times. PLease do me a favor and by all means go out and watch it.,1
2002,"Joaquin Phoenix interpretou o personagem a 100%, uma das melhores interpretação que vi até hoje num filme!Um filme completamente diferente de todos os outros que vi até agora, de certeza será um exemplo para filmes de origem de personagens no futuro!Merece um Oscar sem dúvida!",1
2003,"This movie was an amazing inside view of what could lead to a murderer. Critics are scared to speak the truth due to the violence depicted. However, violence and humanity go hand in hand. It has been this way from the beginning of time. It makes you take a hard look at the insufficiencies in our society and hopefully gives us hope to fix our future.",1
2004,Very good movie. Awesome acting Joaquin Phoenix.The character development is believable,1
2005,"Gran cinematografía, gran actuación, va ganar el Oscar. Calidad grandiosa de Phoenix.",1
2006,One of the best movies I've seen ever since The Dark Knight and one of the very few that doesn't give a **** about your political views or feelings. I hope we get a batman movie that continues from this point.,1
2007,Just reviewing becasue cinema critics seem to be out of touch with cinema. The film is a fu**ing masterpiece.,1
2008,"Following in the paths of truly great movies like Taxi Driver and The Dark Knight, Joker (2019) is an in depth character study, with an electrifying performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Forget how superhero movies make you feel. Forget that you're even going to watch a superhero movie. Joker is one of the most realistic and effective take on a villain that has been put up on the big screen for ages. Technically solid, Joker again showcases why Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors working today and why The Joker is probably the most interesting comic book villain.The transition from a lonely loser to nothing less than a freedom fighter is depicted with style and vigour, the yellow and blue pallete, the nightscape of a very realistic Gotham providing a compelling backdrop to the crimes Joker commits -- which are in fact so relatable and understandable that viewers are forced to contemplate if what they're seeing on screen is actually moral or not. We all know the answer to that question however -- it is immoral. Crimes, especially murder is obviously, immoral. But the movie depicts a personality whose morality is dead. He's had enough. But the movie doesn't tell you that that's a good thing. It just depicts.A Roger Ebert quote fits quite well here - It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it.Joker doesn't shy away from gorey violence,and taking on controversial themes. And I liked that. Many didn't. Many thought the movie is spreading the ""wrong message"". To them I ask, tell me a villain who sends the ""right message"". I'll wait. Movies try so hard to portray a compelling character study of a protagonist who is a villain. They generally fail miserably in doing so. Joker smashes it out of the park.Follow me on insta @rosebudmoviereviews",1
2009,Movie is fantastic and gives an insight on the man who laughs an focuses on the mentality of Arthur fleck. Joaquin phenoix is the greatest actor of this generation and should be given an Oscar,1
2010,"Well, what can I say.The origin of the Joker has never really been touched on in the graphic novels bar the killing joke and there was only the first batman film by Tim Burton that gave a small offering to add to the story... I have waited for years for someone brave enough to write, produce and direct a film to do it justice and boy have they.Phoenix Is phenomenal.I will not say anything to spoil the film other than its stunning.",1
2011,"WOW. This movie really had me engaged with how Arthur Fleck becomes demented and deranged. I couldn't take my eyes off him because with every bad thing that happens to him you see that he's just losing his mind in a very believable way. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an excellent performance and made me sympathize with his character who suffers from a condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably. It's not a action super villain movie, but rather a psychological thriller so don't get your hopes up in that regard. Rather, enjoy the movie for what it is: A one off film about a man who is broken down by society. No Joker is perfect, but all (except Jared Leto's) are respectable in their own right. Joaquin Phoenix's Joker earns its own spot.",1
2012,"One of best movies ever made.Joaquin nailed it, so does DOP, music tracks and direction. Gema of a movie depicting a well balanced script of Joker origin.",1
2013,"Brilliant performances, interesting twists and one of the most enjoyable final acts of any film this year make this a must see.",1
2014,"The best performance by Joaquin Phoenix! People might say ""Heath Ledger who?""",1
2015,"Amazing, realistic, honest, crude, so very well acted! Joaquin Phoenix's performance is amazing. The script in down to earth and realistic.",1
2016,"I would say that this film really brought some perspective in life on how hard life events can be, and how we take them. We see a monster hiding in the shadows of Arthur but we cannot stop but feel bad fkr the guy. You see life **** on him, time and time again. Some of these life events we've suffered, and we see how it could of been.gud movie",1
2017,"This is an easy 10 and it's also easily the best comic book film to date. The craftmenship here is insane and almost perfect. The acting, the music, the script, the cinematography, the color grading, the lighting all work together perfectly to create a tight tense film you can't keep your eyes off of.",1
2018,wow i love film and comics is this combo is just so well done. the acting shots feel all done so well. go see it for your self.,1
2019,Deeply enthralling. The direction was what captivated me. I expected a fantastic performance by Phoenix. But Phillips created something truly mesmerizing. Unlike anything I’ve ever seen.,1
2020,Bold. Artistic. Bleak. Joaquin is a tour de force. The blend of DC lore and even-toned storytelling made Joker's climax one of the tensest in recent memory.,1
2021,"The film is terrifying, and makes you have a weird introspective look at your self. Beautifully crafted the only reason it's not a 10/10 is because some scenes drag.",1
2022,"Masterpiece. Brilliant acting, story, cinematography, music, everything....",1
2023,"Such a great film, Joaquin Phoenix performance is a masterpiece. One of my favorite movies of all time.",1
2024,"Best movie I've seen in a while to put it short.I hadnt actually been out to see a movie in a long time and with all the hype I went into it skeptical, assuming it would be mediocre and everyone was just blowing things out of proportion.Well after the scissors scene I think this movie became one of my favorites and really is a breath of fresh air in the stale film industry as of late.It's not afraid to offend, takes **** at everyone, and Phoenix's performance, while it took a bit to evolve into what I would call great, it got there and left me wanting more, immediately.I would say see this one in theaters!",1
2025,Very well done. Phenomenal acting. Phoenix did a great job as did all the other actors in this film. Todd Phillip's take on the Joker is more humanized but it allows the audience to relate to the character & understand what made the Joker unravel into madness.,1
2026,Excellent all around.  Go watch it for your own sake. By far the best film in years.,1
2027,"Great great film , I loved it ... you felt sad for him , happy for him , mad  for him , he did a great job ... I wanna say on par with the dark knights joker",1
2028,"Joker is a movie that understands the mythos and the message of the character, no this movie does not make violence acceptable, this movie does not endorse white supremacy or white privilege and it tries to convey a message through the use of violence. The cinematography and lightning felt amazing and it immerses you in this 80s dirty and ugly Gotham City, the acting is phenomenal especially Phoenix, he does an incredible job and sometimes he doesn't even say it but you can understand what he is going through. My problem with the movie is that the script cant handle all of the themes subtly, especially when we are talking Arthur hallucinating, and they just couldn't lose the chance and they just had to put Bruce Wayne and the Wayne family in the movie. Also, there are somethings in the movie that goes nowhere, in the beginning, they talk about the garbage collectors having a strike and then they talk about because of the strike and the huge amount of garbage in the street they have now super rats? And then this goes nowhere and it is never mentioned again in the whole movie and it felt dumb. Talking about trying to be subtly, Arthurs's girlfriend being a hallucination I saw that coming a mile away, it's like the screenwriter had some good ideas but he just could not execute them very well. Overall Joker is a very good movie and it will get a cult following in the future (if it doesn't have already), the script has its problems like every other but it can still convey a very important message that I think it will be relevant for many years to come.",1
2029,"This movie was excellent! Its a social commentary, one for the ages. Was riveted the whole time.Phoenix, Phillips, Film all deserve oscar nod.",1
2030,"Muito bom o filme, fiquei completamente entretido e suprio todas as expectativas, vou assistir inumeras vezes.",1
2031,"Perfect movie!!! Joaquin Phoenix deserve the Oscar. Great cinematography, score, art direction.",1
2032,Good story with great acting. Finally a movie which is not flooded with computer graphics as a way to compensate for the lack of luster of the story (e.g. most of Marvel movies). Best movie in years!,1
2033,It's a masterpiece! The director Todd Philips was right about saying that Marvel cannot make a movie like this. He reminded us what cinema is. I still couldn't find any negative things about this.,1
2034,Best movie of the decade. Dont believe the smear campaign against this movie. Joker is a masterpiece 10/10.,1
2035,"Don't listen to the ""critics"", Joachim's performance is the best I've seen this decade and the film will stick with you.",1
2036,"The joker is a slow burner grounded movie, if your coming in to watch the movie expecting the norms of a comic book movie then youd most likely be disappointed. With that being said Phoenix performance is so mesmerising the ways arthur talks, walks, his mannerism changes in the movie and its brilliant to watch",1
2037,"Una película cruda y realista,  con un desarrollo de personaje increíble, con el cual llegas a empatizar, situaciones bien construidas que transmiten distintas emociones.Una obra de arte única en el subgénero de superhéroes.",1
2038,This is definitely the best movie ever made  of its kind and is strictly  not for ****,1
2039,"Joaquin Phoenix does an brilliant performance, his acting of this specific complex and twisted character is phenomenal. The film is a deep, tragic, and sad (in a good way)story of a person descending into madness it does an amazing job at making one empathize with joker after watching all the suffering he goes through. It left me shaken for a while after watching it.  The phoyography is remarkable along with its powerful soundrack. To me this joker is as good as Ledger's specially because it depicts an origin story so it's not competing but more portraying a new phacet of an iconic character. An abolute MUST watch.",1
2040,"I mean, all of that bad reviews are just some SJW suckers who can't stand a different point of view, they're scared about this movie ? C'mon, give me a break",1
2041,"An absolute cinematic blast like no other! Joker isn't your typical comic book origin story movie, but that's just the point! Sometimes a comic book character grounded in reality can be just as thrilling and compelling, even without fancy CGI or explosive fight scenes. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is outstanding in the atmosphere of Gotham is bleak and chilling. All the elements combine together to bring you a DC movie like no other! An absolute must see psychological thriller for fans and even non-fans of comic books!",1
2042,Ufffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,1
2043,"The best comic book movie I've ever seen. I'm not a huge fan of superhero movies. I think this movie is successful because it appeals to the average viewer while at the same time being a really excellent addition to the Batman mythology. It's a really good villain-origin story, but it's more than that. It provokes serious thought about important issues today such as mental illness and systemic power structures, not to mention forcing the viewer to question the motivation of mass murderers. It's dark but it walks that line perfectly, getting laughs that are a little uncomfortable but also a lot of fun. At a certain point, I thought to myself, ""Damn, this is a good movie."" I could go on but you get the point. Loved it.",1
2044,Phenomenal and absolutely jaw dropping. Best performance of the last decade.,1
2045,Really good movie!!! Awesome ,1
2046,Master piece Una verdadera obra de Arte Joaquin con una gran interpretación !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
2047,Hahahahahatefully good! All joking aside. Arthur is a reflection of everything gone wrong around him.,1
2048,Best movie of the year! Mesmerizing and worth watch more than once! Oscar best actor secured!,1
2049,This movie surpassed my expectations! I definitely would recommend this to anybody. This movie has so much character depth! I love all the dark psychological elements. Excellent cinematography. This movie has surpassed my all time favourite movie and that is The Dark Knight. :),1
2050,this movie is a modern day masterpiece. Critics don’t know anything. This movie is just so amazing I can’t put it into words,1
2051,"One word: ""Masterpiece"" Is the best movie of the year and the best movie of DC",1
2052,"I have seen all the movies so far this year with my A-List, from Judy to End Game, this film is my movie of the year, by far. I had read the Killing Joke, the Dark Knight Returns, and watched cinematic versions of the Joker. Phoenix is rightfully there with Ledger, the best Jokers for me. Extremely political, the story contained in this movie is so real and tangible that critics are afraid of it, what were they expecting? Joker is on the title. And, indeed, it totally makes you feel like Joker.",1
2053,"An absolute masterpiece, an Oscar deserving film and words aren't enough to express Mr. Phoenix's performance. And a big middle finger to all those critics who I saw are berating this movie and Joaquin phoenix.",1
2054,"Best acting performance ever. Dark, deep, human. Not really a good life model, but it’s a masterpiece",1
2055,This movie is a strong 9-10. Joaquin's performance is a serious Oscar contender. I don't understand why some pseudo critics want to make this about politics. This is a movie about a crazy person. That's all. Enjoy it for what it is.,1
2056,Wonderful come back by DC.Joker is a wonderful film and this film will impress all the audience,1
2057,Joaquin Phoenix nailed it as joker. It feels like he himself is the joker. Todd Phillips did a great work in making best possible origin for joker.,1
2058,Extremely dark and violent descent into madness. I wouldn't be surprised if it won an oscar best acting and cinematography,1
2059,It pains me to see that the actual “critics” have a total disconnect with actual audience opinions.,1
2060,"In a fictional city that looks a lot like NYC, where public services are failing left and right and social tensions are rising, “Joker” tries and succeeds at telling two origins stories at once by presenting them as poignant counterparts and consequences of a society cannibalizing itself. The movie does a great job as a cautionary tale on the dangers of the epidemic of mental illness of our time and of the urgent need to shed a new light on it. It has the audience questioning the unnecessary inequalities that surround us and the imperstive need to reflect deeply on the social movements that promise change from a place of resentment. While Joker tumbles between reality and fantasy he’s at times frightening, seductive, pathetic, repulsive and endearing. He’s so right at questioning the sanity of a world that has him completely disenfranchised that I found myself rooting for him to get justice although I could never condone his violence. He just deserves to see that world go up in flames, and the world definitely deserves this son for no one could deny that he has come from its loins.",1
2061,"If critics are panning something that is beloved by the public, sometimes it's because they're so desperate to appear as they're above the hype and just end up being a contrarian. People are going to get upset thinking the Joker is a protagonist that the movie is encouraging you to root for. I highly disagree. This movie is a character-study not asking you to sympathize the anti-hero but to understand him. If you thought you could go to an origin story about a villain and not be uncomfortable then I'm not sure how to console you. The movie is a masterpiece and DC absolutely needs to head in this direction to save us from the cursed Disney Marvel content that has no heart but ironically is praised by the critics.",1
2062,Sensacional a forma como mostra na visão de uma pessoa com um tipo de distúrbio mental.,1
2063,"Critics are panning this movie unfairly. I actually really enjoyed this movie despite the darkness and realism.  Don't listen to the critics, go see it (and judge it) for yourself.",1
2064,Joker made history. All time best film ever. Just wow! Jaqlin phonix is mindblowing.,1
2065,"An absolute masterpiece, it was so hard to determine if you should laugh or cry and that’s what Joker, himself, is all about.",1
2066,"Absolute masterpiece.  All these hypocrites saying they walked out or were offended, yet will happily sit through John Wicke, the equaliser, IT, and enjoy the gratuitous violence.  This film shows why violence is a bad thing, and why it is such an evil thing to bully a vulnerable person and treat them with contempt for simply existing.   I believe why people are getting so offended is because the film brings home a number of issues currently affecting today’s society.  The truth hurts.  It offers realism and an insight into the minds of some of our peers who are suffering from mental health issues and have lost their way.  Phoenix's portrayal is truly masterful, he deserves acclaim for his performance.  The story is moving, dark and emotional.  The film is not that gory at all, I have seen much worse.  Don’t listen to the weak minded who are scared of this film.  It is absolutely worth a watch and will go down in history as one of the best films of all time.  The controversy is unfounded and pathetic.  People of today can not cope with being shown reality.  This film turns the joker into a human being, and for that it should be commended and all involved should be very proud.",1
2067,"Excelente película, buen inicio de la historia del joker la recomiendo ampliamente",1
2068,"“I used to think my life was a tragedy. But now I realize, it’s a comedy.”",1
2069,I am at a loss of words it's that remarkable. The way Joaquin plays his character. Everything about it is amazing,1
2070,"One critics disparaged 'Joker' for being 'sympathetic to white men'. It's as if the critics have those social talking points hardwired into their brains, or are just trying to make themselves appear ""socially aware."" This film is a fantastic psychological drama about the spiral of a mentally ill man into a deranged villain. Joaquin Phoenix gives what is perhaps his magnum opus performance. His coup de grâce. It's social commentary is about society as a whole. How the violence and struggles of the world are a reflection of ourselves more than we'd like to admit. Todd Phillips' depiction of mental illness is grim yet tasteful and it drives anyone who watches it further into the soul of 'Joker'. It's the best villain origin story in a long time. It's shocking, subversive, succinct, and all in all, a great movie.",1
2071,Great acting by Joaquin Phoenix. Of course Heath Ledger was the Best Joker)))A tought social drama.Sorry for my bad english.,1
2072,"Amazing Movie!Do your self a favor and go see it! Don’t listen to anyone else, society is so soft these days, they don’t like hearing that people actually struggle or have it rough.It’s gives you a great understanding on how the joker became the joker and him mentally deteriorating over time because of events that happen.It’s not always flowers and roses.. 10/10",1
2073,"It was incredible. Martin Scorsese's words on superhero movies : ""“Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”But this movie, this is not a superhero movie. This is a story about downtrodden citizen, with numerous issues and a bad life,  becoming something else.  Real human being and the torture that pushes him across the line.  In-cre-di-ble. !  10/10.",1
2074,It was very good. Phoenix was amazing. Dance scenes was very cool. I think the movie is very good.,1
2075,"Absolutely stunning film. A phenomenal performance by Joaquin Phoenix drives a powerful story of an everyday man's slip into vengeful insanity. The gradual unraveling of Arthur Fleck hits too close to home for comfort in an age of random shootings and mental health woes. Many will focus on the intense violence, however one may choose to see the moral of the story: Treat others how you want to be treated. Or else.",1
2076,"I'm a dedicated Phoenix fan so there is no way I would miss this movie. But I didn't have the slightest thought that it is some way it is related to the Batmans. Arthur is as stand alone as you can get. And, to me, Phoenix's magnificent performance is as stand alone as you can get. Loved his dancing, which was enhanced by his self-made skin and bone Fred Astaire physique. The only thing that bothered me was Arthur's chain smoking. I don't think all that smoking had made any  dramatic contribution to the movie, but it did give me the impression that the incessant smoking was a proxy tobacco industry advertisement. Maybe intended to encourage young vaping addicts to switch to the real thing.",1
2077,Excellent performance. I loved the main character and the way how the story carries the audience to understand how a mental illness can create a dark person.,1
2078,"From start to finish, Joker excels as an extremely entertaining film and one that commands the viewer's attention. Phoenix's performance is spectacular and Todd Philips does a great job with delivering the comic book villain everyone knows and loves under a darker and more visceral lens. The film is raw and intense from start to finish and totally exceeded the expectations I had from it. If this is the future for DC, it is looking brighter than ever.",1
2079,"Francamente, la actuación de Joaquín es excelente. No pudo haberlo hecho mejor. Toda escena donde aparece es genial. Se disfruta hasta el más mínimo detalle. Es la segunda vez que la miro en el cine en tres días de recién estrenada en Argentina. Gracias Todd Phillips por darnos esta película que va a hacer historia de la buena. Aguante el Joker carajooo",1
2080,"Я не помню кино, после которого мы с компанией бы ещё час осуждали на пустой ночной парковке возле кинотеатра, а ещё и по некоторым пунктам так и не сошлись во мнении и почти договорились на второй сеанс, но сеансов больше не было сегодня.",1
2081,Great performance in bringing the Joker to live!Tackling the Mental Health issues really well,1
2082,Brilliant movie all around. Excellent performance by Joaquin Pheonix. Great cinematography.,1
2083,"Отличный фильм, два часа прошли незаметно. Актёрская игра тоже на высоте, наверное это был лучший джокер из всех 12/10",1
2084,"One of the best movies of 2019, the character is awesome! The Joker is so real a put yoursslf in the clow's long shoes",1
2085,"Фильм на высоте, я ожидал меньшего. Очень понравилось, надеюсь будет продолжение.",1
2086,"All this Starbuck’s critics saying bollocks about it are delusional. They need to tone it down for the sake of their ideologies. Don’t worry, the movie is a great piece of art.",1
2087,A masterclass that is ambiguous enough that you can find everything and nothing to your liking and not necessarily be wrong. Is it dangerous? Only if you're afraid to look in the mirror.,1
2088,"critics are giving this great movie bad reviews because his dictator called out the woke culture. These ""professionals""  lost their credibility. The movie felt like a vivid dream for the whole movie I forgot that I am ""watching"" a movie or went out with a friend to watch it! I felt like I am in a great emotional dream that you just don't want it to end. Joker ""Joaquin Phoenix"" acted perfectly. You will feel how you are feeling bad for him in times and you just scared of him in others. I wish I can watch this movie again soon. What a great movie don't look at the stupid critics reviews I am 100% sure they didn't watch it or they went in with the mentality that it sucks... they are not honest.",1
2089,"Gran película y gran interpretación del joker, fotografía y música muy buenas",1
2090,Constant tension through suberb acting and direction. Joker doesn't try to justify the actions ot portrays but merely to explain then and through this explanation it asks us to look at ourselves and at the society around us.,1
2091,"This was a near perfect movie. Great acting, story cinematography, score, etc. This is a great super villain origin story. Further proof WB is at least somewhat getting it's act together. Bonus points for keeping it R rated.",1
2092,"Oscar for sure, this movie is a critic to allí te people who talk like they ever had the problems of the people like all those famous that are trying to tell how to think",1

2097,You need to watch you have to watch for joaqin phoenix' brilliant performance. This is not a classic action or super hero movie this is a drama by character point,1
2098,"So beautiful, bewitching and at the same time destructive. This fictional world of cynicism and indifference seems so familiar and close ...The film is obligatory for viewing and reflection",1
2099,"Phoenix is mesmerizing and it's a dark, unapologetic and a convoluted masterpiece from Todd Philips.",1
2100,The acting is phenomenal. You cannot help but put yourself into Arthur’s position.,1
2101,"This was a great movie, had a blast and the mix of real and fantasy was pretty fun. liked it a lot.",1
2102,"Please watch this movie. It's simply too good to pass. Do it. You won't be left disappointed.I want to make a special mention to Joaquin's performance, the photography (wow) and the music. My god...",1
2103,"This is an Amazing movie, and Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job as batmans most notorious  villain.  Instead of having one tragic accident turn a normal everyday guy into a villain... This movie instead shows a steady decline in an already surffering mental patient.  From his relationship with his mom,  her obsession with Thomas Wayne, a relationship with a neighbor girl, to his outlook on everyday life, and dreams of one day being a comedian , this movie really transcends the label ""Superhero Movie""",1
2104,"Joker is a repertory film, sober and very inspired by the works of Martin Scorsese. It's not an action film, nor a superhero and it's only better in my opinion. Superb cinematography, the shots are powerful. The soundtrack is excellent and subtle, it is not intrusive.We follow the protagonist Arthur Fleck suffering from neurological problems and depression. He slowly slips into violence. The story is told by adopting his vision of things (This does not mean that those events occurred in this way... Look at the clues). The scenario relies on the spectator's ability to interpret the scenes, not everything is verbalized. In the theater, I heard someone say: ""I don't understand... ».In addition, the film asks the question what is our role in the appearance of this type of individual. He also takes a critical look at social classes.Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar for his performance. Best movie I've seen since Blade Runner 2049. I'm going to get it on Blu-Ray, because it deserves to be revisited. 10/10. (It's also less violent than the Deadpool movies. The difference here is that violence is presented with seriousness.)Joker est un film de répertoire, sobre et très inspiré des œuvres de Martin Scorsese. Ce n’est pas un film d’action, ni de super héros et il en est que meilleur selon moi. Superbe cinématographie, les plans sont puissants. La trame sonore est excellente et subtile, elle n’est pas envahissante.Nous suivons le protagoniste Arthur Fleck souffrant de problèmes neurologiques et de dépression. Il glisse tranquillement vers la violence. L’histoire est racontée en adoptant sa vision des choses (Ça ne veut pas dire que les événements se sont produits de cette façon… Observez les indices). Le scénario compte sur la capacité du spectateur à interpréter les scènes, on ne verbalise pas tout. Dans la salle, j’ai entendu une personne dire : « Je ne comprends pas... ».De plus, le film pose la question quel est notre rôle dans l’apparition de ce type individu. Il porte également un regard critique sur les classes sociales.Joaquin Pheonix mérite un Oscar pour sa performance. Le meilleur film que j’ai vu depuis Blade Runner 2049. Je vais me le procurer en Blu-Ray, car il mérite d’être revisité. 10/10. (C'est aussi moins violent que Deadpool... La différence est que la violence est présentée avec sérieux.)",1
2105,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, it was nice experience. I Will watch it again",1
2106,"Excellent,a masterpiece by Todd Philip , Joaquin Phoenix lived the life of Joker, Oscar worthy performance",1
2107,"Debe ser la mejor producción que ha concebido DC. Hermosa producción, muy visceral y con un trabajo de Phoenix que te deja con ganas de más.",1
2108,"Great Phoenix! Great Direction, great music, if you are a Batman fan you're gonna like it a lot! Masterpiece!",1
2109,A true masterpiec!  With a top notch performance from Phoeni. The cinematography and background score was out of this world. This is a great cinema period.,1
2110,"Una grandísima obra de arte. Hacia tiempo que no veía a todo un cine vitorear y aplaudir al final de una película. Phoenix, el Oscar para ya",1
2111,Best movie of the year! Such a wonderful performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You can relate with but at the same you don't. Impressive.,1
2112,"I still haven't watched the movie, but im pretty sure it deserves a Grammy award",1
2113,"Perfectly paced and beautifully built, to give a suspenseful thriller that really gets you thinking.",1
2114,Brilhante! O filme foge qualquer adaptação comum que ja estave presente nos cinemas.,1
2115,"Amazing. Everything I wanted and more. Dark, chilling, but filled with love for the character. Joker had me on the edge of my seat from the first scene.",1
2116,"An origin story for the joker that in a weirdly successful way manages to include aspects that remind you of both Ledger and Romero (as surprising as this may be). Much more serious than the recent comic book movies, but does not go into that ""brooding for the sake of brooding"" phase. Provides a complicated view of mental illness (for a movie, obviously),The ending is my only (minor) gripe. It could have ended on TV zoom-out scene.Pheonix was magnificent, De Niro also gave a great performance (for real, not just compared to Dirty Grandpa). Zazie Beetz is also fantastic.",1
2117,"Consegue conciliar a violência com o perturbador,a trilha sonora indica muitas vezes que aquilo que está acontecendo é errado.",1
2118,"The best movie in history based on a comic character, great character development, great photography, music, sound, direction and of course the interpretation of both Joaquin Phoenix and the cast.",1
2119,Movie was amazing. It's exactly what I'd imagine a real life version of Joker to be like. It sort of combines American Psycho with Batman begins. Definitely recommend it. Some of the major critics don't realize how great this movie is. Especially if you are a fan of Batman comics cartoons and movies.,1
2120,"Good movie, and the best DC movie since Dark Knight. If DC continues to make dark, gritty movies like this, their movies might be good.",1
2121,Fantastic movie that doesn’t cater but tells a story of what happens when mental illness is treated by society as an “it’s your problem” problem. The pacing is a slow burn so don’t go in there thinking he’s throwing explosives pies. This is an origin story that depicts how a corrupted society has fail and what the end result yields.,1
2122,"The film was dark yet visually beautiful. Phoenix pulled me into Arthur's world. I left the film satisfied and somewhat depressed. Great film, not a TYPICAL comic book movie.",1
2123,"One of the best movies I’ve ever seen, ignore the critics reviews they are just stupid ****",1
2124,"Joaquin Phoenix is so deranged as Nicholson and Ledger. Far from the usual mold of superhero genre, in an environment similar to Taxi Driver and The king of comedy, narrates how a frustrated applicant for stand-up comedian slide downhill into insanity. Maybe overrated but it's a shocker. Not suitable for kids.",1
2125,"The whole experience of watching Joker is made 1000 times better with Joaquin Phoenix in it. I hope this movie will establish the dark, mysterious cinema universe of Gotham.",1
2126,"Great movie and great work of Joaquin Phenix's actor - everything fits perfectly at the right time. I like this real Joker and the problems that this film has. Please, give Oscar to Joaquin while he don't kill somebody",1
2127,One of the best comic book movies I have ever seen. The DCU could learn a thing or 2 from this movie.,1
2128,"I love Joaquin Pheonix and when I learned he was playing Joker I had to see this film. It is not a masterpiece and neither is it so bad like the snowflake reviewbombing critics are making it out to be. The acting, cinematography, and music are goosebumps inducing. The story is also nice. Please go watch it. The weak points are a certain female character that wasn't explored more, and a certain unnecessary sub plot which I am not going to spoil and let you judge for yourself. Overall very enjoyable movie and Joaquin's Joker is a worthy successor to the great Heath Ledger's Joker. Hope Pheonix wins or gets nominated for an oscar for this chilling performance as the Joker.",1
2129,Simply fresh and artistic! It left a deep impact as if I was watching the pianist or Logan all over again. I coulden't keep my eyes away.,1
2130,"Sorprendente y cautivadora, es capaz de meterte casi en la cabeza de Arthur Fleck, con esa combinación perfecta entre la dirección, actuación y banda sonora, brinda una experiencia que quieres ver nuevamente.",1
2131,A movie to remember... Everything was great about it..a true masterpiece 10/10,1
2132,Wow. Outstanding performance.Really dark & intense. Love it.10/10 for sure.,1
2133,"Absolutely brilliant movie, it plays with the discomfort of the viewer and holds nothing back. The acting to the slightest detail was brilliant, the way the posture alone completely changed the mood of the scenes, that combined with amazing use of sound track made this movie so thrilling, yet conflicting. I spent my entire viewing unable to look away, all while trying to dig myself further into the back of my seat.  The movie plays with the edge of what is relatable, with a society, and city that feels real enough it could just maybe exist. Which makes the story so damn believable its terrifying to watch.This is no Batman vs Superman thats for sure.",1
2134,"If you are a type of guy who see only entertainment,it's your wish to watch or not.but if you are type of guy ,who enjoys noticing points and deep meanings ,then,you must go and watch.",1
2135,"Great movie with a fantastic performance by Joaquim Phoenix,who deserves all awards.",1
2136,La mejor . Gran actuación de joaquin.  Quisiera ver una y otra vez esta pelicula. La mejor.,1
2137,"The best MOVIE of all time. Joaquin Phoenix played the character very deeply, I loved every single minute of that movie. I already watched the movie twice and I'm going for the third time on Thursday. Thanks for everyone that's involved in that movie.",1
2138,An amazing perspective!!!! & a true-to-life story that needs to be seen by everybody.,1
2139,"'What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like a trash? I’ll tell you what you get. You get what you **** deserve!’    Joker(2019) Joaquin Phoenix, without a doubt, had one of the greatest performances of the last decade.He deserves an Academy Award for his performance in Joker.",1
2140,I really liked the movie! Very dark tough! But it’s a proper movie based on a comic book which it’s not easy to make! 5 stars!,1
2141,I love this movies. Very intertaining to watch. I love his acting. Phoeni da best,1
2142,"Una excelente actuación, un guión increíble y una fotografía estupenda. Esto sí es hacer una película, únicamente los que la critican son los mediocres políticamente correctos",1
2143,A masterpiece. It a character movie not a superhero movie. That is something we need in this time of saturated superhero movies. We need more movies like this.,1
2144,Don't even take a look at rotten reviews. Go for it.. Best movie of this **** decade,1
2145,"Well, for me, this is the best movie of the year. Phoenix and philips show me how dark joker is.",1
2146,"It's a fascinating experience that will truly change cinema going forward. The acting was absolutely phenomenal and the Gotham city created feels so vividly real that the movie really makes you feel uncomfortable. The climax is unnaturally intense, and the third act is so masterfully crafted. I walked out of this movie feeling almost guilty. That's the goal of the movie and it succeeds in that guil in spectacular style.",1
2147,Phenomenal story. Phenomenal acting. I have watched this movie 3 times already and still can't get enough of it. This movie has so much magic in it. It is probably one of the best if not THE best movie I have seen in my life. I would give this movie more than 10 if I could.,1
2148,"Melhor filme do ano, sem dúvidas. A melhor crítica sempre vai ser a do público e nunca a dos críticos.",1
2149,"Una obra de arte, desde la banda sonora hasta la magnifica interpretación de joaquin, una calificacion de un 5 con algo a esta pelicula por parte de una supuesta critica profesional es un insulto a la inteligencia de cualquier persona.",1
2150,"Masterpiece, violence isn't held back on, mental health is mentioned In a non triggering way, and sympathy isnt given towards the character but you can see why he becomes the clown prince",1
2151,"Es una obra de arte, desde la fotografía, la banda sonora la interpretación de los actores y en especial de joaquin Phoenix, muy recomendable y es lo mejor del año.",1
2152,Well done. Great development of a schizophrenic/ psychotic bad guy. I also now understand finally the origin of batman.,1
2153,"Just the type of departure needed, enjoyed every minute of Joker. Masterful filmmaking.",1
2154,It's amazing like u must watch things movie and the rest of this is so I can post this,1
2155,"Amazing, suprising and truly creative! Unlike any superhero movie I've seen before, very artistic and pleasing to watch. Joaquin Phoenix did great job, easily the best joker right after Heath Ledger.",1
2156,"Awesome movie all around! Forget about the critics, Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing Joker and the movie is beautifully directed. The best aspects of the movie are the acting, music, cinematography and directing. Absolute must-see!",1
2157,Enjoyed it a lot. Definitely a great addition to the DC series. I look forward to the new era of this Joker.,1
2158,"This movie is the most unique piece of film ever shown to the public. I’ve never questioned myself more after a movie, and there will never be another movie like Joker",1
2159,"Awesome film. ""Mixed or average"" my butt. This film is definitely Oscar worthy.",1
2160,"Es una maldita Joya está película, el desempeño de la trama y la actuación de Joaquín son impresionantes y completamente disfrutables en un 100%",1
2161,Just perfect and a must watch movie... An astonishig performance by joaquin phoenix... Hatts off!!,1
2162,"Lotsa notes before we start this review,so keep scrolling,I think,in case you don’t care.1. Terminator Dark Fate (for the brief seconds I saw while entering the IMAX Auditorium since there was a 5-Minute preview in front of Joker in IMAX) looks fookin’ spectacular. Such a shame Italy won’t release it in IMAX 3D…2. This movie has a great friendship with A Quiet Place for “Dead Silent...Stone Cold Audience I’ve ever had at a Movie”3.  DC Black may be the studio I’m most looking forward out of all the other CBM Studios,but it’s no surprise given Warner Bros’ fantastic year (so far)...End of notes.The worst part of Joker may be the fact that I’ve seen all of this coming from the trailers. Guy gets slapped by Society,he starts to get mad,and so here we have an Odyssey of Madness that’ll turn him into the Clown Prince Of Crime,yadda yadda,we all know it by now. But,the thing that makes it stand amongst other character studies done by the numbers is the rather unnerving nature of the character we’re following (played by Joaquin Phoenix with mesmerizing attitude) and the fact that,for a Director last known for making Comedies,this feels like such a huge directorial shift (besides the kinda harsh comment he made on Recent Comedies). This may be the scariest IMAX Experience I’ve had since...I dunno...Mission Impossible Fallout? Which isn’t saying much,considering I’ve never seen a scary movie in IMAX.What also fuels the movie up to 11 is the fact that this is my movie. A movie that says many things about the harsh and insulting society we’re living in right now (another movie like this is Taxi Driver,of which the movie takes inspiration from. No,seriously,there’s a sequence involving Arthur toying around with a gun that feels similar to Travis Bickle’s “you talking to me?”),which is better than great for me,as I despise the lots and lots of people that behave like they’re the most important being in existence,complete with self-indulgence and insults towards others. All spectacular stuff for this movie. But,while most of it feels earned,I don’t think it needs to fully embrace it,since there’s a minority about people who actually know what they’re doing and hope they can literally “rebuild the world” as it was. Yeah,I’m getting ahead of myself,but it’s something I really wanted to talk about in a long time,internet or not. And it feels unreal that I’m talking about it in a Comicbook Movie that shouldn’t work if done in other ways. But if it stopped itself from fully embracing the theme of Society,then we wouldn’t have gotten the big-ass epic finale it had,with a speech that,while feels forced by WB,didn’t bother me at all,especially with a worse gripe than the speech. That being the blatant and unnecessary Batman references. At first it was cute,but during the finale,it felt sort of rushed.  Not for Thomas Wayne,since he was part of the plot,but for the sake of the studio trying to Franchise this up,therefore losing the soul the movie was aiming to have,and making it just “Another Comicbook romp”. Speaking of that,yeah,it stars a Comicbook character as the main lead,and the title is Joker,but should I even consider it a Comicbook Movie? Character aside,this feels more a Character-driven film rather than a CBM,and,while there are action sequences (and Violence) in it,it doesn’t matter all that much considering the Nature of the Story we’re being told,nor is it as insulting as the troll reviewers are talking about (there are positive reviews,no worries,but I hate making fun of these critics,since it ain’t my thing,and I know there will always be more of them in other movies). But all in all,I think Joker is my Iron Man. While I’ve seen most Comicbook Movies by this point,I never had one where it felt like a proper introduction to the Genre (besides Spider-Verse),and anticipating it as “The Rebirth Of Comicbook Fare” was definitely my thing. Sure,it wasn’t the greatest movie of all everyone was talking about,but that still didn’t stop me from being thoroughly surprised by it. The fact it doesn’t show the DC logo at the beginning is already a Plus.",1
2163,"To try and compete with the high standard set by Ledger is an uphill struggle to say the least, but Phoenix's performance captivated me from start to finish. I love the continuity of the character. His portrayal of the character is dark and beautiful but still distinct from Ledger's. He has created his own mannerisms with the character. You can see the hard work he's put into this performance. From the look in his eyes, his stance around certain people. ""The Joker"" is undoubtebly a flawed person, but I've never sympathised with him before, or at least to the extent that I notice it. I find myself comparing our protagonist, Arthur, to Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver. You can see they're excluded from society, spat on, in a city that is rotten. One can sympathise with them at the start, but later on we see the cracks appear.The film has beautiful moments that tie it all together too. For instance, I appreciate how the beginning and end mirror eachother, and that the character ends up parallel to who he was at the start.It starts with a smile, and a psychiatrist,and ends with a smile, and a psychiatrist.Arthur at the start is trying to be happy in an oppressed and dysfunctional world.Arthur at the end is happy his life means something and he's bringing opportunity for people to make themselves happier through revolution, with the wall of the class divide burning away in Gotham.I also appreciate the use of theme in this film. From start to finish the film paints a sincere-feeling message about male mental health awareness and the problems that Social Exclusion can cause on vulnerable people- a theme which I feel should be at the forefront of society, but is so often shoved to the back in favour of other issues. The outrage from media outlets prior to release only purports this- practically encouraging a shooting in theatres so they can condemn the person who *they* gave the platform for atrocities to be committed through, via their constant publicity about it. Ironically, the film speaks directly to that, with the Late Night Show scene in the ending third of the film, martyrising Arthur as starting a revolution. The film isn't trying to advocate for murder of people, that's not the message one can take away from it. The real message I found was that vulnerable members of society should be treated. Arthur's character was neglected, beaten, ""tied to a radiator with bruises on him,"" and yet he remained in the house with his mother, and turned into a social outcast. He gets all the sources of help cut off from him, so he is left isolated. This speaks to contemporary American society too, where medical and mental help costs, and often is only available to those who might not need it as much as a working class family may, seen as most mental health issues lie with the impoverished. This film says a lot without coming off as insincere as other comic book character films do. It doesn't cram a message down your face with a one liner, nor does it try and deprocate itself through ""self-aware comedy"" like every other Marvel film (hint hint ""What Are Those!"" and every line said to make the characters awkward after a big moment)This feels like a true Tragedy. The art style of the film, the soundtrack with those harsh strings, vivid lighting in sections, and the overall design and portrayal of the character is in a world of its own. I thought nothing could top Ledger's performance, but honestly, Phoenix has me convinced.",1
2164,Joker es una obra maestra simplemente grandiosa y Joaquín phoenix en su interpretación esta de maravilla,1
2165,A atuação do Joaquim Phoenix é excelente. O filme consegue passar uma boa visão e empatia do icônico vilão do Batman. É difícil prever o que o protagonista irá fazer. A tensão no ar não diminui em nenhum momento.Recomendo que vc vá assistir com uns 110% de felicidade.,1
2166,"Amazing movie, a great version of the Joker origin for me more powerful than the killing joke graphic novel, they should have completely slipped the neighbors sub plot since is completely useless to the story but else amazing movie ue character can evolve the dance the moves the laughs (@// Wil be a staple of the joker).    .. Joaquin acting is superb really do not get all the bad reviews maybe due to the non serious curriculum of the director......",1
2167,I give it a 10Joker is a cult movie go to see it right nowDC fans are gonna love it,1
2168,"A masterpiece. Best movie of our decade, best performance of our millennia. The negative media representation is disgusting. I just hope DC doesn’t let this work or art go to rest by ruining the rest of this potential franchise. A must see film for anybody who likes good movies. 11/10",1
2169,The last scene that Joker is putting a happy face with blood in his mouth was super!,1
2170,I love this movie . Its one of best movies i ever seen and i very upset when i see the metascore,1
2171,This movie was amazing from start to end. It had me wondering what was going to happen next. I appreciate the dark and mysterious tone throughout the film.,1
2172,"Wow, much better than I expected. I was expecting Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be the only good thing about the movie but I got a lot more. Saying that Joaquin Phoenix was wonderful in his role would be stating the obvious, because pretty much everyone has praised his performance and I agree, he is honestly the best actor of the year so far. Both his acting and the writing of his character is what gives Arthur Fleck/Joker a realism that we have never seen before in any other interpretation of the character. The movie really made me get inside the mind of the title character, to see that he is not just ""a crazy person"" but that he was a human like anyone else. His journey to become the iconic villain is genuinely interesting, and made me care about the character. That is why I think that the character development and acting are the best things about the movie. Robert De Niro was also pretty good. I thought that he would ""phone it in"", but he ended up doing a nice job. The cinematography was also pretty good. There is a little amount of visual storytelling(not too much and it isn't like arthouse film level or anything) and the movie looks aesthetically beautiful to be honest.My issues with this movie are with the script. There were things that felt really cliché and unoriginal. Some of the social commentary is really on the nose and obvious, and when it is included in a conversation it feels more like lazy exposition and takes away from the realism intended. Soms of the plot twists were pretty obvious and the movie treats them as big reveals.So yeah, some script decisions were really a problem, at least for me, but other than that, this movie was reaaaally good. The gritty realism of Gotham City is done so right, making this a worthy ""spiritual successor"" to Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.",1
2173,Movie of the year so far. Simple as. Joaquin Phoenix is on another level entirely.,1
2174,In my opinion joker is one of the best comic book movie of all time the way that the story keeps you guessing what is actually real and what is wrong is fantastic and it is a must watch watch,1
2175,"The critics are a joke. The generic bandwagon needs to stop. This film is living proof that sometimes it works to not follow the trends, to not copy what the last person said, or act the internet emotions society has installed.This film was phenomenal. It strayed so far from what we have grown to know with comic book movies, or even movies in general. There was no hunt for the excitement. It did not project a biased, generic slogan of enjoyment to the viewer in a desperate attempt to fulfil the fix they desire. It just played and you were in it. It was just simply engulfing, excellent writing, excellent acting, incredible cinematography, music, everything. I could continue, but sometimes less is more.  What I will say is that this has my hopes up for a new wave of comic book movies. DC need to ditch the train they’re on and straight up make all the new films as ultra realistic, dark grit as this. I would convert. Bring a sequel that introduces Harley Quinn and the new batman and I’m sold.",1
2176,"I liked it, slow burn but kept my attention. It's not really a comic book movie but that's just fine. I'd watch it again",1
2177,Excellent use of lighting. The music was so well crafted to the events on screen it was noticeable because of its timing. And the decent into madness was so smooth it almost appeared logical. This was a very entertaining few hours.,1
2178,"Es simplemente maravillosa y se aprecia una grandísima evolución tanto de personajes como de trama a lo largo de sus 2 horas de duración a las cuales complementan una espectacular fotografía, una banda sonora inmersiva y una gran dirección que sorprende gratamente",1
2179,"Brilliant and beautifully executed, a masterpiece that transcend the screen and sticks with you considerable time after",1
2180,"Vinex gave an amazing movie, the music was wonderful i really loved it mxkzjsj",1
2181,"Phoenix was awesome as the Joker and the soundtrack matches his character perfectly.  I've never read the comic books but have seen the Joker portrayed in movies and animated cartoons and movies, and I feel as though I understand his character more now.  Awesome origins movie but I definitely don't recommend bringing your children to this movie, it certainly has earned its R rating.",1
2182,"Seriously? This movie to me was absolutely amazing. To call Pheonix's performance anything less than great is utterly ridiculous and quite frankly needs to hang their ""critic"" coat up. It's certainly not a film without flaws, but again, which film doesn't. I can even nitpick it to where I can make it seem like in dislike ot. But that would be a lieThis is a beautiful yet grim movie that captures the crazy world viewed by Arthur Speck. A must see Oh and I think I'm done considering metacritic or any other critic site. A world where Black Panther gets an oscar nomination is a world I don't want to live in.",1
2183,"This week I watched Darkest Hour and Joker. Joker was better. Why? Darkest Hour was an important film about history. Joker is an important film about TODAY.This is a radical work of art. Defiant and truthful. Little wonder the powers that be--the political and media establishment--are aghast.There is very little violence in this film. The moments of violence that are present are intense and carry profound meaning for Arthur, the main character. This is 100% a character driven film.Please, do not shy away because it is a ""comic book"" movie. This is a story about the human condition. There are no special effects. Arthur is the protagonist and a sympathetic figure in his misfortunes, but he is never a hero.A final word for ""critics"": SHAME on every click-bait blogger who is so illiterate that they cannot recognize this important film art. They have no business critiquing films professionally when they clearly have no comprehension of what even makes a film good or bad. No comprehension of what audiences see. No comprehension of (or appreciation for) truth when it is not something they want to hear. They are a disgrace to the film industry and a disgrace to journalism.",1
2184,Very thought provoking film full of masterful artistic execution and craft. Absolute must see for any one interested in crime/psychological thrillers.,1
2185,"if you dont like the movie like the SJWs say ""this aint your movie i dont care if you are offended by it""",1
2186,Absolute Masterpiece. Full of raw emotions. Takes a deep dive into society. Joaquin Phoenix is the best to ever play The Joker.,1
2187,"Loved the originality in direction, writing and clever references to our own society's disfunctions. Joaquin is absolute amazing in performance. A new way of Joker being portrayed.",1
2188,"O filme é maravilhoso , ele te prende do começo ao fim e o Joaquin Phoenix está fantástico no papel",1
2189,"Transcend the genre of comic book movie since I never thought that I was watching one, which is a good thing.",1
2190,This fresh take on the Joker's origin does not do a disservice to the character.,1
2191,Brilliant film and in my opinion the best of 2019. What an experience. Mesmerising from start to finish.,1
2192,"JOKER is a testament to the History of Cinema in the making.JOKER is a reminder to us all, how a proper movie should be executed. Every scene matters. Every score delivers. A staple of a movie that any filmmaker should aspire to.",1
2193,"I'm going to be real and maybe bias about this film. If you were expecting a ""comic-book"" origin story, you came to the wrong movie, but I walked in knowing that already when the first trailer was released. It's a conflicting film of one man's spiral into his own madness and feels too real at times. He doesn't become the joker until the end of the movie, it's more about Author's descent into becoming this character is what makes this an amazing film. It is unnerving, but that feeling is what a Joker movie should be in away. There are moments of the film that blur the line between reality and fantasy, that to me is another detail that screams who joker real is, with the only answer is multiple choice of who he is or was. If there was a Joker origin story that was true to the comics, it probably wouldn't be as impactful R rated or not. This movie will be discussed and analyzed in future youtube theory/philosophical vids much like the Nolan Trilogy has been studied. As a casual Batman and Joker fan, I enjoyed this film and knew what I was going to get from this and still feel puzzled at the end of what was true and was false. But that's up to you to decide.",1
2194,First time I am in complete disagreement from the critics. This movie was a masterpiece through and through.,1
2195,Очень понравилась игра Актера и как всё срежисировано,1
2196,"Joker is a masterpiece, a movie destined to be a timeless classic. Joaquin Phoenix gives a performance that will go down as an all-time great in this intense, violent, disturbing crime thriller that will leave you horrified, confused, and delighted all at the same time.",1
2197,"Joker came out this weekend with mixed reviews, viewers seemed to (mostly) really enjoy it, while critics reviewed it poorly. I watched it Sunday night, and the theater was mostly empty. I for the most part enjoyed the film myself; with a huge exception. The characterization of the Joker was far from what I expected. Allow me to explain, and please, stick with me until the end. This article will contain some plot point spoilers, so be forewarned! If you have not yet seen the film (and I think that you should), please click away now and watch it first!I’ll start with what I loved about Phoenix's Joker. His insanity was explained in a way that is believable, his delusions and his ‘condition’ help to shape and mold the character. That being said, I am a firm believer in never explaining the monster, when you do that it becomes less frightening. The way that the film explained it though (since it is an origin story).The big issue that I took with the characterization is this: The Joker (eventually) will have battles of wits with The Batman, who is, for all intents and purposes, the greatest detective alive. Keeping this in mind, it is imperative that The Joker be equally as intelligent as, if not more than, Bruce Wayne. That is not The Joker that we meet in this film! It is as if the writers placed all the points into luck and none into intelligence! They painted the character as a bumbling fool, he never outsmarted the police, he never tricked the mayor, he just stumbled into a way out of each situation until the end of the film.It feels like the writers did not understand the source material, or if they understood it, they simply did not care about it. There was no future proofing it. If they created in this Joker an idiot, there is no way that they can have that same Joker face Batman down the road. Like I said, I did enjoy the film mostly, I just took issue with the intelligence of (or lack of) the character.",1
2198,It's a great movie which really focuseson the character growth of Arthur Fleck(Joker).The acting of Joaquin Phoenixis excellent. The only negative side of film is that the story is going in a slow pace.But that helped us to understand the transformation of Arthur Fleck into joker in depth.,1
2199,"This movie is a masterpiece , joaquin Phoenix joker can stand toe to toe with heath ledgers joker please see this film",1
2200,"Master class performance, touching and psychological thriller movie. Fitting beginning to a Joker that I wish to see more of.",1
2201,"For all the ""critics"" that know nothing about the Joker's history in the comic books, go f***k yourselves. This is a perfect Joker origin story. Sure, it borrows elements from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy but also involves an unreliable narrator so the audience is left determining what is objectively true and what isn't. And by the way, his condition is a real thing, it's called Pseudobulbar Affect where people laugh or cry when it has nothing to do with their actual emotional state.",1
2202,Don't listen to the critics who don't know the difference between art and reality. Go and watch the movie and make your own opinion.Joker is a masterpiece and JOAQUIN PHONEIX deserves all best actor awards of the year.,1
2203,"Uma obra prima dos cinemas. Perfeito do começo ao fim, show de atuação de Joaquin Phoenix. Digna de Oscar, magnífica.",1
2204,Cinematics: 10/10Story:    9/10Dialogues:    10/10Acting:    10/10Overall enjoyment 10,1
2205,"I'm not about to turn this review into the hot take Olympics -- as many figures in the film criticism arena have undoubtedly attempted to do with their opinions on this film -- though, I will say that Todd Phillips (yes, the very same Todd Phillips behind such films as ""Road Trip,"" ""Old School"" and ""The Hangover"" trilogy) has really tapped into something here. Something so deeply unsettling, visceral, and yet impossible to turn away from. So mind-searingly horrific, yet deeply emotional and thematically resonant. So incredibly well-crafted and performed that I honestly cannot help but include it among my favorites for the entire year. I mean, look around. You can't swing a cat without striking someone with thoughts on this movie and its meanings/implications for our times. For all of this to emanate from a movie based on a comic book character honestly amazes me in the best way, no matter how exhausting some of the discussions have become. In an age where every comic book film is compared to and contrasted with every other iteration from its own canon, other canons, etc., I totally understand why there's a fatigue that's come about in response to it all. But here comes Todd Phillips (I'm honestly still having a hard time believing that he's the filmmaker behind this thing) with a mold-breaking, crowd-censuring treatise on everything that's wrong with our understanding of the downtrodden -- one that I feel still very elegantly straddles the line between doing this and absolutely holding the antiheroic antics of the protagonist to a standard of personal responsibility. It's a high-wire act of nerve-frying narrative choices, incredible cinematography, moral pyrotechnics, a performance that's honestly career-defining, and the Batman mythos. And it roundly accomplishes what it sets out to do. It warns. It scars. It contextualizes a world we all thought we understood in a way we could have never imagined.I love this. I love this and I know it's a movie that doesn't love me back.There's no doubt in my mind that, as a comic book movie, this has to be the greatest undertaking any creative team has ever had to assume, especially considering all the implications and discourses that the film's spawned. The creators knew the conversations that this movie was going to create and were undeterred and unafraid. I applaud them for it.",1
2206,Hands down the best performance by any actor I've ever seen. This film is a must see. Todd Phillips hit a grand slam. This is an entire new level of film making.,1
2207,"An absolutely brilliant character study/ origin story of the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing, maybe only bested by Todd Phillips directing. The pace of Joker is perfect, diving deep into the psychosis of the character, with each passing scene serving as another puzzle piece which eventually completes to reveal a terrible picture, very worthy of the iconic DC comics villain.My theater experience was fairly weak because of all of the people around me, laughing at inappropriate times, and seemingly not sure of the films intentions with the irony it displayed. People were constantly up and about in the theater, among other distractions like coughing, crunching on food, and chairs squeaking, the film was so good that I could tune all of that crap out. So be wary of some of the reviews from people on here that don't say much about the film, or who talk more about it making a negative cultural impact, they clearly didn't see the film that I saw. If you like films like A Clockwork Orange and King of Comedy, you will most-likely enjoy this movie, but if you want to see another Hollywood superhero blockbuster, this film is not for you.9.5/10",1
2208,"The message outside the fantasy of the superheroes is marked by the unequal and lack of context to understand the development of each person, is judged without arguments and pursued without justification generating alter egos in society justified and with context.",1
2209,"A very dark, but well made origin story. Joaquin Phoenix's rendition of the Joker is one of the best yet!",1
2210,"Best Dark Movie I have ever seen. And it's so much thrilling, superb Acting, and superb Direction.",1
2211,"The best  based DC comics ever made, don't listen to woke media opinions. Cinematography and performances are amazing.",1
2212,Excellent movie. Joaquin Phoenix Deserves Oscar .The cinematography outstanding. Every frame is made perfectly.,1
2213,"Masterpiece, but keep in mind, that the madness of the main protagonist is contagious.",1
2214,A well crafted movie.... Did every justice to The character joker. The cinematography was good and everything about this movie was awesome.It shows how the Gotham City started out to be the chaotic city that we know it to be.,1
2215,Great Film. It really doesn't have alot of violence like some want you to believe. This is a character study on a man with serious mental problems and a society who throws him away like garbage and him taking control of his destiny down a dark path. The last 20 min of this film was brilliant. This is a film that will go down as a one to remember when talking about the comic book genre even more then infinity war and end game.,1
2216,"One of the best movies of the year. It’s obvious that this movie would have a bad score from the critics, because it tells us all thats wrong with today’s society. I loved Joaquim Phoenix, from the first moment I knew he was playing as the joker, I thought this movie would be great! The dark aesthetic of the movie makes you fell like you are in a very dark and obscure society. The music is really good too. It’s a must watch!!!!",1
2217,İt was a great that show us the capitalist system in this world. İm happy to learn more about jokers story.,1
2218,Saw it twice. It's brilliant. Surpaces the status of film to become a cultural phenomenon,1
2219,"A masterpiece, it's something you have to watch through to understand, it's difficult to watch but it's because its so true what this movie tells you. Don't listen to all these things about glorifying killers, it is first of all a movie about the joker so sorry to tell you but people were gonna die to begin with and it really makes you understand what can push a person over the edge. Beautiful visuals and beautifully portrayed. Hope there is a sequel!",1
2220,"После ""Аквамена"" я зарекся не ходить больше на фильмы DC.После ""Человек паук 2 и Мстителей:Финал"" я решил, что больше не буду ходить на фильмы MARVEL.После золотого льва ""Джокер"", пошел в кино.И за мои 30 лет, это один из лучших фильмов что я видел, который показывает социальную драму, которая подходит под современное общество.Если DC, выберет для себя ЭТОТ курс и в жанрах комиксах, будут эксперименты подобные ""Логан"" или ""Джокер"", то данный жанр наполнится смыслом, а не уйдет/съедет в пучину забвения как когда-то фильмы про вампиров, которыми травили в нулевые.",1
2221,"The twists are obvious and the ending is clear. The movie is gripping nonetheless, with a career defining performance by Phoenix, and stays with you for days, or may be even months (it is to be seen). But the reason it is the movie of the year (i daresay even the decade) is how poignant and relevant it is. In this era of post-truth and loudness, where even presidents are morons - the movie shines as a cautious tale of what's to come should humanity continue it's course. And if you want to know if it works - just look at how many critics were scared and tried to dismiss this masterpiece as derivative, storyless or any other -less, when the movie is nothing but full to the brim with heart and soul, and most importantly - with multilayered message that is relevant now more than ever.",1
2222,Obra maestra desde ya. Increíbles dos horas que remueven todas las conciencias y dan un bofetón con la mano abierta a deriva que llevamos en nuestra sociedad.,1
2223,"This film is a masterpiece, JP need to win the oscar. Deep and Heartbreaking origin of the Joker.",1
2224,Please watch this movie to upscale your cinema experience. Joaquin Pheonix is class apart.,1
2225,"It was tooo good.. Dark, sensational, thrilling, strong acting, thought provoking and what not.. If you haven't watched it yet.. then please go and watch it...",1
2226,Joaquin you got a Oscar! although movie's pacing is slow but as time passes it gets real great.Its too dark yet balanced punchlines makes it worth watch.Todd philps you rocks!!,1
2227,"No matter the amount of praise we give it is still not enough for the quality of performance delivered by Joaquin Pheonix in this movie. And this is by far the best joker origin story which ties everything up in a neat little bow and that sets up a relation between batman and joker far beyond just a criminal and vigilante; while also giving a reasoning to the joker's obsession with batman. And the cinematography just knocked it out of the park for me. The shots, composition, choice of colour palette was brilliant. Even at its brutal best the movie manages to still makes you laugh a moment after someone's head has been smashed to a pulp (secretly making you wonder how crooked you can be)",1
2228,Slow build up to a chaotic story. Perfect telling of a dark story. Not for the faint of heart.  It's twisted,1
2229,"A satire, You can't watch it, you can't leave it. The best description of a comic character ever on a screen.",1
2230,"Great cinematography,great acting by Joaquin phoenix,deserve atleat an Oscar nomination",1
2231,"As miserable as it is, there is no denying that there is a stark beauty about the back story of Joker.  It is however, not only a decently complex and thought provoking story, also a good performance from Phoenix; but also a love letter to what cultural nuances are on display today...  Bottom line: Thought provking, in good and bad ways!",1
2232,"Just an amazing movie. Do not trust ""professional"" (political) reviewers, it is a must see and a highly emotional experience",1
2233,Una película atrapante que pasa de la compasión y la simpatía de un personaje al total reconocimiento del mismo como digna representación del psicópata que todos conocemos como joker,1
2234,"Fantastic movie, tense all the way from beggining to end. Love the roller coaster ride of emotions that start with sympathy and turns into fear. Please ignore all the negative reviews as they ideologically driven. This is a fantastic movie, please leave you political insanity at home and just enjoy fiction!",1
2235,"This is a masterpiece.Coringa é um filme impressionante. Não é a obra prima que esperávamos, mas é a que precisamos.",1
2236,"First and foremost some of these pretentious critics can suck on a limon. They have let their political views and ideologies blind them to the purely majestic yet gritty beauty that this film and Phoenix are. They themselves could never ever play a role even close to role Phoenix played, he dove deep in the mind of a psychopath with delusions of grandeur like no one has on film up to date. His performance was legendary, it still has me contemplating the roll days later; the cinematography felt so real and gritty i actually felt apart of that chaotic world threw the whole experience. Some critics say their was no message, well let me tell you something there is! 1. Don't mess with people or bully them be cause you don't know what their day or life has been like and what point of a breakdown they are in. 2. Mental health is a serious problem and those that have these issues are just people who just want to fit and most times they are just pushed aside into the gutters of this world to fend for themselves. It is when these people are overlooked and uncared for by their loved ones, friends, society and or the system that their illusions of grandeur become the chaotic tragedy of some people's reality. If you can't see that, then you really didn't even watch the film.",1
2237,Strong and dependant character performed by phoenix. It is full of depressed scene that reflect most people that lived a **** job for living.,1
2238,A beautiful character study of both the Joker and modern society yet while it’s heavely inspired by Martin Scorsese’s King of Comedy and Taxi Driver the film remains its own beast and one that roars to the finish line !,1
2239,"“I’m not mad at all!! I’m just differently sane!! Man was this a great movie. Joaquin Phoenix brings his own take to the clown prince of crime. As you watch you can feel the anger, sadness and hopelessness in his performance as his character Arthur slips closer and closer into madness. In this movie you find yourself feeling for Artur because you know that life has dealt him a poor hand. Yes there is violence in this movie, but not without means. This is a comic book base movie, but it doesn’t feel like one and neither does it have to be.",1
2240,Don't listen to the unhinged swj idiots. Good movie. Phoenix is tremendous in it.,1
2241,"One of the best films I have sat through in I can't even remember how long. Wasn't expecting it at all. Went in thinking I was going to see yet another stupid superhero movie. Ended up with an extremely deep, very realistic character piece. Will never get Joaquin Phoenix's performance out of my head.",1
2242,"Wow, this movie is a masterpiece. I really hope to see this Joker again. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar.",1
2243,"I have nothing to say, but perfection. The cinematography was perfect, the casting and acting was perfect, the story was perfect. I'm in love with this movie.",1
2244,"This movie was well put together. Phenomenal acting and directing, and had an overall good feel and look to it. It made me really sympathize with Arthur at the start of the movie, but towards the end I started to have a disdain towards him. It seems that the more noticed he is the crazier and more unreasonable he becomes.",1

2246,Una actuación impresionante de Joaquín Phoenix en una película de DC sin superhéroes.  Pone el dedo en la llaga frente a como la sociedad aborda el incómodo tema de las enfermedades mentales.,1
2247,"Lo mejor del año. Phoenix es soberbio, segundo sin él en pantalla la película no funciona. No le pongo 10 a la peli por que existe la Naranja Mecánica (otra peli de un psicópata asesino por el cual sientes empatía)",1
2248,Very fun enjoyable movie. Good character study. Must watch for dc fans and joaquin phoenix fans,1
2249,"An amazing performance from Phoenix. A very good movie, but not really a masterpiece. Go see it.",1
2250,"This filme is simple Brilliant. Joaquim does a marvelous job in every take. This is not your typical comic book movie, it's very dark and brutal tho only violent when really needs too be. Talking about violence, this film doesn't have as much as the media claims. I didn't have any faith on this project, I'm glad I was surprised. It's a must see!",1
2251,"Joker simplemente espectacular te deja sin aliento y suspirando es la mejor del año simplemente  es todo lo que prometió y mas  , es Viaje hacia la locura de un personaje victima y victimario de la sociedad   Es un clarísimo pero clarísimo espejo ala sociedad del mundo en general con políticos corruptos que se pintan de salvadores pero que solo buscan su bienestar y el de su elite con periodistas  que trabajan para ellos  . La película es brillante crítica social con un Guion espléndido  una trama que te toma  de la mano y te lleva de principio a fin con una fotografía hermosa y una dirección sorprendente de todo phillips y el monstruo de Joaquín Phoenix que Dios mío este tipo se merece ese Oscar si o si  , el resto del elenco. Esta bien pero no destaca mucho por su poco tiempo en pantalla pero lo hacen bien y no hacen falta   Mi calificación es 9.3/10 las mejores 2 horas que he pasado en el cine en mucho tiempo",1
2252,"That TIME magazine review is whack, lol. The movie was just fine. Dark, different, and complex character development.",1
2253,Oscar deserving.Especially the role played by joaquin phoenix ...he has nailed it.,1
2254,Joker is an amazing movie. It perfectly encapsulates the reason why incel mass shootings take place. Refreshing to see villans with depth rather than a one dimensional cutout.,1
2255,No words to define this Amazing Piece of Art.  ,1
2256,"Totally different from any other superhero movies, and it addresses alot of societal problems. I think joker is a necessary evil to uphold balance to the scale as he represents alot of things that are tragic as he is a product of our wrong doings. This a powerful movie and one needs an open mind to view it and im all for it.",1
2257,A massive punch in the face ! Haven't felt this since Fight club. I'm quite happy to see the critics destroyed it as well. Phoenix deserves the Oscar for this amazing performance !,1
2258,"I don't remember when a movie make me feel this rollercoaster of emotions, happiness, sadness, confusion, angry, it's a genius movie.",1
2259,Monumental performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Great character development and a stunning camera work.,1
2260,"A huge masterpiece! I'm the person who really hates marvel movies (and also dc movies but they had also huge **** stories). But this movie changed everything, I don't think every comic book movie will became that great now but at least they will know what should they achieve.",1
2261,Perfect movie about the most interesting villian in the comics industry. Recommend.,1
2262,"Amazing, sublime película pero aun más la actuación de Phoenix, sin duda merece el Oscar",1

2267,An amazing movie which transport us into the crazy mind of Joker in a gloomy Gotham city in a scary realistic way.,1
2268,Words fall short to describe the performance of Joaquin Pheonix. Pure excellence and outstanding performance.,1
2269,"Masterpiece!Joaquin Pheniox should win an Oscar for his portrayal of JOKER and Todd Phillips deserve a huge round of applause for blending darkness, horror, anxiety, mental disability so freaking well. Robert de Nero is as always at his best.Joker excels in score, cinematography, Realism, acting and direction.Overall Joker is a MUST WATCH!",1
2270,"Wonderful. Пишу здесь что-бы это осталось у меня в Review, ну фильм крутой, просто нарушает все правила, как и сам джокер",1
2271,Joker should be ranked #1 By UserScore Rankings for Current Movie Releases. May I ask why isn't Joker is NOT? Everyone I know only looks at the UserScore Rankings. How long will Joker be censored like this?,1
2272,"Don't look at the retarded journalist who underrate Joker, wich is one of the best movie in the past decade",1
2273,An excellent vision into the birth of the Joker. Shows the dark side of society and the pitfalls facing the modern world. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this movie! Ignore the access medias awful agenda driven reviews!!!!,1
2274,"Best Movie of the year,dark,strong acting, realistic and Memorable Characters.",1
2275,Una de las mejores peliculas del a;o super recomendada para todos excepto los menores de 17 no vallan a verla,1
2276,Uma verdadeira visão que a DC deveria mostrar mas nos filmes... uma viagem pela vida do melhor vilão que apenas quer mostrar que todos tem um lado louco... mas ele sempre quer ser o mais!,1
2277,The film combines the dark and light parts of Arthur. Like the twilight moment it is difficult to recognize. Facing it is enjoyable and it will be impossible to escape.,1
2278,This movie is a must watch. Finally they have made a great DC universe movie again without trying to copy Marvel formula and did their own thing.  joaquin Phoenix's acting is amazing.,1
2279,A slow burn but so worth it. Not sure how it has such low critic scores....,1
2280,"I think this movie really had the true story of Jokers origin story. It taught us that Joker became this crazy villain because of the people in Gotham treating him like garbage.There was twists, action, and true acting through this whole movie! Joker was by far the best origin story I've seen",1
2281,"Esta es una película del origen el Joker, la trama es excelente, y también los actores, hicieron un excelente trabajo.",1
2282,Amazing movie. It’s definitely not forever one but it worth a try. It’s a mind game for sure.,1
2283,just watched it few hours ago. sat on it digested it now giving a quick approval. all and all great movie I hope they continue with a future batman vs joker. Jared Leto is a chump compared to this bad boy. its a slow burn but the climax made this movie for me. Great flick i vote with my wallet I spent 10 bucks to see this and i would spend 11 on a sequel .,1
2284,I don't like to give 10s... and wow this movie deserved it...everyone in the cinema was silent like in church... the movie is mesmerizing...won't spoil it...just watch it in the cinema while this makes history.,1
2285,"Just can't understand the bad critics. It's a great movie, the labor of Joaquin Phoenix is marvelous.",1
2286,Few films have left me so shaken. I didn't think Todd Phillips was capable of something like this.,1
2287,"excellent rhythm in the narrative, a masterful performance, a beautifully macabre soundtrack and an open ending that will speak during the next few years.  Go see her to be able to brag about having seen a masterpiece on the big screen.",1
2288,Arthur really gets u scratching head in this movie. One of the best films of this decade,1
2289,"Favorite movie of this year! Must watch! The ""critiqs"" are out of their minds!",1
2290,"I heard mixed reviews on this film however I had to see for myself, and I am giving this film and eight. A hard to stomach production as we dive into the character we all know as The Joker. Growing up off of DC, we as the viewers are so accustomed to the playful yet hazardous cartoon character. There have been many times where we catch glimpses of the Dark-side the Joker portrays. That being said this film truly grasps the realism and humanity this very troubled being has to offer. Misunderstood and deeply disturbed. I could see how they were mixed reviews I neither love the character noor hated the character... but rather understood The ramifications. The unfortunate fact is, this film may have you truly cringing as you take a journey into to the mind of the Joker. The only reason for distastefulness I can justify is that there are people out in the word who truly suffer this way witch may cause a rebuttal.",1
2291,"Beta-Taxi Driver that despite being held down by it's unfortunate connections with DC, actually manages to be a fairly enjoyable film overall.",1
2292,The movie is simply a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is great at depicting a troubled man that the world he inhabits has left him behind. Although I have to say that some thing could have been left out for a stand alone film there was the need to include them just so the joker fan-base could be satisfied. People who like films that have more than one layer should not miss the chance to see this in cinema given that the audience reaction gives it an plus in tension.,1
2293,"Absolute brilliant acting, absolute wonderful movie.A movie about a crazy, abandoned man by the point of view of the mental man, absolute mindblowing in the end. Rewatch needed.",1
2294,"Pretty intense movie and pure gold acting. Of course mainstream ""critics"" would love to hate on it, but not the public. This is not the best movie ever, but is the best Joker origin story. It's not a comic book movie, it's character movie of Arthur and how he becomes the joker. No, this did not turn anyone a mass shooter. Media always wants controversy and clicks. I am here for a good movie.",1
2295,"This movie deserves the world! I cannot even express how much i enjoyed watching it! I am so ready to give it a second go and watch it again, in order to analyze all the details that I've missed! This movie sheds light upon mental illness, especially how childhood abuse influences your adult life and how society can actually turn you into a monster. It shows the involution of Arthur and how his tragic life develops and transforms into a comedy, driving him into complete madness. The movie shows the differences between the poor and the rich and shows the struggles of the real world. This movie is real, it is a psychological action drama that shows us how raw humanity is and what the consequences of untreated mental illness can lead to. This does not at all provoke anyone to start being violent or dress up as clowns and riot the streets. This makes the viewer analyze his own life, analyze his own moral values and realize for themselves what is right, what is wrong, what is good, what is evil. Joaquin Phoenix brought justice for the Joker, as I haven't seen such a good Joker since Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. Joaquin Phoenix, an actor that definitely deserves an Oscar, perfectly portrayed an unstable Arthur and a crazy Joker, that, in the end, were combined and became only one. His movements, facial expressions, tonality of voice, were sublime and brought mystery, darkness and truth to us all.In the end, you won't know anymore what is real and what is not, as the enigmatic ending plays with your mind and leaves you with numerous unanswered questions.",1
2296,"A masterpiece. Music on point, Phoenix is phenomenal, sad, heavy, dark, rotten atmosphere. Red carpet belongs to this movie this year.",1
2297,"The movie is a true character study. Although expectedly disturbing, the story successfully sheds light on the world view, and the socio-psychological elements that lead to the development (or lack thereof) of a personality like the Joker's.A Brilliant movie!",1
2298,Outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really feel this character. Anyone who has ever been picked on or feels the world is against them will relate more. The message should be clear on how some people don't realize how badly they treat others. We live in a world where sometimes people are so wrapped up in themselves they don't care about another human being's feelings. For me I found myself on the Joker's side. I felt pain for his pain. He has just been kicked down over and over again. He feels that life is just nasty and short and nobody cares?! The human race is bad. Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job of conveying that vulnerability and rage. With the mood swings and crazy laugh it's hard to imagine that you want him to be the hero not a villain. In his mind he is the hero ridding the world of cruel people. There have been several very different portrayals of the Joker in other movies but by far Joaquin Phoenix is in a class of his own. A dark character that you feel sympathy and empathy for. He's aware a monster is evolving inside of him and he struggles with it before releasing it. Overall this is a solid movie with a lot of darkness and depth and Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves an award for the best performance I have seen in a very long time.,1
2299,"best perfomance, best movie of the year, MOTY ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",1
2300,"Brilliant acting and a gripping story That's just believable enough to make you feel a shred of understanding for the Joker's background character. The people that think this was meant to ""start something"" are coming into this movie with no knowledge of how the Joker has always been prortrayed and lack imagination preferring to see only nuances and ""hidden"" agendas. Be a film critic, not a society critic.",1
2301,"Breath taking performance, amazing character build up and a great finale that will leave you wondering",1
2302,"It's a real movie, it's going to give the MCU blinking-flashlight legion a headache, and that's a good thing.",1
2303,"The movie is not trying to condone violence, but to show how dangerous it is when people disrespect other person and what happens when that person snaps. This is the best performance I have seen so far this year from Joaquin Phoenix, and his best work as of now.",1
2304,"Bem o filme vale pela interpretacao de Joaquin Phoenix, no entanto, o filme acaba por ser demasiado nihilista, para uma personagem que nao necessitava de um filme de origem. Nao acho que seja a obra-prima que falam, mas a composicao e entrega do actor acaba por merecer todo o destaque, ofuscando as fragilidades do material.",1
2305,"An excellent movie. A high qualitative performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The pictures are awesome, the music fits perfectly. I think that the interpretation of the Joker's laugh is really original. The idea of a sad Joker whose laugh does not show happiness is for me the more interesting Joker. A sad, complicated character who does not even plan to be a criminal. The circumstances lead him to his true path in life. His tics, his moves, his behavior as a whole built a true crazy character. The dance moves in the film add some extra beauty to his performance. Heath Ledger (another near-perfect performance of the Clown prince of crime) was to me too conscious. He had so many plans and shemes, he had opinions about the society and plans how to test it and this I feel is not typicall for a crazy person. I like the weaknesses of this Joker. The crazy little tics he shows throughout the film. You can see that he is actually a sick man not just because he kills people. The messege is nothing new for the film industy - the little man who is neglected by the society. That is why I gave it 9, not 10. When it comes to comparing the Ledger and the Phoenix interpretation of the Joker I think there are two viewpoints. Some would prefer the Joker to be the apex predator in Gotham, forcing everybody to kneel before him. I prefer the Joker being crazy, emotional, sometimes weak and vulnerable and sad. You will always find something in every movie that you would change. But you should see the movie as it is and you should judge by what you have seen, not by what you would've wanted to see.",1
2306,"I saw Joker last night at the Studio Movie Grill in Marietta, GA. There were two police officers on hand, but it was a very calm and peaceful evening. The theater was completely full and there were a lot of people who clapped and even cried during the movie. However, not once did I ever fear for my safety or my life. Never once did I feel or sense there was going to be anarchy, chaos, or a riot after the movie. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE. Just like any other action movie with guns, violence, and killing in it (F&F, John Wick, etc., etc.). All in all, I thought 2019's Joker was a great movie is a masterpiece with an oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Pheonix. It was a very human movie. It show's a man who's been broken down, beaten, lied to, and mistreated his whole life. A man who feels isolated, alone, unwanted, and unloved in a system and society completely against him. Because of the way the film is portrayed and because of the incredible talent of Joaquin Phoenix, you can empathize and sympathize with his character. You feel sorry for him and all of the incredibly unjust bs he goes through. You may even find yourself wishing you could help him. Because of that, you can understand his descent into madness and the reason behind all of his characters' actions (not that they were wholly just or correct by any means). It gave depth and insight into the Joker's and Batman's (Bruce Wayne's) relationship and their history as a prequel movie. The ONLY things I can think of why certain groups of people might be against this movie are: 1) They don't like DC Comics or Batman. 2) They don't like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. 3) They're afraid that the movie will empower self-righteous people who are fed-up with a corrupt government into taking action and causing Anarchy (like in the movie). 4) They think that grown adults don't have any common sense and/or general reasoning skills, can't distinguish between reality and fiction, and cannot control their own thoughts and actions. All-in-all, I thought this was a wonderful adaptation and I would highly recommend this film to all my family and friends. 10/10.",1
2307,"Joker is a wonderfully crafted movie depicting the plight of Arthur Fleck and how he is betrayed by the system and people of his society. Arthur Fleck has a mental illness. Anyone with any sensory functions can see this. Because of this character trait, the media have stirred up controversy over this character because of how he is portrayed. Joker is not some ""incel guide"" to teach mentally disturbed white men how to become violent menaces, it's a deep and captivating story about someone who struggles with mental issues and is belittled for his condition. The reason why these so called ""critics"" and media outlets **** on this movie is because they are afraid of facing reality. This kind of thing happens in real life all the time. Not everyone with a mental illness becomes a mass killer, but when someone is failed by the system and everyone around them, there is a potential risk of creating a monster. The movie is not the problem, it is the people that constantly throw the blame on external factors, when in reality it is the fault of themselves. I felt for Arthur Fleck and could empathize with his past and situation. It's hard to watch this movie and not want to go through the screen and give him a hug, lend him an ear to listen, or to find him a better therapist. I am in no way justifying his actions, because they are cruel and unforgivable. But it's hard not to empathize with someone who has been spat down on their entire life, with no hope of recovery whatsoever. If you go into this movie expecting a family friendly cake walk, then you're in for a wild surprise. It is rated R for a reason. It deals with themes that are surprisingly real and raw. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding and he really displayed the character well through his wonderful acting. I, as someone who doesn't really know much about DC, really enjoyed this movie as a work of art and a social commentary. I cannot speak of it's accuracy to the Joker story, but it made me interested to dive deeper into the DC universe. If you enjoy movies that are gritty and put you through an emotional roller coaster, than this is the movie for you.",1
2308,"every aspect of guason is dazzling, photography, the soundtrack and how it was used to make sense of the story, in addition to talking about the masterful performance of Joaquin Phoenix, makes you feel the real terror. Without a doubt the best actor of this year, if Oscar is not taken, it is for the whole campaign they did against the joker.",1
2309,best film about mental health issues i’ve ever seen. Acting is amazing from start to finish and the finale is brilliant,1
2310,"Awesome movie, 11/10. Its may be the greatest film from DC. I love Heath Leger, but Joaquin Phoenix is a new level.",1
2311,"One of the most defining movies of the 21st century. It wonderfully depicts another version of the most popular media villain of all time, but, most importantly, the movie depicts what our society has become and how much it alienates us. The people turn against each other and everyone is out for themselves. The film is sad and so is our reality, but we have the power to change that by being nice to each other and accept everyone who is different. By doing so, the chances of creating a “Joker” will be very unlikely...",1
2312,Sublime. What a brilliant film. Joaquin was mesmerising and fully deserves all the accolades he's getting.  I smell an Oscar!,1
2313,Probably the best movie I have seen in a while. It really shows what Arthur is going through and how he transforms into the Joker.,1
2314,Some of the bad critics must be thinking that the movie will just go away if they give it a bad rating. Did they really expect real morals from a movie about the Joker? They’re wishing so they could call it unauthentic. Yes this movie is very likely to be unsettling and yes this movie may be sinister and dark. But it‘s as Joker as it gets. And through that Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix probably played the biggest (and sickest) joke on our cinema industry.,1
2315,"Personally I really liked the movie. It took a somewhat predictable and flat character as the Joker of the comic books that he can't seem to escape from the stereotype of the psychopath mastermind who causes chaos for no apparent reason at all. This leads to an empty plot and it shows a great indifference for the struggles of a person with a mental disorder. On the other hand Arthur Fleck seems a much more relatable figure. He is a person who struggles with his mental illness and who is trying his best to fit into the world. He tries to become one with the crowd and to feel connected with the others, while society seems to never care about him or other individuals that are a bit different than the normal. The Gotham city is appeared to be a dystopia where great social struggles take place. The rich remain rich and the poor must live in the isolation, the crime and the fear of survival. There is no providence for their lives and their health and most of them live in misery.  Everyone is at the point where they want to rebel against a machine that only works for the rich. Everyone lives a life that is almost unbearable and this is portrayed through Arthur. Arthur tries his best to be a good person, to live a normal life and to make his dream even if it's hopeless to come true. His mental illness is very severe and the state doesn't seem to care at all for people like him. Essentially he is all alone in a world where he is considered a freak that can easily turn to a scapegoat. With this kind of indifference and isolation the character develops and falls little by little into madness. It's the society's ways that committed the crime before Arthur did it himself. At this point the movie builds a lot into the character of Joker and gives him a certain depth to realize that he isn't a farfetched character, but a normal person who suffered and was pushed to crime by an estranged society that cheers the social differences. I like how the movie plays with the layers of truth from the start till the very end. I like how everything seems to lead to a certain structure and then this structure is being destroyed as if to portray how a human can feel deconstructed by the coldness of his surrounding environment. I believe that the movie is essentially social and makes us all feel a little more sympathy for people with mental illness as well as contemplate on our way of life and the dangers the system may hide. The clown uprising in the town is nothing but the eruption of accumulated misery in a society where only the rich can flourish, while the poor are always being neglected and walked upon. It's not the first time that someone even a murderer becomes an idol for his actions when such social struggles take place and this is what makes this movie real. The actors were all amazing, the cinematography was breathtaking, the protagonist is simply brilliant and the plot is essentially deep and meaningful. I like all the associations the plot can enable with sociology, psychology, literature and history. I love to see the building of a character and I find that certain scenes were simply amazing and ingenious. One of them must be the Joker meeting young Bruce. We don't have two mortal enemies there, but a troubled man who wants to find the truth who tries not to scare of a little boy. Yes he is manipulative towards him but at the same time he has nothing against him and throughout the movie we see that Arthur was very friendly towards the children. It gave me chills to see their interaction to be so friendly and simple knowing that later on they will be enemies. I really liked the idea to connect the arc of Joker with Bruce's loss of his parents since it shows that in reality we don't have a black and white picture but many shades of gray in between. Every action has a reaction and even if the first seems right to one there's always a different perspective. The same applies with the reality. Some choose to see the story of Joker to be nothing but a joke he made while he was talking with his psychiatrist (as to say a very pessimistic and nihilistic turn to what makes us humans) but at the same time someone can read this scene differently. All of his story could easily happen and it makes a lot of sense according with what we saw to feel sorry and a certain sympathy for this troubled character. Yet everyone seems to forget it all again after the force of the system takes down the uprising. All of these events didn't bring the change he wanted to see, didn't make him more lovable to the crowd didn't give him the happiness he was searching, rather he is portrayed as the villain and the society seems to return to point zero..",1
2316,MasterpieceIt's been a Very long time since I enjoyed a movie this much. ever Since the Dark Knight and Joaquin Phoenix's performance was extraordinary,1

2318,Very good ,1
2319,A manifest in the heroism of victimhood. The darkest and most depressing political statement i have ever seen in a theatre. Yoakim was great as was cinematography but not enough to see. Finally hollywood has no problem with gratuitous gun violence as long as it agianst white men in suits.,0
2320,Sublime.............................................................................................................................................,1
2321,Fun movie good story with interesting back story for the joker no idea what the critics are smoking with the bad reviews,1
2322,"In a classic Batman movie (in 2000s), you see Gotham from the point of view of the honorable elites. You feel Bruse Wayne's pain and love for the city. You sense the necessity of sacrifice of such social elites to save the city. Joker, on the other hand, tells the story from an entirely different angle. You get to see Gotham from the point of view of a commoner, who struggles at his day to day life, just like all the other commoners, struck by recession, having little to rely on, cheating and hurting others on daily basis just to get by. You get to see the City from the eyes of people who are routinely looked down upon by the Elite, either as trash, or as someone to be ""changed"" or ""saved"".One suggestion for the viewer who is going to watch this movie:Although from the surface level, the Gotham and the people portrayed in this movie might feels different from the impression you got from Batman movies. Remember that you are looking at the world from the perspective of the Joker. Watch with your existing understandings on those familiar characters in mind. Try and understand the contradictions that you see. Enjoy the movie with this mind set, you will end up with a much deeper appreciation over this piece of art.Joker is, with no doubt, a dark movie, as what a movie named as Joker should be. Yet with the dark story, it intrigues deep contemplation. Moreover, the social problem this movie portrays actually reflects the ever growing conflicts and dissonance in multiple parts of our contemporary world on many interesting levels. In my humble opinion, this movie is the definition of MASTERPIECE.",1
2323,"I love that ""Professional"" critics wanted this movie to be about ""Greater good"", they wanted this movie to ""have a point"". They accused it of not having a solution for the problems it unveiled. Well its true that this film doesn't have the answers but that is not the movie is about. Movie surfaced the problems in a very depressing angle which shook the viewers. That's how the movie caught the interest of the audience. It is a remarkable movie with great acting. Movies are not propaganda to influence your ""solutions"". Joker started conversation and it told us the problems with a great art and picture. I can not ask more from a film. I didn't expect a conclusive ending and received a great movie experience. Reminder that movie critics are just people who are trying to push down their agenda. Happy that most of the audience liked it. It will go down in history with the other great movies regardless of an oscar or critics just like Fight Club.",1
2324,O melhor filme de 2019 !!!Uma verdadeira demonstração da degradação humana e da sociedade.,1
2325,"Buff i have to say that this movie is the best that i have watched in this year.Joker is a drama which told the Arthur's story and like step a step he gets in a crazy man.I have to stand out two things, the fantastic Joaquin Phoenix's performance and the great direction and photography this movie.I recommend it, and it helps to evolve the superheroes subgenre.",1
2326,"The movie was brilliant. It showed how joker was created after how the society treated him, it showed mental illness problems that he had and how people kept rejecting him. It didn't feel rushed at all, the took the time to build a character that is THE JOKER. The acting was amazing, the scenes felt right the camera angles felt right everything about the movie was just great, recommend it.",1

2345,"E-Value: 9Acting: 9Plot: 9Unlike the previous DC movies (after 2012's The Dark Knight Rises) which is set in DC Extended Universe, Joker is a standalone movie which is separated from the shared universe franchise and starred Joaquin Phoenix as the titular character instead of Jared Leto, who previously portrayed the character in 2016's Suicide Squad.Set in the year of 1981, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) lives in Gotham City with his mother, Penny Fleck (Conroy), and works a party clown to make ends meet. He also idolised the talk show host, Franklin Murray (De Niro) and wants to be like him one day. Life in Gotham City is very difficult for him because the city is filled with crimes, unemployment and society is very heavily divided between the rich and poor.Arthur also has a disorder which causes him to laugh at inappropriate times and he always relied on social services program for his medication. His life starts to get from bad to worse when he lost his job due to bringing a gun to a children's hospital while entertaining the children which is meant for his own protection and being sold out by his friend who gave him the gun to protect his own skin.The worst things happened to him does not stop there. After he lost his job, he gets beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises employees in a subway train which forced him to kill two of them with his gun in self-defense and execute the last one when he attempts to escape. Not long after that, he loses access to his medication after the social services program got shut down due to budget cut and learns a horrifying truth about his mother along with his past. Arthur's fall to the path of darkness begins here.While it may not be part of the shared universe, this movie is really great and the tone is very dark and even better when combined with the plot which is very well written and executed. It is even darker than 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and The Dark Knight Trilogy.What I love about the movie are the character developement and ambiguous nature. For the former, I love how Arthur Fleck's journey began from a nobody who is ignored by society until his transformation into an iconic villain being depicted. He worked very hard as working man but after all that hard work, he always ended up getting beaten, betrayed and even being mock by other people. All these bad things happened to him had led him to become a villain. All it takes to change a person was a ""one bad day"".For the latter, Todd Phillips managed to make the movie into an open ended and more than one interpretation. This is true to the source material because Joker does not really have an origin story in the comic book. In the comic book itself, Joker prefer his origin story to be a multiple choice. This multiple choice was used in the movie which really made you think whether which parts of his origin are true and what other parts are false. It is really up to audiences' interpretation. That is what made the movie plot really great.Joaquin Phoenix is really amazing in his performance as Joker. He put up a lot of effort in this role and he successfully nailed it. His dances in some scenes and his Joker laugh are very impressive. In addition, his version of Joker is right on par with the late Heath Ledger, who portrayed Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight. His acting skills is definitely an Oscars worthy be nominate as Best Actor and might even have the chance to win that award.This movie is truly a masterpiece for a low budget superhero (or supervillain in this case) movie. I would definitely recommend to watch this movie to everyone and not just comic book fans.",1
2346,Reversing story and very good story made by Todd Phillips.Must be rated 10 out of 10,1
2347,"Наконец-то мы дождались фильма вселенной DC, каким он и должен быть, не аттракциона вроде Мстителей и иных кинокартин студии Марвел, а мрачного и гнетущего психологического детектива.

Это не сцены из реальной жизни?""Музыкальное сопровождение отлично подчеркивает моменты фильма усиливая впечатления и эффект.Сюжет не банален, несмотря на повседневные темы, но самый смак этой картины в том, что весь фильм, кроме финальной сцены это вымысел главного персонажа.",1

2360,"Joker is an absolute masterpiece. Despite a history of various actors completely nailing the role director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix bring to life an extremely original take on this much beloved character. Arthur Fleck is a mentally ill professional clown with dreams of becoming a stand up comedian. But after a series of traumatic/hurtful experiences Arthur slowly begins to crack as he is edged closer and closer to insanity. Many critics including Peter Bradshaw (the guardian) have criticized joker for its ambiguous handling of morals and encouraging of violent behavior, however I can confirm that this is not the case. Although our protagonist is an extremely troubled man and his actions are far from virtuous, we don’t sympathise with Arthur because of his attributes as a person, but because of how badly he is treated by others. Todd Phillips does an excellent job of shining a light on real world problems, whether it be wealthy capitalists who don’t hold any concern for the poor or stage show hosts who practically make profit from ridiculing others. Although some of it may be a bit far fetched it is purposefully done this way in order to prevent the film from feeling too political. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding In every aspect, and his performance is definitely Oscar worthy. The supporting cast as well, although not as heavily focused on, certainly never falter. Another feature that separates Joker from most films of its genre is steering clear of the trends of blockbuster action. When there is the occasional moment of violence it feels dark, gritty and shocking to say the least. Another problem that critics claim exists is that the film draws heavy inspiration from other movies such as the atmosphere in taxi driver or the riots from V for vendetta but once again I disagree, because the film does enough to feel different from all of them. There is so much more I could say to praise this film, but in order to not drag I’ll just leave out some of the less important details.",1
2361,"Just a movie, in my personal opinion, great music and acting, although the movie is not easy!",1
2362,"Really Brilliant and intense.. great acting, atmosphere and a thrilling joy ride which was over way too quickly in my liking... Really have no idea what movie the critics watched.",1
2363,Wow 10/10 Amazing...............................................................................,1
2364,"As usual the ""professional"" critics get it utterly wrong. I have no idea why anyone takes them seriously at this point. The movie is an entertaining introduction to one man's downward spiral into violent madness. It's a tragic tale of despair and the misery of a life without hope. I'm not surprised the media hate this movie so much, it has a reason to exist, and doesn't outwardly crap on regular people.",1
2365,"Отличный фильм просто бомба 12/10, лучше фильм за последнее время а то всё говно",1
2366,"A beautiful movie, it's amazing. The method in which the plot immerses you in the Arthur Fleck's life is unbelievable. This movie transforms each of us in joker.",1
2367,"The Joker was a very good movie, I won't say it's the best movie I have seen this year, but it was a good movie. There are probably some deserved criticism and praise, although I disagree with the people hailing this as a masterpiece and the people trashing it.",1
2368,"The film was impressive, and now I understand why it has 16+ mark. The film shows how the community hurts  its members turning them into monsters. That was also the best actor to play Joker I have ever seen, so I wold recommend it to anyone.P.S. That was an absolutely different Joker from the previous onces, and for sure different from Marvels' ""Evilmen""",1
2369,One of the best movie ever in the history of world cinema. Best Comic Book movie.,1
2370,"Throughout the film I had shivers all over my body, respect to the director who managed to use music such as Picasso's art .....",1
2371,"Very good movie, great acting, and a great script. It had very good twists throughout the movie. This is definitely a great way to tell the story of the Joker.",1
2372,"Good,with the actor and the historyThe new way to tell about joker is awesome",1
2373,"This movie is a thrilling experience. The Joker character alone is a legend of a villain with his twisted, cold mind and legacy. And the movie really convinces you he's the good guy before he breaks and goes deeper on madness. As the good guy, you expect the moment he overcomes everything, but the movie will hit you with its shocking moments to remind you that this is not the case, that Joker is a villain, but not over nothing.When you watch Pirates of the Caribbean, you see captain Jack Sparrow rather than Johnny Depp. When you watch this movie, you see the Joker, as it's impossible to see Joaquin Phoenix, because it was an outstanding performance.It easily is the most remarkable movie of the year, and will (probably) make you feel bad at the end of it. Put it simple, it's a masterpiece, a fine work of art.",1
2374,"One of the best movies of the decade. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. Truly intense, beautiful & uncomfortable.",1
2375,Joker always said if he wanted a backstory it will be multiple choice. Joaquin Phoenix brings a amazing adaptation of the classic character and Todd Phillips brings a fantastic idea for the character as he blinds the lines between reality and fantasy leaving the audience to decide what is the story. A must see movie of the year and should be thoroughly studied in universities,1
2376,"Hint❗If you are not a true batman, Joker fan you may not like it, there is sort of connection for what's on it with your whole concept of batman, joker stories whether on cartoons or films. and if you'll  enter it, put on you mind it's a total bibliography movie there is not an action feeling on it as I felt something people were dissapointed by such kind of fact Review",1
2377,"Gran película; la actuación y el guión, la construcción del personaje es soberbia y en manejo de los colores y de la luz. Un descenso a la locura más que fenomenal. La película se sostiene por si misma y no necesita a Batman para explicarse.",1
2378,"One of the better movies I've seen in years. Joker provides a tragic tale of the beloved DC villain in a way that leaves audiences captivated to the very end. With Joaquin Phoenix's polished portrayal of the titular character and Todd Phillips' skilful direction, this is definitely a movie event not to be missed this year.",1
2379,"Фильм отличный, он не для всех, и быдло любящее Marvel и сидящие в редакциях СМИ недостойна этого фильма, и его глубокого смысла. Великолепная картина, обязательная к просмотру ценителям хорошего кино.",1
2380,"We are going to watch it for a second time! I'm not a big movie person, but am so glad I have seen tgis masterpiece. We love it!",1
2381,NICEEEE movie hnivf kwkkdocowlq kdllflcodwo kwkwkfkvldllw owpqpcp pp kdkdkcl,1
2382,"This movie is a masterpiece, acting, script, setting, best movie I have seen in years.",1
2383,You wouldn’t get it.hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahaha,1
2384,"Joker is amazing! I just couldn't believe when i saw the meta score of this movie, cause looks like those people who scored negative notes to this movie didn't see the same masterpiece as me and, as i can see here, most of people. It's time for the critizers reevaluate theis concepts about art and cinema.",1
2385,Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great!,1
2386,A Spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix!..He should win the Academy award for Best actor!..A MUST see movie !!.,1
2387,"Nothing like you've even seen before, deep and dark character study pulled off with amazing direction and acting",1
2388,So gooöooooooöoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nicht schlimm vielleicht auch manchmal lustig dass sie komplett d,1
2389,This movie is an instant classic our kids and grandkids are gonna be watching this for generations to come. The atmosphere of the movie is great Todd made sure that this felt like Gotham and not like NY with the amount of detail he put into it and the acting is awesome Joaquin out did himself as the joker it’s like he was born to play the role,1
2390,"Forget what part of the media says, just go watch this masterpiece. Todd Phillips did a GREAT job here, and Phoenix delivers one of the greatest performances of the year, hands down. The filmography is top notch, the pacing is great, and yeah, you can expect a handful of masterful and powerful moments. To all the critics that cheered to this movie to fail, a HUGE MIDDLE FINGER. Just go watch it.",1
2391,"Joker is amazing movie. Good story great picture with beautiful colors, great music and unique performance from Joaquin Phoenix.",1
2392,"joker is nothing like any comics related movie- its amazing, stressful and intense! joaquin phoenix gives an austonishing performance! and the close ups... and the music... woww!!!",1
2393,"Holy hell. This movie is fantastic. Easily my movie of the year. I honestly don't understand the critics bashing this film just because of it's depiction of violence considering everybody loved Taxi Driver, and I would argue that that movie is more violent. It is a perfect depiction of how a mentally ill man can fall into society and become completely psychotic to the point of murder. There isn't a lot I could say that hasn't already been said. It's really good.",1
2394,Did not expect it to be this good. The main actor naild it. I like this Joker better thank all others.,1
2395,"Superb characterization, emotionally engaging storytelling, awesome scenes. Everything here is pure visual/artistic poetry. The most ambitious, serious, profound and realistic approach to a comic character ever made and probably the best superhero movie of all times. Masterpiece.",1
2396,"Es una pelicula muy viceral, que sorprende en muchos aspectos y te mantiene atento hasta el final",1
2397,Joaquin Phoenix gives the most incredible performance.  This movie is so we'll made on every level. The story telling is powerful and so relevant to current social crises.  Think what it's like to be someone other than yourself.   The character is the most compelling and complex I can remember ever having seen in a film.  Phoenix is possibly the greatest actor ever.,1
2398,By far one of the best movies I've seen in the recent past. Actor performance is really great. But I'd love to see the real transition of how Joker becomes the real Joker. The plot is sometimes a little bit predictable and on the other hand leads to unlogical conclusions. 9/10,1
2399,"muy buena actuación por parte de Joaquin Phoenix, la he visto mas de una vez pero creo que exageran al catalogarla una ""obra maestra"", aun así, seas seguidor de los comics o no, el Joker es una película que recomiendo a cualquiera.",1
2400,This movie makes me glad I disregard critics opinions.  This movie is tremendous!,1
2401,"Well, that was dark...  I do have some trouble with specific dark content as it usually strays away from the artistic wonder that it needs to serve a purpose.  When I walked in to see this film, I had butterflies in my tum-tum as I didn't know how the dark subject matter could be handled.  Then I saw this experience.  I love this film for the same reason that I love A Clockwork Orange.  **** up content that is handled with dignity.  Making the audience empathise with Arthur until he lashes out.  It's a perfect balance.  The score is masterful, Joaquin Phoenix's performance actually makes me jealous on how good it is.  I do say that it does have some issues such as Bruce Wayne being involved for fan service.  (However, I do like how they recreated Batman's origin). There really wasn't any importance with him and the illusions do seem a bit of an excuse for some flaws such as Joker shooting Murray because, ""why does that camera keep broadcasting this""? or ""How come Murray didn't expect Joker to game-end him with a gun""?  But, in the end, I don't care.  A very good film that is worth your time.",1
2402,"Absolutely incredible movie, Joaquin Phoenix gave an outstanding performance as the Joker. This is, in my opinion, the best movie of 2019.",1
2403,"What impressed me about this movie is that it did something that no other comic book based movie has been able to do and that is tell a great story. It took a character that we all have seen in movies and comics and actually gave him life by making him, though in a dark And sadistic way, relatable.",1
2404,"IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE DARK, THEN DON'T WORRY AFTER WATCHING THIS, ALL YOUR WORRIES WILL BE GONE AND YOU WILL REALLY LOVE THE DArk",1
2405,Excelente filme me fez ter um olhar diferente sobre o vilão e a real motivação da revolta dele com os waynes,1
2406,"El cine de superheroes por lo general me suele gustar poco y no lo consumo mucho más allá de algunas excepciones... Y puedo decir que esta es una de ellas, realmente disfrute de la película, muy buenas elecciones en la música y visualmente hermosa. El personaje y la situación por la que pasa genera mucha empatia e incomodidad. Si bien estuvo genial verla en el cine, no puedo esperar a verla más detenidamente en mi casa.",1
2407,"The film tells the Joker with a different plot and perspective, but still can provide good progress and character development, making the audience better understand why Arthur Fleck eventually become a ""Joker"". Althought this Joker did not go ""crazy"" in the conventional way as we know it in his comic book the Joker film succeded in giving another reason why the madness could occur since the film began throught a story that we can relate more the everyday life. -jagatreview",1
2408,"This was worth seeing~ mind you this isn't your run of the mill kick your ass, guns blazing and lethal social experiment Joker involved film. This was a dramatic origins story of our favorite sick and psychotic villain The Joker.This was very relatable and you start to gain a better understanding of how the Joker came to be. Highly recommend you watch this flick.",1
2409,"The Joker is great in almost everything - the acting, the colors, the visuals, the dialogue, the makeup - but like the main character, it's completely empty inside. Like Arthur, who sits in a dark room and fantasises about a better life, Phillips's Joker wants so badly to be something more than a superhero (or supervillain?) movie.It tries to be a critique to modern society, but fails at being realistic.It tries to be an elegy to nihilism, but its protagonist is more of a common criminal than an Übermensch.It tries to be complex, but its black and white perspective makes it something you would expect in fanfiction. There is nothing new in Arthur's descent into madness and more importantly there is no real conflict. The viewer knows from the start what will happen, he knows that Arthur is supposed to be the victim who finally snaps and gets revenge on the real bad guys (namely everyone else). This movie feels like a ""gut punch"" to some people because of its emotional intensity - but is this feeling genuine? Or is there something more to it? The writers tried to make Arthur Fleck as real as possible, to make him a tragic character, but in the end it looks like they googled ""Buttmonkey"" and built him around that concept.",1
2410,"A masterpiece.Joaquin's performance in this movie is something that haven't seen on the big screen in a very long time, while the soundtrack behind , empowers the scenes and gets you to the exact point where you can live the story through Joker's eyes.And maybe that's the reason the reviewers were so afraid of complimenting this movie , because they were afraid of representing something that goes against everything they believe in .",1
2411,"This movie is actually really good, but is ruined by woke people saying its bad so... you know its good.",1
2412,It had its brilliant moments. But overall was kinda underwhelming. Still worth watching in a movie theater experience type atmosphere.,1
2413,"A true masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix is ​​brilliant, Todd Philips makes a precise and majestic direction, photography is spectacular. A comic book movie really for fans as well as true cinema fans",1
2414,"fantastic, great movie with an extraordinary Joaquin Phoenix. For me, this film should have the price of the best film, the best photography, the best actor.",1
2415,The movie is very good. It is very impactful. It leaves many interesting questions in the air for the viewer to interpret.,1
2416,"Pretty amazing. When it’s trying to be a brutal, original, and unflinching look at the realistic origins of the greatest comic book villain of all time, it’s badASS. It stumbles a bit when it tries to be a serious commentary on our society; it gets a little heavy handed and unrealistic, almost a little silly. But almost everything else is immaculately crafted. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely Oscar-worthy, it is GORGEOUS to look at, the writing is good, everyone involved is in peak form here. Well done.",1
2417,"Absolutely stunning! The cinematography and acting is amazing, especially Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. Don't listen to the big critics, watch the movie!",1
2418,"I feel truly sad that this absolutely amazing movie has been brought down by the fake outrage politics directed at it. Do not let the critic politically-influenced garbage reviews influence you or your opinion of this film. There is not a single aspect of this movie that is not perfect or near-perfect. Simply put, this may easily be one of the greatest movies ever to exist and is certainly one the best I have ever seen to date.",1
2419,"Perfection, acting, storyline, everything basically amazed me.Phoneix did an excellent job",1
2420,"La mejor pelicula que he visto en mucho tiempo, la ame de principio a fin. Joaquin es un increible actor y en esta pelicula simplemenre se lucio. Una obra maestra!!!",1
2421,I generally agree with Metacritic's movie score over Rotten Tomatoes but not this time. Forget the paid critics biased views of Joker and go and see one of the best movies of this century and maybe the last.,1
2422,"It is slow for 90min, but just accept the fact that this isn't a film made on the green screen (aka a Marvel cartoon).  Phoenix is great in everything he does(See ""The Master"") and is always worth the price of admission.  Support this film.",1
2423,"Joker is a amazing movie because of two main aspects. Joaquim Phoenix acting and that damn photography that is so good its basically cheating. All of the mental issues the film shows are very compeling and you get out reminded of how the world can be cruel to those that don't ""fit"" in this crazy and paranoid society that we live in.Also for me it was kinda of a expirience to see the parts where the audience was laughing and I was just ""ooook...."". Anyway its a must see for sure.",1
2424,A movie that makes you satisfyingly uncomfortable. Joachim Pheonix totally nailed it in his role.,1
2425,"This is a masterpiece, and the Oscar goes to.......Joaquin Phoenix!!!!They don’t need to listen to critics, they are afraid of everything, for them cruelty in films about zombies is normal and they give high marks and cruelty in a film about our life in which desperate people do bad things, it’s bad for them, although if attention was paid to such people, and similar problems did not arise, but everyone doesn’t give a damn, good cinema is a reflection of our society, we don’t have to keep silent about the problems of society, we should talk about problems and then there will be no victims !!!",1
2426,"Joker is the best comics movie ever made. Not all-action blockbuster finally. It shows you can make comics movies in different genres. The movie shows you how modern society creates so-called ""evils"" and that the real evil is selfish. rude and cruel people that surrounds us everywhere (in the streets, in public transport, in office etc.).Joaquin Phoenix is genius, he earned his Oscar by this role.",1
2427,"A must watch, it's a movie that encompass a lot of themes is a thesis of phycology and análisis of joker as a character, it's a comic based movie, it could be an art film if you want or a blockbuster film, the script its a bit messy but it seems like it was intensional to create a debate among the viewers, the direction, photography and score makes you feeel Sadness and when the times come make you fell the insane of the character and the Catharsis of the character in becoming the joker.",1
2428,"I can't stand all these superhero movies. So this one is a welcomed change for me and I like this one a lot. The best movie I saw for a long time, worth every penny of the $18 admission.",1
2429,"brillante, hermosa, única, de las únicas películas que me he visto 2 veces en un cine, no hay palabras para describirla",1
2430,love this movie realy do just watch it now realy enjoy it alot  hope make sequel  next,1
2431,"Brilliant performance from Joaquin Phoenix, Great new angle and take on the character. Overall a fantastic watch.",1
2432,"Would've been perfect if this film didnt throw us about Joker's mental health illness in our faces in the first half of the film, but the rest is perfect. Make a sequel please",1
2433,"Belas atuações, mas o enredo e direção do filme deixa a desejar. Filme monótomo demais.",1
2434,"Joker is for the most part a psychology movie. This is still an origin movie but with focus on Arthur descent into insanity. And in a sens, his fate seems linked to the city itself. There is no fx here. The action is minimal and there are some violent moments. The performance of Phoenix is amazing (Oscar's worthy). And it has a good cast around him. The music is interesting and sound like some parts of The Dark Knight. Some areas of the movie are a bit slow. I personally didn't like the constant smoking. I give it 75%. Really good acting and interesting story.",1
2435,"The new Joker movie is yet another visceral and cerebral retelling of the iconic Joker character. Albeit the thematic of this iteration is more of a macabre ""Rite of Passage."" I absolutely adore it:The Good: Stellar acting. Themes of gray and grey morality. Gratuitous violence. The Cinematography and disturbing realism.The Bad: A rather peculiar lack of consequences for his actions. While it is expected, coming from a villain's P.O.V., it inevitably loses a bit of hardcore grit that could have put it a slight tier above Heath Ledger's Joker, whose dark and brutal portrayal is immortal.The Ugly: This is a good kind of ugly, but the haunting irony, the touch on several topical themes that ail our society and the wonderful musical thematics that accompanies the movie creates a haunting experience and I was wowed beyond belief in an era where I have massive brightness-induced-apathy with overenfranchised Marvel and DC comics movies with pointless, unnecessary remakes. I swear if another Avengers movie comes out, I'm boycotting superhero movies for another ten years. More of this visceral, cerebral content that actually bothers to stimulate your mind please!9/10",1
2436,"From start to finish this movie really set the scene of Arthur Fleck slowly descending into madness. The soundtrack, wardrobe and casting were perfect and this movie is the best movie I have seen this year. A shame that Phoenix has been bombarded with gun glorifying messages even after his brilliant acting, I can see critics are voting this movie down purely to coincide with media's outroar on gun violence. Overall 10/10 would recommend to everyone to watch.",1
2437,"I had high expectations for this movie and man did it exceeded. Phoenix surprised me as the Joker and I rooted for him the whole way through.The music, the characters, the brilliant simple story was a experience that I'll never forget. SPOILER ALERTThe gory kills are soo realistic that thought one of them was real.",1
2438,"Absolutely Amazing movie! Psychological, atmospheric, shocking, amazing acting from Joaquin Phoenix(should be an oscar), good origin story, reat cinematography, good pacing. Grim, dark movie which rightly reflects the state of Gotham city. Some parts are kinda hard to watch and the movie makes you feel all kinds of things. I just thought the scenes with BW were unnecessary and didnt need to be there at all.Still the best movie in many years.",1
2439,"I used to think Todd Phillips can only make comedies, but now I realise he can also make bloody great tragedies!Just as provocative, sick and disturbing as I'd hoped it to be. What really exceeded my expectations is Pheonix's terrifyingly unhinged performance that's definitely worthy of an Oscar. (8.5/10)",1
2440,I was straight-up rooting for Arthur to kill everyone. Buy this movie on Blu-Ray for Christmas to give the middle finger to the little commissars who panned it.,1
2441,An extremely emotional film. Absolutely amazing. It will shock you. I can't stop thinking about it while I listen to its soundtrack. Don't trust people who say this is not a good movie: they just don't know **** about life.,1
2442,"It was ok but I'm giving it a extra point because of the media crying like a bunch of doofuses over this going to cause a Incel uprising (which is really funny). Any ways The movie was just ok. It was well Directed and the acting was good, Story was alright. My problems with it are going in I just thought Phoenix was Miscast as the Joker and after seeing it, well it just confirms I was right. I can admit when I'm wrong cause I thought the same thing with Downey as Ironman and Heath ledger as the Joker but completely changing my mind after I saw the movie. Phoenix is just to old to play the Joker, He looks 50 on top of that his voice just doesn't carry any weight of insanity nor do I buy him as the Joker. Now I do think Phoenix is a good actor and I think he was trying his best to do it but he just doesn't pull it off for me. I also hated the make up job for the Joker. It just didn't look right. He looked like a normal clown instead of a Insane one.The Script is pretty good I like its Darker tone. I'm getting bored of these copy paste comic book movies. I want some thing Darker and edgier and this does deliver on that. It does take awhile for it to get going but we do get to see the Jokers slow decent into madness, which is done pretty good. If they could have just found the right actor for the Joker this could have been a 8 or maybe even a 9 from me. Who should have played the Joker? I dont know I really dont follow who the young actors are out there so I dont know who should have been cast for the part but he should have been younger like mid to late 20s considering Batman is only like 11 or 12 in this. I kept thinking when they meet for the first time the Joker is gonna be pushin 70.",1
2443,"Masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece",1
2444,"Unbelievable movie, stunning performances and a slow thrilling story which builds up to an excellent ending which leaves many questions but in a very good way. Joaquin Phoenix  deserves every accolade possible for this performance",1
2445,I love it! Wasn't in the lot of story little crazy but love the ending and knowing what happened to batman parents and who made it!  Really shocked me but i like what the did with the movie,1
2446,"A suffocating journey into a man's life disintegrating before his eyes. Loneliness, shame, indifference. All of these just pound into the lead character Arthur until it gloriously explodes and everybody in Gotham feels it. It's a very sad film that touches on feelings I think every young man has had a few times in their lives. Not surprised about the disconnect between the ""media"" and real user reviews.",1
2447,"Es una pelicula demasiado grandiosa, el hecho de combinar la realidad y relacionarlo con un personaje de un comic haciendolo ver de una manera surrealista que podria suceder en la actualidad y de hecho le da el toque de enves de  comvertirlo en una simple pelicula puede ser una historia completamente real, de hecho los casos de asesinos con problemas psicologicos son relativamente parecidos. En mi opinion, puede ser visto de muchas maneras, como a la par verlo como un llamado a la sociedad el cual el mensaje sea la tolerancia y el respeto por los demas, el ponerse en los zapatos de la otra persona y comprender que no todos tenemos la misma vida con ventajas o desventajas, como a la vez un simbolo de revelion para otros ya que tambien vivimos en una sociedad donde la moral esta por los suelos cuando uno asiende hacia el poder y es el pueblo mismo quien debe sufrir esa falta de etica por parte del gobierno. Simplemente tiene muchos mensajes sobre la realidad que vivimos hoy en dia y como ya se establecio antes, esto es a manera de entretenimiento solo es una pelicula para ver y reir o llorar un rato de la realidad en la se convirtio el mundo. Quiza la idea principal de la pelicula sea arreglar todo el mundo que hemos creado, no a traves de asesinatos, disputas y problemas. Sino a la traves de la union, del saber que esta bien y que esta mal como Ghandi lo dijo una vez ""No hay que apagar la luz de otro para lograr que brille la nuestra"".",1
2448,"What a performance by joaquin phoenix and what a movie by todd phillips. I could feel myself beside joker in every scenes and thats what i want from a movie like this.We had some ""scorcese kind"" scenes in it too and that was perfect either.I can't talk more... just wanna say congrats to everyone who did their best to make this masterpiece!",1
2449,"The best movie of the year with a spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix, masterful direction by Todd PhilipsA true masterpiece",1
2450,"Look at the critics total score then look at the users score, and you will understand how EPIC this movie is.",1
2451,"This movie is not a superhero cinema, it is a brilliant character study, psychological drama, tragedy and thriller. Something we did not expect but got.Performance of Phoenix, if it wasn’t movie, would convince psychiatrists to his problems. Calling it acting it’s an insult, it’s something more.",1
2452,"Such an interesting movie ,for me.Ok, it's aslow but i realy like this movie.",1
2453,"Great movie, for me this is what cinecomics should be.The marvel studios have still MUCH to learn.I look forward to waiting for his retinue.",1
2454,"Um ""dedo na ferida"" na sociedade contemporânea, um filme que leva o tema de quadrinhos, e super heróis, a um outro nível. Enquanto isso, o Joaquim Phoenix encontra o seu auge de atuação. Até este o momento é o meu filme favorito de 2019.",1
2455,This movie was beautiful and frightening at the same time. His acting is Oscar worthy and will give you chills until the end. The ending was well put together and I promise anyone who will see this film will never forgot the scene the last 15 minutes.,1
2456,"This is a must see movie, you will regret it if you do not see it in the cinema.",1
2457,"As a kid I loved superhero comics, as it happens, my parents owned a collected volume of (pre-super) Batman comics. Good stories, if a bit corny in spots. The Joker was one of the most recurring villains in them. Yet it wasn't until Batman TAS that Mark Hamill's performance as a voice-actor really brought the Joker to life. For most of my life I felt that the Joker was a perfect if cartoony villain. Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger did amazingly well in the live-action portrayals, but Hamill still did it best. So... my brother and I have been trying to spend a bit more time together as we do not have a lot of family left. We have gone to see a few movies and we both enjoyed comics as kids, so Joker (which I'd heard good things about) was a natural choice. And we were both blown away. This review is just my personal opinion mind and I will strive to keep away from spoilers.Primarily, Joker is not a super-hero story. It is a psychological drama set against a fictional city, containing characters with recognisable names all from a comicbook franchise. But it is not a fantasy-filled spandex-fest. Todd Phillips has made this movie in quite a different way than I had imagined possible. It is a story about one unhappy, mentally and emotionally scarred man trying to live in a city that has severe issues. Over the course of the movie, in which these worsen and throughout which Phillips makes the viewer wonder what is real, we follow Arthur Fleck's descent if not into madness than to and beyond the breaking point. The climax of the movie perfectly encapsulates this: if you keep pushing someone, then you will get what you deserve.It is a phenomenal artwork, this movie. And Joaquin Phoenix has played his role as Arthur perfectly. Scratch Letho, that was a cartoon character done badly. Phoenix on the other hand has portrayed a human being. A broken man in a **** of a city living in utter misery... You get why what happens, happens. I cannot praise Phoenix enough here as he has made the Joker an actual human being. Something that only occurred in rare flashes throughout the comics, say at the end of The Killing Joke. As a viewer of the movie, you will be touched by this. Hopefully, it will inspire you, or at the least promote empathy.The rest of the cast also manages to come across as genuine. The lone mother, the social worker, the asshat office workers... They can be found on Earth as well.To address the critic reviewbombs: Not all movies are intended to be sugarcoated stories for mentally challenged babies. Functional violence, deep themes and complex issues in a morally grey story have their place in movies. Heck, any form of fiction. Joker deserves all the awards it can get and then some. It is clear why this movie does better than the parodious Batwoman.",1
2458,"Beautiful. Bitter. Acidic. Dark. But True.Beneath the colourful madness it tells you all the eternal truth about the Homō hominī lupus, the selfishness of human kind, otherwise ""Mors tua vita mea"" the evil driving force behind the humanity mask. It also explores the horrible dimension of mental illness and the destructive forece of wrong parenthood.",1
2459,"Amazed first time in many many years, that something so glorious was created in Hollywood. Loved every chilling second of the movie. Such an incredible performance and character development. So much depth.",1
2460,"**** unbelieveable performances, visiual telling, drama and musics. J. Phoenix is the best Joker.",1
2461,"It’s not that Joker which I’m used to see in the DC universe, but I’m really like it.",1
2462,A must watch. It clearly lives unto the tag of best film of the year that the critics called it. Simply brilliant.,1
2463,"Holy **** **** go see this movie. Ive never been so captivated by any piece of fiction in my life. When my dad asked me what i thouht anout it i was just truly speechless. This isnt a movie, its an experience. Im never going to see it again, solemly because of how captivating his truly misserable story is. This isnt even on the same planet as endgame and how this got 59 is just incomprehensible",1
2464,"I'm a big film enthuist but never written a review and never intended on doing so until I seen the pitful score from 'critics'This film is from the start to the final scene clever. It isn't a popcorn film you would take your other half to see, it isn't like your marvel action feast that you will be used to of late. No this is a film of the gradual downward spiral of one man, commonly known today as the joker. Joaquin's performance was 100% dedication, forsaking all past iterations and giving a performance to be respected on its own",1
2465,"The most profitable 'comic book movie' of all time is essentially a film that was destined to be a throwback to its 'main story line'. Yet the commitment of its production team and its cast created something else entirely, and it resonates with so many people.  Is it a completely 'original work'? No, as the slow yet sure descent to madness 'psychological thriller' was a staple in the 70's.  Taxi Driver...A Dog Day's Afternoon...Joker paid a handsome homage to these flicks. Kudos also to Phoenix's incredibly committed performance as Arthur Fleck aka the Joker.  It is an incredible feat that will probably land him an Oscar Nomination, and a highly probable win. Yet again, why just an '8'? Simply because I have seen this film 'before' and it is simply a repackaging of these beloved 1970's flick (many are directed by the comic book genre's biggest 'critic' Marty Scorcesse).  Yet, it is a great film that is to some extent,that  lives up to all its hype.",1
2466,"This movie is stunning, sometimes its grabbing you by your throat. I'm surprised by the critic reviews, probably the critics can't handle this movie, or has another expectations, one thing: THIS IS NOT A BIG ACTION BATMAN MOVIE! This movie is about being rejected, getting depressed and eventually going lunatic!",1
2467,This movie is a masterpiece. Absolutely amazing. It is by far the best comic book based movie ever. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an oscar.,1
2468,"Stunning, movie, reminds me of when Hollywood made good movies, not like the trash they churn out these days, more like this please",1
2469,"Pocas películas toman temas tan serios como la psicología de una manera realista, con un cierre buenísimo y una actuación impecable, una película de 10",1
2470,"Truly the greatest movie of 2019 by far, very excited about the announcement of the sequel",1
2471,"Simplesmente incrível, Joaquin Phoenix mandou muito bem na atuação, adorei o filme.",1
2472,"Seeing how critics gave this movie a bad score and crap like Thor Ragnarok a good one makes me realize I should never, ever take their reviews in consideration. This movie is a M-A-S-T-E-R-P-I-E-C-E! go see it for yourself",1
2473,"Well filmed, well acted, it is nice to see that DC make these big risks with their most beloved franchises. The downpart is the way they try that the audience empathize with the Joker. That shouldn't be necessary and goes too far away from the character s essence.",1
2474,Great movie! Tied into joker and batman. Joaquin Pheonix is amazing as joker,1
2475,"Finally the best movie of a decade. All superhero movies for children and fools but joker 2019 great movie, really strong.",1
2476,"I cant believe the metacritic score on Joker. I had to watch it again inmediatly after the first time because it is that good. Portraits a mentally ill, cast out Arthur who just doesnt understand the lack of emphaty on this world.",1
2477,"This movie reveal and tells the truths that the media and critics desperately want to cover. This movie has its all checkbox tick. Audio,cinematography, acting, script and etc. Go watch the movie first and dont listen to the hypocrite critics.",1
2478,One of the greatest movies i ever saw. Joaquin Phoenix really deserves an Oscar for this performance.,1
2479,"This is a phenomenal movie about one of the most iconic villains of all time. Excellent music, grim atmosphere and a remarkable performance by Joaquin Phoenix.",1
2480,"A good socially critical film that can be related to the class society we live in today. The mental ill-health and exclusion of man is expressed through the Joker in an excellent way. Fantastic acting, lovely lighting that gives a true-to-life atmosphere. I think many people can relate to the essence of what the movie is about. Social injustice, exclusion and the capitalist hierarchy.Love it!",1
2481,"Holy, f’n, sh*t.Those were the words that were running through my mind while watching Joker. I can’t believe this movie exists. That it somehow got greenlit by Warner Bros, in a time where Disney/Marvel reign supreme with their theme-park formula. It wasn’t that long ago that Warner’s meddled with Zack Snyder’s Justice League because it was too dark. What Todd Phillips does with Joker is infinitely darker than anything Zack Snyder did with DC. That alone is a minor miracle. Add to that fact that Joaquin Phoenix, a true A-grader in the world of acting, was convinced to take on the role, in a property that he does not find traditionally attractive, and we have a movie that shouldn’t exist.But we do, and thank the film gods for that!Joaquin Phoenix owns the part, chews up every scene, and brings his A-game to the movie. He is magnetic in the role; you can’t take your eyes off him. Watching him transform from Arthur Fleck into The Joker is a thing of dark, somber beauty. There is a line in the movie that says “I use to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it’s a comedy.” make no mistake, watching a mentally ill person that is shunned by a society which lacks empathy, slowly deteriorate into a homicidal maniac, is a tragedy. This movie hits hard and doesn’t hold back with its message.The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is brilliant. She manages to capture the mood of the setting and Arthur’s mindset so well. I can’t imagine the movie without this score. The cinematography is great. The colours, the lighting, the close-ups of Joaquin, and in particular, a shot of Joker standing on top of a cop car embracing the chaos he inspired, it’s a thing of beauty. I also liked the addition of a couple of songs from the era it’s set in. Props must be given to the supporting cast, even though they didn’t have too much to do because of the movie’s strong focus on Arthur, but did great with what they had, in particular, Robert Deniro.And lastly, the biggest surprise from this movie, is the director, Todd Phillips. When I first heard the news of a Martin Scorsese produced Joker origin movie, the hype within started. Then Joaquin Phoenix got attached to the leading role; the hype picked up the pace. And then Todd Phillips, the director of The Hangover Trilogy attached to direct, the breaks on the hype train were pulled or at least slowed down. I kept the faith that’d be good because if the project had Scorsese and Phoenix interested in it, then it had to be good, so I backed their judgment and subsequently backed Phillips, and I must say, they got it right. I hope to see more serious movies from Todd Phillips; the guy can pull them off.If you want to see a tour-de-force performance from one of the world’s best actors and a hard-hitting movie that doesn’t hold back its punches and doesn’t apologize for them, if you want to be left speechless by the end, then you have to see this movie. It is one of the best films of 2019, and the hype of its brilliance couldn’t be any more correct. The movie is not about an incel who couldn’t get laid, so he goes loco, like some of the media are portraying it to be. This movie is a warning about society’s inability to deal with its unfortunate inhabitants in an empathic way. It’s funny how the media lays into these “incels” as some of the characters lay into Arthur in the movie. Life imitating art, I guess.",1
2482,"saw it twice, giving it a 10. god bless men. this was a movie that will drive feminists despise since the joker was not a female character.",1
2483,Incredible piece of art.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,1
2484,"For me, as a person with mental illnesses, the film very truthfully shows how we feel, especially when stigmatized by society, we lose norma treatment and social security (I do not know how in other countries, but in Russia this is enough). I really hope that this film will make people treat us with understanding and help us overcome the disease. Even if you do not look at the film from this point of view, it is still wonderful!",1
2485,"The film didn’t seem particularly cool to me, it is very overrated, in principle, you can watch it. A good game of the Phoenix, the plot will come off, filmed and mounted is also good. The film conveys the gloomy atmosphere well. This film shows the current society well. The Joker is a film that suggests thinking.",1
2486,Zaebis film po kayfu ezhi marvel dlya pidorasov Vavavqvqvqvavavavaavvaavava,1
2487,"Joker may not fit in that well with the DC universe, but what you get out of watching it is so much more. It's a character study of a lonely, mentally ill man slowly descending into madness inside a world where only the rich matter, and those in need never have a voice. The end result is one of the most powerful, disturbingly relevant thrillers of all time.",1
2488,The movie itself was good but I didn't find it as great as many say like being one of the greatest movies this year. It was good but the story seemed a bit predictable and for me also missing some action. Good movie though,1
2489,"It is interesting how the film works in the moment of comedy and sadness. I spent a week thinking about this film, about the character's madness and how the situations brought him to that moment. Very sad, but I loved it. I don't know if I would see him again.",1
2490,"This was interesting: The professional critics are bad, but the user critics here are very good. I dont trust the imdb Score, but it has a high score there. So I was curious who will win.The movie is great, has a lot of suspense, mostly because of the brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The development of Joker is very comprehensible and you suffer with him and with his situation from early on. Some scenes were very hard and hit severely and this movie still touches me even after seeing it. It is also interesting, that we have a similar political situation in the western countries like in this movie.I only didnt like the ending, it was very sudden and I wanted to see more.",1
2491,Joker a poor unfortunate soul who I felt a heart for because I work with sick patients.  I want to say you guys portrayed a extraordinary man with soul that was hurt from the beginning he was born. The awesome movie star Joaquin Rafael Phoenix cant do a better job to make this movie,1
2492,A very interesting movie. The Joker is one of the most coolest characters ever.,1
2493,I was waiting for a joker that i used to imagining expected from comic books but phillips suprised me and gave me a better one joaquin will make laugh of one who was in my mind his joker is amazing.,1
2494,This is a great film but its also a hard film to watch. Joaquin is so good its criminal the story is hard hitting and makes you think about things you may not want to. Would i watch it again yes but will i buy it on DVD no but that takes noting away from this fantastic film.,1
2495,Best movie that came out 2019. The acting is amazing the story telling is great and not complex which makes it easy and enjoyable to follow.,1
2496,"Well, that's an easy 10 from me. In our age of identical PG13 superheroes movies - ""Joker"" (and ""Logan"") was like a breath of fresh air.Great atmosphere, script and directing. Some shots are so beautiful you just want to put them in a frame. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing Joker, one of his best performances if not THE best.Don't skip this one, we don't get movies that good often.",1
2497,"Incredible,  brilliant, thought- provoking, well-executed and heart wrenching all at the same time.  I hope Joaquin receives the Oscar he has deserved for so long",1
2498,"A joke is only a joke when makes people laugh, but can be a headshot when makes people think. Hope is a happy face on a miserable life.",1
2499,Ladies and gentlemen!!! THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. It is an INCREDIBLE origin story. One of the best movies based on a comic character. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is SPECTACULAR! Thank you Todd Phillips for bringing us this shocking story.,1
2500,"I don't give 10/10 often, but this is one of the rare movies that absolutely deserve it.This isn't an action comic movie, this is a deep dive thriller.This being an original Joker take, allows the creator the freedom that he has and he uses it perfectly.When I saw the trailer at first, I wrote it off as another boring movie, but I have never been so wrong in my life. This is the first time I have watched a movie twice in one day. Absolutely my hats off to the cast and creator! This is an absolute masterpiece, a MUST WATCH!",1
2501,"Negative reports from critics seem to find the film Joker is to depressing to be respected, perhaps because it's comic book origin is seen as lighthearted. In my opinion the Joker character has always been dark, and using that role to form a theme around mental health is a very admirable idea. Joker's story falls right into a must-see premise, and the only drawback is the brief 'comic book' moments it was undoubtedly forced to add. The visuals were captivating, but there were some glossed over plot moments.",1
2502,One of the best origin-story films with an excellent performance by Phoenix.,1
2503,"This is a flawed, yet very, very good film. The main problem I had with it was the lack of realism pertaining to the descent to madness. Particularly, a talk show host making fun of you and flat out bullying you? Or a group of kids randomly jumping you? If you look at a superior film with this subject matter in Taxi Driver, you see a much more realistic and nuanced descent. Not to mention, while I like the homage to that film, at times it feels like a cheap knock off of it.It has lovely shots. And, most importantly, Joaquin Phoenix delivered an absolutely all-time performance that was jaw-dropping from start to finish. In my personal opinion, he should win Best Actor. I just wish the movie around him was a bit more well rounded, even if it was engaging and entertaining.",1
2504,"The Joker has cleverly given us a picture of today through the eyes of the 70’s. Allowing those who are naive to believe the issues raised in the movie are something of the past. The real tone of the movie should move people to act on the current socio and political environment in our so called free world. This movie explains in a clear way, when the wealthy lead people, they no nothing of the hardships felt by those Who have felt the bitter taste of misfortune. This is not a movie for the people that enjoy a hero movie, this movie is for the humans who are on the precipice of action and those that can see the injustice in every day.",1
2505,Awe inspiring. Incredible attention to detail. You notice more of this movie's genius with every subsequent viewing.,1
2506,"Just give this guy and the movie an Oscar.Great story, acting and cinematography! You should go and watch it! And ignore the criticism as the media wants a movie to check theirs own boxes.",1
2507,Impressive acting by Phoeanix a well worthy Oscar performancw if he gets to win the award !,1
2508,"Metacritic is a joke, and this review page shows exactly why it is so. Critics are out of touch and overwhelmingly biased, and are thus quickly losing any credibility they might have had left. Their days are surely numbered.That said, 'Joker' is a masterpiece and should surely be commended - although I am no fan of the man, it is irrefutable that Phoenix did a fantastic job and portrayed the Joker phenomenally. Definitely in my top 3 films of the 2010's.",1
2509,"In my opinion, it is a masterpiece and the best film of the year. This movie also, possibly, gave us Joaquin Phoenix's best performance!",1
2510,"This movie is a modern masterpiece, I've never watched such an interesting movie. Enough said.",1
2511,"Just watched joker,wasn’t sure about it really,but thought it was very good,quite disturbing how he is treated all his life,JP as joker was excellent must be in the running for best actor in a leading role at the oscars,9/10",1
2512,"Why are fanboys so fascinated with despicable people?  Joker, Darth Vader, Hitler, Trump?  I thought ""Joker"" was a very creative story, although I thought it to be too dark, maybe even a little sick.  Joaquin was ok, but every actor who plays the Joker gets rave reviews because the role embodies so much self-expression.  I'm giving it a 7 based on the original story and the creative writing.",1
2513,"Well, I FINALLY got around to seeing the controversial and wildly popular film, Joker: the most profitable comic book movie and the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. Now, I intentionally avoided seeing this movie when it came out. Not because I wasn’t interested in seeing it or because I thought I wouldn’t like it, but because of the hype and the controversy. Seemingly, all the reactions were either “If you like this movie, you’re an incel and a school shooter!” or “If you don’t like this movie, you’re an SJW and a shill!” and I just hate that black-and-white mentality when it comes to movies, or anything really. I find it really obnoxious. I was sick of hearing about it everywhere so I just stayed away. However, months later, the hype has died down, no one has gotten shot or killed because of this movie and it’s finishing its theatrical run. I paid $5 and saw it at the second-run theatre. What did I think of it? I loved it, but this movie is not perfect. I’ll get the negatives out of the way first since there aren’t a lot of them. I thought the writing was way too unsubtle, obvious and on-the-nose. This film is very clear about what it is saying and it hits you on the head with it, almost like they’re dumbing it down for audiences who aren’t used to watching introspective dramas like this and otherwise wouldn’t if it weren’t based on a famous comic book supervillain. It can make you roll your eyes sometimes. There weren’t too many of those moments for me, but your mileage my vary. Also, there really was no point in setting this in the late 70s/early 80s. I know it’s paying homage to famous Joker stories from the 80s like The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns, as well as Martin Scorsese movies from the 70s and 80s like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but you can do an homage without making a period piece. You could set the story in modern-day and it wouldn’t change at all. In fact, some things would make more sense if it were set in a world of social media and mobile phones. You’ll see what I mean if you see the movie. I also think some aspects of this movie would’ve been stronger if they showed rather than told. This movie needed more flashbacks, it would’ve been way more powerful. However, with all that said, I still loved it. I thought it was great. This movie is not fast. It’s not fun. There isn’t much action or comedy. It’s darker and more serious than The Dark Knight. Just know that going in. This is not your typical comic book movie. It’s more A History of Violence than The Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as the titular character is INCREDIBLE. He’s both sympathetic and scary and adds so many little nuances and special touches to his performance to make it completely his own. This Joker is very much unlike any other Joker we’ve gotten in other movies. It was refreshing, especially after the Suicide Squad fiasco. A lot of the other performers aren’t half bad either, it was cool to see Robert DeNiro in a comic book movie. This movie is beautiful. It’s shot really well and I loved the setdressing. Everything is dirty and grimy and disgusting with garbage everywhere, we’re a long way from the Gotham City of Joel Schumacher’s Batman movies! The score was also haunting and beautiful, with some great music choices for the soundtrack. No Twenty One Pilots here! I also thought this movie was really thematically rich and relevant. It has tons of social commentary about mental health, class, bullying, abuse, trauma, social isolation, gun violence, the media and more. Some might say this film bites off more than it can chew, it does try to juggle a lot of different themes at once, but I think it worked. This movie also connects with the larger mythology of Batman in very clever ways, leaving the door open to possible sequels and spinoffs. I don’t want that, personally, but it’s cool that this movie is also a Batman origin story, in a way. Joker and Batman are still two parts of a whole, even in Joker’s own movie. Overall, Joker is a flawed but great movie. It’s not for everyone and I definitely understand where a lot of the criticism of the film itself is coming from, but I still loved it and recommend it to any fan of psychological character studies or crime dramas, not just superhero movies. I hope it wins some Oscars!",1
2514,"Pretty much a modern rendition of Taxi Driver with a comic book backdrop. Easily one of the best movies of 2019, don't let the critics fool you.",1
2515,just great epic movie in every whey the acting is awesome .epic epic loved it,1
2516,Critics have defo got this wrong If ur looking for political rubbish or sentimental crap this ain't your film It's dark and violent and show the mental break down of lonely depressed man who tool his anger and shame and instead of killing himself he became art. Always keep a smile,1
2517,"Great plot and acting. It portrays a society where Antifa-like socialists endeavor to overthrow government with violence. It displays how the fruits of Arthur’s parent’s actions manifest in Arthur’s pain that when not healed, festers into a degraded life.  It’s one of the better movies in the last few years.",1
2518,"Joker But Not A JokeKnock, knock. Who’s there? Stream to Big Screen. Stream to Big Screen, who? Stream to Big Screen the best site for movie reviews on the internet! Corny? I think not. Welcome back everyone! This week we were able to view the highly anticipated movie, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Joker is a standalone origin film of many people’s favorite DC Comics villain. The movie is set in the worst of times in Gotham where violence is rampant, civil unrest is prevalent, and the rodent population is no joke. This movie follows Phoenix as the main character, Arthur Fleck. Arthur is a young man longing to fit in and aspiring to be a comedian but is dealing with a bevvy of issues, primarily mental illness. The film leads us through Arthur’s path to becoming the titular Joker.While this movie is titled Joker, the theme/takeaway from this movie is no joke. Ultimately, this movie hits way too close to home for American society presently. The bullied, belittled, forgotten person in society deals with mental illness without an appropriate support system, and he has access to a gun. This storyline has become an all too familiar in mainstream media today. For this reason, Joker is a very good conversation piece. But didn’t we come to see a movie based on a comic book? This isn’t what I wanted! Well, this is important to know. DON’T go into this movie expecting a comic book like story or a connection to the comics, other than the name.With that said, Warner Bros. couldn’t have found a better or more experienced lead actor than Phoenix. Phoenix definitely has practice acting like a power seeking maniac begging to be remembered. I’m looking at you Commodus! From the beginning to the end, Phoenix takes us through every single range of emotion Arthur experiences. It truly is quite impressive. Phoenix’s acting and the movie provide a great feeling of anxiety, not necessarily suspense, throughout. Unfortunately, the director either held Phoenix back or chose to feature too many early movie boring set up scenes. When Phoenix acts his craziest, the movie is epic but there is just far too little of it to get over the boring parts. In a way, I felt deceived by the intense commercials and trailers. We’ve been waiting for nearly a year to see this movie. Yes, the movie provides a few intense moments but far too few. And, far too little of Zazie Beetz! Honestly, they could’ve interchanged her with any actress to do the same thing. Nevertheless, her presence was still welcomed.And then when I wasn’t bored, I was predicting exactly what was supposed to be a surprise or twist in the movie. I’m not sure if it was the scene selection or a purposeful directorial decision, but at times the same scenes just didn’t make sense when I was watching them. Eventually, my suspicions were confirmed and I just said ,”duh!”All of that said, Joker delivers in some aspects (I didn’t even mention the great score in the movie) but ultimately will let you down. Joaquin does a good job as the Joker, but he’s never going to be regarded like a Heath Ledger once the dust settles. Try to check this movie out at a matinee time, if your a big Joker/DC fan. Everyone else, you may be disappointed in a matinee price but for a reasonable price it’s worth it or an early streaming rental.The Stream: Takes unbelievably long to get moving and then supremely predictable.The Big Screen: Joaquin delivers an uneven performance but worth watching.The Final Bill: Joker is an overhyped film that will create some conversations about mental health issues in society.-S2S: Movie Review",1
2519,"This seems as a mixed review for me. The concept is great, the feel of falling into mad descent, the uncontrollable laugh, the play on Thomas Wayne and Joker, these are all done phenomenally(and a few others I can't spoil). I can't help but to feel thought, that this movie could have been and should have been a 9 or even 10. It's got all the right pieces to the puzzle and with a more thorough execution would be right there. I think making this movie 3 hours long, showing a little more of his descent into madness, and really capitalizing on the final few scenes and not leaving you with the ending that it did really would have put this to number 1 for me but above all it's still a really good film. If you're a comic fan it's a must see.",1
2520,U need to see this movie. Its one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. The script and  scorr are brilliant and the caracther is so well composed. A true masterpiece that doenst come every year.,1
2521,Awesome movie the act of joker was lit i never watched a movie like this ..,1
2522,Joaquin esta perfeito nesse filme a trilha sonora e incrivel  joker e espantador e fascinante,1
2523,A fantastic movie. When i watched the movie I didn't know how to feel about Arthur aka the joker. I wanted to feel sorry for him but at the same time I hoped he got arrested. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job at bringing this beloved character to life  in an even greater movie.,1
2524,Loved this movie. Pure masterpiece with perfect directing and stunning performance from  Joaquin Phoenix.,1
2525,"I want more movie like joker this movie play with your brain, with his sounds,colors,music,mental illness paranoia journey through the head of a sick person where reality and thoughs are mixed brilliantly that you have to rewatch the movie to get it right and piece by piece reconstruct the puzzle to see a clear picture of what going on! Clearly i knew i was going to enjoy joker since the first trailer show up because it was unique and different not another blockbuster supervillain movie where theres no deep meaning other than make bad cgi effect on screen and been a cash grab, no joker decided to go risky and show us what it would really mean to have someone like joker in our society how he would grow,evolve and react in our community when someone with mental illness is let to himself fly by your own and maybe only maybe survive the struggle of social life, i think a huge part of what make this movie so successful is that we can easly relate to his struggle as human being we struggle so much from the inside and outside with what we have to going true that we can easly being in his shoes,that movie is magistral,sensational and easly one of the best interpretation of a superhero comic book movie closest to our reality ever seen for everything already said about the movie on other positive review i think it fair to say that todd phillips achieve with his wonderful team what i would call a masterpiece.",1
2526,Brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix AMAZING !!!!!! Good story line. I actually felt compassion for the  Character joker.,1
2528,"Incredible, provocative, soulful. Probably the best movie I’ve ever seen. Must see!",1
2529,10 out 10. Awesome movie. Acting of the joker was phenomenal. Hands down best individual superhero film of this century,1
2530,"Incredible acting, the performances were extremely believable and you can tell the actors had a passion for what they were doing. Amazing writing, kept me on the edge of my seat when any other movie would have me bored beyond belief. Great visuals, the scenes are wonderfully realistic and gritty, really captures the atmosphere of Gotham City. Dialogue was spectacular, felt like actual, organic conversation between real people. There are a lot of ways to interpret what this movie is saying, what the meaning behind it is, and for me what it does is highlight an incredibly prevalent and urgent issue we face as a society when it comes to the assistance some mentally ill people desperately need but never receive, because of things like budgeting or just a lack of people who care. It's a wonderfully written and produced movie with great characters, great thematic consistency, and a great message. As an added bonus, this is one of the best depictions of the Joker to ever grace the cinema.",1
2531,"His laugh and the pain behind it and every single dialogue he delivered, was insane and gave me goosebumps. 2019's Best movie for sure",1
2532,"Amazing movie, Joaquin brought a brilliant job for this. The songs and the colors helped a lot to that great result. I hardly recommend it.",1
2533,"one of the best DC films to date with a perfect performance by Joaquin Phoenix, worthy of a score of 10, but many **** critics rated it low because they considered it to be a dangerous film ...",1
2534,"Absolutely frightening.  Phoenix well deserved his Best Leading Man Oscar, and the building tension keeps the suspense building throughout the movie.  (The only off performance that stood out to me was the midget in the apartment's reaction to the murder of the guy who showed up with him.)  All these media voices who think that this movie celebrates the Joker and his actions are morons.  The Joker is portrayed as a dangerous killer, not a hero.  The movie explains him, but it doesn't celebrate him.",1
2535,"After seeing '' joker '' you will no longer support Batman. For some men, climbing the gray ladder of social success is not easy ... for those who are repeatedly trampled, marginalized and humiliated by a selfish society it is easier to go down that ladder by dancing, sinking into the abyss, coloring and merging their life with madness. Because in that madness, perhaps, there is the only possibility of a revenge .. Masterpiece!",1
2536,"has to be one of my fav movies of 2019, if you have not seen this don't expect a comic book action flick because you will be upset.",1
2538,"Finally went to see this at the last showing before it left the theater. Intriguing story and acting, but the most satisfying scene was seeing that ignorant Robert De Niro getting smoked. Tony this Bobby.  Worth the admission for that alone. Fulfilled my fantasy very well for the evening.",1
2539,"One of the best movies of the decade, hands down.  It gave a fresh take on how the Joker became into the psychatic sociopathic mastermind.  It is not the Joker many are used to but this Joker has no reasoning, care, or guilt.  It shows how the Joker can be scary.  Don't listen to the critics, this movie is awesome.",1
2540,Absolutely Moving and inspirational! I have never seen a Movie to express thought and character like this. It isn’t Edgy for the sake of being Edgy or Gorey for the sake of being Gorey. So well developed.,1
2541,"Comme c'est étonnant ! Les revues ou les critiques n'ayant aucun problème pour remplir leur frigo ont tendance à trouver ce film vraiment surfait. C'est très comique !Soyons clair, ce n'est pas le plus grand film de la décennie et l'impact qu'il pourra avoir sur vous vient en grande partie de la performance magistrale de Phoenix. Néanmoins, cette relecture du Joker vaut le détour tant scénaristiquement que graphiquement. Parfois binaire, mais très souvent bonnard. Foncez !",1
2542,"U need to see this movie. Forget what u heard about it. This is one of the best comic movies ever made stands right along with The Dark Knight, Spiderman 2, Spiderman Into The Spiderverse etc.",1
2543,Omg this is an truly amazing movie!! Watched it numerous times and never gets boring!! Well done!!!,1
2544,"This movie hit close to home to all of you saying that this is a poor representation of mental all of you wrong. I have the same mental disorder Arthur had in this movie (complex ptsd) serve PTSD caused from abuse over a long period of time. This illness causes speech problems it could cause consent laughing (like in the movie) impede your speech this movie is a very real depiction of it with solid writing, some of the greatest acting in all of film.  A fairly accurate portrayal of mental illness and how society treats it Joker is one of the greatest films of the 2010s and of this current century a true masterpiece.",1
2545,Joaquin Phoenix takes on some incredibly dark rolls and generally nails the performance.Joker is another jewel in his crown. He threads subtle emotions in every dark corner andbecomes the Joker. Very well done cinematic movie.,1
2546,"rating...The movie is great with all aspects. Main character was great, served its purpose and the idea was delivered. the sequencing of the events and  the story escalating smoothly I was never at any time during the movie annoyed or bothered  and so was everyone who watched I believe. overall it was a masterpiece in my fan point of view. I think critics should have a second look upon this movie",1
2547,One of the best. Joaquin Phoenixs performance is a master piece. It is a mystery why so many people don't like this movie.,1
2548,"Loved the Movie, Had a blast watching it! Joaquin Phoenix was phenomenal, all the scenes he was in felt more than real, the composition of the shots, the lighting and the music gave the movie an unique, mysterious and chilling vibe that truly bewitches the viewer!",1
2549,"Está bien, es una buena película, pero no es para tanto, no seamos gilipollas.",1
2550,"Vai toma no cu!!!!!  Uma nota dessa?  Vai se fuder!!!  Nao acreditem em notas, filme otimo nao é atoa q concorreu a 11 Oscar, e os fdp dão essa nota?  Desculpa mas n da",1
2551,This is not a comic book movie. This is a horror film. One with an incredible central performance from Joaquin Phoenix who deserves every bit of praise he gets.,1
2552,"a film that surprised me absurdly even though I had good expectations after seeing so many compliments, it is a film that differs from the others of DC and Marvel, which more and more, for me are getting saturated.Joker was a work of art in the form of a film, at all times you get stuck in the plot waiting for the outcome.",1
2553,"This movie is a haunting masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is spell-binding and probably the best he's ever done. This movie also gives us a fresh perspective on the Joker's life, and how he evolved into the fan favorite comic villain we know and love. Don't let all that melodramatic controversy get in the way of you seeing this movie. It is truly incredible.",1

2555,"A mash up of Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Batman and a Fellini movie. I approve.",1
2556,"This is the type of film that only succeeds to be amazing on surface level, but not a truly great movie. It’s visually stunning, it’s brilliantly acted by incredible actor Joaquin Phoenix, it’s empowered by the chilling musical score of talented composer Hildur Guðnadóttir. Everything in this movie is exceptional except two things: screenplay and direction. The movie is strongly derivative of Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, yet sadly fails at being anywhere near as deep, clever or subtle as either of them. But hey, at least Todd Phillips recognizes good films, despite his pretensions in making a culturally important one.",1
2557,"A brilliant, violent and controversial origin story given to DC's Joker, combined with Joaquin Phoenix's amazing and powerful performance which makes Joker the best movie of 2019 and one of the best DC movies.",1
2558,"Joker released on the 3rd of October, 2019 and grossed 4 million short of 100 million USD on it's opening weekend in the US. Overall, Joker grossed nearly 1.1 billion dollars worldwide. It stars Joaquin Pheonix as Arther Fleck and Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin. So, how was it?Joker is possibly the most enjoyment I have ever had from a comic book movie. It is a dark and gritty character study of a psychopath. There is not a moment of this movie where I feel happy. It is very consistent with it's tone and the atmosphere is so gritty. The constant sirens, the trash on the streets, the graffiti on the subway, all of it contributes to a hopeless feeling. Joaquin Pheonix gives the best acting performance of his career, which is saying a lot. His laugh is one of the best Joker laughs, only beaten by Heath Ledger. His improvisation is on point and always feels consistent. When he commits a crime, he always gives you the feeling that deep down, he enjoys it. The cinematography is so incredible and the dark colour palette looks like its ripped out of the 80's.Joker is a great movie, but like all great movies, it is flawed. Rupert Pupkin from The King Of Comedy(1983) is very clearly an influence on this movie. And by influence, I mean they ripped his character nearly completely off. An unreliable narrator that tries his best to become a comedian and become famous. He fails and this, among other things, leads to him commiting a terrible crime. The personalities are different, but the storylines are quite similar. Todd Philips and Scott Silver also take influence from Taxi Driver(1979), another Scorcese film. Joker has the same obsession with guns and commits the same crime. Just because it isn't original doesn't mean it's bad, but it does have another issue. Joker's atmosphere can be a bit repetitive. Taxi Driver had a similar atmosphere, but it mixed it up a bit with jazz music being played. Joker is always sad, always depressing.8/10",1
2559,"Excellent film avec un excellent acteur (Joaquin Phœnix). Avec aussi l'excellent Robert De Niro dans le rôle du mec qui se fait buter. Ce film montre un homme sombré dans une folie, et ce n'est même pas ennuyeux ! C'est un excellent film voir un chef-d'oeuvre.",1
2560,"An amazing film from start to finish. A must watch, and very topical in this day and age.",1
2561,Iconic movie. Psychological drama where the best actor shows how Joker becomes Joker.,1
2562,"Maybe the decent into darkness themes are just not my thing? Comedy and happy endings seems to be my thing so it would seem. Came for DC not for the mental torture porn. A well acted and well crafted film, but for someone like myself it was painfully uncomfortable to watch. Interesting yes, but entertaining no. This Joker comes more off as a sad character. Than a master criminal who could take on the Bat.",1
2563,Joker gives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star -- and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema.,1
2564,"Amazing movie, beautifully acted and riveting. Not sure why critics don’t like this movie but this movie is amazing.",1
2565,"A delightful frolic through the vast intricacies of the mind of a 'mentally ill loner, whom society abandoned and treated like trash'.",1
2566,"See Joker doesn’t get enough praise. It’s dark but it knows what it wants to be. Here are the reasons why you must see and believe me when I say that all of us are in quarantine so we all have enough time! - The acting is incredible - Although it’s grim, it also hooks you in. I’ve never had a bad time watching Joker. For some reason, my dad whose a doctor is scared of watching this.... I was around 17 when I saw it and enjoyed it and my dads way older than me obviously.......... that’s weird to me. A doctor is afraid of a doctor-moving.  It seems like he’s trying to stall too soooo.",1
2567,"This isn't a film, it is a work of artistic reality.Super hero films in recent years have been abysmal, leaving no sense of reality or relevance towards consumers unless you really ""just watch them for the action"", for instance infinity war or endgame is just a waste of time and it's following is only because ""everyone likes it"". Now this isn't to relate to this film's protagonist or sound like an edge lord but these marvel films are a ""roller coaster ride"" as Martin Scorsese describes them. Often times I compare the uncharacteristic MCU to the amazing writing and philosophy of the Halo series, halo is far more relatable to a group of superheros jumping around in CGI fights forever. I'd rather look up to the Arbiter, a self-sufficient dinosaur than a group of wimps.This leads to my main point about Joker, it is relatable. It surely isn't 100% relatable, as of course what the joker does in this film is immoral and unethical in every way, cant just go about killing people the way he did in this film. But, it is very realistic, its sad, its pessimistic and it shines a light on the reality that some mentally ill patients probably experience on a day to day basis. It also captures the reality of wealthy capitalists causing divisions between the rich and the poor in America (only in America, NOT IN THE UK) and other countries like Brazil. For instance, the game Max Payne 3 captures this pessimism in a similar way except Max is a hero rather than the anti-hero that is the Joker. This division of rich and poor is clear when you have to pay for healthcare in America and the fact that they advertise all sorts of health products there and make falsified claims about it goes to show on this division. Then again this isn't to get political, I don't agree with the idea of sparking a revolution because killing people isn't a good thing but this is a film and entertainment is of course for escapism. Understanding the Joker's mind and what he goes through was what we escaped into with this film and because of how realistic it is and emotional at times, it makes this film a master piece.Apparently Scorsese films influenced this film and I can 100% agree with this since I love his films. This is far better than a bunch of cgi fights and unrelatable content. Watch this if you're looking for a real film",1
2568,"I've always had an affinity for Batman movies, even the bad ones. But, this wasn't a ""Batman"" movie, obviously, and I read no reviews and went in with no expectations, except one. I was postive that they picked the wrong guy for the Joker. I was hilariously wrong. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was unmercifully perturbing and left me, for the first time, connecting with a criminally insane character, whose makeup is far more complex than that of a murderous clown. This depiction of the Joker could stand all on its own, and maybe will. But, after leaving the theater, I have a desire not to leave the transcience of this sorrowful film there.",1
2569,"This was everything i could have hoped for in a back story, phoenix's performance was completely out of this world.",1
2570,"Perfect in every aspect. The acting, the script, the sound design fantastic.",1
2571,My Best movie ever...My love for this movie is extremely highI rate it 10/10,1
2572,"One of the best movies in 2019, there is something artistic and so true in this production. We can find part of ourself in the main character - Joker and see what could happen if we take hatred further.",1
2573,"Overhyped in the name of getting quotes like ""there is the world before Joker and there is the world after Joked"" spread all over the internet for reviewer clout. This movie is far from disappointing, but ANYTHING would have been after all the hype this film got (supposed standing ovations at festivals and winning an award a bunch of best picture winners have won previously).Now, about the actual movie In a lot of ways, its Taxi Driver with a DC skin. It has the same tone and a lot of the same themes, but plot beats and base character motivations are drastically different. What you've heard about Phoenix's performance is all true, but I also loved the sometimes demented, sometimes classic style of cinematography and how the score would switch back and forth between sounding like what the character's perceived feelings on the events/situations were in a scene and what a sane person's perceptions of that same scene would be (triumphant vs. horrific).In addition to Jaoquin's performance, I thought that the few brief moments the supporting cast were given to play in were acted flawlessly as well. Zazzy Beats, Bryan Tyree Henry, and Deniro all had a brief moment to shine and they all took full advantage. I only have two real complaints about the film. First, I thought almost all additional tie-ins to the DC universe were the weakest parts of the movie. One with pearls felt particularly shoehorned in. And second, I wish the film had cut to black on the last line of dialogue Phoenix delivered. It would have been just a bit more effective than the more drawn out ending we got, I think, because that last line has some real punch to it. Maybe it would have felt cheesy. Lmk. Not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed it and will definitely see it again.",1
2574,The scene where he murdered murry was intense. How now brown cow. Sorry just writing random stuff because for some reason it can't be less than 75 characters even though I have nothing else to say than my first my comment.,1
2575,"Joker may initially scan as a pastiche of Scorsese's neo-noir ""existential hero"" style, but further watching reveals a film that isn't a loving forgery as much as it breathes new life into this style of filmmaking, picking up the torch where the original director left off. Like ""Taxi Driver"", it brings with it an ability to pull on every uncomfortable string of our tense social ball-of-yarn, slowly unraveling a complex web of institutions geared steering us away from the yearning emptiness of our late-stage capitalist lives, and like ""The King of Comedy"", gives a powerful and haunted glimpse into the inner worlds of the unstable and self-absorbed. Yet, it doesn't just sandwich concepts from other films, but brings with it a variety of new tools that didn't exist in that era of filmmaking, such as the ability to show some sympathy to these malignant figures and see that their struggle is ours, and warns us all of the potential danger of leaving loose threads frayed for too long.",1
2576,"Great movie , very mixed reactions from other but i personally love it. Joaquin was amazing as well. A must see!",1
2577,"Impresionante en todo el sentido de la palabra. Es la única forma de describir Joker: me ha dejado impresionado. Y con un mal cuerpo tremendo, que es sin duda un testamento de lo bien hecha que está. Un Joaquin Phoenix que se supera incluso con el elevadísimo listón que se había dejado en el pasado. Una dirección, estética, ambientación, cámara... todo perfecto. Y un guión ambiguo, turbio, sórdido y sin duda brutal no sólo en la violencia (que también) sino en la creación de los personajes, la historia, el ambiente. Una historia donde la risa acaba dando casi miedo, presagio de lo terrible que va a ocurrir, y donde es imposible no empatizar con un protagonista que te remueve por dentro un montón de sensaciones. Realmente, una película excepcional.",1
2578,"This film gave me one of the most unique cinematic experiences I’ve ever had. Phoenix’s performance was one of the best performances I could recall ever seeing after leaving the theatre, better than just the best performance of 2019. I was in disbelief that the person I was watching on the screen was Joaquin Phoenix - from start to finish he was unrecognizably dedicated to playing the role and very highly emotionally provocative for the audience. The cinematography was phenomenally uncomfortable, the score was hauntingly brilliant, the supporting cast were well selected, and the movie pacing was uniquely captivating. This was also the best Gotham city setting to me so far. The film setting drew me in and made me feel filthy. The metaphors and the score from the film were particularly powerful. There is ever present audience gripping tension starting from the first minute of the film until the end. You could really feel the emotional involvement of the audience in the theatre. The final 45 minutes of this film are truly some of the best cinema ever produced. This was not simply a shut-your-brain-off for 2 hours entertainment movie - more so a movie of great importance that’s thought provoking throughout and will absolutely move the viewer to self reflect.",1
2579,"Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserved his oscar for this film. He has an outstanding, incredible performance as Joker in this movie. Probably DC's most impressive film so far. The soundtrack is amazing, the cinematography is great, and it's good movie with some dark themes. It isn't perfect thou. It gets a 7/10.",1
2580,"I absolutely loved it, one of my favorite movies for sure. If you haven't, give it a shot.",1
2581,Amazing! Honestly the best film I've seen in a while and the best of Joaquin since The Master.,1
2582,I think critics don’t watch movies with their eyes.You must add this movie to your watch list.,1
2583,Director Todd Phillips... “Joker” Joaquin Phoenix... Senario... Cinematography... And Soundtracks... EXELLENT ! This Is A Masterpiece !,1
2584,I'd like to pay tribute to the creators: how talented under the vernacular of a comic book people were sold psychological acute social drama.,1
2585,"Joker is such a excelent movie. A great Performance, great Music, great Actors.",1
2586,i feel like this movie was just as good the second time and i wonder why the critics are giving this film such a low rating. it kinda makes their views redundant.,1
2587,Absolute MUST SEE. Incredible film the entire way through. Extra props to the score and special effects. Phoenix is legendary. 10/10,1
2588,"Incredible movie, the score is absolutely brilliant and the plot is extremely well written. A very, very dark movie, but also an incredibly well made movie. I don't think I looked away from the screen once because it was so engaging.",1
2589,"This movie is hauntingly beautiful. It's amazing, deep, dark, disturbing, yet encouraging to ""think of the other guy."" Joaquin's performance is superb. I'm looking forward to the sequel.",1
2590,"Dark and intense dive into a madman's mind is a fascinating as well as disturbing experience, largely due to Joaquin Phoenix's frenetic, mesmerizing performance.",1
2591,"This is nothing less than spectacular. Absolutely mesmerizing! Phoenix delivers a magnificent performance. The direction is excellent. The production design and cinematography are some of the best I have ever seen. While the story does seem confusing at times, picture yourself in The Joker’s position. His life doesn’t make sense at all. One of the best movies I have ever seen.",1
2592,"An surprisingly excellent origin story about one of the most infamous comic book villains. Thanks to Joaquín Phoenix's outstanding lead performance, the haunting and chilling soundtrack, a darker and grittier style and tone thanks to its R rating, black comedy, taking inspiration from Martin Scorsese films, and plenty of social commentary about class division and the treatment of mental health, it's one of the finest and most iconic comic book movies of all time.",1
2593,"Initially when I heard the lead was Joaquin, I was excited because it was quite obvious he is one of the best actors around. And then the reviews made it sound like a flop so I thought maybe it's not that good. God, I was wrong. His performance as the Joker was spectacular, even reaching to the point that I felt the Joker was not wrong to be who he became. Arthur started off as a depressed man without any light in his life. But it was the way Joaquin physically portrayed someone with a psychotic disorder with so much detail, he never once overdid it. His physique is one of a broken bullied man and his eyes reflect Arthur's tormented soul. The direction of the movie was terrific as well by focusing on the internal breakdown of Arthur's mind. The movie was so painful, realistic and never too dramatic, that I was captivated throughout. Despite Heath Ledger's amazing performance, I think it is no way comparable to this Joker. However, to be fair, Heath did not get the same size of the role. I would strongly recommend it to anyone, especially DC fans to see this movie with legendary acting so rare.",1
2594,"Joaquin Phoenix' performance is masterful, on par with Adrien Brody's in The Pianist. Excellent character study, and the film could very easily stand on its own without it being in the Batman universe. That's just a bonus for Batman fans.",1
2595,"Nihilism with an artistic flair. Audiences are left wondering what, if any of it really happened. All while painting a character portrait of a cult icon. By no means an apologist for his vile actions, the film lets you into a world where good things are non-existent and the darkness of Gotham's underbelly. This movie gives you a look into the world of someone truly broken.",1
2596,"Worth it for Phoenix alone, but let's dive into why critics hate this work. The most obvious answer is it made them uncomfortable, which is exactly what the movie set out to do. The grotesque shots of Phoenix's body, the close-ups of his face that make you squirm, all of them tie in to fit the narrative of, well, ""weirdo"". It makes you feel creeped out and empty, and that's exactly the purpose of this film. To showcase the oddness and obscurity of such a character as Arthur Fleck. I really wish critics would stop comparing this movie to Scorsese. You're not watching ""Taxi Driver"", and that's not a bad thing. Take the movie for what it is, not what it could be. And for what it is, it's a great film.",1
2597,"So incredible. Phoenix is on the same level as Ledger was in The Dark Knight, but at the same time it's also a flawlessly directed film with amazing cinematography, mesmerising music and great performances all around even from the side characters. Critics hate on this movie for condoning violence, but isn't that the point of the joker anyway? That character was created by DC as a violent, chaotic character to stand against batman. This film will go down as the best joker movie ever made, through its gritty realism and brilliant drama, along with a performance of a lifetime by my boy Joaquin.",1
2598,"One of the best films of the decade, a unique film, a masterpiece, one of the best films of all time, the film industry needs more film like this ...",1
2599,He didn't cause chaos. He's a product of chaos. All the things that happened around him made him who he was.,1
2600,"A fascinating origin story about a sad man turned madman. It is unapologetically raw and uncomfortable, and I appreciated every demented moment of it.",1
2601,"This film was really good! The acting combined with the screenplay and the audio effects were somewhat unsettling, however, it worked.  The tempo of the movie was another positive.",1
2602,"Una obra maestra y de las mejores películas de villanos, esta película nos muestra a un Joker realista al que la sociedad vuelve un psicópata. La música, historia y escenas son increíbles y emotivas, es una película que te llega al alma y que te fascinara con todos sus demás aspectos.",1
2603,"Joker is hated by mainstream reviewers for showing unapologetically, albeit in dramatized style, the harsh reality of systematic abuse and apathy the mentally ill and impoverished face every day. It takes the radical position of depicting people similar to the fictional Thomas Wayne as not the solution, but rather the problem. The poor to people like Thomas Wayne are clowns, not even worthy of contempt. If only they'd work as hard as he, then maybe they'd share his wealth and success! Or so he'd like to believe. His son Bruce will presumably grow up to become Batman, a rich spoiled vigilante that gets his kicks by beating up opportunistic criminals in an urban environment of decay and destitution. Like his father, Bruce is merely part of the problem at best is a symptom of a society facing total moral collapse.Arthur from the moment of conception is abandoned and left to be abused by a narcissistic ""caretaker"" and her bad boy boyfriend. He grows up horrifically broken and fantasizes receiving fatherly love from a talk show host. This is the kind of man that is starved of love and has known only the vicious callousness of his anomic society.It's hard to say if Arthur would have grown or developed normally to begin with, but the fact of the matter is: he is given no chance or hope. His only path is to become insane. All other doors have been shut...Instead of helping Arthur, his society cuts his meager therapy and leaves him without his many prescriptions. Arthur is subject to physical abuse without any recourse. And the man he came to fantasize as a fatherly figure, ridicules and mocks Arthur for the sake of empty entertainment. The end result is not surprising.",1
2604,This is a great movie. Good story and the character performance is really great.,1
2605,Best movie of 2019. Joaquin Phoenix is real amazing. Hope for a sequel. 10/10,1
2606,Bad. Just very very bad. The hype over this damn movie made it seem like the greatest thing ever created by Hollywood..... girl please. Phoenix’s performance was the ONLY good thing about it. But not good enough to warrant a higher score.A waste of my time tbh.,0
2607,"Fantastic movie, I just wish Arthur Fleck would have become Joker earlier. For some people the movie may be boring, but I really enjoyed it.",1
2608,"As always, Joaquin Phoenix presents us with an incredible performance. This was straight into Arthur Flecks mind.",1
2609,Joaquin  Phoenix deserved 5 Oscar's for his role.His laugh was so full of pain. Genius actor,1
2610,"Joker is a darker and grittier take on the comic book genre; it doesn't resemble a ""traditional"" comic book movie at all. It focuses on the life of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill loner living in a grim, early-80s Gotham City. Though the movie itself isn't some sort of revelation, it has a captivating story which tells of Fleck's descent into madness. Joaquin Phoenix's chilling performance carries the movie, as do the stunning cinematography and the fitting score. It can be hard to watch, but it's still a solid movie.",1
2611,"I'm just gonna say this as my review. The critics this time are wrong. Trust me, you'll love it regardless if you grew up with DC Comics or watching the shoes. It's great standalone.",1

At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.",0
