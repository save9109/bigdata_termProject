0,"Many (former) fans have already stated opinions that are the samw as mine. In short the following are my main concerns: 1. They wrecked Luke Skywalker as a character 2. Too many CG critters designed to sell merchandise3. Too much humour a la Spaceballs. (I love the humour in Spaceballs, but not in a Star Wars main entry movie) 4. A promising villain that turned out to be nothing",0
1,"While watching the movie, I felt like my whole family just died and someone was cracking inappropriate jokes in my ear, non-stop.",0
2,"Pros:- By far the best looking Star Wars Film- Light Saber Battles are awesome and well choreographed.Cons:1.  Left open plot lines from The Force Awakens(TFA).  - TFA made Snokes background a major plotline, this move did not explain any of it.  - TFA made Rey's background a big deal, this movie provided an unsatisfactory resolution.  (What's the point of making them a mystery in TFA, if they're nobodies?)  - TFA setup Finn to be force sensitive, no further development here.  - TFA made out Snoke to be supremey powerful, he met an anticlimactic end in this movie.2.  Poor overall plot.  - Casino subplot was unecessary, when you think about it.  Why did the purple haired lady hide her plan?  If she had disclosed it the casino would have been unnecessary.  - The whole Casino scene was unnecessary, it ended up failing overall.  - Finn's romance with the asian girl was poorly written.  Her character was not developed, it felt forced.  TFA had some romantic tension with Rey and Finn, not furthered in this movie.  - How do bombs ""fall"" in gravity?  - This was a problem with TFA as well, but how the hell does Rey overcome Elite Guards without training?  3.  Betrayal of Luke Skywalker.  - Luke spent the first trilogy trying to redeem his father, you're telling me the same Luke, would kill his nephew after he sensed a little bit of darkness?  GTFOH!!!4.  Comedy was forced and cheesey and out of place.",0
3,"The worst part about this movie is not that it's a poorly written movie with terrible (or non-existant) character arcs, poor plot, out of place humor or ham-fisted political commentary. It's not even that it ignores established Star Wars canon or lore.It is awful because it attempts to ruin everything about Star Wars that made it such a beloved story in the first place. Instead of wisdom, we get book burning. Instead of optimism and faith, we get nihilism. And instead of hope, we get pessimism and despair.This movie is an all out assault on Star Wars as a phenomenon, it left me cold. It seems as if the people in charge of the franchise at Disney really hate the original trilogy.",0
4,"First thing. No, I'm not a bot. I've watched the movie in the theatre, thought about watching it a second time, but I really did not like many things in this movie. So instead of giving Disney more of my money, I've came here to express my point of view.The director ignored many aspects and plots from previous movies and novels of the franchise. Even from The Force Awakens.I felt that many characters were thrown there just to be a mean to an end, even the big ones. Which I think it's not a big problem if you are making a movie in a new universe, or trying to push a new franchise/saga. But it can be a big problem on a well stabilished universe like this.A lot of things that could have been or needed to be explained, are just ignored or like Rian Johnson himself later said ""aren't important to the history"", or ""weren't important in the 70s movie"".They had an oportunity to make an amazing trilogy, where the old character passes the torch to the new hero and teaches her about the things that he did right and wrong, so she can become even stronger than him. And they could have done it in a way that feels respectful, nostalgic, coherent with the character and at the same time showing that he is not a perfect being.But they didn't. And in my point of view, there are things in this movie that some Star Wars fans may find wrong, incoherent and in some cases even downright insulting.",0
5,"Worst best seller of the history, Leia flying, stupid jokes like the ""iron"", those ridiculous birds, in that case better watch Spaceballs. Luke denigrated to the worst garbage of human being and with powers ridiculous for a Jedi, he died stupidly, please remake this film, this film should never had existed.I don't say that it is a bad movie because Luke died, in Episode VII Han Solo died and killed the possibility to ever play together with Luke again, but anyway I liked the movie as it was a decent plot, if you are going to kill a super idol do it for a good reason, like it was done in Episode 7, not kill him because he got tired after use too much Jedi Power and leave episode 9 with nobody, even with a good plot you should be very careful if kill the Luke, now everybody is dead as Carrie Fisher died in the real world, whats the point of Episode 9? Who will be the stars, Chewbacca and androids? Unless they bring Lando to episode 9 for sure only teenagers will go to cinema to watch it. I left my family in Christmas to go to watch this abomination, for a Star Wars movie, anyone would understand, but leave Christmas for this garbage? Most of fans say ""pretend that this movie never existed"" but it is difficult, specially that there will be an episode 9. Rian Johnson, you killed Star Wars.",0
6,disgusting - cringe as fk ? yeah fits pretty well....& of course great brain washing concept ....,0
7,"I don’t understand how this movie has an 85 on metacritic clearly the critics see movies one way and the public sees the another, I don’t know who pays the critics, besides the movie studios, they need to review movies for themselves and stop giving their opinion to the public because we are not getting paid so we will be honest.",0
8,"The worst SW movie ever. The plot doesn't have any sense, severe abuse of jokes, many SW's rules violated, many ""plot twists"" are just bad ones, too much politics in the movie (girls are smart, men are stupid and violent, all white men are all nazis except for Luke, rich people are evil in many ways, etc), many dialogs are very bad. The movie is so bad that Phantom Menace looks like a master piece compared to it.",0
9,"Well that wasn't Star Wars.  Apparently Lea is a spaceship with innate powers that Anakin would be envious of after his years upon years of training.  Luke is not Luke but some emotionally unstable hermit.  If I go on it will be spoilers... whoever wrote this just shoehorned in ""cool"" ideas that he got from three year olds.  The story is contrived and awkward.  I can see why Star Wars fans want the movie removed from cannon, long live Jar Jar!",0
10,"Unbelievable how mismanaged this series is. The direction is so adolescant, there's no subtly at all. Help us, spin-off movies, you're our only hope!Appalling script written by a ten year old, massively misjudged comic relief turns this into an SNL parody.",0
11,"Remember all the stuff you loved from the original trilogy? All crap. What about all the mysteries and intrigue from Episode 7? We don't care about that either. It's a middle finger to the fans of the originals, and perhaps even worse to the fans of Episode 7.I feel like I just watched two hours of someone throwing all the previous films into a fire. There is no reason for me to care about the next movie.",0
12,"I enjoyed the prequels more than The Last Jedi, and that saddens me. I wanted to like this film in spite of its awkwardly Whedon-ish dialogue and tv-like plot, but the visual effects and camera work (which were just above average --strange considering TLJ was the most anticipated movie of 2017) were not enough to sway me. It wasn't an enjoyable film, mostly because the main characters were written as unlikable, miserable jerks. Where's all the mystery, excitement, and fun? Aren't Star Wars movies supposed to be fun? Perhaps I missed the memo.",0
13,"This movie is OK for anyone, who just want to see some sci-fi with good visual effects and who is totally new to SW universe. But for people, who lived with SW universe through original trilogy, books, video games etc... for them this movie could be a huge disappointment. Plot is a total mess with no logical connection even to this movie itself, not to mention all previous SW lore. Dull characters and side plots introduced in this movie just because ""why not to add something that can be added"". So far this is the worst movie of all 9 (episode 1-8 and including Rogue One) buy its plot and new characters. Comparing this movie to original trilogy is like comparing ""Alien: Covenant"" to original ""Alien"" and ""Alients"", or like comparing ""Terminator: Salvation"" to ""Terminator 2""",0
14,Ruined the Skywalker saga and threw away not only everything that episode vii set up but everything that made star wars special.,0
15,"One of the worst movies I’ve ever seen, and really put the damper on the whole Star Wars legacy. Terrible plot, humour and character development, this movie has nothing good going for it at all. They named a species crystal critters for ****s sake!",0
16,This film was just heart breaking. I enjoyed The Force Awakens and Rogue One but this film was a complete disaster. It totally wrecked the character of Luke and most of the drama in the film was completely pointless.,0
17,"Visually stunning, horrendous story!If you expect a movie to look beautiful and have some amazing special effects, this is perfect for you.If you want a cohesive and compelling story, do yourself a favour and save your money. The movie consists of three main storylines and two of those are 100% artificial and would not have happened if certain characters acted in a logical way. It felt like they just existed to give character stuff to do.Furthermore, you really experience the lack of a common thread for this sequel trilogy of Star Wars. Apparently, the writers/director did not plan out major plot points in advance and loose story ends from the previous movie are mostly ditched. In addition, some characters have a different personality than before and no visible arc throughout the film.I would give 'The Last Jedi' zero points but admittedly the visuals are great and the score from John Williams is top-notch as always. Nevertheless, terrible Sci-Fi movie and even worse Star Wars film.",0
18,"Worst Star Wars in history, disappointed. Disney ruined it big time , serves them right .",0
19,Worst star wars movie ever made.it disrespected the force and everything we love...,0
20,"My family and I go to Disney World every year. I was extremely happy when Disney obtained the rights for Star Wars because I thought it would be more Star Wars and because Disney usually does an outstanding job with its products. However, I grew up loving Star Wars and Luke Skywalker because Luke would never give up on his father no matter how terrible his father was. But for some reason, Luke no longer had that faithful determination that was the key to his growth in the Original Trilogy. It was obvious that Disney killed off Luke just so they could more easily expand the Star Wars Universe to make more money. They could have done it in a far better way by making him go out showing his true power and saving his friends. How this was not thought of is amazing. Not giving Luke a final amazing lightsaber duel is asinine. The greatest Star War war character ever was treated like a burdensome character to deal with and so they just did away with him unceremoniously. I understand that I am upset because of how they handled Luke Skywalker and not upset with the quality of the movie itself. However, I think that my rating is appropriate because the source material for the movie was almost entirely disregarded (except for the facts that there are outer space scenes and the Force is involved in the story). If the Lord of the Rings was given a new Trilogy and that trilogy made Aragorn a feeble, depressed character then many fans would freak out on that issue as well.I am so confounded on how Rian Johnson came to the conclusion that Luke Skywalker would act in the way he did in The Last Jedi. Even Mark Hammill thought his character in The Last Jedi wasn't true to form. The worst part of all is that Disney and Johnson are saying that the divisiveness The Last Jedi has caused is a positive thing. If you are losing half of your fan base how can that possibly be a good thing? It may be sad to some people that I can be so upset about a movie, but Star Wars was such a large part of my childhood (and my adulthood) that tarnishing so many of those happy memories for me if hard to move past. I will no longer be going to Disney after this year. The only reason I am still going this year is because I paid for tickets, a room, and a meal plan before The Last Jedi was released to theaters. Even though I love Disney, I cannot support a company that would so recklessly destroy a source of happiness for so many people. Hopefully Luke Skywalker isn't dead and just found a way to transport himself through the Force to different locations. That's the only hope I have that Star Wars may not be ruined for good.",0
21,"This movie is crap. Absolute crap, crap, crap. I hope Rian Johnson's planned trilogy is cancelled after seeing how horrible of a job he did with ONE movie. Can you imagine this guy making his own trilogy? I don't want him anywhere near the Star Wars universe again. This movie was absolutely terrible.",0
22,Blows harder than a lactating sea moose. Genuinely wish I could unsee this movie.Complete waste of time.,0
23,"I'm sorry to tell you all but this film is one of the worst monstrosities I've ever had the privilege of witnessing in the theater. I paid matinee prices so I didn't get too ripped off but wow I'd be really mad to pay full price and do 3D too! Everything is wrong here, nothing makes one moment of sense, the acting is just terrible beyond words (except Mark Hamill), everything feels out of order most of the time and never for a moment was I thinking ""wow this is going great."" I see what happened here now, Disney's Kathleen Kennedy stated in an interview they write stories then fit characters around them. They don't write for the sake of characters. That's exactly what this felt like, as if the stories being given had no relation to any of these people we learned about in Force Awakens, instead it feels like they have been put into an alternate universe where everything has different universal constants/laws even peoples thought processes. I never thought a modern day film could ever be this bad, especially one with such a large budget as this I KNOW NOW I WAS WRONG. Nothing can fix this mess, it's written worse than a childs story, it's absurd nonsense that goes nowhere. I'd rather watch the prequels every single day of my life than see this one more time.",0
24,"This is not Star Wars unfortunately.Whenever I watched Star Wars, the original three, the prequels or the animated TV shows, I liked them because they gave back the Star Wars feeling with the characters and the immense story. With this episode, after a disastrous Episode 7, I am hopeless. The movie is long, packed with action which is good but the characters are not well written and most of them are misrepresented, not to mention the modern age plight in the movie:- the new characters are not capable of taking over from the old characters, they are just vague and you feel like there is no point in the whole movie. - the old characters, nearly all of them, seem to be totally different from previous parts. They are not who they were, they have different ideals. - women are strong, brave and clever whereas men are cowardly, stupid or impulsive without brains (in old Star Wars movies we had strong women and men characters and it wasn't pushed, here it is pushed)All in all, could have been a great movie because I believe old and new could have existed next to each other but they didn't even try to do that, they just  wanted to get rid of the old and introduce the new which turned out to be a failure.3 out of 10.",0
25,"Worse SW movie, looks very nice but lacks any heart that makes a SW film, hence the one star. Rey is now a super Jedi with no proper training. Poe is an idiot, Finn does nothing. Leia and Luke's characters are just treated badly with no continuity with previous canon films regarding the Force, especially Luke. How they took an iconic character who's motivations we know from the previous films and then crap all over that history and expect people to accept it? I left the cinema stunned and the more I thought about what I saw the more I grew to dislike and now I absolutely hate the film. No Solo, EpIX or any future Disney SW for me.",0
26,"I would give this zero stars if possible. This film is not only an awful piece of storytelling in its own right, but also a complete F*CK YOU to fans of the original trilogy. I can't comprehend how this film has had such good reviews from the critics but am gratified to see the sheer number of fans giving it poor reviews. Leia Poppins, Luke being Not-Luke and dying on a rock from doing nothing but using the Force, an entire sub-story (in a film with very few plot lines) being entirely pointless and characters like Akbar being killed off with utter disregard are just a few of the things so very, very wrong about this sh*tstorm of a movie. The film makers need to have a long hard look at themselves in the mirror.",0
27,"There are movies that I like, and there many that I don't. But this one... I really hate it. Spoiler alert: This movie destroys everything that you know about Star Wars.",0
28,"The only way this movie can be redeemed is by JJ starting episode IX is with the realization that everything that happens from the moment Leia is sucked into space is a dream before she dies, and then reboots XII into IX from that moment on.  Allow the Rebels to escape, have Luke actually act like Luke and train Rey. And then have Luke and Rey take on Snoke and Kylo for a big ending!  Otherwise, IX will be as horrible as VIII was.",0
29,"I'm writing this review to document that I am a real human being and not a bot, which frankly is a pathetic excuse for apologists of this thing to make. The Last Jedi is just not a good movie, if this were any other franchise we would all be laughing about it in a MST3K/Rifftrax sort of way; because Star Wars means so much to people there is ""polarization"". This movie isn't bad because I didn't get what I wanted as a fan of the series, this movie is bad because I didn't get what I wanted as a fan of movies in general. Lame jokes, unlikeable characters, a boring plot that goes nowhere and some of the worst editing and pacing I've seen this side of the Transformers franchise. In six months when this trash is on home media all of its supporters are going to have a hard time defending it. The only good thing about this movie is the commitment by every actor to try and make it work. Star Wars movies are supposed to leave you with the want to come back to the galaxy far, far away and I honestly don't care after this movie.",0
30,"The Last Jedi is easily the worst Star Wars film to date; no better than the one-off Rogue One. Rian Johnson continues his personal series of flops by writing this awful fan-fiction. It focuses on the father-daughter relationship with Luke & Rey, and mostly a simple young female janitor to set-up a trite romance with Finn later on. There’s extraordinary pacing issues, and the longstanding characters act as though this is their very first Star Wars film. There is no pay-off in the end, and the humor is particularly bad. It tries so hard to be different in formula from The Empire Strikes Back, that it does nothing exciting. What could’ve been a fantastic departure from the obvious sci-fi standard is instead a tedious spin-off. Episode IX could ignore The Last Jedi entirely and no one would be the wiser.",0
31,"Gorgeous visuals, but truly atrocious storytelling!! Such wasted potential!",0
32,"This movie is so bad, both me and my father who are lifelong fans are insulted. We both have seen every star wars in the theater since 1977, and we can honestly say that when Lucas sold it to Disney it was over because clearly the same man no longer has his fingerprints anywhere on the movies. Even Mark Hamill in recent interviews slammed this movie. ""Its not how I would have handled the situation as Luke Skywalker."" Lets go over some points why this movie was terrible:  1. The first three movies, 1977 1980 1982 were basically a space soap opera. You became emotionally invested in the main 7-10 characters. The movie plot was built around these characters with action but it was always about these characters which became family.2. The new movies. Never build up characters up the same way. Who cares about that new pilot? Who really cares about Ren like you cared about Princess Leia? These people never grew or were introduced like a family as in the first movies. The were just individuals wandering around the plot points on separate paths. This did not allow you to become emotionally invested with them.3. The plot is haphazard, like pieces of a puzzle scattered all about a table from a 1000 piece puzzle. There were many points where you were saying to yourself, why is this part here? For example, why am I watching an alien horse breakout for 15 minutes?4. Weak bad guy. The first three star wars movies there was a strong bad guy. Darth Vader. This new bad guy? Unsure of himself. Weak. Self doubting. That is really poor for a movie. You want strong opposite polar characters. The bad and the good. Darth Vader and Princess Leia. 5. You can no longer vibe with the old characters they brought back. Its like going to prison for 30 years then coming back home and realizing you dont really know these people anymore. Leia is some old lady no longer with the fiery personality she once had. She doesnt look or act the same. No longer know or recognize her. Luke is now a quitter. Doesnt act like Luke Skywalker. Even tried to murder his apprentice in his sleep. Dies at the end for no reason, almost like he just gave up. Not the Luke I know. And Han just came back for a cameo last movie before he got dispatched. All of them never got back like a family, they were all on their own separate paths. And don't forget the awkward hug between Han and Leia. No romantic long drawn out kiss between them now that they are old, right?6. Same old (general) storyline, poorly rehashed. Hey, didnt the republic win at then end of Star wars 6 in 1983? Once again its the empire or some version of it chasing down a small band of rebels. Already been there, done that.So to recap, this was a jigsaw scattered movie with a weak plot with characters you cant emotionally invest in containing cameos of characters you formerly loved but cannot reconnect with basically redoing a movie plot that was already handed in the first three Star Wars movies. It is quite clear the that man who did the first 6 movies handed it off to someone else and these 2 recent movies are somewhat soulless in comparison, being cranked out by a corporate entity who bought the intellectual property with the motive of profit. Yes, of this writing, the movie made close to 800 million dollars. Which means the bottom line says they are going to make more. However as people clue in that these are not the same movies they used to be, profits will fall.In my personal library I have on DVD on a shelf Star Wars (1977) The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and the Return of the Jedi (1983) along with the next 3 prequels from the early to mid 2000s (Star wars I-III). And as far as I am concerned, that is it. Series completed. These last two movies were like poor fan movies. Yes, this movie blew. I am going to have to cleanse the palate by watching the original Star Wars and forgot I ever saw this.",0
33,"The only good thing about this movie is that Episode I is no longer the worst one. I liked some stuff from Episode VII and I expected to see a good film, but Disney definitely ruined Star Wars with this one. I can't believe it's a 2:30 hours movie, I wanted to leave the theatre so badly...I guess it's a movie for children now, they probably enjoy the action, the awful gags and the FXs.",0
34,"First off, Star Wars is a myth. Myths should not question their own premises and deconstruct themselves - that’s the critic’s job. But ignoring the meta-critique, the movie itself was extremely clunky and tedious. The Finn/codebreaker storyline went nowhere. On the one hand, the daring, against-all-odds mission is supposed to work - it’s Star Wars!. On the other, even if you want it to fail and teach Po a lesson (always obey your superiors even when they seem to be leading your entire movement to certain death - a sickening betrayal of the whole ‘rebel’ ethos), they should have killed off Finn. There are so many things I could criticize about this movie, but I’ll just do one more. Why exactly are we supposed to care about the Resistance? No one responded to their distress call - clearly the rest of the galaxy doesn’t thing the First Order is all that bad if they’re unwilling to fight against them. Okay, one more thing, sorry. Why did the movie end with broom kid? I don’t care about broom kid, no one cares about broom kid. Every other movie ends with main characters - a concrete summation of coming conflict or a recent victory - this one ends with an abstract appeal to a notion of hope. Broom kid probably doesn’t even care or know about the First Order, he just wants to be freed. Just another tiny instance of this film’s message of subversion. Everything about the movie seems to betray some aspect of ‘Star Wars’. This is how a culture dies.",0
35,"ive never been so disappointed by a movie in my life.  bad plot, nonsensical choices, a story that goes nowhere.  in all the ways that mattered it was dull and repetitive yet in all the ways that didnt it was full of oddball choices and characters who seem to have had a lobotomy.",0
36,"Maybe the story was written too quickly for the sake of making quick money cause that's the only thing that makes sense. The movie felt shallow and incoherent and seemed to rely to much on special effects and stuff blowing up, than having a meaningful experience. About half way through I felt like it should be wrapping up soon but was repeatedly quickly disappointed that the action would pick up again and I would have to endure another long round of nothing really making much sense and too many explosions... what was the main plot? The characters were extremely annoying and shallow. If you insist on making more Star Wars movies, please do something better than this pile of vomit. What a disgrace.",0
37,"A friend of mine said it best:""I was thinking today what non-Star Wars fans see when they are shown Star Wars, is just random crap about space and aliens. When a Star Wars fan watches Star Wars, they see the archetypal hero's journey in full effect--full with a deep mythological force as old as storytelling itself. When you make a Star Wars film that tries to chuck all of that out the window to 're-invent' or 'subvert' the previous saga...a Star Wars fan just sees random crap about space and aliens. And that's why critics, many of which perhaps never understood Star Wars to begin with, saw the random crap about space and aliens and thought, 'Sure this is what they like'.""I couldn't agree more. This movie left me completely cold, and I didn't think a Star Wars movie was capable of doing that. The worst part is...I don't think there is a way for it to be fixed. Disney has now opened the floodgates for this franchise to be a Transformers or Fast & Furious - just disposable trash, albeit trash that makes a billion dollars at the box office. The biggest disappointment of the year. Fans have a right to be heartbroken and angry.",0
38,"This movie is a HUGE disappointment for me.  A bad Star Wars movie is still an entertaining movie, but this is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made.  There are so many reasons this movie sucks.  -Superfluous characters and subplots (who doesn't love Laura Dern and Benico del Toro but their characters had no reason to be in this movie, Fin/Rose mission to casino to find ""Master Codebreaker"" absurd).  -Idiotic plot holes (hello, you can't drop gravity bombs in space, what they are electromagnetic?, then you don't need to get ""over"" your target, who is going to fly those suicide bombers anyway?)(fly a ship through the big New Order vessel?, try leading with that)(a whole long chase scene? Han Solo can take the Falcon out of hyperspace in the short distance of a moon's atmosphere, just hyperspace in front of them, duh!), etc.etc. -Throwing away stuff that has been built up (who is Snoke and how did he come to power?, who cares?, he's dead already!)(Knights of Ren?, never heard of them)-Pitiful, not menacing villains.  -Squandered opportunities (fight between Fin and Captain Phasma is like 2 seconds, WTF?)(almost no light saber duels).  -Ridiculous retconning (you don't need to train for years to be a Jedi, Rey is a force expert with no training at all)(Yoda can just come along and shoot force lightning?, where was he when Palpatine was trying to kill Luke Skywalker?)(did I mention flying a ship through another vessel? makes it a lot easier to blow up a Death Star). -Forced political rhetoric (we get it, horse racing bad, capitalism bad, so I get my money back, right?). -Contrived, cringe-worthy ""romance"" (I love you and will sacrifice my life for you even though we just met).-Cannon and characters completely inconsistent with previous movies, including the movie to which this is supposedly a sequel.  But the biggest travesty is how they treated Luke Skywalker's character.  He was totally wasted and betrayed.  Also, how pitiful the resistance is; they have accomplished nothing since the first Trilogy and are worse off than ever before. The more I think about it, the angrier I get.  Then to top it off, they harp on this theme of letting go of the past.  Yeah, the past when Star Wars movies where great.  This movie is garbage.AMENDMENT - STRIKE THE LAST JEDI FROM STAR WARS CANNON! - I know some of you will dismiss this as pathetic, obsessive, sad, fan-boy wallowing because I didn't get the movie I wanted, but the more I think about it, the more I think I'm right. As I have reflected on the film, my opinion hasn't changed, it has gotten stronger. Every day I scan the new user reviews on metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes and watch the negative reviews pile up, and their beef is the same as mine.  I know there are people who liked this movie. My son liked it, but he is young and didn't grow up watching Star Wars, and he loves Kylo Ren. I've reviewed a bunch of positive user reviews (the critic reviews are utter BS, so I don't concern myself with those). They fall into a few camps: people who didn't grow up watching Star Wars (thus reasonably impressed with a $200M blockbuster), people familiar with Star Wars who don't like it or are board of it, people who grew up with Star Wars but are not fans, apologists (people who love Star Wars and are trying to find a silver lining) and idiots (people who grew up with and liking Star Wars that also like this movie). Most non-apologist reviews usually say something along the lines of ""this movie broke the mold and went in different directions"". Here's the thing… if you want something new, go make something new. I'm not saying make it stale, but there is Star Wars cannon and a Star Wars formula that make Star Wars great (and it includes dog-fights, light sabers, the Force, master/apprentice relationships, light side vs. dark side, awesome villans, and courageous, noble heroes and Jedi Knights; if you don't like it, feel free to enjoy another franchise). This movie is a) garbage by any measure, b) a TERRIBLE Star Wars movie and totally inconstant with canon including the movie to which it is supposed to be a sequel, c) a total FU to Star Wars fans, and d) gives one of the most iconic heroes in cinematic history the worst send-off imaginable. So, I am praying for a miracle. I think everyone who thinks this Star Wars movie sucks, and that we (and Luke) deserve better, boycott Disney products (and I love Disney, so this is extreme for me) until they agree to remake or completely retcon Episode VIII. Also, that director RJ, and all the execs that approved this terrible movie, should never be allowed anywhere near the Star Wars franchise - There, fan-boy rant concluded.",0
39,"Like from the majority of user reviews here about The Last Jedi, I had no choice than to give this 0, and it can't be ever more so box offices said. To make matters worse, when Star Wars first came out May 27th, 1977, George Lucas didn't hoped at all any success for his than-developed films, and yet was that too badly said. I'm sorry, Rian Johnson, and J.J. Adams, but they're all wrong when it expected better, and now operosely wanting to have back Darth Maul. Else, they riot The Disney Company.",0

The were just individuals wandering around the plot points on separate paths. This did not allow you to become emotionally invested with them.3. The plot is haphazard, like pieces of a puzzle scattered all about a table from a 1000 piece puzzle. There were many points where you were saying to yourself, why is this part here? For example, why am I watching an alien horse breakout for 15 minutes?4. Weak bad guy. The first three star wars movies there was a strong bad guy. Darth Vader. This new bad guy? Unsure of himself. Weak. Self doubting. That is really poor for a movie. You want strong opposite polar characters. The bad and the good. Darth Vader and Princess Leia. 5. You can no longer vibe with the old characters they brought back. Its like going to prison for 30 years then coming back home and realizing you dont really know these people anymore. Leia is some old lady no longer with the fiery personality she once had. She doesnt look or act the same. No longer know or recognize her. Luke is now a quitter. Doesnt act like Luke Skywalker. Even tried to murder his apprentice in his sleep. Dies at the end for no reason, almost like he just gave up. Not the Luke I know. And Han just came back for a cameo last movie before he got dispatched. All of them never got back like a family, they were all on their own separate paths. And don't forget the awkward hug between Han and Leia. No romantic long drawn out kiss between them now that they are old, right?6. Same old (general) storyline, poorly rehashed. Hey, didnt the republic win at then end of Star wars 6 in 1983? Once again its the empire or some version of it chasing down a small band of rebels. Already been there, done that.So to recap, this was a jigsaw scattered movie with a weak plot with characters you cant emotionally invest in containing cameos of characters you formerly loved but cannot reconnect with basically redoing a movie plot that was already handed in the first three Star Wars movies. It is quite clear the that man who did the first 6 movies handed it off to someone else and these 2 recent movies are somewhat soulless in comparison, being cranked out by a corporate entity who bought the intellectual property with the motive of profit. Yes, of this writing, the movie made close to 800 million dollars. Which means the bottom line says they are going to make more. However as people clue in that these are not the same movies they used to be, profits will fall.In my personal library I have on DVD on a shelf Star Wars (1977) The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and the Return of the Jedi (1983) along with the next 3 prequels from the early to mid 2000s (Star wars I-III). And as far as I am concerned, that is it. Series completed. These last two movies were like poor fan movies. Yes, this movie blew. I am going to have to cleanse the palate by watching the original Star Wars and forgot I ever saw this.",0
41,"I'm not a bot. I'm not an alt-right troll. I'm not stuck in the past. I'm not against change. I'm just a regular guy that enjoys Star Wars movies. I signed up to Metacritic today because I am amazed at 1) how terrible ""The Last Jedi"" was and 2) how anybody could give this movie a decent score.There are so many many problems with this movie, and these problems are well vetted by other users, so no need to rehash. But there are legitimate reasons to hate this movie well beyond the blindly dismissive buzzwords like ""toxic masculinity"" and ""stubborn fanboys"".I will just give one example of how terrible this movie is. There is one scene in a casino where an alien dressed like Mr. Monopoly Pennybags (monocle and tuxedo) tries putting coins in BB-8, mistaking the droid to be a slot machine. Later in the movie, BB-8 fires these coins and kills stormtroopers. Let that sink in.I've polled 30+ friends/family/co-workers on this movie. My admittedly informal poll found that those that thought the movie to be terrible were older, male, successful, traditional values, and of higher IQ (not all mutually exclusive). Anybody that was a big fan of the original trilogy categorically loathed the movie. Those that loved the movie (I found very few) were typically children and younger adult females.If you loved the movie, I'm very happy for you. In fact, I'm jealous. But just know the way in which you are entertained is very different than the way in which I am entertained. Disney horrifically changed the tonality and subsequent audience for these films. They clearly pivoted the brand. I think I speak for many people given the negative user scores and quickly eroding gross receipts.To that point, sadly I will not be going to Solo or Episode IX on opening weekend as I typically do. I may not go at all. I'll wait for the reviews first. This movie was so bad that it made me stop caring about Star Wars.",0
42,"Horrible, awfully Disappointing, dumb, stupid. They just slapped and took a dump on every fan from the Original, there's a New Force now and whatever you thought before just forget about it. Rian Johnson just killed Star Wars, It will be a box office hit because everyone will want to see it, but It will not be Iconic nor Memorable.",0

45,"I had to sign up just to add my disgust of this movie with the thousands of others listed. The basic lack of physics understanding, massive plot and logic holes, and terrible characterizations are just a few of the reasons this was so horrible. They trashed the character of Luke, space Leia was absolutely ridiculous. The thirty minutes used for the stupid subplot on casino planet could have been well used to explain all the answers to the questions posed in EP 7. I'm really hoping box office will plummet so they know what an incredible disservice they did to fans.Only putting two instead of zero so it counts.",0
46,"I went back and watched the prequels just to make sure, and yes this is the worst Star Wars movie ever made.",0
47,"This movie is a horrible mess even without mentioning Star Wars: bad pace, plot holes, childish dialogue, forced opinions, and total lack of story consistency as a sequel. Adding Star Wars elements only makes it even more worthless, since it does not respect existing Star Wars universe at all. It feels like Rian Johnson is simply making a movie he wants with the skin of Star Wars.",0
48,"Bad Characters.Bad Writing.Bad Storytelling, a mish mash of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with a terribly copied and unconvincing version of Battlestar Galactica running as it's main theme. The slowest chase scene in the history of cinema.Lots of bait and switch for the sake of being unexpected, is it snow? no it's salt.Bad Continuity.Lots of plotholes and conveniences.Not even a lightsaber duel and what we do get is terribly choreographed and looks like a battle with Kylie Minogue's backing dancers.The worst Star Wars movie in existence.",0

50,Star Wars is dead to me.... this is such a slap in the face of all the story lines set up by JJ and characters built over 40 years....a Star Wars with no light saber battle? Killing off the bad guy with no story? What they did to Luke is indescribable we wait 40 years and you give us this BS story Luke was never coward but that what you make of him? You could have sent him off dying in an epic duel with Kylo. Screw you Rian and Disney....Lea floating through space? Wow just wow....oh now you can weaponize a space craft and sucide? Why didn’t they just do that to all the Death Stars before it? Duh...you can’t just add something so crazy 8 films in. What a shame... this should have been epic. I don’t plan on giving another dollar to Disney...,0
51,"Pésima, la segunda parte de una trilogía que esta destruyendo todo el espíritu de Star Wars.",0
52,"TLJ is a terrible movie with more plot holes than the Empire has Tie Fighters.  I wouldn't really care, except the way Rian Johnson made Luke Skywalker into the Larry David of Jedi Masters was ridiculous.  No way Luke ended up a grumpy old man just waiting around by himself doing nothing.  No way he disrespects the Skywalker light saber by throwing it over his shoulder.  No way he gets his ass kicked by Mary Sue Rey who is perfect in every way, but has no training whatsoever.  Think about how lame The Empire Strikes Back would have been if Luke already was the greatest warrior in the galaxy from the beginning and could kick Obi Wan's and Darth Vader's ass without having to go through the trials and events that eventually made him stronger, made him a Jedi.  I will never watch another Star Wars movie after this CF.",0
53,"Es increible como los criticos pueden colocarle calificaciones de 100 en este sitio. La película aunque tiene lindos planos, es una mala película. Esta llena de agujeros argumentales. Se llama EPISODIO 8 precisamente porque es una saga. Y esta escrita como si todo lo anterior no importara; crea sus propias reglas y solo utiliza los nombres de los personajes como pretexto para desarrollar su propia historia. Super inconsistente. Terriblemente escrita. Incluso envía mensajes politicos y la diversidad como ejes argumentales. Fuera de lugar. Absurdo.Es probable que la saga no se recupere de este absurdo intento por ganar dinero creando una expansión del universo Star Wars sin reglas, sin un eje de personajes, en donde el siguiente director pueda hacer lo que le de la gana.Star Wars se intenta vender solo como una marca, donde el contenido puede ser cualquier cosa en el espacio. Terrible.",0
54,"This movie was a disaster and I would've walked out if not watching with family from out of town.The plot was again crap, following in the footsteps of Episode VII, whose plot was essentially transporting a floppy disk across the galaxy in the age of email and cloud storage (physically transporting the ""space map"" when instantaneous intergalactic communication is demonstrated multiple times).  In this movie, the crucial plot point that the First Order can track ships in hyperspace gets a 30 second, nonsensical expostion dump from a character who was blatantly shoehorned into the script to market to a certain demographic.  Then the arbitrary and lame plot point that the Resistance ships are running out of fuel becomes the central source of tension, despite fuel having never been mentioned as a constraint in any of the SEVEN PRECEDING MOVIES.  At a crucial point, Snoke's ship is destroyed by pointing a ship at it, then engaging hyperdrive to punch a hole through it.  Apparently the Resistance and First Order at the worst tacticians in the galaxy, because their giant fleets could be rendered moot simply by strapping a hyperdrive on an asteroid.Star Wars movies have worked because of the great planetary settings.  This movie was set in featureless intergalactic space for most of the movie.  The only planets of note before the final 30 minutes of the movie are completely unaffected by the conflict between the First Order and Resistance.  In fact, the one planet that occupies most of the middle of the movie has war profiteers blatantly selling to both sides of the conflict.  In trying to make a lame political point, the writers just made the First Order/Resistance struggle look inconsequential to the larger happenings of the galaxy.The characters sucked.  John Boyega is basically a placeholder for most of the movie who passively does nothing as events happen around him.  His Asian girl companion was, as mentioned before, obviously shoehorned into the script to appeal to a demographic.  Snoke is killed off without any backstory whatsoever.  Daisy continues to be all powerful without any preceding struggle.  Nuff said regarding Luke Skywalker by Mark Hamill, and kudos to him for having the balls to say it.I could go on, but really all that needs to be said is this is the last Star Wars movie I'll ever watch.",0
55,"The Last Jedi reminds me alot of Episode 6. There is greatness as in the Luke and Vader confrontation, but also many glaring problems like an unfocused narrative, Ewoks, Boba Fett and at parts very clunky dialoge.The Last Jedi has a great dynamic between Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren. But it also has glaring problems like an overly long story where everything feels underdeveloped with glaring plotholes, characters acting completely out of character (Luke) and adding pointless new characters and subplots. Instead of focussing on the exciting parts (Reys training) we constantly cut to the mildly interesting escape attempt of Leias fleet and an attrociously bad side story with Finn and some uninteresting side characters.Also the movie got really disneyfied with weak attempts at silly Marvel-style humour and a bunch of useless stuff they shoved in to sell toys and appeal to kids (like alien birds and foxes and a bunch of crap on a casino planet).Really disappointing that The Last Jedi has much more in common with Episode 6 and the prequels rather than Episode 5 or something new.I really hope they will deliver a more focused story and make more use of Rey and Kylo in Episode 9, cause that's what people actually want to see",0
56,"This was the single worst movie that I have ever had the displeasure of seeing in a theater. I've never actually considered leaving a cinema before in my life. The reasons for which this movie is just horrible range from big picture to nitty gritty, from personal opinions to objectively bad decisions. I'll lay it out as such.Objectively bad:- Fin and Rose's plot takes up half of the movie and accomplishes absolutely nothing.- General Gender Studies's plan to escape the ship doesn't make any sense: ""We're just going to abandon ship in these transports and hope that the enemy - who has surrounded us and is watching our every move - doesn't notice dozens of ships leaving out of the hangar.""- Fin actually tries to make himself useful near the end in what was about to probably be the best scene in the movie but Rose ruins it because ""MUH LOVE INTEREST"" or some such crap.Personal Opinion:- Awful unfunny middle-school humor such as Poe's prank call in the beginning scene- Movie is saturated with jokes that don't ever allow us to take it seriously. For example, when Luke asks Rey where she is from and Rey says she's from nowhere, this is in the middle of an important conversation but Luke kills the mood with a poorly timed joke about Jakku really being nowhere.- There was no reason for Admiral Tumblr to hide her plan to her staff. It's clear that they just did this so that Poe would mutiny and so that they could use the moment to talk about ""toxic masculinity"" since that's what Poe's character has been reduced to in this movie.- Terrible acting overall. The characters speak like children. Remember in the casino scene when Fin is positively GAWWKING at the glamour of the place and can't even contain himself because apparently he's as excitable as a puppy on steroids? And when he and Rose find the generic master hacker they literally stop and stare and exclaim out loud ""There he is! The master hacker!"" Didn't anyone ever teach these idiots not to scream their intentions out loud?- Goddamn SUPER LEIA Nitty Gritty:- World War 2 style gravity bomb bays in SPACE- Multiple times where a ship is exposed to the vacuum of space without there being a forceful depressurization (leia coming back onto the ship, the last bomber in the opening scene literally having holes in it, the hangar of Snoke's ship still having air in it after getting shredded through by the Resistance flagship)-Rose's awful quote after ""saving"" Fin is objectively incorrect and stupid.The only reason I give this movie a 2 rather than a 0 is because of a couple select moments which are good. I enjoyed Luke's force apparition near the end and I thought it was cool when Vice Admiral Vag went full 9/11 on Snoke's ship. That said I would have preferred if Luke had actually been at his death in person, and I think it would have been better if it was Admiral Ackbar who went ""Allahu Ackbar!"" rather than Field Marshall Feminist but whatever at least those moments were still cool.",0
57,This movie was basically a middle finger to fans. It deconstructed Star Wars in a way that mocked fans and their expectations. Maybe that's why critics liked it?,0
58,"I think the theme of this movie is ""Kill the Past"" which I think it did effectively. At first I thought it was okay but if I'm being honest this is just a bad movie. It will never be what I want it to be--which is fine. It is fine if Disney wants to take the franchise in this direction but I will step out the side door. Good luck.",0
59,Yeah it's just disneyfied star wars... it goes from serious to humor in an instant the whole subplot with Fin and Rose is pointless and if it was removed nothing would change. J.J Abrams hit a home run and Johnson forgot to run,0
60,"The guy who directed this thing killed the whole Star Wars saga in one movie. And it doesn't seems lack of warning, since Hamill himself tryied to tell the director he might be in (completely) wrong way. At least I will save my money never buying Star Wars products again.",0
61,"I generally refrain from posting reviews, but after repeatedly hearing claims that the only critics of this movie were ""russian bots"" or ""fanatic fanboys"", I was compelled to make an account and post my review.Where to start?The single greatest problem with The Last Jedi is the writing. From the messy plot, to the egregious oversights and contradictions, to the absurd, repetitive dialogue (""Godspeed"" and ""page-turner"" is all I'll say); the script of The Last Jedi stymies the movie to such a degree that even if everything else about it were great, it still wouldn't be a good movie.But everything else isn't great. The lead actors are wooden and uninspired (with the exception of Mr. Driver, a lone bright spot. Fisher, Serkis, and Hamill were fine too, but alas this isn't their movie), though to be fair they aren't given much to work with. There's a plethora of 'jokes', which isn't inherently problematic, until you begin to realize they're only there to keep you from falling asleep. With every change of scenery there's a new ""animal"" to meet, and the movie takes extra care to ensure we get a lengthy, zoomed-in shot of each one's cute, pouting face (Don't worry if you didn't see them all, numerous toy versions will be available at your nearest retailer).Some of scenes are carbon-copies of those found in previous Star Wars iterations (Hoth ""Salt Edition""), others look like they were plucked right out of an anime strip (Snoke's Big Send-Off). On the flipside, we do get to meet some new characters. There's Benicio Del Toro's DJ, a hacker/thief who is perpetually on the verge of having a seizure, Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico (A play to overseas audiences in Asia? Or a sneaky way to further marginalize Finn's character? We'll never know), and finally Laura Dern's dear Admiral Holdo, a stoic, purple-haired rebel commander who just barely manages to lose out on the coveted ""Worst Battle Tactician of 2017 Award"" to General Hux and the entirety of the First Order military command (Self-sacrifice isn't heartfelt unless you let half of your forces die needlessly beforehand. And where are the TIE fighters?)Now, in fairness, Rian Johnson does move the franchise forward quite a bit. We learn that there's much more to the Force than previously thought:1. You can facetime your frenemies.2. Force-ghosts are a thing (those silly Jedi in the past only used Holograms)3. Remote light-saber activation (makes you wonder why we keep seeing all of this 'dueling' nonsense)4. Out of oxygen? Never fear, the force-float is here!We learn there are Space casinos where everyone dresses...wait for it...exactly like they do on Earth casinos! And apparently fuel is now a big deal, although sending out your smaller ships to collect some isn't allowed for some reason. Animal cruelty is BAD (but the planetary-genocides commited by the First Order in The Force Awakens have become a thing of the past. After all, a week is a long time to remember such trivialities).So yeah, that's the jist. Some people may complain about things like Luke's behavioral changes, or Snoke's unspoken backstory, or Rey's 'grounded' parents, but those things aren't important. What's important is you go into this movie without clearly formed expectations, or a clearly functioning brain for that matter. I recommend copious amounts of your favorite drug or intoxicant of choice, so you can watch the lovely special effects without wondering why the First Order ships don't use hyperspeed to overtake the fleeing rebel fleet, or why the rebel fighters are lining up to face the oncoming AT-ATs in trenches a la WWI and not hiding behind their blast-proof door.If you don't, you may just start wishing for everyone to kamikaze each other.",0
62,Absolutely terrible. I'm giving 3 just for special effects and music. But this has no Star Wars soul.,0
63,No longer a Star Wars Fan. Rushed storytelling. No character development. Horrible Script. Bad Plot. This movie tried to rush the saga by killing off the last of the characters from the original movies. I never had much interest in the Solo movie and after this don't really care to see any others in the saga. So this is probably it for me and Star Wars.,0
64,"In short this is a really difficult movie to review. There is so much wrong with this that as you try to lay out the criticisms in some sort of coherent fashion you are bombarded with memory after memory of this mess of a film.It starts fairly well, the iconic scrolling text and opening are solid despite some daft spaceship designs (bombers... in space? And it ends as well as you might expect) the brief space battle looks good but it too heavy handed and sets the tone for this movie; it wants to be emotionally hard-hitting and slapstick without succeeding at either.The comedy elements: often mentioned but I found them so unobtrusive or ineffective that I won't mention them further beyond that they were often at the expense of the audience.The story premise is a fairly good one and could have worked (plucky rebellion are being pursued by a vastly superior First Order force and need to think their way out of almost certain defeat) but every arc and subplot is self-defeating at best or outright awful at worst. The Force Awakens did not do a very good job of uniting the characters it hopes to build this franchise upon and compounds the problem by including more characters that are even less fleshed out - if asked I could not describe Finn, Rey or even Poe except in the vaguest of terms - which leads to the bigger problem.What the hell is going on? Is there a Republic, who are the Resistance, what situation are they in, what planets got blown up and what was actually lost by the First Order's attack? The world building is non-existent, I have -no- idea what the Resistance is what it's fighting for what challenges it faces and I cynically expect it is kept nebulous to allow lazy writers to shoe-horn in details as it needs them down the line.I had expected to enjoy this, and I could not believe how embarrassed I was to be sitting there watching this film. I spent the majority of the excessive runtime staring at the screen incredulously; the choices and direction this film takes are breathtakingly stupid in places (Space Leia anyone?) and seriously detract from the story which begins disintegrating almost immediately after the opening scene. During the screening I was in there were regularly groans and whispered complaints, even strangers behind me were asking me if I were seeing what they were, and there was not a single laugh to be had. The Force Awakens for all its faults was still enjoyable, and the audience was right there carried along (admittedly once you left the theater or attempted a second viewing the spell was broken) but this was one of the least joyful experiences I have ever had watching a film.Everyone outside of Luke Skywalker (with some uneasy character development) was a single note character, they were whatever emotion they happened to be portraying at that moment. From the writing and narrative it was impossible to determine what any of these characters principles or motivations are. Granted, Kylo and Rey get some intrigue that worked better than I expected only for it to unravel in an utterly pointless confrontation towards the end of the movie - and by then I just wanted it to end.There is so much that did not work in this film and it is bitterly disappointing. I don't think I'll be watching the next one, and I'm not someone who would support boycotts or petitions for a remake or any of that silliness, I have just seen all I need to see and don't want any more.TL;DR Force Awakens was fun whilst I was watching it, but does not hold up to further viewings.Rogue One was watchable but utterly meh and suffered from some casting issues.The Last Jedi was badly thought through, regularly undermined itself and uncomfortable viewing. There are a few good moments peppered throughout, but they are destroyed by terrible writing and confounding plot choices. Not that the Last Jedi is hard to follow, you just find yourself wondering about how these ideas made it to the screen. It reminds you it is a movie at every turn, and a very bad one at that.",0
65,"Conspiracy theory at the full swing. Metacritic and rotten tomato have abysmal user score but IMDB has it at 7.6 . Most of the positive review is a generic review ( Brillant , best, Masterpiece) . It seems to me that BOT is doing it. My guess is that after Disneys got the first view of the theatrical release. They flex all the muscle that they can to buy out the critics and super reviewer. This movie can not be failed period.",0

67,"This is not the Star Wars Trilogy you're looking for. Sadly, it is time to move on.",0
68,"The film did not subvert my expectations, I had no preconceived ideas. I wanted to be surprised and shocked (in a good way) after the nostalgia hash of TFA. But instead it made me feel angry from the start, as it became clear that this movie had thrown out TFA. I get that Rian Johnson didn't want to just blindly follow Abram's mystery boxes. But it felt like he'd only read a a two page summary of TFA and didn't care about creating a trilogy. The plots were also disappointing. The theme was failure, I got that quickly,but the film was a failure. Seriously, after the movie in just walked out with my nephew and we both just said we didn't want to talk about it. Everyone I've spoken to who saw it thought it played for cheap laughs and made fun of characters who deserved better plotlines and character arcs. There were some amazing things about this movie. But it fundamentally failed to engage me or excite me. I don't want to see the next movie. I don't want to watch more meaningless pap which critics have portrayed as the best ever Star Wars ever. I won't watch the next one.",0
69,"Other than a few brilliant visuals, there's really nothing redeeming about this film. There are really too many problems with the movie to list them and it should be dropped from the canon. There's nothing to see here. Move along.",0
70,"The Last Jedi is hot diarrhea—anticipated with dread, but a great relief to have it over with. It feels like Star Wars through several degrees of adaptation. Not just a sequel of a sequel of a sequel, but like a live-action adaptation of a cartoon based on a line of toys based on a sequel of a sequel of a sequel. There were some inventive moments which were all the more frustrating for their wasted potential. Plot and character motivation were as senseless as The Force Awakens, and none of the questions (or plot holes) raised in that movie were answered. And was it not enough to have Luke spurt green seacow milk into his beard—must the udders also look like genitalia?",0
71,"This latest cinematic installment, and I say installment rather than addition as addition would suggest consideration of and positive effect upon all or any of the preceding material, to one of the most beloved stories in the world has, with all its promotion, anticipation and critics reception, achieved the incredible feat of creating something of an ""emperors new clothes syndrome"" across the world.Rian Johnson, the tailor of this empty garb, has some how been able to convince Disney and those we trusted to parade and praise the work he has done, whilst the public and many of the eager fans clap happily along and cheer for what an amazing spectacle he has created. Then there are those like myself, akin to the little boy staring at the emperors flaccid member in confusion and shock, whom raise their hands and point out the fact that the entire experience is an embarrassment.Regardless of poor writing, story structure, bad and misplaced humor, sloppy editing, terrible plot devices, blatant marketing and money making ""creative"" decisions, zero character development and shoddy or hammed up acting by many, I am not sure why those at Disney responsible for the Star Wars property would chose to stray so much from the core material for these chapters in the saga. At their heart these stories are about the legacy of the Skywalker's, even the original title of episode 4 was ""Adventures of Luke Starkiller, As Taken From the Journal of the Whills, Saga 1: The Star Wars"". So, in my opinion, The last Jedi and then chapter 10 should have at least concluded that arc properly. With the choice for Luke in this movie and the path of Ben Solo, the legacy of the Skywalker lineage seems to have been cast aside in order the start crafting the next chapter for a new generation. The expansion of the Star Wars universe is something everyone wants, be it the fans or those with financial interests, and the creation of material to introduce people to new characters and worlds is wonderful, but not at the expense of the previous material and hard work done by thousands of people over decades.With the originals, George Lucas aimed to create something ground-breaking and exciting. He used his knowledge of previous cinema storytelling and strong narrative to fashion a new way to tell the same type of story. He wanted to use the latest techniques to craft something fresh but recounted the same kind of messaging his inspiration told or he himself believed. Even in the prequels, be it you love or hate them, were efforts in the same vein yet, unlike Johnson, George Lucas managed to maintain the heart of the universe he created whilst telling the story he wanted.What Disney and Johnson have done with the Last Jedi is disappointing, with no respect towards the original material or consideration towards the correct tonality for the genre let alone Star Wars itself, something that for all peoples gripes with TFA, the entire team got right and were respectful of. With TLJ they have seemingly tried to make Star Wars more relevant by changing the tone of the film, through choices of language, acting, character prioritization and constantly hammering the message that the old is to be brushed away and only the now, new and future is worth considering. Such a message might sound like a rallying call towards progress and one which may resonate with the ever increasingly impatient youth of each generation, but is one that also has the frighteningly narrow minded connotation that the past should be forgotten, that the old and more experienced are best not considered, that the mistakes previous generations made are better left behind because they were after all mistakes. Yet in doing so Johnson's message forgets the fact that with experience comes learning's that would die as result. The scene with Yoda in the film momentarily suggests that Johnson may begin to craft a worthwhile message but unfortunately he chooses to be ""unexpected"" and we are not provided with this important lesson as we see Yoda burn the books he considers useless. We see many of these types of lessons clumsily delivered in the film which many chose to defend as brave and bold choices or justify as holding deeper meaning, yet for all the arguing it can not be denied that they are inherently non Star Wars in both content and delivery.All in all, there is a great deal more to say on the Last Jedi, be it superficially or in digging deeper and searching for answers, comparisons, metaphors, connotations or messages, but my experience with this film is that it is the only Star Wars film I have not enjoyed watching and that was from the very first scene of poor humor between Poe and Hux, right through Luke's space walrus molestation, past the ill conceived side quest & beyond the character assassination of a childhood cinematic hero. I will not be interested in seeing the final chapter of the Skywalker arc and will take solace in the words of Mark Hamill...its just a movie",0
72,"Gutted, this film was awful - no wonder Disney forced US cinemas to show it on their largest screens for a minimum of 4 weeks. From the opening 5 mins this film was a farce, at first I thought I was watching a sequel to spaceballs with the 'your mum' jokes and a certain scene which looked like a cross between Mary Poppins and superman but then the jokes come to an aprupt stop when you see what they do to Luke, totally betraying his character.",0
73,"There are spoilers in this review.TLJ was the single biggest motion picture letdown of my life. Disney should have released this parody on April 1st. There are over 82,000 signatures on a change.org petition to remove TLJ from Star Wars canon as of 1/6/18. Disney won't do that, but that there is a petition at all conveys that something is wrong here. And something is. Aside from being a bad movie, TLJ refutes the values of Star Wars. Disney pretends complaints show how sophisticated TLJ is. Those dumb fans, they don't 'get it'. But last I checked, thin characterization, using characters simply as vehicles for action, inconsistency within a trilogy, and thinking ships need fuel in space to keep moving, were not signs of sophistication. The discrepancy with pro reviews may be explained by the fact that pros' publications receive Disney advertising dollars. I give TLJ a 1 for the actors. They are not to blame. But the writing is ruinous to the entire franchise.First, too much CGI, visually messy scenes. The movie had no idea what to do with Finn. The casino planet scene was filler. And how is it possible, after destroying Starkiller Base, that massive weapon, that the First Order seconds later has all but vanquished the Resistance? There's no gap between VII and VIII. (There was a gap of 3 years between ANH and The Empire Strikes Back.) So why is the First Order in such top form after such a huge defeat at the hands of the Resistance (now inexplicably called the Rebellion). It's like the Resistance's accomplishments of the last movie accomplished nothing at all. By the way, I'm not a bot. And I'm also not alt right or a Trump supporter. I'm white, married to a brown woman of African descent (she was not born in the USA and her first language is not English). We have a young daughter who loves BB8, R2D2, Rey, and light sabers. But that's based on TFA. We wouldn't allow her to watch TLJ any more than we'd let her watch Sesame Street themed porn.The biggest problems with TLJ were Luke's characterization, the lack of characterization of Rey, and the anti-Star Wars theme which rendered this not Star Wars, but Mirror Universe Star Wars, or Bizarro Star Wars.Regarding Rey, if you think her TFA ""vision"" had meaning, or there was any rhyme or reason to Maz Kanata saying to Rey, ""Now it calls out to you"" (referring to Darth Vader's and Luke's light saber)  you will be disappointed. IT IS ALL DROPPED. The identity of Rey's parents might have helped explain why she's so great at everything, but this was squandered. This is not a sequel, it is not act 2, it has almost nothing to do with TFA. Ep 2 continued Ep 1; 5 continued 4; but Ep 8 spits on Ep 7. The idea that Rey could beat Luke (trained by two Jedi masters) in a fight is ludicrous to the Nth degree, especially when you consider how much training Luke (not to mention Anakin) required. Luke lost his hand to Vader because, while he trained under Yoda, he left too early. He paid a price. Rey pays no price. She's perfect without education beyond a two minute meditation session. A protagonist so strong is not credible, and is boring because nothing can threaten her, thus no suspense. Johnson knows this; it's why the last act shifts and all but abandons Rey; there is no peril for Rey now that she's superwoman. He's left JJ with nothing for Ep. IX. As for Luke, this was anti-Luke. Luke was aware Vader had killed millions, yet in Return of the Jedi, refused to kill him. So Luke's instinct to kill Ben in TLJ wasn't in keeping with Luke's character. And would Luke abandon his cause, and his SISTER, for decades, to hide out? No. But if so, why did he leave a clue to his whereabouts for people to follow? He was searching for the first jedi temple why? No reason at all. Rian Johnson wasn't consistent with the original films or Force Awakens. TLJ is hermetically sealed off from and doesn't fit with the saga. It takes place in a separate universe. The statements throughout TLJ that heroism and sacrifice are not positive values, that there is no difference between good and bad, are anti-Star Wars. They also deny TFA, not to mention the intense sacrifices of Rogue One that made everyone's lives in TLJ possible. Bottom line. TLJ is creepy and nihilistic.Being pro-women is great. But Poe sexist, when Mon Mothma led the Rebels for 4 movies and then Leia led them, is absurd. Making every man bumbling, evil, or arrogant is hard to miss. You don't have to tear men down in order to build women up. That is just what feminists are always publicly claiming they are NOT about. Finally, the dialogue has no personality. In TFA when Finn helps Rey on the Falcon just before Han shows up - has more personality than in all of TLJ. I just bought Thrawn book 1 for an alternative post-Episode VI saga that makes sense. Disney has the legal right to make canon but that's an empty right when there is no spirit behind it. I'll decide what I consider canon.",0
74,"I'm just a regular SW fan, not a Bot, nor an Alt-Right conspirator. The Last Jedi is a hot steaming pile of crap. Unlikeable new characters, plot holes the size of the Death Star and a meandering half baked script is what sealed the fate for this potentially great film. JJ had set up RJ for an easy lay up/slam dunk after the TFA, and yet RJ somehow manages to alienate half the SW fanbase and make a completely non sensical SW film. Director RJ has managed to defile 40 years of Star Wars history and traditions in one fell swoop. Not even the stellar performance of Adam Driver can save this film from the garbage compactor. The Last Jedi is akin to the Phasma character, a lot of hype, with very little payoff and ultimately hugely disappointing and disrespectful. This movie has no respect for what came before it, and ""That is why it failed."" - Yoda",0
75,"If anything, the quality of the script gives hope to potential screenwriters that their worst ideas could be optioned by Disney due to their zero quality control process.It is a sad realisation that the Star Wars universe is probably dead now, but alas, will all these negative feelings be forgotten when Disney brings out the next Star Wars story?Disney does not care how you feel about it, because they know it will make money regardless. They know (as i've read in some fans negative reviews) that people will go and $ee it again ""Just to be sure it was as bad as I thought the first time"". They know there are enough dedicated individuals who will find substance in a film where there really is none. They know people will still go and pay to see it, even you reading this now who is baffled at how The Last Jedi could have been made with such a garbage script.I am truly amazed how fans justify the films shortcomings. I am in awe really and find their interpretations fascinating, though I'm mostly disappointed and sad they they have to stretch their opinions to make sense of this poorly written script. I'm disappointed because it shows that people don't care much about story or logic and can easily fool themselves in to thinking things that don't make sense, do. And that is really what it is. Disney has tapped in to that inherent human flaw of hoping for the best, and giving the benefit of the doubt for beloved stories in order to make money. That, if anything, is what should be admired about this whole sloppy mess. They've adopted the Star Wars religion, and be sure they know what they've got here, and will keep on producing awful stories in this genre because people will pay money and go see it regardless.As far as I'm concerned, my interest in the Star Wars universe is done and dead. I won't be fooled in to paying to see any more Disney Star Wars, other negative reviewers here should pledge the same. There are better things out there and we still have the original (unedited or even the adywan edit) trilogy in our home collection which they can't make any money from. May the original trilogy Force be with us. 1 star for the special effects.",0
76,"This movie left me empty. It was way too much like Empire Strikes Back, but in such a bad way because it was so disconnected and implausible. So many lines said by characters made no sense...a disconnected senseless movie. I have never watched a movie and thought, what are they doing, why did they say that? And if the director could please tell me how bombs fall in the near vacuum of space? They really need to teach more science in schools. How about no bombs at all. I thought Star Wars was about laser beams and light sabers. I could go on, but why bother, let's just join the critics, clap our hands, and drool at all the fancy cinematography. Note, I am an old Star Wars fan, but have no desire to watch any more new movies. Excuse me, I need to leave and attempt to empty my memory of this ridiculous movie.",0
77,"***SPOILERS***Luke Skywalker did not act like himself at all. The Jedi who once stood up against the 2 most powerful Sith in the galaxy, and sensed the good in one of the most evil Sith Darth Vader was so scared of what Kylo Ren might do he tried to kill him. Luke was too scared to confront the first order so he projected himself over there instead. Leia somehow with little force training used the force to survive in space after surviving and explosion to fly to the next ship. The new character Rose was a waste of screen time and her subplot with Finn was too long and did little if anything to add to the story.",0
78,"If you can classify yourself being between a hardcore Star Wars fan and just somebody looking for a couple of hours of entertainment with a free cinema ticket, you should steer clear of this movie. I will not bore you with painful details that have ruined my expectations. PLOTThe script is in a total disarray. You will see things that make 0 sense and you will struggle to find connecting links between events because of too many plot holes. Bombs ""dropping"" on space, First Order ships have no energy shields (really...?), Leia getting blown up -survives, drags off to outer space -freezes, comes back to life and flies back in THROUGH the energy shield? You will witness characters getting killed such funny and stupid deaths to a point that you'll almost be hearing the Benny Hill soundtrack (Snoke, Phasma?). Also, the majority of one-liners and humorous moments are so cringe-worthy, I am amazed that the people who edited this actually approved it.VISUALS AND SOUNDEffects are probably the only redeeming thing of the movie but also probably the least important. It has a few very well directed scenes and iconic photography, especially with Luke facing the First Order walkers on the salty-surfaced planet. The beloved Star Wars music is sometimes used a bit out of place though.SCRIPT - TIME AND PACINGThis movie is long. And not in an enjoyable way; the first hour, I thought even if I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't have missed a whole lot. Towards the end, I was begging for the movie to wrap stuff up and end because I'd gotten tired of the endless cringe-worthy moments which seem to be increasing in frequency. The pacing of the movie is absolutely horrendous; some storylines take a few hours, others weeks. Some are unclear how much they take(?). This creates a lot of ""WTF"" moments in the audiences' minds as to ""how did this happen?"". Ray seems like she's been training with Luke for weeks but the events with the Resistance look like they last hours/a few days.SCRIPT - ""INNOVATIONS"" AND CHARACTERSIn Force Awakens, we had a lot of new characters introduced, but The Last Jedi, viciously floors literally all of them and the ones that already were there. It introduces more characters who are completely and utterly useless, uninteresting and very flat (I'm looking at you Rose!). Ray's backstory seems destroyed, she's basically a completely uninteresting daughter of scum who sold her off for money. Snoke, one of the most intriguing villains we'll never know what did he do or where did he come from; at least not in a meaningful way. OVERALLThis is a very bad movie. Although the visuals and sound effects are stunning, the movie is a soulless husk. Characters are uninteresting and even look bored, plotlines diverge to paths unknown for too long for no reason, and then drag on some more. Plot holes ruin the continuity of the movie and make the audience wonder ""so what happened now?"". Sense of humour is appalling and completely out of place.",0
79,"No I am not a bot, and no I am not some disgruntled Star Wars fan.  Instead of the media investigating if bots are to blame for low audience ratings, the media should investigate how it was able to garner such high critical praise--strong-arming? bribery?  Because TLJ is a very, very bad film.  And not bad in a way that can be blamed on one person's tastes compared to another, but bad in ways that are otherwise undeniable in the eyes of critics: the writing is horrendous; the plot is all over the map but somehow ends with the main characters, as well as the the rebellion and empire, in exactly the same place as the beginning of the movie--i.e. in 2.5 hours of plot hole after plot hole,  NOTHING HAPPENS other than setting up for another money-grabbing sequel; all of the major story turns are repeats of the original trilogy; the themes are sophomoric even for Star Wars, especially the whole ""learn from your mistakes and let them go"" bit that Luke, a supposedly enlightened Jedi supremely in touch with the interconnectivity of the universe has to learn from a second-coming of Yoda.  Viewers can argue about the casting (horrible), the camp humor (bad), and Star Wars nerds can argue about the director taking the franchise in a different direction, but there is no way that critics can sincerely praise this film; something else is going on.",0
80,"To say this movie was a disappointment is a great understatement. My disappointment is not based on any ""betrayal"" of what Star Wars is or is ""supposed to be""; any real story teller and artist ought to be able to explore their imagination and give a new interpretation or spin on things. My disappointment is in the fact that this film is quite simply a poorly made film. It lacks almost any sense of narrative integrity- cause and effect relationships are overlooked in favor of action sequences, that while visually beautiful, have absolutely no sense of gravitas. Basic concepts such as the connection of motivation and action have no place in this film. In the end it feels like only so much fluff and dazzle. I can accept one, two or even three jumps in logic or plot holes, but this film takes it to a new level. The narrative collapses repeatedly. To find myself not caring at all about what happens to characters that I have loved since childhood only underlines the truly monumental lack of care and haphazard way this film was made. I cannot imagine a great film maker such as Spielberg or even Peter Jackson making something as poorly constructed as The Last Jedi. I am sad to say I won't be watching another film directed by Johnson. I am baffled by the critics who have praised his work- and can only think that they only hold this film to the standards that they would hold a commercial or a shoddily written Saturday morning cartoon. To me the worst Star Wars film ever made and enough to evaporate any interest in following the franchise any further. It feels like a great loss- but it's Disney's right to do whatever they want. I just don't have to follow.",0
81,"This movie will end the love of the franchise for a lot of people and will eventually put fans of the series to the test, whether or not they will go see or buy anything that has the Star Wars logo printed on it.  As a fan of the movies, books, comics, etc. this film got a lot of things very wrong.  Now, fans are left wondering how the force or physics in the galaxy far, far away are even supposed to work.  The Last Jedi destroys the hero of the series, makes the end result of episode 7 seem pointless, and manages to really back the franchise in a corner by implying that there will be no more Jedi, which is a major drawback to the future of interest in this galaxy.  At first watch I think people will be entertained by this film but not long after the show is over it is far too easy to find glaring mistakes in the plot that are infuriating to any hardcore fan.",0
82,"Yes, it's as bad as you've heard. Other reviewers have deconstructed the film and highlighted its many flaws so I won't retread the same ground. But perhaps I can add this: More than any of The Last Jedi's structural flaws - e.g., narrative and character dissonance - to me the most heartbreaking aspect of the film is its underlying cynicism, both in its worldview and its message.It tells us there is no such thing as good and evil (it's all just shades of grey) and that those who seek moral clarity are on the wrong side of history.It tells us that ""hero worship"" is wrong and should be avoided because our heroes (like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo before him) will inevitably fail and let us down.It tells us that the past needs to be 'killed' because it's useless, serving no purpose other than as a lesson of what not to do.It tells us that anyone can achieve greatness, not through hard work, effort and sacrifice but through rejecting one's culture, traditions, institutions, and heritage.It tells us that laying down one's life for another is wrong because that's tantamount to hate and killing who and what one loves.It tells us that we can learn absolutely nothing about our identity from our parents, even though our parents conceived, nurtured and brought us into the world. I can't think of a message more antithetical to ""Star Wars"" - the Star Wars George Lucas created all those years ago (post-Kennedy, post-Vietnam, post-Watergate) than that.And it just breaks my heart.",0
83,"TLJ was a retelling of ESB and RotJ, how are you defending this movie. Some of the acts are straight copies of these movies, Crait = Hoth and Snoke Throne room exact copy of Emperor even some of the dialog straight copy. Vader killed the Emperor, and vader wannabe Kylo kills Snoke. Are you seeing the trolling yet. The main act of ESB is about the falcon not being able to go light speed to get away from the Empire's fleet, TLJ main act is about the good guys not able to get away from the Empire by going light speed. This movie also had Dagobah with yoda and the jedi leaving while not being fully trained in the force just like Luke in ESB.TLJ even has Bespin in it. Remember ESB has the heroes trying to find the help of a shady/scoundrel character who may or may not help them and ends up betraying them to the Empire. DJ = Lando.The audience needs to take your Star Wars beer googles off and realize TLJ is a straight copy of ESB and RotJ with Act 1 Hoth being moved to Act 5. They even go as far to troll the fan boys by ""It's Salt"" to point out its not snow and it's your fan boy tears at the end of this parody.It was nothing more then a SWJ propaganda movie. Every male in this movie was made to look like an idiot and needed a strong women character to tell them what to do. This movie contradicts itself ""you must kill the past"" nonsense. If you must kill the past then why is everything about this movie a straight copy of the OT? Both stories so far are copies, the ships are copies, it has vader/anakin = Kylo Ren, it has emperor = Snoke, it has Luke = Rey, both from a desert planet and come from nothing.The hardcore SW fans need to realize Rian and Kathleen trolled you and made the first 3 movies pointless. The 1000 year prophecy of bringing balance to the force last maybe 30 years and The Empire vs Rebel face-off was meaningless and only to repeat itself 30 years later with a direct retelling.﻿",0
84,"Fails on every front. The rare few frames that are good cannot make up for the 2.5hr snorefest that not only meanders like a herd of cats, but gives the legacy of Stars Wars the finger so often that it feels deliberate. It is an affront to logic & good storytelling. I want my money back.",0
85,"I'm an avid Star Wars fan. I enjoyed The Force Awakens. The Last Jedi, I did not enjoy at all. It was weird, the audience had a good cheer at the opening crawl. Then when the movie ended it was silent. No applause, nothing. I think people left the theater feeling cheated and empty. Some people even laughed at the Leia/Superman scene. I just cringed deeper into my seat. Are we really left with the villains being Kylo and Hux? They aren't even menacing. They are just hollow characters. I just don't feel like this was a good story. I'm not looking forward to the next of Star Wars film, and that is a weird feeling for me to have.",0
86,The plotholes are so massive that you have to pretend you're an idiot to enjoy this film. To make matters worse I genuinely don't care about the characters. Overall the movie just made me angry.,0
87,"Not a Star Wars movie.  Disney/Johnson  completely removed George Lucas.  Regardless of any legitimate criticism of Lucas, his contributions were the DNA of what made Star Wars great fun.  What were those things: structure is serial comic book/science fantasy, had lots of detail around military/robotic/speeder/weapons hardware to geek out with, had heroes and villains that were fun interesting characters, alluded to deep history of the Star Wars universe with the Jedi that kept peace for a thousand generations which gave a mystical feel to the Star Wars lore.  Last Jedi destroyed almost all of that.  It now seems like modern pseudo-intellectual secular humanist anti-dogma dogma with some shallow preachy social commentary tacked on.",0
88,"This flilm is a steaming pile of doody.  Disney is continuing the destruction of the franchise that Lucas started with the prequels.  So much of the film is awkward, nonsense and a waste of time, from both a storytelling perspective and as a viewer.I won't go into details, but the movie awful to the point that I no longer care for Star Wars.  I'm tired of paying money for disappointment.  The writing is main the culprit.  It is just awful.No one that has any influence on the film seems to care about quality.  They are merely making a special effects presentation with Star Wars branding and expect audiences to freely throw their money and praise at it, regardless of content.The theatrical versions of the of the original three films are what made Star Wars great.  Unfortunately, it appears that it never get any better than the rubbish currently on display, due in large part to cult fanboy fanaticism that defends poor stewardship of the universe by Disney, simply because it carries the Star Wars name.",0
89,I can't believe so many critics liked this movie. It is definitely the worst Stars Wars movie ever made. It was so boring at points my brother and his daughter dozed off. Others have stated everything negative so I don't need to repeat the same thing. Disney has destroyed the franchise.,0
90,"Horrendous movie that spits on every fan's face. It destroys everything that has been accomplished in the past movies, even in the force awakens! What were they thinking? Didn't they write the whole trilogy before they started filming it? How amateur is that? Anyway, boring movie, plot holes everywhere, horrendous character development (poor Luke), bad writing, useless plots, bad humoristic tone, lack of tension... I could continue all night but I will stop. This movie doesn'et deserve talking about it. They just destroyed a beloved saga. I won't bother to see the next movie. To me, the star wars saga contains 6 films. No more.",0
91,"I want to emphasize this greatly. I didn't watch a single trailer, or read a single review prior to watching The Last Jedi, and I do **not** mind social advocacy messages in a film. I only heard vague sentiments that critics loved the film, which undeniably excited me, but holy moly, I could not disagree more with the critics reception. First off, many of the interesting plot threads created in the Force Awakens like who are Rey's parents, what happened to Luke Skywalker, the greatly anticipated return of Luke Skywalker to the resistance, and developing Phasma and Snokes into a menacing antagonist are all fumbled here to my great disappointment. To my shock, the director and writers instead chose to pursue new and much less interesting subplots involving Finn, Rose, and how the crew of  the resistance flag ship handles an 18 hour chase sequence when low on fuel. I would strongly discourage anyone other than dedicated fans of the series to see this in theaters and rent this film. It's simply not worth the price of admission.",0

The nature of the spirits of force has been altered, they cease to be beings that could not interact with the physical world in a physical way to the contrary. Instead of giving answers to questions, they have decided to eliminate what generated the unknowns (Sno ke, etc). And they have left for the last film a single confrontation between Kylo and R E Y, which is of little interest anymore. The mystery was in the hands of the supreme leader and he is dead.",0
99,Not worthy of being part of the Star Wars franchise. It's extreme political correctness stripped the characters of their basic humanity. The villain wouldn't scare a 10 year old.,0
100,"Lots of plot holes, lazy writing, rushed post production, slap in the face for SW fans and SW mythos. Also it has really bad SJW vibe. This movie shouldn't be made.",0
101,"A violation of meaningful archetypes, the need for teachers, and the internal struggle against evil and corruption breeds a meaningless, false narrative where a suffering hero re-emerges to transcend to nothingness and a new hero needs no guidance nor explanation. That is not a celebration of gender and diversity but a crude devaluing of femininity to a fantastical, utopian idealization and white males to power-hungry, fearful mongrels. This is no better than a film which objectifies women.Luke 1980: ""I see good in you!"" Luke 2017: ""I must purge the evil in you!"" He spends years in purgatory (a shamanic/Christ/hero idea) but when he re-emmerges he doesn't lead, challenge, teach (yoda), transcend (Obi-wan), or any of it - he just vanishes after performing the most powerful act yet seen in the universe and not even defeating his darkside counter, but just stalls for the saving of some 40 odd people. A weak symbol of white male irrelevance passing away without the transfer of a mantle. Masculinity, especially caucasian masculinity, is portrayed as wholesale bad, incompetent, or weak in the film. This is the opposite of true diversity and modern diversity interventions. The crux of the hero meaning is that women already encapsulate the fullness of the deeper meaning of religion, and that any pull evil has on her is resolved as just curiosity. She is perfect because well, she just IS. She doesn't require teaching or guidance. That's a false, utopian archetype and a betrayal of both genders.That's what this film is - a betrayal.The Hero archetype is only present in Finn, who is on a path to overthrow his former oppressor (this is the only story path which feels correct).",0
102,"I, like a few others on this page, created a Metacritic account just to give this movie a bad review. I am beyond shocked that this movie has gotten such good reviews; I don't think that I have ever disagreed with critics more. The positive reviews are completely wrong on almost every point of praise they make...shockingly so. I genuinely didn't believe in media control until watching this movie and reading the positive reviews. Star Wars ""love"" aside, this movie is just bad on every level and the absolute only logical explanation for the overwhelmingly positive reviews is that Disney bought the reviewers. Again, this movie is bad on every level...there are even some incredibly atrocious special effects in this movie (though the majority of the movie is visually impressive). As I mentioned, I created this account for the sole purpose of giving this movie the bad rating it deserves. I am not going to waste my time getting into the details of everything that is wrong.

109,"I see the media deflecting the criticism of this movie by accusing alt right groups and bots of review spamming the site. I am not a bot and I'm not affilated with any alt right groups. I have been a SW fan my entire life, as many of my fellow fans who were utterly disappointed with the movie. These are all people voicing their opinion, deal with it. Here is mine:What I liked:-Mark Hamill and Adam Driver were amazing.-Many people found that scene ridiculous, but I personally liked Leia using the Force to pull herself back to the ship. It was already established that she was Force sensitive when she sensed Luke in Ep. 5.-The visuals and sounds were good.-Yoda's appearance.-When ""TIE Fighter Attack"" started playing I actually felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie.What I disliked:-The movie opens with a lame ""your mom"" joke.-Poe Dameron sacrifices an entire squad of bombers without any regret because he is the embodiment of ""toxic masculinity"".-After Leia pulls herself back, Poe opens the door to open space, but the people don't get sucked out by the vacuum (Ep. 3 and TCW got this right).-Holdo doesn't tell her plan to Poe so he is forced into making a mistake, which is intended to make the audience think that he's dumb. Thing is, Holdo is at fault here for being a bad leader and not communicating with an established star pilot of the Resistance.-Casino planet was boring and it consisted about Disney (!) saying that capitalism is bad. Rich people=bad, poor people=good.-The movie structure is very similar to Empire Strikes Back, except the battle of Hoth takes place at the end of the movie.-The throne room events are very similar to the one in Return of the Jedi.-Rey, after a couple days of lightsaber training, is able to defeat several of the elite guards. She seems to be just as potent in combat as Kylo Ren, who had been trained as a Jedi/Knight of Ren his entire life. Luke Skywalker in the OT practiced for weeks to be a decent duelist and Force user, while in the Prequels Jedi trained their entire life from a very young age. What I'm saying is: Rey is undeniably a Mary Sue.-Captain Phasma, heralded by the media as ""the first female villain of SW"" (she isn't, Asajj Ventress exists), gets 3 minutes of screen time, getting beaten by Finn. She seems like a running gag from a cartoon at this point.-During the Battle of Crait, Rose stops Finn from saving the Resistance, and then drops the most cringeworthy line of the Star Wars franchise.-Finn and Rose crash land in front of the AT-M6 line, kilometers away from the Resistance base. A few minutes later we see Finn dragging an unconscious Rose back to the base on foot. The First Order showed them mercy and didn't shoot them on the way back, or maybe they missed because Finn was walking so fast.-I personally felt like Rian Johnson's biggest goal with this movie was to bamboozle fans with his pretentious plot twists. It felt a little forced to me because there were just too many.-My biggest issue: The reason I wanted to watch this film was to see what happened to Luke. I felt like his character was mistreated and underused by Rian Johnson just to make way for Rey. Luke in this movie was a grumpy, scared and reluctant old man who had very minimal impact on the story. I wanted to see him get some love, maybe a bit of fan service like the one scene we got with Vader at the end of RO. Instead he shows up at the end of the movie as a distraction, sacrificing himself for the Resistance. But it turns out it wasn't him, he was just showing us a new kickass force power, great! He doesn't need to die! Maybe JJ Abrams can give him some justice in Ep. 9... Aaaaand he dies from exhaustion... Are you serious? RJ did a 180 with his character and then killed him off because people would be more interested in Luke than in Mary Sue. Luke Skywalker had to actually learn how to use the Force and to fight with a lightsaber. We saw his journey from a whiny farm boy to a wise Jedi Knight. What journey did Rey have? Expert pilot, Force user (who can lift a hundred rocks without any proper training) and lightsaber duelist from the beginning. Not Mary Sue btw.-Then at the end of the film we see a child effortlessy using telekinesis to grab a broom. In the OT and prequels, characters needed training in the Force to be able to use these powers. Apparently in the sequels anybody who is Force sensitive can casually use telekinesis, mind tricks etc. This is another way Rian Johnson disregarded the previous lore.This movie left me utterly uninterested in Episode 9, because I don't care about the new characters. They are boring, one-dimensional and didn't have a proper progression like Han or Luke.This movie felt like a mockery of Star Wars mixed with political messages. I personally don't like watching my favourite franchise being used as a tool to push an agenda. This, paired with the poor plot and utter disrespect for Lucas' Saga is worth 0p",0
111,this movie doesn't care about the fans nor for anything Star Wars if this is mark hamill and Carrie Fischer last film in Star Wars Disney has done a truly remarkable job in destroying the franchise no matter who directs episode 9 if this movie is canon and not retconned it will be truly be a lost cause for the Star Wars franchise rian johnson ruined Star Wars so spectacularly that I am flabbergasted that Disney would ever consider giving him his own Star Wars trilogy after destroying this one so callously,0
112,"Absolutely disrespectful film to all Star Wars fans and intelligent people. So many plot holes, that film just drowning in it. So many garbage stuffed in movie just for check. They don't actually reveal heroes, but show you stupid don't funny joke or action and large amount cute animals, hello Disney, bye bye Star Wars. Sanity or reason in this film logic they just forgot to put it. I add 2 points just because some heroes were better shown and some scenes were not bad. But it's one grain of logic in the desert off stupidity.SUMMARY: Look at the user rating. You just can't take glorious SW Universe and put anything you want in it. Please, learn from SW Extended Universe.",0
113,The worst star wars movie ever made and the death of the franchise. No creativity. Boring. An insult to the lore. Avoid.,0
114,"This movie marks the end of the good old Star Wars quality movies. This movie has ruined Luke Skywalkers character, made the Imperial faction’s officers into jokes and comical reliefs, there is no consistency in the movie when it comes to morale (OK for the rebel vice admiral to suicide attack, but not when Finn wants to … it’s OK to kill and eat fish, but not OK to eat flying penguins .. and so on), this movie is so political correctly loaded that one wants to throw up (the rich 1% are cruel to animals, use child slaves, sell weapons to all sides and want to have war … bla bla bla) and like 33% of this movie is about a pointless side mission that has no meaning in the overall plot, with two characters who have no role in the overall plot (Finn and Rose). On top of all this, one could write a book about how Star Wars 8 breaks (or violates) tons of Star Wars canon and continuity. Overall: Disney has killed Star Wars as we knew it, and a new money grinding machine monster is born :-(",0
115,"Horrible movie. Dozens of plot holes and slapstick humor.  The director has clearly never seen a Star Wars movie. There was so much potential after episode 7 raised lots of questions, but this is pure garbage.",0
116,"This movie was the absolute worst star wars movie, and perhaps one of the worst ""block buster"" movies of the last few years. I was always a really big star wars fan, I first watched the original trilogy and then the prequels. I can understand some of the hate for the prequels, but these movies go so far beyond that. It was hard for me to realize that this wasn't some fan fiction written by a teenager, but was the product of millions upon millions of dollars. This movie had more plot holes than I can count. The political innuendos are all over the place (We get it you like women being in power). Why did the admiral of the rebel fleet have perfect hair, which was dyed purple, and was wearing a **** party gown? How can I take her seriously... Tons of cheap jokes thrown in randomly so no ""serious"" seen can be taken seriously. Remember all those theories about Snoke and how mysterious he was? Well apparently he's just a dumbass who got killed like an overly-talkative bond villain. Rey is still Miss Perfect and she even kinda kick's Luke's ass. Luke isn't a powerful jedi master in this movie, he's a depressed old man who failed at life. Coming into this you think you're gonna at least see him do something interesting considering he's supposed to be a legendary Jedi, but instead is incredibly underwhelming.I could go on and on about this pile but I would probably just be reiterating what others have said. I actually believe this movie deserves a score of 0.TDLR; movie was stupid, didn't feel like star wars",0
117,"Hard pass. Not worth your time. Worst writing ever in a star wars film. I will not see the next star wars film, because this one was so bad.",0
118,Badly written and destined to attract new fans but if the producers are interested in a whole new era they have a tough task with better stories and plots. It's like watching Harry Potter without Harry. It's completely disappointing.,0
119,"i would really like to know how much disney payed to those so called pro-reviewers for all these super positive reviews... cant believe this c**p has higher score than amazing rogue one... this whole movie was most likely created just to sell some toys fluffy merch to kids. Acting is mostly average, plot lines are on the same level as average SW rebels episode (also garbage compare to clone wars), characters are either boring or totally killed, villains are just ridiculous with zero charisma, fights are meh, new alien creatures exist only to sell merch, theres some leftie agenda too (but thats not the real problem here) and its all feel like some poor fanfiction... most likely worst SW movie ever created",0
120,"The only way this movie works is as a stand-alone fan fiction. As a stand-alone movie it's fine; but when you put it as the second film in a cannon Star Wars trilogy; completely unmaking the first film in the new trilogy, it's not fine at all.Every character returns, exactly as you knew them in Episode VII! Yes, every character is the same as the first movie. In fact, there is no character development in this movie at all; it’s like they wanted to remake the first movie; it’s only been a couple years! It’s not a problem if you don’t know who Snoke is, or who Rey’s parents were; because it never mattered, boy how clever; straight out of the “M. Night” twist playbook!I didn’t have an issue with Han Solo dying in Episode VII, because Harrison Ford wanted that character to die off a long time ago. Killing off Luke, especially in the way they did, was a very unattractive move to a lot of people; in fact, Luke’s whole journey in this movie is the complete opposite of what it was in the original trilogy. They effectively unmade the original trilogy. It’s like, if someone were to make a sequel to Citizen Kane, but made every character you love into a child murderer. Why would Luke want to kill Kylo just because he “sensed” he went to the dark side in his heart? Luke literally tried to turn the most iconic fictional evil villain in history back to the light; Darth Vader, and he succeeded in the end! Princess Leah is also an iconic fictional character, and she floats through space like a champ too; also, where the hell did she learn how to do that? If Leah can float through space with force abilities and no training, did Jedi even need space ships at all in the Clone Wars?So, we’re supposed to “let the past die”, and accept that the main characters are at conflict now, and were in the past, for seemingly no reason at all. There is no reason for Kylo Ren to be on the “dark side”, and there is no reason for Rey to be on the ""light side"". Nothing matters in this movie, and that’s a big problem, especially for episode 9, and the entire future of Star Wars itself. They not only effectively unmade Star Wars, they made it pointless now too. Disney just wants to make and sell some “Team Kylo” T-shirts, that’s all they care about.If I were directing Episode 9, I would have Finn wake up from his coma from the first film, and be like ""Wow, that was one hell of a nightmare""; that way episode VIII never happened.",0
121,Ok now I am mad. You have ruined my childhood. There is no plot. Conversations in movie are retarded as all first order commanders. This movies is trash...  One of worst movies I have seen in my whole life.Shame that you manage to kill one of the best franchise in history of movies.,0
122,"Basically, this is the worst film I have seen in my life. I want my 2.5hours back.I do not regard it as a Star-Wars film, as it contains nothing that made the other films enjoyable. In my opinion, it is merely a trashy Sci-Fantasy film filled top to bottom with self inconsistencies and bad comic relief.",0
123,"I've been reading through the criticisms of ""The Last Jedi"" and I must say that I agree with a lot of the opinions. There are way too many plot inconsistencies and ham-fisted attempts at social commentary in this film for it to actually be entertaining. I found myself so distracted by the forced representation of current political issues that it completely failed to teleport me to a ""long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....""For me, the absolute deal-breaker comes when ghost Yoda burns the ancient Jedi texts, citing that they're not page-turners and that Rey has all of the knowledge that she needs without them. If we remove the thin veil from this metaphor and apply it to our own world, you'll see that Master Yoda is really burning the Holy Bible and claiming that it is not necessary. I can't be a fan of this franchise any longer.",0
124,"When Episode VII came out I was under the impression they were setting things up to portray the old heroes as nothing but losers... I wish I could say I  was prepared for what they had in mind for us this time around. No way I could have foreseen to which degree they would degrade the heroes of old (particularly Luke Skywalker) and the Skywalker bloodline in this movie.When The Last Jedi ended I thought at first that I would leave the movie theather feeling sad or even angry about it, but, in the end, I didn't. I felt indifferent. I don't care about it anymore. Nor does my girlfriend, my mother and nor does my 12 years old brother.Star Wars is over, this new Disney stuff is a joke and we the fans are the clowns.",0
125,"Very disappointing.  Bad writing, poor character development and misrepresentation of characters.  Awful continuity with its predecessor.  Not a lot to look forward to in episode IX.",0
126,"Seen it opening weekend, the more I think about it, the more I am shocked by what I saw. I understand we all need to move on with the Star Wars universe, it needs to move on from Skywalker, but why the need to destroy the old movies and their heroes. With the millions of dollars available and the ""creative minds"" in the industry could we not have moved on AND kept the heroes from the past ? Why destroy it all? why burn it down? why alienate half the fan base? Movie was a cool movie, but a terrible, terrible experience. One that gets worse as time goes on. A betrayal of my love of Star Wars. The plot holes aside (which their are MANY), I don't care as much about them. I am OK with Han, Luke and Leia dying off and new people coming in, its honestly OK with me... but why did they have to destroy the characters that made Star Wars they way it was. Why could Luke not have fought Kylo for real and died sparking the light of hope ? what harm would that have done anyone ? he died anyway ? What harm would it have been to have Leia killed in space ? what did she do the rest of the movie ? nothing. It would have ended her arch. Now its going to be done off screen...What harm would it have done to explain Snoke more ? and how the First order came to be ? It would not have taken much screen time... instead we got horse racing. What harm would it have done to the story to have Akbar so kamikaze instead of a new character who hardly speaks at all ? I doubt anyone would have said after ...""why didn't they invent a new purple haired lady to do that ?... what a waste of a potential story line !"" My opinions are my own and I'm the one living with them comfortably. No one else needs to care, I'm OK with that. Life goes on, but I have a hard time explaining to myself why Disney/Rian had to burn down a universe I grew up with to make a new one. They could easily have had both. Instead its divided everyone down lines and helped ruin the Majic of it all. Why ? What for ?  A New Star Wars ? I'm ready for that ? but I also wanted Old Star Wars ! Its important to me... I can accept anything, I can accept death of beloved characters... I cannot accept destruction for destructions sake... slightly depressed over this. 0 out of ten is too high... Read the books (the ones about Thrawn) and that was a Star Wars experience... brought life to my ideas of what happened after RoTJ... the Last Jedi was Star Wars murder. Bold, new, and aweful.Cool effects tho.... hyperspace death was a really cool scene in 3D. I was amazed at the time.... when I got home tho, ... I was like... why didn't the ships that ran out of gas just to that in the first place... the hospital ship captain even stayed with his ship as it was being destroyed ?.. he could have done it. How did the other ships around the Mega ship blow up as well Km's away? but everyone in the Mega ship yards away seemed to live ? How did Phasma end up at the other end of the hanger with more troopers, when Finn and rose were still where they were ? Did she get blown to the other end and just happened to land in front of a horde of troopers who remained on their feet ? So much to think about later on that once the movie ended I started to question things.People say read the books.. they help explain things. But any movie that requires you to read books to get a movies message, is a BAD movie.... AND any book that requires you to watch a movie is a BAD book. You cannot argue that... even if you want to argue it for arguments sake, you know in your heart your wrong.",0
127,Kathleen has clearly endeavoured to destroy Star Wars to push her clear agenda. This is an atrocious film that blatantly disregards Star Wars lore and rules. I don't understand why they are getting Jar Jar Abrams and Rian Jokeson to write these movies. Where are the Star Wars lore masters? Where are the writers who can actually write a script and tell a story? A 5 year old could have written a movie with less contrived plot devices and plot holes. Embarrassing.,0
128,Horrible movie. Disney has killed Star Wars. This will be the last one I see in the theater until Disney sells the rights.,0
129,"I was so looking forward to this movie.  I really enjoyed the Force Awakens and how they neatly relaunched the franchise in the modern era by revisiting the New Hope plot elements (people criticized it, but I found it clever and well executed like Terminator 2).  I thought it a great way to honor the original stories while setting up to send us into exciting new territory in the middle movie.  Rian Johnson took all of the FA plot lines/setup plus the remaining characters (Luke and Leia) as well as the history and myths of the Star Wars we all loved and took a massive huge dump on it.  The Last Jedi is by far and away the worst Star Wars movie of the saga. I am so disheartened.",0

I will never go to movie theater for the next Disney Star Wars. Just NO!!!!",0

137,"Overall, the film was not good.  Some positive points from the film:  2 Great battle scenes at the beginning and end, Kylo Ren is an incredible character and well acted, great character chemistry with Kylo, Ren and Luke.Here is what is bad about this movie:  Bad overall plot, subplots that go no where (as for the people who say it's ok the subplot doesn't work because people really fail in real life, that's not why I go to a Star Wars movie, I want to see our heroes succeed and the subplot was too drawn out and just didn't work with the story, I don't care about the Tauntan story), Luke's character was a coward (Mark Hamill did a great job, not his fault the story was bad), huge let down at the battle between Kylo and Luke, that should have been a real fight and then to have him die like that is not cool.  Furthermore, I don't have a problem with the whole ""anyone can use the force"" but you need to still have training and stuff to do so!  You can write a new and fresh story, but don't destroy the foundation of the series!",0
138,"I was bored coming out of this movie and could have walked out of the cinema several times (if not for the fact that I had paid a lot for my ticket). Judging this purely as a movie and not 'a star wars movie' it is still awful. The plot was incoherent and uninteresting, the characters were two-dimensional and uninteresting (in spite of some good acting). I could not care less about any of the new characters (noting that by contrast I was very entertained by Rogue One). The writer/director has very effectively killed off any curiosity I had about the SW universe or the characters within it. As any SciFi fan knows, creating a rich framework/setting for the story is essential, you need to feel as though you are looking through a window into something much bigger and more interesting - this movie fails utterly in this regard. There is now no reason to be curious about any of the characters or the larger SW universe (which now has no continuity and makes little sense).Yes, the visuals and sound were great in TLJ, but you need so much more to make a movie entertaining. As someone who is not a big SW fan this was just a bad movie. The interesting thing is that so many people seem to really like this film despite all of the major flaws in plot, script, humor and character development. Forget whether or not this was 'good fan service' purely as a movie it really stinks!",0
139,The last jedi is a bad movie. Disney Killed Star Wars. This is not a star wars movie. This is a bad disney movie. Unlikeable characters. Luke is not the same Luke. Boring plot. I'm sad.,0
140,"The reason why some people love this movie and others hate it is much simpler than most people claim: The movie massively breaks continuity with the movies before it and acts like it plays in an entirely different universe (characters, physics, the force, change on a massive level, ignoring everything that's been established before). Sure, there are plenty other bad things as well - but this sequel cannot be watched as a sequel to the 7 movies before it, which is what disappointed pretty much everyone who watched the 7 movies before it.",0
141,"Positive:-The visuals are great and epic all the way through (hence why I'm not giving 0 points)Negative:-Mary Sue main character who can beat anyone in fights with 0 training while the actress says it can't be Mary Sue because that's sexist-Unnecessary forced jokes throughout all the movie (In a scene that's supposed to be an epic battle the bad guys are LITERALLY defeated because of a prank call that ends with a ""your mother"" joke)-The ""First Order"" is so incompetent it's absolutely laughable. They have all the top military technology and giant ships and loads and loads of soldiers (which is never explained how they got all that stuff in the first place), yet they **** up the most basic logistical tasks and keep getting beaten by 20 people in outdated junk tech-Leia get's blown up into space in an actually epic scene that would have been a great opportunity to kill off her character since the actress died. But nope, she suddenly has op force powers that help her survive in space and she just floats to the starship door like Marry Poppins-Admiral Ackbar is killed offscreen to make room for a forced feminist violet-haired character to be in charge (which might be why they had to come up with something to knock out Leia in the first place) who just plays games with Poe to show how she's a strong independent woman even if that ends up killing half the Resistance because she was too proud to tell her plan to anyone-Forced Casino side-plot with yet another forced feminist character where they search for a ""master hacker"" while criticizing capitalism and animal abuse just to find some random drunk in a cell who just happens to also be a master hacker after being told the other master hacker is the only one who can do it. Then they get betrayed by the drunk master hacker so the whole side plot ends up being useless anyway.-The rest of the resistance uses junk-gliders to take on like 20 top tier AT-ATs because they need to destroy a giant laser-cannon but most of them get blown up on the way. Finn tries to sacrifice himself which would actually have been a great moment and would have made it feel like there's actual consequence in the movie, but in one of the most stupid moments in movie history the random girl crashes into Finn and basically (almost) sacrifices herself for saving Finn from saving the resistance and then proceeds to kiss him after knowing him for like 8 hours.-Finn is just able to drag the random girl for miles and miles to the base without any protection without being shot-Luke appears and gives the movie an epic final showdown with Kylo Ren, which would have made a somewhat worthy death for him, sacrificing himself, but then reveals he just trolled everyone with a hologram. But then he just dies anyway from a heart attack or whatever so what was the point of not personally showing up...-Once again incompetent First Order can't notice the Millenium Falcon escapingI definitely won't pay any money for the 9th movie and deeply regret paying money for this garbage. Don't understand why so many people are giving such high ratings (especially all the critics)",0
142,"‘Star Wars The Last Jedi’ is quite possibly the most disappointing movie I have ever seen, not the worst, but the most disappointing. The previous movie, ‘The Force Awakens’, had plenty of problems and was essentially a rehashed and modernised version of ‘A New Hope’, but despite this I still left the cinema with that feeling of childlike excitement that usually goes along with seeing a Star Wars movie. With this movie, I left the cinema with a very different feeling.There are so many issues with this movie that I doubt any review could cover them all without writing a lengthy tome on the subject, but the problem that stood out most obviously to me was the very poor script, not only in terms of dialogue but also with regard to story telling and basic continuity with previous entries in the series.A Jedi Master contemplating murdering a child, fuel suddenly being a consideration in the SW universe, hyperspace ram-raiding, 2 fleets of ships that have EXACTLY the same maximum speed, WW2 style bombing runs in space with ships that are so hopelessly slow that even when they reach their target, they are too slow to escape from the blast of the bombs they just dropped, and a totally inconsistent timeline are just some of the many problems with this movie.Besides the above issues, which many may consider’nitpicking’, there were other serious problems with this movie, such as character development......as in there wasn’t any. Rey is essentially the same character at the end of this movie as she was at the beginning, unless you count her seemingly magical ability to develop new skills instantly as character development. Kylo Ren was a whiney, bad tempered child in ‘The Force Awakens’, and he still is in this movie and Finn had basically the same character arc in this film as he did in the last one.Poe Dameron is the only one of the new main characters to have any real development....and it was all bad, with him now having regressed from a seasoned and skilled pilot and leader in Episode VII to a short tempered and tactically inept moron in this movie.The character I’m really looking forward to seeing them develop more in the future is Snoke because he was by far the best of the new.......oh, wait......he’s dead already.......never mind....Of the other new characters, Vice Admiral Holdo is completely ineffectual as a leader and her actions actually cause more harm than good. Rose was as pointless a character as I have ever seen in a movie (and in fact the whole Canto Blight sub-plot was like something from a different movie and seems to have only been inserted to help push a political agenda) and DJ was......errrm......yeah.Captain Phasma was also back in this instalment, but try not to blink after she appears on screen, because if you do she will be gone again.The film criminally wasted the last (living at least) on screen appearance of Luke Skywalker, turned Leia into Mary Poppins and took 40 years of story and development and threw it all in the garbage in favour of a ‘bold new direction’, which was just Rian Johnson’s way of saying “If you are a long time Star Wars fan, tough cookies pal, Star Wars aint for you any more”The only positive thing I can find to say about this movie is that at times it was visually stunning. Too long, too boring, disrespectful to the material and lore that preceded it and full of plot holes so large you could fit another movie in them, ‘The Last Jedi’ is absolutely NOT worth your time and it should have stayed in a galaxy far far away......",0
143,"This is my first review on this site.  I had to do it, this movie was just so horrible.  Huge plot holes.  The director seems as if he has NEVER seen a Star Wars movie in his life.  He completely disregarded where Force Awakens left off.  The characters have ZERO character development.  Finn was pointless.  Leia turned into superman in space.  Luke Skywalker became a total wimp, getting a beat down by a girl with zero training whatsoever.  So much for Yoda's training.  This movie makes no sense.  They killed off a sith lord that you knew NOTHING about.  I found myself so detached from the characters.  The movie was painful.  Even the humor was not funny.  I want my money back.  The worst Star Wars movie of them all.  i was pretty shocked.",0

145,Taking the path of levity at this point in the Star Wars saga is giving up on decades of pride in discovery.,0
146,"It's been said many times, but I still can not fathom how disappointing The Last Jedi was. My expectations for the new SW films are very low after this mess of a film.I will start with what I liked; the visuals were nice and the fight scene in Snoke's throne room was pretty cool. Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Mark Hamill (especially Driver) did a great job acting in their respective roles. Now for what I hated, where do I begin...Humor is really bad and is placed during the worst moments. At one point in the film a Resistance hangar is blown up by Kylo Ren, killing everyone inside. A second later, BB-8 comedically rolls out of said hangar as if the deaths of many Resistance members was supposed to be some sort of joke. There is also a bit at the start of the film where Poe calls General Hux to crack a your mom joke to him (really?). My theater was dead silent during these types of ""jokes.""Marry Poppins Leia. The Star Wars equivalent of jumping the shark and probably the dumbest scene in the entire franchise. Also how on earth did Poe and the others open the door Leia was trying to get through without being sucked into space?The Canto Bight subplot was pointless and the animals they ride to escape were something out of Narnia.Holdo not explaining her plan to Poe makes absolutely no sense. It's clear from the way other characters looked at her suspiciously that the film wanted viewers to think that she was the villain. The problem is there was no reason for her to hide the location of Crait from the other Resistance members. This means the entire subplot with Poe and Holdo is a complete waste of time. Also if lightspeeding into other ships is so powerful, why didn't they just use that against the various Star Destroyers/Death Stars in the past?Tons of characters are either wasted or ruined. General Hux has been reduced to nothing more than comedic fodder. Captain Phasma gets beat down and has less screen time than in TFA. Admiral Ackbar (known for his famous ""it's a trap"" line in episode VI) gets killed off-screen (I am aware his actor died IRL but he still deserved better). Supreme leader Snoke - who has had so much buildup to his power/origins since TFA - gets killed off quickly and we learn nothing about him. In episode VI, Luke is convinced Darth Vader still has good in him and tries to bring him back to the light side (even with all the atrocities his father has committed). In episode VIII, Luke attempts to murder Ben Solo IN HIS SLEEP despite the latter doing nothing wrong at the time. Luke's writing in TLJ was so out of character that even Hamill himself did not like the direction his character was going.Rose crashing her ship into Finn's to ""protect the ones you love"" makes no sense at all. For starters she would have killed Finn by plowing into him, and if Luke didn't show up then Rose just doomed the entire Resistance since the First Order was about to destroy the giant wall. Also gotta love how none of the AT-ATs fire at Finn and Rose when their ships crash and Finn is somehow able to drag Rose's body all the way across Crait. Easily the worst scene in the film after Mary Poppins Leia.There are also a ton of inconsistencies. For example, Finn and Rose are about to be executed in a First Order hangar in front of Phasma and hundreds of storm troopers. When the lightspeed crash happens, Finn and Rose are the only ones alive and now Phasma is entering the hangar from a completely different location. Uh, what? I'm honestly convinced they just filmed two completely separate scenes and just mashed them together. I know this sounds like I'm nitpicking, but inconsistencies like these were so blatantly obvious even on my first (and only) viewing it left me scratching my head.Overall, this film was a giant let down. Unless episode IX is on par with the OT, I am done with the series as it is now Disney's cash cow.",0

Even the few things TFA managed to do an OK job at, this movie either skips entirely to follow up on, or just scratches the surface of. I really, really wanted to like it. I hoped for the longest time that it would be at least as good as Rogue One, but sadly this chapter makes the prequels look great. Huge plot holes, misplaced humor, forgetfull characters. This movie tries way too hard at way too many things simultaniously and fails at most of it. And the absolute crime that is done to the character of Luke Skywalker is atrocious. I can honestly say I wish this movie was never made, or at least that I had never seen it. And so ends my life long relationship with SW movies. It's really strange how sad it is as well. Like the death of a life long friend or family member. I feel so sorry for Mark Hamill who had to go through this.",0

155,"This was the worst Star Wars made. With poor directing and poor script this movie was truly one of the most abysmal movie experiences. The people have spoken and the official critical reviewers have lost all credibility. I'll rate this movie 2 stars for the tireless efforts made by the special effects gurus, but I'm afraid it's not enough to save this movie as the worst in the Star Wars franchise.",0

157,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen... I’m a huge Star Wars fan and Rogue One was a fantastic movie... the plot, the acting, the dialogue for this movie were some of the worst I’ve ever seen. Sure the cinematography was par for the course along with the cgi effects but that can’t make up for the shortcomings of a terrible story with horrendous pointless subplots",0
158,"Wow. Where to begin. Ok, first up. The script is bad. Not just on a technical level (I'm a writer, and it is, it realy realy is), but also because Rian Johnson seems not to like Star Wars. The dialogue is atrocious, and makes the cardinal error of spelling out everything that is happening. This is screenwriting 101. The tone is just OFF. It isn't Star Wars. There are tonal lurches all over the place. Bad humour. No sense of jeopardy. Idioms from the real world circa 2010-2020. The source of tension was so ridiculously contrived as to be non existent. The thing that realy makes this hurt even more, is that a lot of good ground work had been done beforehand with the Force Awakens, which wasn't perfect but gave us a nice set up. Rian purposefully throws it all in the bin (when he isn't aiming jibes at Star Wars fans). I also thought Rogue One was pretty excellent. You managed to tease me in to thinking it was possible to get semi decent new Star Wars, and now this. There's more. Much more. But I'm not going to go in to it. I actually can't believe they managed to murder it this badly. The one redeeming element was the performance of Daisy Ridly and the fact Rian isn't directing the 3rd one. The special effects, while often tonally off at least clearly had a decent amount of talent behind. What a shame it was so badly misdirected. I'm off to watch Rogue One. That's how you do it. Please, please, Disney. Don't let that man near another Star Wars film. Never mind a whole trilogy.",0
159,Many good Ideas but the whole movies tensions are destroyed by al lot of funny sequences. The whole Casino Sequence is unnecessary long and in addition not as good shot as the rest of the Movie. I want to like it but i can`t.,0
160,"It's a bad movie, with even the most basic premises of its many cluttered plot lines being plot holes, but more than that it's a bad Star Wars movie that puts the previously established cannon in the trash and disrespects every character and every fan expectation. It manages to be so bad that it makes the rest of the series worse for watching it. I am genuinely regretful that I saw it.It is worse than the prequels by an order of magnitude.",0
161,"Una película decepcionante que insulta a personajes historicos no solo de STAR WARS sino del cine, esta pelicula es una completa estupidez plagada de errores narrativos no senti en ningun momento que era una pelicula de STAR WARS. No han sido capaz de crear siquiera un villano porque los que estan en la pelicula son unos bufones a los que ridiculizan y debo aceptar que la comedia no ha faltado pero... yo no fui a ver una comedia. Lo que ha hecho Disney no tiene perdon de Dios, Darth Mouse planea destruir la mas grande historia de ciencia ficcion, si eres fan y defiendes esta pelicula usa tus ¡sentidos! no te unas al lado oscuro ¡disierne! y recapacita, porque no es bueno aceptar lo malo. ¡¡¡VIVA LUKE SKYWALKER!!!",0
162,"Treason to Star Wars by the real Empire, AKA Disney. The prequels became master pieces after this ""film"". Get ready to see some weird guy called Luke Skywalker, you thought you knew him? Noooope, Mr.Johnson and Ms Kennedy turned him into a bizarre creepy guy who will ALWAYS do the oposite Luke would do.(Can you imagine Aragorn throwing his ancestor's sword comically or refusing fighting Sauron because there is no difference?) There is no bad guy in this movie, Kylo Ren loses again all of his fights and Rey win them all anyone knows why (because they wanted to create a strong and independent female character). They changed Ren's scar because he was ugly with it and removes his helmet at the beginning losing all the strenght the character had with it. He kills his father and doesn't even have dark side eyes? WTF?? Honestly I'd love a female character like Ripley, Sanchez, Imperator Furiosa etc... but no... she doesn't need training or anything else, thats just for male jedi. What about Snoke (lol), Finn, Phasma (lol), Ren Knights, Leia(LOL), R2D2, Chewie etc? Forget them, they wasted. At the end of TESB you cared for absolutely every character, bad one or not, you knew them and watched them evolve and grow. It doesnt happen here, everything is at the same point but filled with many marvel and out of place jokes and new creatures just for merchandising.Why there is a role for that asian woman? It is ABSOLUTELY unnecessary, but hey, you make a black guy kiss an asian woman and everything is beautiful even if their actions were unnecessary. You can call me racist or another **** like that, and you will be wrong, I dont have any problem with the ethnic of anyone in ANY situation, I only care for his/her act and role, and honestly, her character was forced in order to represent a beautiful and multicultural society (just with the resistance, the bad guys are all of them white males, of course)My english is bad and I cant explain as I would want, just watch it and judge yourself, but please, dont give your hard owned money to the empire and his minions, even if you find 20 bucks on the floor, they dont deserve it.",0
163,"As a huge SW fan I'm here because I have to speak! Do you know what it's funny? Some desperate Disney stans saying things like that: ""Don't listen to the bad reviews or the negative people, the movie is great"", ""Ignore the haters, go to see the movie"". Haters??? So you dare to call ""haters"" the immense majority of the SW FANS who don't recognize Rian Johson's crap as a Star Wars movie? So are they lying about the ridiculous things that they saw in this movie? So Leia doesn't fly? Luke doesn't refuse to train Rey? He doesn't not throw away his light saber? He doesn't milk a ""space cow""? He doesn't die without actually fighting? Yoda's ghost doesn't burn the Jedi books? Rey is not a nobody with magic powers (Marie Sue) she got without trainning? Snoke doesn't die without a explaination about his past or who he is? Snoke... What a silly name for a villain that was supposed to be the most dangerous Sith of this new trilogy! It sounds more like a perfect name for a pet. Yes! I can imagine a dog or a cat called Snoke. I bet there are pets with this name, and there were BEFORE the character was created! Come on, Snoke, don't pee on the carpet. Snoke, come here to drink your milk. It's NOT a good name for a villian. And for what I know in Star Wars, the big villains are Sith and have a ""Darth"" before their Sith names!Well, all I have to say is NO! I won't to see this movie, I won't pay to see this, I won't give any money to Disney anymore! The fans are not lying! This movie sucks.Disney look a little desperate, paying critics for good reviews and making some people (Mark Hamill, Angry Joe) apologize for being honest about how bad the movie really is!And they want us to buy books and stuff to read their absurd explanations for some things that the movies could not show??? Only money matters to Disney!I prefer ""midiclorians"" a thousand times than ""The force is female"" (and I am a feminist woman)! Kathleen Kennedy, I have to say something to you: The Force is NOT female or male.It has NO sex or gender! Stop being so ridiculous!So you think you can create new rules or powers for the Force users without any complainning from the fans of this series? You are very stupid for thinking so. It's the same as someone deciding to make a Superman movie in wich he can become invisivle, wears yellow suit, can hold a big piece of kryptonite without getting weak and doesn't fly anymore! Fans will say ""This is not Superman, it's someone else"". That's what's happen with Star Wars as most fans are saying: ""This is not Luke, this is not the Force, this is not Yoda, this is not Leia and this is not STAR WARS!"" If Disney couldn't not see that it was going to happen, so they are really stupid! To me  Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams and Disney are all big morons. Thank you for killing my beloved franchise! And I am NOT an old generations fan!",0
164,"This piece of garbage movie can be summed up with, this is not going to turn out the way you think.  It's going to make you sick and want to vomit right there in the theater.  Absolutely awful story that answers nothing from the previous movie and actually takes a dump on the entire franchise, wish I would have stayed home along with the everyone else I took with me.  Looks like I'll have to return some toys this Christmas considering the kids now think Star Wars is a joke, and my kids are 5 and 3.  My 5 year old even said to me ""What the heck dad, they didn't answer any questions about Snoke, that movie was terrible.""",0
165,This is not Star Wars and more like a Saturady Night Live skit. Ha! I honestly thought the opening scene was just a fancy advert for a phone company when Po was messing with the Empire pretending he had a bad connection. I waited in vain and then desprate hope that some flashy logo would appear and then the REAL movie would begin. This is a gut wrenching movie to watch. To witness that the people in charge have so little understanding about what makes this franchise great fills me with fear for the future. To feel that they have so little respect for the inteligence of the audience that they think re-hashing the old scenes and dialogue with a few cute fury characters is enough to warant calling this a new addition to the saga. This movie shamelessly rips off Empire and Return both in the script and visually. The other elements feel rushed and thrown together with boring and pointless character arcs and actions. By any normal movie metric this movie is weak. But the fact that it was so setup for a logical and interesting progression from the Force Awakens it seems like they went out of their way not to pursue any of the threads left by the last movie. The reaction of the public hopefully will be listened to by the studio. We can only hope that Rian Johnson does not direct any more star wars movies.,0
166,"I did not like this movie. I left the theater asking what it was I just watched. It was a pretty movie with nice effects and to some degree it keeps you on your toes about what will happen in the plot... but this is not Star Wars! Take the casino planet which most everyone hates, it looks like Las Vegas. Star Wars has, for the most part, been able to create a rich and exciting galaxy that feels foreign and new. This movie hit way to close to home for more reasons more than one. I don't care for what happened to Luke and all the side stories. This movie was made by a cinematographer, not a story teller.",0

171,Wonderful movie! I really enjoyed it! Just kidding. Boring movie. Not what you want from Star Wars. Too many microtransactions. I fell asleep near the end. Luke Skywalker plays a completely wrong role although Mark Hamill does his best with the script he is given.

174,"What a complete mess. Not just the movie, the reactions as well. Are journalists being paid to defend it vehemently, criticizing anyone who dares speak out against the bland, boring plot or forced characters? I don't even know where to begin in expressing my dislike of this film.I found The Force Awakens underwhelming. And the prequels were never fan favorites. But The Last Jedi was so frustratingly terrible, all four of those films look pretty damn good in retrospect. I'll cliff some of the ridiculous aspects of this movie.*** SPOILERS ***- Rather than giving Poe character development, he was used as some ham-fisted caricature of ""toxic masculinity"" as the buzzword regurgitating misandrist psychos like to say.- General Tumblr with the purple hair had to be the most useless character in the entire franchise. Worse than Jar Jar, worse than Rose. She was just there to patronize Poe a half dozen times. Then she gets this big heroic death? That moment should have been given to Leia or Admiral Ackbar. Hell, where's Mon Mothma? The moment was one of the few cool things in the movie, wasted on this terrible character.- Speaking of General Tumblr, why doesn't she just tell Poe what the plan is? Oh right, they needed a plot thread to bash ""toxic masculinity"" over the head. They needed to show Poe ""mansplaining"" her over and over again to drive home how terrible males are. I usually laugh when people say movies are SJW propaganda, this time...I'm not laughing.- Princess Leia floating through space was terrible. Absolutely abysmal.- Luke Skywalker was given the worst treatment. - Rian did all these ""double twists"" to shock the audience, but really it just seemed extremely lazy. A sort of combination of the M-Night Shaymalalianlyn twist, meets a horror movie jump scare. For example....(1) Oh no, Leia is dead! GOTCHA! She's gonna float back into the ship through space!(2) Oh wow, Kylo just took out Snoke and is going to join Rey! GOTCHA, he was just taking over the First Order!(3) Holy **** Luke Skywalker finally came out of retirement! GOTCHA, he was a hologram, he survives! GOTCHA AGAIN, he actually doesn't survive, he dies because he used up his force powers!(4) Oh no, they couldn't find the code hacker! Now they're in jail! GOTCHA, a stuttering Benecio Del Toro is their cellmate and just happens to be a hacker that will help them out! GOTCHA AGAIN, he's gonna betray them for the First Order!(5) So Finn and Rose are gonna die, apparently? GOTCHA, Finn is gonna fight off Phasma again with three swipes of a sword and kick her into a pit.(6) Rey and Luke's big moment from Force Awakens is finally here! GOTCHA, it isn't big, it's comedic relief. Luke hucks the ""laser sword"" away like a syphilis ridden ****I could go on and on, but I've made my point. The double twist didn't ""Subvert expectations,"" it felt forced every single time. Every ""rug pulling"" moment was supposed to be this big revelation. I can imagine Rian standing with a beaming smile, arms crossed as each double twist unfolds. But really, the result isn't some shocking revelation, it's like someone runs up and gives you a wet willy, or a wedgie, or points on your right shoulder than slinks off to the left. Only to spit in your face when you turn around.That's another thing, this movie has ""Nolan Batman"" syndrome in that it characters FRANKLY EXPRESS THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND EMOTIONS. You ever hear of ""Show, don't tell""? And it moves beyond just characters motivations, the Disney corporation even shoe-horned it's own agenda into the film, unsurprisingly through Dark Emo Jedi Kylo Ren. ""KILL THE PAST. KILL THE PAST. THE PAST IS DEAD."" Or, in other words, the verbal confirmation that this is, in fact, a giant double handed middle finger to fans of Star Wars.KILL THE PAST! KILL THE PAST! How about kill the past 3 hours wasted in the cinema on this hokey, forced, bland series of double twists? If you really break the movie down, it's 4 scenes stretched way beyond their amusement. 1) Space battle / space chase2) Luke ""training"" Rey, and Rey face-timing Kylo3) Casino Heist4) Reverse Hoth (with salt instead of snow)One last thing, why the **** does everyone keep saying ""THIS IS SO UNLIKE STAR WARS!"" The double twists really got your nips that hard? This is just as much a rehash as Force Awakens. It just borrowed moments from across all three OT films, rather than being A New Hope. For example, the throne room scene from ROTJ, Battle of Hoth from ESB with salt instead of snow, Rey training under a goofy acting exiled Jedi Master and eventually facing her psychological demons in a dark cave / tree when staring into her own face, ""We got away too easy, they're tracking us"" but it's THROUGH HYPERSPACE this time, guys, what a fresh innovation!I'm usually lenient on films. ""It wasn't that bad, guys!"" But his was a failed remake, failed reboot, and failed sequel all in one. Nice hat trick.",0
175,"Rose is a worthless character shoe-horned in for god knows what reason and is more irritating than Jar-Jar - they killed the wrong sister at the film's onset. The casino arc is trash, if the producers really wanted it to still be in the film, they should have just made Finn and Poe go together and scrapped Rose. The grating humor is out of place in a film where the good guys are being annihilated. Jumping to hyperspace as a weapon goes against the very idea of hyperspace and if it is a viable strategy, why not have any of the support ships of the rebel fleet sacrifice itself with a droid pilot at the start of the film. For that matter, why not jump a ship into the first and second Death Star in the original films, the introduction of this tactic is completely unjustified and not well thought out. This film makes the events of episode 7 completely irrelevant and implies that no level of attack on the First Order will have any effect. Apparently, destroying star killer base did nothing but kill Han while causing no permanent damage to the first order. Why must we not see Luke performing any acts of true power, it saddens me that the chosen one who defeated Vader and the Emperor is relegated to mere astral projection as the extent if his power. Next Leia apparently has the force power to survive the vacuum of space despite no real previous indication that she could do more than sense some truths through the force. Please, this is 2017 how can the animation of her flying through space back to the ship be laughably bad. Why god, did they have to ruin Rey's back story - there were so many amazing options they could have gone with, but they chose to make her essentially and orphan (the most cliche and lazy back story imaginable). Why did we get the casino arc instead of a Rey back story? Next, how can the all-wise, all-seeing Snoke be defeated by such a crappy trick as that employed by Kylo?The only really redeeming parts of this film are those with the force link between Rey and Kylo, the scene with the dark side cave, and the fight between Rey/Kylo and the praetorian guard.All together, I fail to see how any critic with a ""developed"" cinematic pallet could say this is a good movie. This film is a disgrace to the Star Wars inheritance, and I can not imagine how a critic could think otherwise without having been bribed or strong-armed into a good review by the demonic Disney executives seeking to keep the film from tanking in the box office. The entire casino subplot is a worthless arc motivated by the typical Hollywood political sentiment that is incapable of seeing its own hypocrisy - like DiCaprio lecturing us on the environment while hosting birthday parties on mega yachts and hiring private planes. Lead by example you swinish, elitist, Hollywood hypocrits!",0
176,"""The Last Jedi"" is a film that combines deep visceral imagery with a terrible plot which insults both the intelligence of the viewer and the legacy of the original trilogy.Director Rian Johnson must have felt the need to put his own ""stamp"" on the series, but in doing so he ruined every story arc which had been created by JJ Abrams in ""The Force Awakens"".  Spoilers ahead.Snoke is killed early on without any indication of WHO he was and HOW he was able to build the First Order out of the remains of the empire.  Rey's parents are dismissed as drunks who abandoned her.  Rey also somehow forgets that Ren murdered his own father and starts to fall for him because he has dreamy pectoral muscles.  Luke is a grouchy old man who ""ran away"" and refuses to help.  Rey masters the force in like 1 day and overpowers Luke.  The resistance is a pathetic bunch who can't seem to get anything right.  The entire plot is a low speed chase scene through space where nothing happens.  Story aside though, Rian Johnson makes several changes to the way things work in the Star Wars universe.  Ships now run out of fuel.  The force is mastered (by Rey) in like 1 day. Hyperspace ships can somehow interact with other non-hyperspace ships (this has never been the case before).  Laser bullets ""arc"" like artillery shells.  Bombs ""drop"" in space, and the list goes on.Additionally, for a movie with a running time of 2.5 hours, nothing really happens to advance the story and by the end of the movie you're left wondering ""What did I just watch?""Save yourself the money and do not see this movie.  Maybe go watch the original 3 again instead.",0
177,"It's just a mess wrapped in stunning visuals. The last film deletes the achievements of the original trilogy, but perhaps most disrespctful are the blunt retcons. The whole movie pretends to be surprising, critics praise it for subverting expectations, but I can't help to think it's just badly written when the main point of the previous movie was getting the map to Luke Skywalker, which Luke himself left hidden so that the Rebels, in time of need, may find him and seek his aid. This movie completely forgets that point and pretends it never existed. This is not surprising plot twist, it's just cheap.",0
178,"I really hate this movie. Full of plot holes! If light speed traveling could turn a ship into a light speed torpedo, why bother with all these fragile battleships? Just make more light speed torpedoes!!!",0
179,"This is the worst and most awful Star Wars movie yet. The movie is terrible. It doesn't fit into any of the other movies. Logically the movie falls apart worse than any other Star Wars movie yet. Most of the movie centers around a rebel (I won't call it resistance, that was a stupid and unnecessary name change from The Force Awakens) group of transports that are running out of gas getting chased by the Empires most powerful fleet. Don't ask me why but apparently the imperial fleet has nothing that is faster than rebellion transports and their tie fighters seem to all be broken down at once.If you ever wanted to see Luke Skywalker milk an alien. Then this movie will cover that base. If you want to see General Leia surrounded by a bunch of women to make modern feminist happy this movie has you covered. If you want virtue signaling about how awful rich people are this movie has you covered. At one point Leia busts through a door by using the force. When this happens you will expect the spice girls to run into the room and yell GIRL POWER. You will also get to see Leia fly through space like Superman. Because that is exactly what every Star Wars fan has wanted for 30 years. What you won't get is an amazing lightsaber battle featuring Luke. You will get to see a bunch of AT-AT's fire at a projection of Luke, though. Because that is what we've all been waiting for since the Return of the Jedi. Did I mention this movie is awful?If you wanted an actual Star Wars movie that embraced the spirit of the original then do not see this movie. This is a Disney movie. For some reason, they felt the need to pepper every serious scene there is in the movie with awful humor. The movie opens with one X-Wing flying right up to the imperial fleet. For some reason instead of blowing up the X-Wing, the Admiral of the imperial fleet starts arguing with Poe. I actually thought I was watching a bad commercial. I could not believe this was the start of a Star Wars movie. This is a modern Matrix Reloaded. Every fan theory or idea that you had about this movie is better than what you will see. I feel like I waited 30 years to watch Luke Skywalker milk an alien. I have never left any movie shaking my head but that is exactly what I did when I left this movie. Star Wars is dead. Disney sucked the life out of it. You'll be begging for George Lucas to make the next movie after seeing this. The prequels look like a golden age compared to this monstrosity.",0
180,WOW this is the BEST DISNEY CAN COME UP WITH??? PURE **** Oh this will make a bunch of money but they have ruined the franchise wait till that silly Han Solo Movie shows up and it will put a nail in the Starwars coffin...I'M DONE WITH STARWARS and this crappy MERCHANDISING all for MONEY!,0
181,"Absolutely horrendous. Rian Johnson, Disney and SJW congratulations, Star Wars are dead.",0
182,"Only good thing about this movie is the effort from most of the actors and the dynamics between Rey, Kylo Ren, and Luke. Otherwise, this entire movie is a mess with too much misplaced humor, inconsistent pacing, and weird transitions. It's a shame because the movie had some bold ideas, but the execution was terrible that I'm surprised the studio actually went ahead with the final product. Worse of all, it adds absolutely nothing to the Star Wars lore and instead, negates almost everything the previous movie, ""Force Awakens,"" set up. It serves no purpose and should never have been approved. There is no overall vision or direction and you cannot claim to be the middle act of a ""sequel"" trilogy without one. It's almost as if Disney and Rian Johnson wanted to make a ""trolling"" movie to stir up the fan base. I still have trouble believing anyone can think this mess of a movie is a ""masterpiece."" Objectively, this was not even a competent movie, let alone a Star Wars movie and I'm terribly disappointed.",0
183,Horrible movie that looks really good. All the questions set up by Force Awakens get disappointing answers or don't get touched upon at all. Tons of plots holes. There are a few great moments but they have no real weight immediately afterwards or looking back years from now because half of it is illogical. This is a rental only. Don't waste your money at the theater unless you can get in for less than $10. Don't support Disney on this garbage quality writing covered in eye-candy.,0
184,"All the previous ""0"" reviews were right on the money.  There are so many bad plot devices, meaningless diversions, bad character development, poor ""physics"", bad acting, bad EVERYTHING, that this should not even be considered a part of the Star Wars saga.  They should issue an apology and try again.",0
185,Boring. You could remove an entire subplot of the film and it'll only make it better. Incoherences everywhere. Characters making decisions that make no sense. Important events that happen just because. If it was Star Wars: The Parody it'd have been decent. Best of the film are tiny penguin-birds on the island.,0
186,Never been this disappointed in a star wars movie ever. the utter garbage dialog didn't make sense storyline didn't make sense.,0

188,"Me cree una cuenta solo para poner esto, no tiene ningun sentido el guion. Agarraron lo poco que dejo abierto en episodio 7 y lo terminaron de manera patetica. LLeno de chistecitos tipo disney. Arruinaron los personajes miticos de la saga. Una verga espantosa.",0
189,"I knew something was wrong when I reached for my watch and thought ""this is taking too long"". Never before I felt this way while watching an entry of my favorite movie saga ever. Up to that point I was mildly entertained - lots of eye-candy - but the over-the-top humor and a growing length that for some reason wasn't paying off were already red flags. When the credits rolled I was confused out of my mind.Since then I don't go a day without thinking how bad the whole experience was, and I just had to come over and join the almost three-thousand voters' consensus.One could point three main reasons why The Last Jedi is atrocious: 1) It's technically an awful movie: bad writing, bad pacing, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad decisions, gaping plot holes, no character development, no real journey, no accomplishments, disjointed plot; 2) It actually strives to spend the maximum screentime as possible delivering political undertones that have nothing to do with it's universe at all; and 3) shamelessly disrespects and disregards the saga's lore, world-building and legendary characters.I never thought it would come to this, since The Force Awakens was a serviceable nostalgia ride and Disney usually manages to keep the quality standards in their projects. But it's not just about nostalgia, as most of the critics are bashing the disheartened fans. The changes they defend about The Last Jedi are not thoughtful steps forwards that build on the saga's foundation. They're market-calculated decisions designed to appeal a smartphone-dumbed and twitter-minded younger audience, coupled with really shallow and trendy moviemaking. And to that merit, Episode VIII accomplishes it infamously.Also, that is where The Last Jedi does feel like closure, at least to me. I'm disgusted enough to have paid a cinema ticket to watch it, and I'll not indulge this Coca-Cola-ish brand anymore. I'm not part of the target audience that enjoyed this catastrophe and is willing to pay for more. I've lost interest in many other beloved franchises before, but never felt so conned and so betrayed like this. As time passes though, comes indifference, and I just can't be bothered. Like many others have expressed, I've no more room for Star Wars in my entertainment, be it past or upcoming features. An X-Wing replica still sits on my desk, but it feels strangely distant now. The Last Jedi is a bitter full circle, and I'm done with Star Wars.",0
190,"Sad face.  Star Wars is dead!  What did Rian Johnson do?  Strange how all the critic reviews are positive?  Sounds fishy to me.  And on top of that, they accuse the fans of being “Russian bots”.  Insulting.  FU Disney!  Bring George Lucas back to fix this!",0
191,"After hearing other people talk about the movie I figured I'd still probably at least enjoy the movie even if I wouldn't love it like the last one. However I am shocked at how disappointing this movie was! Snoke was nothing more than a plot device with zero payoff to who he is, Rey's parents end up being nothing, Luke's death at the end is totally ""wat,"" and it basically made every male in the movie into either a blundering idiot or a villain while every female was righteous, smart and valorous... I'm all for equal male/female treatment but this was not equal at all. The story was filled with holes and totally broken. It had a few cool action sequences which were neat and some humor here and there but otherwise, a major disappointment. I would rate this one as being just as bad as Phantom Menace.",0
192,"I had to keep myself from throwing up in the theater. They did the impossible. They created a character, named Rose, who is worse than Jar Jar. I seriously hope Rian Johnson will never get to direct aka ruin another movie in his life. This feminist SJW Kennedy person has to go too. By far the worst SW movie.",0

198,"I thought Force Awakens was horrible but it could've never prepared me for how godawful Last Jedi is. First of all, Snoke is obsessed with killing Luke because he represents hope in the universe. Fair enough. Only problem is that Kylo collapsed a hut on him and didn't finish the job! We know Kylo is in contact with Snoke at that point because Luke says as much. That was his reasoning for almost murdering the teenager in his sleep. Kylo survived the hut crashing down so why in the F'n world would he (and Snoke) not think Luke, a JEDI MASTER, also survived? Especially considering that Kylo and his supporters, whom we NEVER see (The Knights of Ren weren't even mentioned in TLJ despite Snoke titling Kylo ""Master of the Knights of Ren"" in Force Awakens) taking the time to murder the rest of Luke's apprentices. Ugh! Also, in several of the Disney cannon novels (and Rogue One) Darth Vader relies on his pressurized suit to withstand the vacuum of space, but Leia is so much more powerful than even a dark Lord of the Sith to the point that she can use the force to survive total exposure to space. Good grief! Worst of all, however, is the scene where Luke tosses the lightsaber. His F'N father's lightsaber! AND he reaches for it with the hand that was lost while wielding it! The very lightsaber that Obi Wan collected and handed down to him for training. If someone handed you a family heirloom, especially one with such significance and nostalgia, would you just toss it away like yesterday's garbage? And all this is just the tip of the iceberg. TLJ once broken down, is rife with horrible dialogue, incompetent editing and just a plainly obvious trash script. The final straw for me was having a casino scene that would've perfectly set up re-introducing Lando Calrissian (remember how he was one of the four major characters?) only to have...wait for it...Justin Theroux as the gambler contact??! Finally, if Luke never wanted to be found and rather just die a useless, cranky old hermit, why the F did he give R2D2 his coordinates??? And why after so much time and so many prior adventures together did C3PO get nothing more than a wink from him??? The worst part of all of this is that Disney loved this trite so much they give the hack director Rian Johnson a Star Wars trilogy? Over my dead body!",0
199,"Like so many, I prepared for this film properly - early bird ticket, no spoilers, no reviews and zero expectations – only to flee the theatre afterward in a fitful state of bewilderment and dismay.This film was so terrible, it drove me to an immediate second viewing in disbelief, then tears and finally Rotten Tomatoes to comment.A must watch if you appreciate endless plot holes, ill timed slapstick humor, tonally disjointed scenes, Jedi skype calls, laughable villains, pointless side quests, uninspiring new characters, force ghost lightning (wtf), low gas tanks, absent autopilot and droids, light speed crashes, lazy subversion in place of quality consistent story telling ...and pairing the truly abysmal assassination of Jake Skywalker (see Hamill's interview) against the all powerful, yet unrelatable Mary Sue (see internet)... and of course, porgs. Keck. I would like to include a special thank you to both directors - and perhaps Disney - for allowing our once beloved hero, NOW warped cynical deranged defeatist coward, to greet Rey in TFA in FULL ""Sunday Best"" JEDI ROBES – before pitching his Father’s light saber over a cliff in pure slapstick fashion, choke on milk from a quadriplegic sea sloth and  repeatedly retreat to his hut in fear in TLJ.

I literally just made an account on here to post this because I'm still so stunned at how this could have happened. Disney and all involved should be ashamed. A huge middle-finger to 40 years of fandom with a dose of terrible comedy and amazingly ham-fisted political messaging added on to boot. Where have you gone, George Lucas? Our nation turn its lonely eyes to you.",0

205,"Lets start with the positives:It doesn't last forever.On to the negatives:Lukes character is destroyed.  Luke dies in squandered manner.  Rey is textbook Ultra Mary Sue.  Shes seems to grow more powerful the less she knows.  If she continues to receive no training, she will be able to move planets with her pinky.SJW characters abound, nothing like getting political for no reason #2017.  Plot holes are like mines in a mine field here.  There are soo many!!  It can only be safely navigated with the proper mine sweeper (give up caring).  Death stars can be defeated by light speed missiles now and everyone before this movie was an idiot for not realizing a new style of hyper weapons.  The casino planet is unbearable.  Free animals, ignore children.  I figured it would be a 5 minute sub plot, but it was over half an hour of RICH PEOPLE EVIL.  I get it!  Please let me off this ride!!  Leia is apparently 100x stronger than any other Jedi before.  Space is no consequence to her, and oxygen is not required.  Perhaps it is only females do not require any training to use the force?  Kylo Ren in this movie changes his position on topics ever 10th second in the movie and is almost unwatchable. Too AngstEdgy for me.  Snoke was the best villain ever.  Without consent, can connect users minds and facilitate a skype call.  Force lightning through holograms.  Overpowers overpowered Rey like its nothing.  To be betrayed by his pupil while giving a diatribe on how he could never be betrayed by his pupil.  There are non relevant props that are treated with more love, backstory and screentime than Snoke (Porg/Crystal Foxes).0/10 for this since the director (Ryan) is being rewarded and allowed to create his own trilogy.",0

The key problem seems to be the ""plot"" was merely a vehicle to move from one cool scene to another and when the implications of something in one of those scenes clashes with a later scene it's just ignored. Its not even a problem of plot holes which implies there is a coherent plot with a few issues. Instead it's like the movies is just a series of plot islands with only a vague connection to each other, let alone the events and characters of the previous movies. I was entertained in the moment, but after the fact (which is the real test of a great movie) I am not impressed. Can they salvage it from here? Probably, but this movie is always going to be a gaping wound in the larger narrative I fear.",0
210,"Ghastly, heinously bad. Muddled plot, flat characters, bad acting, eye-rollingly stupid and clichéd dialog. Disney poisons everything they touch. Long gone is the Star Wars magic. This film should be taken out to the woods, shot and put out of its pathetic misery.",0

That many people can't be stupid enough to believe this movie actually has good character development. I really am concerned for the future of, not just Star Wars, but of entertainment in general if this is the case. There was nothing that made me feel good about this movie. The humor made me cringe and was totally out of place. There was a complete lack of any real dramatic moments. Too many inconsequential scenes and new characters. The runtime could have been cut by nearly an hour and nothing would have changed. Just way too many bad choices on the part of the writers. I am all for making something new and unpredictable. Just don't do it at the expense of your plot. I'm not even looking forward to the next one now. I don't recommend seeing this movie in the theater. Wait till it's free on netflix.

218,"I think The Last Jedi is one of the worst Star Wars movies ever made. People were seriously falling asleep or playing on their phones during the movie. The audience was quiet -- not reacting or cheering the way they did during Rogue One, The Force Awakens, or Revenge of the Sith. I found it hard to resist the urge to play with my phone or nap during the movie, and I normally love sci-fi movies! I've seen all the Star Wars movies multiple times.The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is it was clearly written and directed by someone who does not understand Star Wars, has ADHD, and does not understand human emotion. The movie constantly jumps around, attempts to accomplish too many simultaneous story lines, blows away the boundaries of what is believable in sci-fi movies, and completely ignores emotional attachment to characters. Worse, every confrontation I was looking forward to turned out to be completely anticlimactic due to being handled wrong, pointless delays, and force powers turned into pure magic.The Last Jedi was bad. It's a pretty movie that definitely lives within the Star Wars visual universe. However, it was not up to Star Wars storytelling quality. The only thing good about the movie was the dynamic between Rey and Kylo -- that's all. I do not want to see any more Star Wars movies by Rian Johnson. I would happily take George Lucas back.",0
219,"Although visually impressive, this film is a real mess of pointless plots, zero character development, and ultimately unsatisfying gotcha moments which attempt to 'reset' the Star Wars franchise with 'something different' but ultimately leave the viewer confused and confounded. As a stand-alone sci-fi/fantasy flick it is perhaps not too bad, but taken as part of a long epic story it seems to make absolutely zero sense. Cliffhangers and characters set up in the 'The Force Awakens' turn out to be red herrings and are dropped unceremoniously. New characters are introduced (Purple hair lady, random annoying Asian chick) out of the blue apparently to appeal to diversity quotas. Old characters are either killed without ceremony (Admiral Ackbar) or come back to life in Superman style (Leia). Bad comedy permeates nearly every scene, puncturing any attempt to create suspense. What plot points do work are shamelessly ripped off from the original movies.The franchise's great hero returns and is a miserable old man sitting on a rock who doesn't want to play ball any more. He has gone from being the great optimist to a curmudgeon with a whisky bottle. Why? His teenage nephew was a bit angsty. When he finally gets off his ass to do something he just becomes a hologram or something and vanishes into thin air. Is that it? Luke Skywalker is now Jeff Lebowski with less humour and white russians.  The new lead character Rey is able without any explanation to use The Force without any training. Entire subplots divert to meaningless planets which go nowhere. Hamfisted political points (capitalism and patriarchy bad, mmkay) are shoehorned into this film, despite the irony of it being a multi-billion dollar global franchise which never really had a 'diversity problem' in the first instance.But nothing matters, this film will make squillions of dollars and Disney will milk this cash cow for all it can get (the second thing we see of Luke is him milking some weird alien cow on his rock, surely an in-joke about this very fact) and The Last Jedi will fade into memory while an endless stream of CGI sequels stretch into space and devalue the epic majesty and wonder of the original trilogy. Somewhere in a galaxy not very far far away, fat Hollywood execs are laughing all the way to the bank....",0
220,"A disappointing movie,a poor history. It makes me feel the first trilogy was even better.",0

222,"So what's the deal with these critics scores? I find it incomprehensible that they can think that this movie is a modern masterpiece. Even if the logic centres of your brain don't reject the deluge of plot holes, plot armoured characters, and jarringly injected political correctness, the story itself is total pants. This movie is so badly conceived and executed that it actually REDUCES the amount of joy you'll get if you rewatch the older SW movies... well, if your any sort of fan of Luke anyway.The message of this movie is 'Get with these nihilistic times sister, because being THE hero is lame, and we're all heroes you see, so we all get a prize just for participating'. It doesn't appear that any sort of decent script writer did because the pacing, humour, and shape of the movie are all way off. I imagine director Rian Johnson was given a checklist of crappy ideas and scenarios by Disney that he had to somehow shoehorn into it. That would help to explain the out-of-character and moronic behaviour, and the endless unneeded side stories that often had little, or nothing, to do with the plot. They just burned valuable time that would have better spent world building and developing some of the secondary characters properly. For instance: - What is the rest of the galaxy up to after the events of the previous movie. You'd think some of them would be angry enough to do something. Say what you want about the prequels, but they always made you believe they took place in a vibrant and culturally diverse universe. The stakes just feel so small and inconsequential in this movie when compared to even 'Rogue One'.Please don't be fooled by the thousands of Disney mandated positive reviews that have been appearing online - this movie is a dog, and it leaves me with absolutely no interest in where these movies are going nor desire to see what happens next.R.I.P. my childhood hero and role model Luke Skywalker, and commiserations to Mark Hamill. You didn't deserve this treatment at all dude.",0
223,"The fact that 95% of critics can give this piece of crap movie good reviews should ring alarm bells.

Easiest way to make sense of them and figure out how it really rates as a movie to to simply pay attention to the way that postive reviews are written. You will see a LOT of ""Didn't make sense but LOVED it"" and ""There were tons of odd moments that made me cringe but GREAT film"". Ask yourself why even all the positive reviews of 8,9 and even 10 tell you how awkward it was and how they are 'taking a new direction' with the series in this 'turning point' film.Those are the kindest possible terms for a movie that took a massive steaming dump on all the things we loved about Star Wars prior to this. Heroes? All of the things you thought you knew about the Lore and Characters will be completely washed away by the end of the film. Is Luke a brave hero who risked his life to save his father or a broken, selfish and cowardly vagrant? if you believe the former prepare to be disappointed and confused.To keep this spoiler free I will not be listing all of the times this film make me confused,angry and hurt.

230,"The Last Jedi manages to literally and figuratively kill everything The Force Awakens built up.  If you were expecting for it to propel the story forward at all, you will be extremely disappointed, as it cuts off any sort of story or plot to go on for another sequel.  Episode IX is completely f**ked in this regard.  Here are some reasons why... WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!  Rian Johnson kills off Snoke as if he's a little **** after making him out to be powerful as all hell. They kill off Luke by having him fade away (the most fighting he did was a stick fight with Rey, which he f**king loses!). Captain Phasma was killed by Finn after a 20 second fight with him thanks to the power of ex-machinas.    Leia does NOT die, instead she has a force ex-machina moment and Mary Poppins herself to safety after being blown up into the vacuum of space.  Rey is still terrible, taking literally no training whatsoever to be able to do remarkable sh** that even Anakin couldn't do at his early stages, even after Rey's parents are revealed to be nobody junkers that left her behind out of greed.Another major disappointment was Leia's character as a whole.  She doesn't get much screen time, and when she does it's weak, and ultimately pointless.  She feels so much like a side character that she could've been removed altogether (which she should have been), and it wouldn't have made a goddamn difference to the story.  Being yet another reason why Episode IX is royally f**ked, you know, having to figure  out how to either sustain her or kill her off.The one decent thing I can say for this movie is that it's very pretty.  It is hands down the most aesthetically pleasing Star Wars movie to date, but that doesn't help a film much when the story, characters, and even the ending are terrible.The Last Jedi takes everything The Force Awakens built up and says, ""F**k it, we don't need it.""  Being a terrible segway episode and standalone episode.  But at least it did it while being pretty, which is the only reason this film is a 3/10 as opposed to a flat out 0/10.",0

232,"The amount of potent disgust I feel towards this film and its creators is beyond words. I'm not going to waste (too much) time rehashing what 62,984,825 true fans have already iterated across Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, etc. but I do want to mention that I personally found this film to be an overt assault on: STAR WARS fans, Men, Family, Tradition, Religion, The aged, Capitalism, My eyes/ears, My intelligence, and on George Lucas/Ben Burtt/Mark Hamill, etc.Not only is this post-postmodern pile of garbage offensive in its caustic/nihilistic sensibilities, it is also devoid of the high-quality STAR WARS craftsmanship we've come to know and love. THE LAST JEDI is a poorly put-together film. Strictly speaking, on the technical side of things, it's crappy. Perhaps we all could have tolerated the aforementioned hyper-political misandrous hate-fest, if the film had exhibited just a lick of cinematic prowess -- but alas!I'm genuinely struggling to write one good thing about THE LAST JEDI... oh, John Williams!John Williams' score was solid, and it stands on it's own, thank God. That's why I gave this film 1/10, instead of 0/10. Williams is the man, too bad he got pimped out to this drivel. I found the sound design to be coarse and jarring - where the heck is Ben Burtt? Are you aware that even he doesn't know why he was axed? No Ben Burtt = Red flag #47. The story was nothing, the dialog and humor atrocious, no character development. Rian Johnson destroyed all of Abrams' hard-earned potential and mystery, in one overlong bloated hyper-messy mash. Shameful. Really! I found the ""special effects"" totally ho-hum. Been there, done that. The explosions were all cut-and-paste pixelation nightmares. This was way worse than Michael Bay's latest Transformers film, and I couldn't stand that one -- at least Bay's special effects are special. Plot holes, ridiculous physics, canonic inconsistencies (to the absurd) -- this film's got it all.STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. Gross + hollow; everything about it. Hated it. Could not have been more disappointed...STAR WARS is supposed to be FUN. Thank you Rian Johnson (and whomever else pulled this crap lever) for infusing politics into ""our beloved STAR WARS."" In this polarized political climate we find ourselves in today, you could (and should) have taken the high road, and been the ONE thing that brought everyone together. ""Everyone loves STAR WARS!"" That used to be a thing people would say, it was bi-partisan/universal. Not anymore. You ruined it, and multiplied this present darkness exponentially. Very divisive move, Disney. You sold out to your crap politics, and alienated AT LEAST half of the STAR WARS fan-base.I didn't make this political. You did. So I'll go there, just real quick... The caustic ideologies present in THE LAST JEDI are likely the same ideologies which were major contributing factors to Trump's 2016 victory. This ram-it-down-your-throat, take-no-prisoners, no compromise, no apologies approach is only going to continue to empower the growing backlash against the ideologies of the left (socialism, rabid/hateful feminism, moral relativism; just to name a few of the bigger/uglier ones). I believe there is a strong correlation between Trump supporters and THE LAST JEDI haters. Not a perfect correlation, by any means, but I think there's a trend there, for sure. This continued ""double down on your failures"" approach, from the left, will probably lead to a second term for Trump. Yes, THE LAST JEDI may very well help Trump win a second term. That's how bad THE LAST JEDI is. LOL. Just kidding. (I'm trying to be partisan here!) My heart goes out to all the others like me who were actually devastated by this release. I was pleased to see I wasn't alone. I'd never been let down like this before (film-wise). Thank God it's only a movie (and not canon, in my world). Timothy Zahn forever. May the (pre-Disney) Force be with you. (i'm not-a-bot) P.S. This would be a pretty awesome bot entry. Let me know if you know of any bots who could pull this off -- I'd love an introduction. LOL.

238,"This movie was such a disappointment to me.  I've been such a Star Wars fan for such a long time, and this movie, is the first time I've really disliked the whole movie (I mean, nobody liked Jar Jar, but he didn't ruin the whole movie).So when Disney decided to un-cannonize the expanded universe, that was hard enough, after all, it was the incredible popularity of those books and comics that brought Star Wars back into popularity enough to spawn off new trilogies and spin offs.  But we could deal, it wasn't that bad, the new cannon would borrow some of the best story-lines and characters and make a whole new and interesting followup to finally finish off the stories.This movie kind of feels like a slap in the face to all big fans of the Franchise.  It decides to either not answer, or flippantly answer many of the big questions we had coming out of the last movie (who is Snoke? Who were Rey's parents?).  The entire Finn/codebreaker story is superfluous to the movie.  They've gotten rid of the classic ""bombers"" from the past and introduced some kind of slow moving gravity style bombers instead of missile style torpedoes (in space??).  Just awful.  Instead of homages to the popular ideas coming from the expanded universe, it stomps over everything we've come to love, the new ideas are bad, their execution poor.The pluses are what you might expect.  The movies does have a nice big budget for effects, and nice balanced cast, and mostly good acting (I didn't like the role they wrote for Luke, but that isn't his fault).  So it does have some epic fights, great music, and big scenes.  These things are hard to enjoy; however, because there are so many huuuuuge plot holes in the movie, and it draaaags on for an incredibly long time.  At the end of the movie, the most disappointing thing for me is the overall arc they've taken the universe in.  We went from new republic, to dictatorship with the empire, then rebellion.  But then after return of the Jedi, I Han and Leia split up, Han lost the falcon, Luke went into seclusion, and the rebellion got crushed?  We've now lost so many of our beloved characters, even the death of Akbar was just brushed past in seconds.  By the end of this movie the rebellion is down to a dozen people running away in the rediscovered but damaged millennium falcon?  The final ground fight was going to be the ""seed of a new rebellion""?  Why would anyone be inspired to join a rebellion anew, the last one was apparently ruthlessly crushed, to the point of irrelevance.  I'll go see the last movie, but these films no longer feel like an ever enriching, consistent expanding universe and storyline, but rather they just do a deus ex machina whenever they want to take a hard left turn or right turn for the plot, and take stories in random new directions.  I have more hope for the spinoffs.",0

This movie really killed the francice. Wow.",0
242,"The screenplay was dysfunctional as a dramatic narrative.  That is not an opinion but a statement of fact since I am myself (among other things) a screenwriter with a great deal of education in dramaturgy.That critics gave this film a glowing review does not bade well for those critics' credibility frankly.  From now on I will not rely on the mainstream media for reviews since all the well known reviewers are either uneducated in the art of storytelling (so why should I listen to them?) or have other motives for providing misleading information to the public.What they did to the once great character of Luke Skywalker is unforgivable.  Mark Hamill more or less created that role, beating out Lucas's terrible dialogue and imbuing him with great spirit and conviction.  He was a character I looked up to as a child, my ultimate hero, and they treated him with such disdain, subverting his character entirely without a word of explanation.And then, in what looked like a last minute addition since it included a shot of twin suns that had not been earlier established in the film - as though to imply gravity to the scene - they had him puff out of existence in a shot that looks like it was CGId in at the last minute also.Personally I suspect Mark Hamill didn't know they killed Luke off before he first saw the film, but is alas constrained by a gagging order from speaking out.  Quite aside from disrespect for the character this showed a total respect for an extremely talented man like Mark Hamill.I'll be skipping episode IX.  Still not decided on Solo, but honestly, the prospects don't look good.  The Star Wars saga may well have ended disappointingly for me on December 14th 2017.  Ruin Johnson destroyed something I'd been following for 35 years, since the age of 5 and he still won't shut up with his pathetic excuses for the choices he made.The man has no writing talent whatsoever.  I'd love to have a write-off with this guy, a contest to see who can write the most engaging story.  The Last Jedi was NOT A STORY.  Stories require consistent and fulfilled character arcs of which this film had none.  The fact that the writer/director of this film seems unaware of that point just illustrates my point that he has no business whatsoever calling himself a 'writer'.Anyhow, rant over.  Film was awful basically and it kind of hurt me internally, 35 years of emotional commitment was thrown against the wall.  I can't even watch The Force Awakens anymore because this film also destroys that film since the questions posed in the first film were inadequately answered in this one.",0
243,"As many others i have made account just to voice my disgust for this abomination. This ""movie ""does two ""things"".

246,"While I went into this movie without any expectations, and while I enjoyed most of episode VII,I left quite disappointed with this. This movie is poor from two perspectives. First as a movie in general, e.g. script, plot, characters, and cinematic. and second as a star wars franchise movie.1). This is just a poorly done movie / cinematic. --- contrived plot--- poor character development, e.g. characters do not evolve, they remain static in their understanding of events and conflict from beginning until the end.--- forced diversity, the character 'Rose' reeks of Disney forcefully placing ethnic diversity into the film as a matter of making a check on list. There is no point to this character and events or responsibilities of this character do not make any sense and are meaningless.2) Bad Star Wars franchise movie---No adherence to cannon. e.g. not consistent with established 'rules' of 'The Force'(e.g. Jedi training). Why didn't rebels use hyperspace kamikaze to former threats in previous movies?---The visuals and action were a step down from previous movies. Where is the  masterful Jedi vs. Sith light saber scene? Where is the Jedi taking control of the battle field or space in conflict?---Lukes climatic buildup carried from episode VII was a big nothing and inconsistent with his matured character from Return of the Jedi. To be frank, we all wanted to see Luke's bad ass Master Jedi skills in action to save the resistance. ---No climatic battle with Supreme leader Snoke... by the way, can holy wood get away from the contrived throne room? No rulers sit day in and day out in a throne room. At least Darth Sidious's room was more of a command viewpoint to watch galactic warfare.",0

Everyone's (mine included) delight in having a diverse cast cover up the plot holes for the critics.3. The Disney factor. Amalgam of the Disney marketing beast and their power in media.This film and its scores will be talked about for years and I am sure we will hear the truth at some point.",0

I saw both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in theaters (a bit too young for A New Hope - I was only 3 at the time)... I, like so very many, played with Star Wars action figures and toys relentlessly, reenacting and inventing over and over. There was ALWAYS some kid that wanted to play too who wanted to kill Luke, or deface Leia, or wanted to do nothing but make the figures have sex, etc etc.... That was the kid that you didn't let play Star Wars with you, that made you just put away your toys and go play on the swing. That kid was Rian Johnson.",0

254,"The Destruction of Star Wars and Everything Special About It:I feel so bad for today's kids.  I grew up on the original Star Wars trilogy, which clearly laid out how love, calm, and self sacrifice = the Light side of the Force, and hatred, anger, selfishness = the Dark Side.  It was clear cut, and helped guide my moral compass growing up almost as much as anything. Luke emobodied these ideals and struggled with the darkness and the light through his 3 movie arc before solidifying himself as the greatest hero in the history of movie-dom by saving his father and the galaxy.And now we have TLJ, where Disney throws everything we hold dear out the window.  Luke is destroyed and treated lower than dirt.  The Force and how it works is destroyed.  The rebellion is destroyed. Everything the rebellion worked for in the original trilogy is destroyed.  The beloved Admiral Ackbar is unceremoniously flushed in favor of a new purple haired character nobody cares about or will remember.And the main character Rey, who I am supposed to be rooting for, is essentially a Sith in the employ of the Resistance with her rampant use of untamed dark side power. Don't worry though, the porgs and horse-dogs are saved! yay!  Long live Supreme Leader Ren and the victorious First Order!This film leaves people with ZERO anticipation for episode 9.  Are 30 people (the entirety of the Resistance now fits in the Falcon) going to defeat a galactic Empire of billions? Who will lead the Resistance since we know Leia is dead IRL?  Will they pull some other random pink haired lady from the back or do we need to wait 10 years for broom boy?  Will Kylo finally turn good after slaughtering the entire galaxy or will Rey defeat him?  Who cares.  I'm out.  See you later Disney. I'm going to go hug my pre-special edition VCR tapes of the original trilogy and cry.",0

256,"Putting aside the issues with what fans of the series might expected, the plot made no sense.If the idea was for Poe to be allowed to help the bombers ships, then why was he told to pull back when all he needed to make the potential mission successful was to destroy one more anti bomber canon? Yes many bombers were destroyed in the mission, more to chance than anything else, (one piece of enemy's ship debris hit one bomber that then causes a chain reaction of explosions that could not have been predicted), but when the mission was started the ideas was to send them non the less, they could have not known they were going to be destroyed, and if they knew, then why the hell would you send Poe to take down the surface canons from the Destroyer in the first place? There's also no reason to not tell Poe about the plans to leave the main Rebel ship as decoy, he's a high ranking officer, and he would not leak the plans to nobody, the only reason he ended up trying another plan was because he was not told what the plan was, that was a completely stupid way to handle your subordinates, telling them to shut up and do as she says? there's a time for a soldier to follow orders, and there is a time when following orders is just stupid, if the soldier knows the value of holding a position its more likely he would hold it because his morale will be high, Poe's morale was at an all time low, he was not only told he was an idiot for making the first plan successful, but also he was not told what the backup plan was, that made not god dam sense.Finn should have died a hero's dead, and that's that, or if he was not to die, then that whole scene of him trying to kamikaze to stop the laser ramming ray should have been scrapped, It would have added gravitas and weight to the story if he actually was allowed to follow trough, but we can't have that, we need him to be our comic relief...in the next movie...Luke could have been used much better, and his murdering tendencies toward Kylo made no sense in terms of Luke's psychology, Rey gets no training, which means the whole rest of Star War's ideas are effectively erased, and I would be fine with that, this review is not from a person that thinks Star Wars is the best of the best in terms of scifi, I rather watch Arrival or Interstellar for that matter, but if you are going to make the move to erase the older movies themes, then you could have done it in a way that made sense, for starters find a good reason for Kylo to be as deranged as he is, or was, the movie does not give us enough plot to believe Luke would decide to kill Kylo just like that, the motivations of the characters are paper thin. There's not enough plot, and what there is, is poorly thought out, so then the characters end up doing things because they are angry, or sad, or afraid, but the reasons are poorly explained, and thus the suspension of disbelieve is broken.",0

261,"If you're a fan of the originals, you'll probably be disappointed.  Horrible dialogue, no real plot line, still no background to the characters (unless you believe Kylo Ren, in which case it's a waste of a storyline), pointless filler, pointless action (crashing a ship into another to save Finn who miraculously has not a scratch on him), Leia is now Superman?  I personally will not be seeing the third installment.  This is clearly a case of getting you hooked in the first one, but not revealing much in the second so now you have to see the third one for closure.  Only I bet there won't be any closure except in the 100's of offshoots they make as they milk the franchise for all its worth.  I've only ever liked one thing that JJ Abrams has ever touched, and director Rian Johnson has shown himself to be a real jerk when interacting with fans via twitter.To those who say that the originals were just as goofy, etc., yes I agree.  However, kids who watched the originals back in the day are adults now, and if they wanted to do something different, they could have gone down a path to make it more ""adult"".  An example would be Christopher Nolan's Batman vs the garbage from the late-80s & 90s.  I understand Disney bought the franchise, Disney makes kids movies, yada yada, but they could have expanded their business model and broadened their portfolio.",0

263,"THE LEAST JEDI. What an unbelievable sham of a movie camouflaged by gorgeous art direction. I'll give this movie a single start for just existing and the extra one only for how beautifully rendered it is. And that's about all that's right with this one. The Force Awakens rode on the hate for the prequels and an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and got by just rehashing the best parts of the erstwhile first 3 movies. What exactly is Rian Johnson's explanation or motivation to turn a decades-old mythology into his personal playground and how pray did Disney go ahead with this? Characters mouth incredulous dialogue (some of it captioning action on the screen), others throw hissy fits, some others decide to sacrifice themselves at the altar of temporary relief to their armies only to be thwarted by others with secret crushes on them. Backstories and plots drawn up in Force Awakens are decimated into smithereens like Alderaan. Mark Hamill, bless his hamming soul, is a classic 80s actor - unsubtle, upstages co-performers and clearly guns for longer screen time by slowing down dialogue delivery and throwing in a dozen or so pauses, glares and grimaces. His directors in the original trilogy probably recognised this and so gave him tight, sharp scenes to work with. Rian Johnson succumbs to the fanboy-as-director syndrome and lets Mark do his thing hoping that nostalgia will lull us all into not expecting a performance worthy of a 2017 film. Oscar Isaacs makes up for poor writing by being the film's only hormonal teenager stuck in an adult's body. Daisy Ridley starts and ends the film confused. Adam Driver should consider taking Kylo Ren off caffeine. Carrie Fisher reveals a superpower at the most inopportune moment. At which point, I thought Guardians of The Galaxy might make an appearance. Because by then, we'd already been subjected to some dialogue clearly inflicted by JossWheddonitis. If you're going to be honest then call this Star Wars Rebooted or something so true followers like me can make a choice and stay way. This is just dishonest, play-to-the-gallery filmmaking backed by a machinery that knows a billion bucks is out there to be made But here's the truth. Episode 9 is going to struggle at the box office, now that the trust and love for this saga has all but been put to waste.",0
264,"Movie reviewers are becoming completely out of touch with audiences. Last Jedi feels like when the MTV Movie Awards used to parody scenes from popular movies. General Hux getting a crank call on the bridge, Luke throwing away the light saber like trash, then going to milk a sea creature's nipple, Leia flying through space and making fun of her hair style. This isn't supposed to be a throwaway Marvel movie with lots of cheap laughs. Doing so undermines the evil of the villains and makes light of the seriousness of the themes of the movie. The characterizations of Luke and Leia feel false. After watching 5 of her planets blown up, finding out the First Order corrupted her son to kill his father and watching her friends including Ackbar blown into space, the Leia of the original trilogy would be lightspeed ramming Snoke's ship herself not sending a  subordinate to do it. Luke would never attempt to kill his sister's son while he was sleeping, run away to an island to die alone, ignore his sister's call to join the fight, and then refuse to show up in person to protect her like a damn coward. Whomever wrote this movie didn't understand the characters and didn't care about disgracing them in their last scenes.The movie lacks any continuity from the Force Awakens even though they take place moments apart. Why was a map left to find Luke, why is the Resistance completely wiped out, why didn't Hux return to Snoke,  how is Finn and his jacket okay when he just had his spine sliced by Kylo Ren? Plot ideas and interesting characters that Force Awakens created are abandoned with total disinterest (Snoke, Knights of Ren, Phasma). The 3 new hero characters are robbed of major hero moments and are isolated the whole movie. The movie wastes our time with 2 secondary plots that accomplish nothing other than a very cool explosion and a long prequel-esque escapade to a Casino planet. A good story teller would've at least had Leia pilot that ship into Snoke like a mofo and time it so the explosion stuns Snoke, saves Rey, giving Kylo the opportunity to kill Snoke. The way they wrote this movie both the good and bad guys looked weak and stupid when both should be impressive. Finn and Rey's competence in combat against much more experienced fighters remains an ongoing mystery that might just be a result of awful storytelling.The movie is not original either. The entire Rey story is stolen from ESB. She travels alone to a distant plant to meet a strange reclusive Jedi Master for training, while there she discovers an ominous cave that will hint the truth about who she is before disobeying the Jedi Master and confronting an enemy that reveals who her parents are (Dagobah = Ach-To). That is the main plot of ESB beat for beat. Meanwhile the rebels bunkered-in fight AT-AT's on a salt/snow planet that they must retreat for their lives (Crait=Hoth). While visiting a corrupt wealthy planet the good guys meet a shady character they ask for help but he betrays them (Canto Bight=Cloud City). Do not tell me Last Jedi is any more original than Force Awakens.",0

266,"This is a terrible movie and star wars film. The story is stupid. Don't waste your money or time on this movie. Trust me and everyone else in the reviews, there is a reason is has so many bad reviews.",0
267,"As a lifelong fan of the franchise, including The Force Awakens, this is simply an agonizing review to write.  It's tempting to pour out my thoughts in bullet points.  To angrily outline the list of the this film's failures.  And it has so very many. But I will refrain.  The movie catastrophically falls short on every level, in every facet.  Yet I'll attempt to focus on why I feel this way, without cataloging and critiquing particular scenes and decisions.Character development is nearly non-existent.  Daisy Ridley's very-likeable Rey neither grows, learns, or changes in this film.  The few conflicts or challenges she faces are fleeting.  As with the previous film, the Force ""awakens"" in her, with little effort on her part, or any explanation.  She's static.  Her most profound and interesting scenes were her interaction with Adam Driver's character, Kylo Ren. There's a hint at just how intriguing and imaginative the plot *could* have taken with those two.  I was briefly on the edge of my seat. Only to have a boring, predictable ""Good vs. Evil"" outcome.  Wasted opportunity.Jon Boyega's character goes nowhere, in an almost literal sense.  He has an almost-meaningful scene near the end of the film.  Almost.  But he doesn't.  He literally could have remained in his bacta healing-tank the whole film, and it would have made zero difference.When there is character development, it's awful. Poe Dameron, our favorite hotshot fighter pilot from The Force Awakens?  He quickly became my least favorite character.  Oscar Isaac's acting was great.  You'll just question why he was instructed to act that way.Minus a scene or two, don't expect anything new from Leia, and you won't be disappointed.  That's ditto for Supreme Leader Snoke, General Hux, R2-D2, Chewie, Threepio, The First Order, and so on.  The movie simply doesn't have a lot of new information to share, least of all revelations.Mark Hamill and Adam Driver did the best job they could, given the poor script, material, concepts, and erratic timing of the film.  They did excellent, considering with the pittance they had to work with.Oh yeah, there's an actress playing a mechanic.  Seriously, I literally almost hit the ""Submit"" button for this review, before I remembered her, and added this sentence.  That's how important this new character was.The most frustrating fact about this film is that a lot *happens*.  But not a lot *matters*.  Certainly there is no shortage of action, scenes, adventure, parallel plots, characters running around doing things, saying things. Yet roughly 2.5 hours later, when it's all concluded, the movie has gone...?  Nowhere.  Everything is essentially right back where it started.  You've got some powerful, evil First Order.  And you've got some underdog Resistance.  They still don't like each other.Sure, there were some casualties along the way.  But really...they don't matter.  Their loss doesn't change anything, for better or worse.  Our heroes and villains simply haven't accomplished very much, or learned anything, or made any revelations.  ""Hope you enjoyed another movie in the Star Wars universe!"", they seem to shout.  ""We'll give you more of the same in Star Wars 9!"".  And given this movie's ending, the next film could literally be about *anything*.  The Last Jedi leaves you wondering ""Is there genuinely anything left to show or talk about?""  It contains it's own built-in ""reset button"". By the conclusion of your time in the theater, you mentally and emotionally won't care anymore.And that's the *worst* part of this film for me.  It made me not care about Star Wars anymore.  It's infuriating.  I'm left with no desire, curiosity, motivation, or incentive to watch another movie.  Who cares?  To my shock and dismay...not me.  I don't care what happens next.  Even the prequels kept me coming back for more.  This time, there's no new hope.This ends my review, but wait!  Some important news is coming in...Last Jedi Public Service Announcement:  Cute animals are important and should not be harmed!  Don't worry if you miss the message.  It's repeated using at least 3 new adorable species.  At least they don't annihilate stormtroopers with rocks and spears, Ewok-style...Did you like the subtle comedy from The Force Awakens?  Me too!  Prepare (once again), for too much of a good thing.  It's not as bad as Jar Jar Binks, thankfully.  But it's obviously out of place, and you'll feel it instantly.The Last Jedi: Morality and Ethics Review!1) Is it important to obey orders and follow leadership, or follow your heart and to hell with the rules?  Prepare to be wrong, regardless of your answer.2) Is a noble sacrifice, for the greater good, a correct and justifiable decision?  Prepare to be wrong and confused, regardless of your answer.3) Is a preemptive strike morally okay, when the evil is certain?  Prepare for 3 separate, equally plausible, but not-established conclusions!",0

The critic reviews are baffling to me.",0
271,"I really don't understand why critics are praising this film. Leaving aside any Star Wars expectations (I'm fine with something completely different) here are the issues:- Too many characters, not enough character. With about 8 main characters not including our protaganist, there isn't any time for character development.- Having its cake and eating it. There are several moments when something dramatic happens, only for the reveal that it didn't actually happen. By the end I didn't care about anything happening because they killed the impact of any events by reversing everything that happened previously.- Pointless side-plots that went nowhere. You can actually cut every scene with Finn & Rose, and it would make literally no difference to the plot. Nothing they do affects the film in any way.As for Star Wars specific criticisms:- Jedi training is now meaningless. Anyone born with the force can throw stuff around and fly without training.- Kamakazi ship attacks that make every Death Star plot meaningless now, why didn't they just hyperspace fly a ship into the Death Star?This film doesn't work as its own thing, and it doesn't work as a Star Wars film.

The timing.Episode VII ends with Kylo Ren heavily wounded by a bowcaster and a light sabre. Snoke ordered to have him brought to him to finish his training. Also the ultimate weapon of the first order has been destroyed.Propably about half a day later he is fully healed and shows up with a complete fleet, including a not-quite-ultimate battleship at the resistance HQ. Or maybe the resistance was stupid enough to not immediately initiate their GTFO protocols. I'm not sure which would be worse.Well either way, at this point in time the first order has taken control of the galaxy. Yes, the whole galaxy that was pretty free under the protection of the republican fleet a day ago. There are 200 billion suns in our own galaxy, and the first order took control over that amount of systems instantly. Palpatine did that by using an existing power structure that had grown over millenia, and the first order does it by conquest in a snap. There is no way to properly descripe how incredibly stupid this is. If the first order is that powerful, how did the republic ever stop them? How do you fight somebody who, after losing that bs Starkiller base still has the means to do THAT??2. Apparently you can use your hyperdrive to cut right through a vastly larger object with your ship. This of course means that any superweapon could have been easily destroyed by a rusty freighter flown by remote. This alone makes the first order and its fleet of unneccessarily costlly and huge ships a non-issue for anyone with a brain. Sadly nobody in the entire movie has one, or they would have done that with one of the two ships they were abandoning anyway. After all, how would the First Order prevent it? Destroy it? Apparently they can't at that distance. Evade? With a ship broader than the Executor was long??3. Luke Skywalker. This is NOT Mark Hamills fault in any way. He was turned from the incarnation of Hope, someone who thought redeeming Darth Vader was worth a shot, into a nihilistic grouch hiding on an island somewhere in the galaxy. Seriously, its only the empire returning in a more Nazi fashion and his sister fighting for freedom and her life. Who cares, right? It doesn't matter anyway. Also for some reason he thought about killing a teenager in his sleep for having dark thoughts - which is, of course, absolutely irredeemable. Apparently dropping an unstable stone hut on him is so much power he has to hide 'till his death. Oh and he was finished off so his iconic figure doesn't stand in the way of whatever they come up with for IX. Apparently death by meditating is a thing now.4. Physics. No, really.The movie opens up with a battleship being attacked by bombers of the resistance. Which would be no problem - except for the bombers having WWII style bomb bays. What is supposed to drag them out of there and toward the target? There is NO gravity in space. (Not completely true, since that was in orbit, but the effective force of the gravity is zero, or everything would crash on the planet). Even worse, each bomber had about 500 of those bombs. The hell is that supposed to do? The first dozen bombs will explode and either push those coming after them away or outright making them explode outside the target doing nothing at all. And the bombers were HUGE targets. Get a squadron of B-Wings instead. Those are bombers that make sense. Well, anyway, the one bomber that made it blew up that multiple km ship. Apparently hitting it anywhere will cause a chainreaction blowing it up or something.Snokes flagship also doesn't seem to know there is no gravity in space, because its oversized turbolaser shots arc like artillery shells would on a planet.5. Hyperspace tracking.Well, this is not so stupid from a technical point, but massively retarded from a story perspective. Because you see there is a... story arc about only the flagship doing the tracking. But the flagship wasn't there when the rebels fled. So it isn't necessary to track at the starting point. So... hit&run, with X-Wings or otherwise, doesn't work anymore. Any ship approaching a secret rebel base would instantly betray its location. There are only two possibilities for any further movie.I'm only stopping now is because I'm running out of characters. Thats how bad VIII is.",0
281,Terrible movie.  Unlikable characters.  Plot holes.  Skip it.  Save yourself.,0
282,Mary Sue? Check.Still no training? Check.Grows in power with STILL NO TRAINING.Star Wars pilots don't need space suits to walk in the vacuum of space.Bombs...DROP towards a dreadnaught...IN SPACE ! Think about the physics...Maintenance crew chick beats up soldier.Purple admiral is an **** to Poe for no reason at all. And by keeping secrets from him destroys 90% of of the Rebellion.GOOD JOB! ( sarcasm )Apparently the First Order can be distracted by a prank phone call. Soooo funny...( sarcasm )Palpatine wannabe - dies like a moron.Superman Leia.This movie is 3/10 But the amount of IMBECILES voting 10/10 forces me to vote 0/10 to EVEN OUT the stupidity !!,0
283,"Terrible! The movie was disconnected mush - painfully lurching between consumer product placement and future theme park rides. A few sad motivational speeches mixed in. Plot, etc, if any, was laughable. The cinematography was often beautiful, but the end result was garbage: as ridiculous as Space Balls -- just not as funny. I feel bad for all the artists, designers, etc who all must have worked hard on this. Anyway, I'm not an obsessive Star Wars fan, but as a 41 yo, I grew up with these movies. I think this franchise is done for me. Very sad.",0
284,"The Last Jedi is an awful Star Wars movie. It's boring, has too many forced jokes, ignores plot lines set up in The Force Awakens, and disrespects all the films before it.",0
285,"A post modernist take on Star Wars, which makes Rey the equivalent of a toilet bowl in an art museum.  Now we know what a feminist take on Star Wars is like, apparently its like Transformers, but that wouldn't be fair, the robots have more character than the soulless husks of ""identity"" politics we see on screen here. They even brought in a pink hair for good measure, because woman strong!  There are countless things wrong with this movie, but I don't feel like clicking the spoiler box, its a joke to pretend this movie could be spoiled when its already rotten.At this point the rebels #resist are little more than incompetent terrorists led by women, if the goal of these movies was to get me to root for the Empire, congrats, job done.  I can only wish the Empire would win and put this shambling corpse of a franchise out of its misery.Its not so much that the sacred was destroyed, as some people like to mis-characterize fanboy reactions, its that they took something good, something with potential, and they spat all over it with their progressive politics, throwing away things they did not understand had value because their ideology blinds them to human reality, even natural human interaction evades the progressives grasp now.  These are people who believe everyone is the same, yet different, yet interchangeable, their incoherent world view and ignorance of tradition and history yields cultural destruction like this.  The modern Mao's red guard are the Kathleen Kennedy and #imwithher types, and you are seeing now why they cannot be trusted with power.",0
286,"Oh this is hilarious . . . Rian Johnson is going to desecrate Star Wars and then go on to make his own trilogy. Well guess what? The joke is going to be on him when his new trilogy comes out and so few people show up that it absolutely bombs. Last Jedi can be summed up in one scene at the very beginning of the movie: Luke tosses the lightsaber over his back. There was so much in this movie that was blatantly irreverent. I feel sorry for the director who has to try and pick up the pieces with episode 9 because, unlike episode 7, I really don't see what could happen next, nor do I really have a desire to.",0
287,unwatchable unwatchable unwatchable unwatchable unwatchable unwatchable etc,0
288,This is without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen. The story is non existent. If you look at the beginning and the end of the movie the only difference is that Luke and Snoke died. Literally nothing has happened. The movie has 0 character development. Rey is the most boring protagonist in the history of cinema. Finn and Rose are on completely irrelevant sub-plot that does nothing for the movie. This movies is a complete **** with the only decent things being the music and a couple of special effect.And thanks to disney for **** PORGS that add nothing to the movie other then to sell some **** toys. Unbelievable.,0
289,EPiC FaIL. Totally crapped. Franchise is ultimately dead. Never watch the IX.,0
290,"I REALLY want to unsee this. My eyes bleed.. They ruined the setting, completely ruined the Lore, and just to hurt me even more - they've replaced it all with ABSURD.",0
291,"JJ Abrams provided Disney with a good start to a new trilogy.  It set the new trilogy.  He set the next director up with what should have been a slam dunk — just execute on the well developed ideas in the Force Awakens.  This movie is such utter garbage that it defies explanation.  Too many plot holes.  Far too much poorly timed comedy.  Too much politicizing.  And worst of all no real character development.The way they portrayed Luke was a total disaster and was not believable, given his already strongly developed character. Total waste of time and money.  Terrible movie.",0
292,"Rian Johnson said he didn’t make this movie ‘to give the fans what they wanted to see’ and Mark Hamill said when he read the script he was “insulted”. So should we be surprised that this movie has gotten so poorly rated by fans? Because of the innumerable plot holes and invalidating 40 years of Star Wars history this movie is beyond bad. Surprising the audience is one thing but this is just denigrating history.I think most fans understand and agree that the definition of Star Wars movies needs to eventually expand and it naturally would have. However, you can’t just take a shortcut to get there by retconning the 40-year history of the Skywalker saga. There is still going to be hundreds more Star Wars movies made by Disney you would think they could have left the Skywalker Saga alone to some extent. I suppose The Force Awakens direction unfortunately put all this in motion but Last Jedi still did not have to so completely invalidate the importance of George Lucas’ Skywalker saga. I have no idea how episode 9 can possibly fix any of this without coming off overly contrived. The first 6 episodes of the Skywalker saga and Rogue One ultimately all lead to a very satisfying logical cohesive conclusion. Disney having a new director pop in to each new episode in the new trilogy and take it in their own personal direction clearly does not lend itself to creating a cohesive new trilogy story. This movie amazingly also retcons most of anything you would care about from The Force Awakens too. I agree surprising the audience is valuable but when that is achieved by just simply saying everything before me is just not valuable anymore that comes off as cheap, unearned, insulting and just poor story telling. This movie sadly as many have stated in a way destroys Star Wars. Things that are no longer valuable in Star Wars if we are to believe this movie: Jedi, goodness, fighting for good, lightsaber battles, Anakin, Vader, Luke, Jedi training, respecting tradition, Luke being a Jedi, Yoda thinking training is important, shields, respect for the chosen one fulfilling the prophecy and bringing balance to the force, respect for the chosen one’s lightsaber. If none of these things are valuable anymore then why did Disney in even buy Star Wars? It’s as if this movie is stuck up on itself and thinks it’s more important than all the other movies before it. This movie actively makes you try to feel bad for believing in anything that came before it. This movie in a vacuum still does not deserve to be rated well for its innumerable plot hole issues but ultimately this movie deserves a negative rating because of what it represents to Star Wars as a whole. These are dark times for Star Wars.",0
293,"Disney has clearly strong armed or threatened the critics into writing positive review for their cash cow.  This is not merely a terrible Star Wars movie, it is a terrible movie period.",0
294,"Rarely do I get pissed off about something, that I write a review for it, but The Last Jedi is one of such occasions.This movie destroys everything, that I held dear about Star Wars. The entire plot is an incoherent mess from start to finish. It's filled with plotholes, inconsistencies and irrational decisions by the characters.It doesn't just ""subverts expectations"", it completely goes against all established lore of the Star Wars universe, craps on the characters of the original trilogy and delivers nothing that was built up in The Force Awakens.Admittedly, I didn't like The Force Awakens either, but at the very least, you could appreciate the effort, that was put into ""recreating the Original Trilogy magic"", when creating that film.Unfortunately, it seems like Rian Johnson not only did not see Original Trilogy, but The Force Awakens as well.No, we didn't have ""unreasonable expectations"". When J.J. Abrams hyped up the questions, such as ""Who are the Rey's parents?"", ""Who is Snoke?"", ""Where are the Knights of Ren?"", ""Why did Luke go into exile?"", we rationally expected answers to these questions. We assumed, that they will be answered in the next film of the trilogy.Unfortunately, Disney made an absolutely idiotic decision to switch Directors for each film of the new trilogy, and gave them complete free range of what to do. Unsurprisingly, when Rian Johnson took over, he made his absolute best to destroy everything that J.J. set up.That was me speaking as a Star Wars fan. For me, as a moviegoer, this movie is just as bad.It was unnecessary long. The 80% of the movie is a boring chase of two puny fleets, during which the bad guys just shoot at our main characters from time to time.It is filled with ridiculous humor. From the starting scenes of the movie, with Poe's ""yo mama"" joke, to the Luke's first scene, where he throws out his father's lightsaber like it's Pirates of the Carribean, the jokes and quips are absolutely out of place.The side story of Finn and Rose is as boring as it is unnecessary. It takes around third of the movie, and in the end, results in absolutely nothing.The decisions of the main characters are absolutely stupid. Why didn't Admiral Holdo tell Poe her plan? If it weren't for her, the entire Finn and Rose subplot wouldn't even exist. In the end, she doomed the fleet, because DJ spoiled the Resistance plan, and then she waited for way too long to even do anything about it.But more importantly, the decisions and portrayal of Luke is disrespectful to the franchise and the fans. From a symbol of hope, the man, who saw light in Darth Vader, second most evil person in the universe, Luke became a bitter old man, who decided to murder hiw own nephew, while he's asleep, just because he had some dark thoughts. And by the end of the film, after a completely anticlimactic final battle between Luke and Kylo, he just decided to die because he was a bit tired.The only two good parts of the movie are the music and visuals. John Williams' score is as always epic and majestic, which could not even be attributed to this movie, because the pieces are mostly from the previous films. As for the visuals, I didn't expect anything else.After what I've seen, I'm completely uninterested in the future of Star Wars universe. I refuse to support any future movies, and I'm quite certain, that Rian Johnson either hates Star Wars, or didn't see it at all.",0
295,"The opening crawl decides that, contrary to the previous film, the resistance has actually LOST and now the First Order has completely taken over the galaxy. How the force did that happen? It seems every one of these films starts with “about everything that happened before? Yeah, we’ve nuking that.” This is then followed by a ridiculous scene involving yo mama jokes and the resistance losing all of its bombers because they apparently can’t move more than 2 inches per minute.The first order destroys one of the resistance flagships, and Leia is flung out into space and dies…BUT WAIT! She now has mad Force skills and can not only survive in space, she can FLY LIKE SUPERMAN through it. I mean what the serious **** She falls into a coma after this, and the resistance is ruled by Kathleen Kennedy’s Real Grannies of Outer Space, who don’t take no lip, new ideas, or sensible talk from these young boy whippersnappers who just need to get off my bridge! Pretty much 80% of the resistance and every important person who isn’t Poe is now female.Finn wakes up from a coma, and goes into Jar Jar Binks mode. Then meets Poe and decides he’s gotta go tip his fedora at Rey because reasons. So he sneaks off the ship but before he gets there he gets one-upped by Disney’s Asian Market 03, who suddenly decides that this is a quest she wants to be on. They go on said quest, which drags the entire film to a halt (because it was apparently not slow enough with the resistance literally just drifting in space) and makes some of the most outrageous claims about rich people ever put to film. Seriously, this is about a half hour of the film and adds nothing to the plot and changes nothing.Back on the ship, Poe leads a mutiny against Kathleen’s holodeck projections and it feels pretty good to see them go down. But then Leia wakes up and tells the youngin’ to pipe down cause they DO have a plan that they told no one for no reason. But it’s a **** idea, like everything KK does.Rey is off trying to get Luke to come back and be a Jedi. But Luke is sick of that nonsense and instead goes and milks a giant grey creature with huge **** and then drinks the milk right fresh. A horde of unspeakably annoying bird-groundhogs convince Chewbacca to become vegan. Rey manages to get Luke to tell her to “reach out and feel the Force” in what in a scene that is not terrible. But that’s the end of her training. She shows off how awesome she is with a lightsaber (which she never got trained in) and later kicks Luke’s ass in a duel because this movie hates your intelligence. After a while Rey gets bored of Luke not agreeing with her every whim and decides to leave the planet. Then ghost Yoda shows up as a nearly immobile puppet with worse ghost effects than in ROTJ, and blows up a tree containing the last of the Jedi archives (because this is totally something Force ghosts can do) while telling Luke that Rey doesn’t need to learn anything. Because obviously she’s perfect. Hold on a damn second! Did they just have Yoda say lines that Palpatine said to Anakin? WTF?During the time that Rey is with Luke, she starts communicating telepathically with Kylo Ren. These conversations are the best part of the film and actually make Kylo a less hateable character. You find out the Luke tried to murder Kylo (because the filmmakers hate Luke apparently) and that’s why he's all genocidal. But Rey has seen the OT and decides that Kylo can be turned back to the light, so she goes to see him. Kylo takes her to Snoke, and then Rey persuades Kylo to kill Snoke. Ending any chance of charactibility or discovery of who the **** Snoke is. Then a bunch of guys in awfulplastic outfits (makes me miss the CGI clones) attack Rey and Kylo and of course Rey is the better fighter and has to save Kylo. But after that Kylo decides he doesn’t want to go back to the light side so Rey leaves the ship and goes to join the rest of the resistance.The cunning plan of the Granny Gang is to go to a planet right next to the First Order fleet and hope they don’t get destroyed. This plan goes about as well as you’d expect and most of the resistance characters are killed. Then the FO lands their new 2nd-Film-in-the-Series AT-ATs and decides to blast open the resistance hideout. Finn decides to do something useful for once and attempts to suicide himself into the FO cannon but Asian Demographic 03 stops him for no goddamn reason and the FO blows open the door.Suddenly Luke shows up and challenges Kylo to a duel but PLOT TWIST he’s not really there! He’s just projecting himself across the galaxy because that’s TOTALLY something that is possible now. Kylo throws another tantrum, MaRey-Sue uses more advance Force powers she has no training for, Luke just dies because **** it, and the last tiny group of resistance gets away – but not before announcing they are called Rebels now.",0
296,"A joke of a movie, literally everything has comedy awkwardly injected into it.  Virtually nothing in the film felt like it could be taken seriously.  If you wanted a Star Wars film where every character plays an alter ego of Jar Jar Binks, this is the film for you.The plot and plot holes are terrible also, the First Order continues to get its ass kicked in every encounter, yet we are told to believe that hope is near lost because of 'reasons'.  With no sense of plot, the entire story lacks any weight, and in the end, events that were supposed to be critical to the film ultimately felt very cheap.",0

The film is filled with inconsistent plot points and a completely illogical storyline. This is certainly NOT a true Star Wars film in my opinion. The Director/Writer and Disney completely miss the mark here. In my opinion, this is the last Star Wars film I will be seeing.",0
300,"Rian Johnson failed to approach this as the second part of a three act trilogy, respecting the films that have come before. By throwing out everything set up from TFA, criminally wasting many established characters, and introducing pointless new ones he's created a mess. Topped with half baked political commentary and cringe worthy jokes sprinkled into every dramatic scene, you are left with a truly terrible script. God awful writing that should never have made it passed first draft. Bitterly disappointing.",0

Abrams, you are our only hope.",0
303,"Shameful, absolutely shameful.  I have never felt compelled to leave a movie review, much less on a Star Wars movie.

304,"Unfortunately this was not a film film for me a 40 year old fan of the originals. The out of place humour belittled characters and destroyed any dramatic tension. Luke Skywalker's character transformation was badly conceived and his conclusion unsatisfying, why go to the cinema to see that ending. There were numerous plot holes, one of the worst lead to the whole Casino world story which gave me flash backs to the Phantom menace. The way the force was handled in the movie didn't align with how it worked in earlier films. I simply wasn't entertained. Won't be rushing to see more of these.",0
305,"Truly the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Either the critics have a very low bar, or they just aren't Star Wars fans--fans who love the characters, and the grand themes of the franchise, as opposed to 'fans' who just want to see laser sword fights and space battles. The Last Jedi is for the latter - empty, hollow, corporate garbage.",0
306,"First of all, I'm not a bot, I'm not alt-right and I'm not here to troll. I just want to give you my story. We were about 15 people watching The Last Jedi, ranging from guys in their early 40ies having grown-up with Star Wars to 20-somethings with basically no idea whats the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek. None of us would qualify as a hardcore fan-boy and nobody had some kind of fan fiction in his mind. But its fair to say, that everybody having seen TFA was expecting answers.After the movie we compared our thoughts and rated the movie. The best vote came from someone in her twenties, she thought the movies was ok-ish, but she wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to friends. This could translate to something like 4 stars, maybe 5, if you feel generous. Worst reaction was along the lines of ""what a pile of garbage"", so all other ratings were below that, maybe in the range of 1-3 stars. Drilling further down, everybody felt insulted by the same things, independent of ""Star Wars experience"". A nice quote from that evening was ""how stupid does Disney believe me to be?"". So all of us were offended by immense amount of plotholes, absurd storytelling, meaningless story arcs and plain silly behaviour of basically anybody in the movie. We couldn't identify a single character showing something like common sense, or signs of intelligence, or basic military training.None of us felt insulted by the choices made by Rian Johnson, all of us were good with the direction of the story, with the single exception of Luke trying to murder his nephew in his sleep. However, none of us felt that the story was new, or original, or unexpected. Basically its an amalgamation of The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and Battlestar Galactica, especially the episode 33. We had this ""been there done that"" feeling quite a lot.Finally, most of us were annoyed by the forced humor, calling it misplaced. Star Wars was always kind of funny, but a lot of the jokes simply felt plain wrong and out of character. Maybe on a side-note: 2 guys swore to never drink milk again. On a personal note: That was the single-most disgusting scene I have seen last year.So whats the verdict? From my point of view The Last Jedi is maybe the worst movie of the year. Interestingly it is not failing because of whats happening (story, characters, choices...) is failing because of how (no logic, plotholes, retconning lore...) it happens. Just a few examples: - What is the logic behind trying to sneak of a cruiser in smaller freighters, when you are within viewing distance???- How is it possible, that a fleet of Star Destroyers with 1.500 turbo laser cannons each can't overload the shields of an old cruiser???- Why don't send 2 ships ahead at lightspeed creating an effective trap???- Why not simply launch all TIEs in the first place? The first order fleet should have at least 1.000...- How can DJ betray a plan, Finn and Rose don't know and haven't talked about??? Was he the only guy looking out of the window???- Why do several attack walkers with the order to kill everybody from the resistance not shoot Finn and Rose???- How is possible to run severals miles faster than giant attack walkers while carrying someone and arriving just in time to be evacuted with everybody else???- Why do you risk the single most important mission for the survival of the resistance with wrong parking???- Why is Snoke loosing at the same time his common sense, his peripheral vision, his hearing and his feeling of the force???- How can someone with no training overcome half a dozen highly trained personal guards meant as a last defense???- If there is blaster-proof armor, why not issue it to all stormtroopers???- How do you survive a direct hit by 2 torpedos, the vacuum of space while already being frozen over and how do you open a door without everybody being sucked into space???",0
307,Star Wars but for dumb children of the Logan Paul era. Full of stupid jokes and bad direction. I couldn't get past the first 5 minutes. A big disappointment after TFA.,0
308,"Esta película no tiene salvación, siendo una autentica mierda.A nivel de película no es entretenida para nada, a nivel de coherencia presenta incoherencia en prácticamente todas las escenas, a nivel de historia no tiene ningún sentido con la pelicula anterior, a nivel de lore de Star Wars se carga todo lo establecido en los últimos 30 años.Lo mejor que se puede hacer con esta película es hacer como si nunca hubiera existido.",0
309,"Confusing, no direction, and absolutely difficult to watch, and much more difficult to reflect on. The way Luke's character is totally stripped of its original charm in the original trilogy is just sickening. Casual fans might like it, but I would warn devoted fans of the original lore to avoid this mess if you haven't already seen it.",0
310,"It was a horrible film, so many missed opportunities to expand the Star Wars Universe lost forever. It had a terrible plot, childish characters and a ""Mary Sue"" protagonist - And don't even tell me she is not one, because years on the desert would make her only good at fighting and extremely greed. I hope that this 3rd trilogy or at least from this second movie on, to suffer a reboot. And I can say that I will not be getting to the theaters to watch episode IX nor anything else until things significantly changes at disney. Hey disney! do not spend your precious money on episode IX, reboot episode VIII !",0
311,"I am now convinced that Disney will kill Star Wars. The latest movie is absolutely lacking the heart and soul of Star Wars. The plot is so convoluted and several events take place that should make you question numerous events not just in this movie but also in past movies too. Just massive plot holes. The Last Jedi completely tramples the lore of Star Wars. The mythos, the ""facts,"" the importance of Star Wars and its past. The performances are well done, individual moments and scenes are amazing even, and overall the movie cinematically looks great. However, as a whole package, it does not work because several of the most important components of any good movie are missing. For Last Jedi, it is story, heart, impact to certain character's motivations. I am avoiding spoilers but nearly step by step, scene by scene, anyone could rip this movie apart. Literally, ""THAT MAKES NO SENSE!"" Consider Vice Admiral Holdo's impact to the movie for a moment, why wasn't this ""trick"" done over and over again in space combat? Why not against the Death Stars? Why was the trench run even needed then? There are other examples but attempting to avoid spoilers as previously stated.I greatly fear for the entirety of the Star Wars Saga. At this point, I can definitely say I miss George Lucas.",0
312,"It's the cinematic equivilent of when Coca Cola changed their recipe/formula to 'New Coke...'    This whole sequal trilogy should have started with the events leading up to The Force Awakens. They clearly wanted a new and younger cast to market and a new and younger audience to market to. A mistake. Star Wars hit the sweet spot where everyone can enjoy it. It transcends, it's generational, it's mythic. The Lord of The Rings has the same type of appeal, books and the films. The Hobbit is more of a children's book but still appeal and 'that' trilogy of films is an acknoweldged disaster.             The majority of plot points set up in The Force Awakens are not followed. They nare discarded or are subverted for the sake of being unexpected. The map to Luke Skywalker for example. I doubt Luke was in permanent exile, more like taking time out soul searching and looking for deeper answers? Why have map in the first place? Just in case? No. What's wrong with many of these so called critics? No play, no premiere, no back stage pass etc? I doubt Luke would have even attacked Ben Solo first? ""Knowledge and defence, never attack."" Character decisions deliberately written in the opposite way to be 'different' and 'unexpected' is ultimately out of character. Sure subvert some story points, writing 101, but with so many aspects altered to fit this new narrative and regardless of what came befor makes little to no sense. The humour in this film is pure parody, farce, mistimed and mistolaced. ""Use the farce."" I was expecting, ""I can't breathe in this thing."" ""It's only a flesh wound."" It's not Star Wars.  The music is superb by John Williams and stands out compared to The Force Awakens. The film is generally an aesthetically authentic, good looking and well shot film. Millions of dollars on screen but overall the feel is cheap due to story and charactisation.    I preferred the pacing over TFA. To some extent.TFA was action every couple lines of dialogue. ""Yeah I knew Luke."" Aaannd aaaction. Rathtar scene, oh my god! The film within the film subplot with Finn and Rose on Canto Bright is dreadful. It slows the whole film down and makes it too long.           The Force connection communication Betwen Rey and Kylo Ren is straight out of Twilight. It's not Star Wars. The Leia 'space' moment and she's out for the count for most of the film. Admiral AckbarCaptain PhasmaWhy did Yoda use the persona (Hmm laugh) he used to test Luke when they first met? That persona was an act.Luke is Luke at the end but it's too late. Wasted and if what happens to him even needed at all? Now that would be different to keep him around. Gandalf him back.I agree it's not what many Star Wars fans wanted or expected. There are so many things wrong with this film that I cannot give it a pass.   I am not a bot or politically affiliated with anyone or anything. I felt the need to say something. It's not just a film, especially when you grew up with all the toys etc. It's part of the fabric of our story telling culture. I am/was an Original Trilogy kid, 'fanboy,' 'purist,' whatever the pithy noun/adjective/pejorative is this week. Time to be counted.Equality cannot be achieved at the expense of others.",0
313,"Looks like meta-critics were paid for praising reviews. If you'd take your time to read those, the praise is fake and bloated as **** This movie was at super very best: below average.",0
314,"Do you like Star Wars? Then don't watch this travesty.I'm tired of having politics and ideology of ANY kind served with my movies (even more if in subtext - don't f***ing insult my intellect), and this one is greasy, burnt and bloated with it.That aside, the characters are even duller than in VII (the only passable ones are completely irrelevant to the movie), the story is comatose-inducing and even Mark Hamill said he hates what they did to Luke - that this... Thing... Is not ""his"" Luke.Don't waste your time with this one. Really.",0
315,"A disappointment in almost every conceivable way. Worse than the prequels. I will be fair though, the slave children. You know, the ones that are still slaves at the end of the movie even though the horse-monsters were freed.  They were great.",0
316,"The only reasons I am even giving this movie any points are because Luke was there and for the visually arresting fight and battle scenes.This movie trolled fans from beginning to end. Fans go into a movie expecting a general direction. For example, you watch Return of the King (3rd LOTR movie) expecting Frodo to finish destroying the ring. The Last Jedi is like Frodo saying **** it, forget that we all agreed to form the fellowship, nothing matters, I'm going home, the end.They seemed so obsessed with subverting audience expectations. Instead of trying to exceed audience expectations to deliver an amazing movie, they instead chose to go the opposite direction of what fans want.I'm no marketing expert, but creating a product designed to piss off your customers seems like a bad idea. And then they go blaming the customers for being haters and idiots for not liking the sh!t they were trying to sell.",0
317,"So, writing my first... anything really. Before I place my own thoughts into type, I would comment on what I have been reading of others. When I read comments by those who dislike the film, they write just that. They reveiw and comment on the film shown uupon the screen.Those who like the film? They talk about everything else and every other movie of the franchise instead of the flim which had been upon the screen.The ""Last Jedi"" is, in effect, Darth Nihilus as if such a character could be a movie (Or anything, really given the nature of what Darth Nihilus is)The 'Last Jedi' is such a complete 'Anti' film that critics can seemigly do nothing BUT compare it to EVERYthing else in Star Wars because... there simply is NO movie (Effectivly) on the screen too review. This film truly has nothing to offer in and of itself that one could class as a 'Movie'. It has no plot. At least, nothing over arching that could be considered as a plot.It has no real dialouge. Characters seeminly 'One liner' words at each other in sentences form, meaning passes... but nothing is actually meaningfully or coherantly discussed between characters.The characters? They effectivly do nothing. They effectivly acheive nothing.At the beginning of the film the Resistance is fleeing from the First Order. At the end of the Film the Resistance is fleeing from the First Order.At the beginning of the film Kylo Ren is a force of darkness. At the end of the film Kylo Ren is a force of darkness.Characters that are introduced during this movie... are no longer there when the movie ends.And so the list of 'Anti' film goes on.The makers of the last three films have succeeded in acheiveing something within myself that I truly never thought I would see. That I no longer care what happens to or with the franchise. A better title for the film would have been simply;""Star Wars, meh.""",0

I don't know one person that would honestly say they liked this movie.

TLJ in my opinion is a worst movie that episodes 1-3.",0
319,Shockingly bad.  Best could be said is that the screenplay was written to promote the sell of cheap Disney after-market merchandise.  The movie itself isn't even worth reviewing.  It unceremoniously ends the franchise.,0

That or perhaps let Marcia Lucas edit another Star Wars film, but even then she could probably not do much with the content being created under Kathleen Kennedy.",0
323,"I have never made a review on this web site and i dont expect to make another. I felt compelled to this time however due to the PR spin the powers that be are trying to put on this movie. The fans are upset. The fans do not like this movie. I (and many others i am sure) are done with the star wars franchise.This movie completely **** on the previous material. This movie has little to no respect for the source material and is essentially a long toy commercial. Nothing eventful happens in this movie. nothing. Luke dying isnt even important. He wasnt there to start with. Now he is dead. The situation didnt change. The ""rebellion"" is in the same **** shape as when the movie started. Apparently, destroying the first orders super weapon in episode 7 didnt phase the first order. It didnt inspire the galaxy to fight back like destroying the death star inspired people. The characters in this movie do not have to actually work for any rewards. i would make the same claim to the **** director of this movie. He really phoned it in. Kylo has had training since he was young in the ways of the force and in combat. Rey is apparently on par with him with no training. I hear all the trendies defending this by saying ""the force made her stronger"" well thats great. She has more force power now. wonderful. it doesnt mean **** if she doesnt KNOW HOW TO USE IT. i could give you all the gasoline you could hold. without a car, tell me how fast that gas makes you go? Just ""having power"" doesnt mean **** unless you know how to use it. There are so many things i could point out here that are just simply idiotic but i dont believe i am going to be changing peoples minds. Either you like it or you dont. It just seems to me that everyone who ""liked it"" only look on the surface of things. they are entertained by pretty lights, a ****ty romance that they are setting up between ray and kylo. the ****ty romance that happened all of a sudden between the fat asian plumber and the token black guy. then the inevitable love triangle cause the token black guy fell in love with ray in the same super fast what the **** way in the first movie as fat asian plumber did in this. This is the problem with fandoms getting into the mainstream. Instead of actually having to have quality in writing/story telling, the mega corps can just cash in on the trendies and the name of the product. RIP star wars. i wont be seeing another movie in this brand.TL;DR - the fans are actually upset. dont let your own spin fool you disney, you ****ed up.",0
324,"Lamentablemente se siente muy forzada la presencia de algunos personajes. Hay demasiadas inconsistencias en la trama. Poca acción, ninguna línea memorable y Disney está únicamente usando el acreditado nombre de Star Wars para ganar dinero. No se respeta a la franquicia. Para los niños es una genial película pero para gente con criterio más desarrollado, definitivamente es una película POBRE. Se salva un tanto por los efectos especiales y por Mark Hamill. De lo contrario, no vean esta película.",0
325,"As bad as the movie is with the many valid reasons people have expressed for not liking it, when the dust settles I think this movie will be seen as an impostor: Being advertised under the Star Wars brand but without the heart and soul of the original movies. What’s even worse is the fact that Star Wars has now become a politicised propaganda weapon to influence the minds of the young.The OT became so popular because at its core was a simple story of the archetypal struggle between good and evil told through the intergenerational relationships of the Skywalker family. It’s no accident that George Lucas was able to craft such a powerful story. He was an excellent student of Joseph Campbell and anyone who’s read Campbell’s ‘The Hero With a Thousand Faces’ will have gained a deeper appreciation of not just the OT, but story-telling in general. Hollywood has either become incapable, or more likely, unwilling to produce stories that emotionally resonate with audiences as they don’t want to inspire, only to mindlessly entertain. This is at the core of the continuing decline of Hollywood. The same slow decline and desolation has occurred within the music industry over the past few decades.As a vegan I care deeply about animal welfare, as do the vast majority of people. However, the scene with Chewie and the roast porg totally undermined the characterisation of Wookies. As Han Solo told the droids in A New Hope, Chewie had been known to pull people’s arms out of their sockets for no other reason than mild irritation. Did this scare you as a kid in the 80s? Or course not, it made the Wookies seem more formidable as allies in the fight against the seemingly unstoppable evil Empire. Disney’s infantilisation of children does them a disservice in the long run.In many ways this is a movie of its time, whereas the OT is timeless. The great hope is that Generation Z will see the effect that cultural marxist poison has had on the Millennial generation and become immune to the propaganda. There is hope that this is happening already.I’ll finish with a note about the character assassination of Luke and will echo what another reviewer stated, ‘The obvious deliberate deconstruction of one of the most positive male archetypal characters of the last 50 years within popular culture is a cultural marxist’s wet dream.’ Stories about idealised heroes following their own Hero’s Journey are as old as culture itself. Myths help us to understand our own natures as we struggle along our own journey arcs. Disney going their own way with new characters within the SW Universe is fine but not if it means the destruction of what came before. Nothing can justify what they did with this beloved character. They should never have brought the old characters back if this was what they were going to do to them. As a lifelong massive SW fan, it pains me to say the same thing about the movies in general.",0
326,"I didn't like The Last Jedi because it is a deeply cynical and nihilistic post-modern deconstruction of the Campbell hero myth.A lot of criticism of TLJ has focused on its gaping plot holes.  I’m not going to do that here because most people dont really care about gaping plot holes if a movie delivers a good time and a solid message.  The other criticisms you hear are about ”poorly written characters”, ”bad sense of humor”, or “pointless side plots”.  In fact, all three of those are symptoms of the underlying nihilism of the film.REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERSIt’s not that the humor in the film isn’t funny. Often, it does make us laugh in the moment, but almost invariably serves to undermine the authority and gravitas of a character, rendering him impotent, which instinctively rubs some people the wrong way.  In the first scene, Poe makes an absolute mockery of General Hux.  How can we take Hux seriously after that? Finn runs around naked in a leaking bacta suit. Chewbaccas power is drained by porgs.  Snokes a joke. Luke’s lightsaber is treated like garbage. And, of course, Luke Skywalker is ruthlessly and vulgarly humiliated at every opportunity. Vulnerability in characters can humanize, making them sympathetic (think about how your felt when Snoke mocked Ren’s mask), but it’s hard to look silly and intimidating at the same time. In contrast, the humor in the original trilogy was almost always either romantic banter or a repair to defuse a tense situation.Characters seem thin because nothing they do matters and nothing about them matters. Family doesnt matter.  Rank doesnt matter. Relationships dont matter.  Heros dont matter. The most sympathetic character in TLJ is Kylo Ren as he sinks into the deep, abiding nihilism the film celebrates. Let the past die.  Kill it if you have to.The only thing the good guys have going for them is the Force, which is a stand-in for deus-ex machina.  The Force provides.  Rey doesnt need a family nor a backstory nor training nor wasted time with self-improvement because the Force does all the work for her. There is no true struggle for the good.  Rather, the film posits that there is no good.  No evil for that matter.  Its all subjective. We are all in a galactic hamster wheel in which nothing ultimately matters. THATS the lesson Canto Bight teaches us through Rose and Finn.  Cant find the expert youre looking for? Who cares, there are no experts, anyone will do, any random thief. The Force provides!  Obviously, Rose and Finns mission is an abject failure and they learn nothing. They congratulate themselves that at least they saved the space ponies, but its not like the animals wont immediately be recaptured, and they did nothing at all for the slave children. Its no coincidence that Benicio Del Toros nihilist DJ (Dont Join) saunters away rich without a scratch on him. That guy really gets it!Look at how the film plays with the notion of self-sacrifice for the greater good, one of the classic hallmarks of a hero myth:Paige Ticos self-sacrifice is meaningless. The dreadnought is easily replaced. Many rebels die. Poe is dressed down and demoted (but not so youd notice-- his demotion is also meaningless. Whats rank?).Holdos self-sacrifice is meaningless. The rebel hiding spot is immediately discovered.Fins attempt at self-sacrifice would have been meaningless, if not for Rose interrupting his effort and explaining how pointless it all is.The lesson for Kylo Ren was that he should not have allowed himself to be distracted by Luke.  Luke was only an illusion, a relic with no substance, no real power. Apparently, he was all but dead already. If Ren had only followed his own advice and Let the Past Die, he would have triumphed and crushed the rebels.I learned that since Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and rejection of Lucas, there has been no master plan for the new trilogy nor its ancillary projects.  Rather, Disney's Kathleen Kennedy has been constructing a multi-billion dollar write-around, with each successive writer/director told to do as they liked, with no regard for continuity, only to be fired mid-stride if she didn't like what they were up to.  Abrams did what he does and constructed a mystery box out of ""The Force Awakens"", questions without answers à la ""Lost"".  Now, Rian Johnson, using Kylo Ren as his personal stand-in, has deconstructed and demolished that box and has built nothing at all to replace it.""The Last Jedi"" takes a treasure chest with seven movies' worth of content in it, dumps it in the dirt, shows us the empty bottom, and jokes about it.  We're supposed to admire how clever that is, while not questioning what we are to do with these empty boxes.   Kylo Ren's mission to kill the past is complete. I didn't like it.",0
327,"Disclaimer: I would like to say that I am not a super fan of Star Wars but I keep up with the storyline like any average viewer. I usually find the Star Wars movies entertaining. I guess I am a casual fan and I am always excited for new action-adventure movies, which includes SW.With that said, this movie was trash compared to other Star Wars films. IMO, the worst of all Star Wars movies and aside from special effects, probably one of the worst movies of the year. I know that seems crazy to say because it's freaking Star Wars...but everyone I talk to feels the same way. Disney is trying to force characters that are not needed on people and they are not memorable at all. Just stick with Rey, Finn, and Kylo. Seriously. The flow of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. Even I not being a superfan has no clue how Rey can be so powerful with the Force and have literally like 2 minutes of ""training"" with Luke. It's absolutely insane. It literally flowed like an off-kilter anime or something. The jokes were cringey and not suitable for Star Wars. Luke was cringey as hell. The casino planet was so shoe-horned in in order to give Rose a backstory, nothing made sense. And why is Finn so amazed and in awe and wanting to play at the casino when they are in a dire situation that needs to be fixed in a couple of hours!? The movie is very ""I'm adult do as I say, stop being rambunctious"" or something. I understand Disney is over this now but come on...it's so forced! I wish Kylo and Lukes battle was an actual battle. And finding out who Rey's parents are is such a let down. And I'm not even going to get started on Snoke...LMAO seriously, it was like the executives had a meeting and pieced together way too many plot points and boom...there is your 2 hour and 30 minute drawn out movie let's hurry up and film it lol. The best thing that came from this movie is the trailer...the trailer is literally so much better than the movie.",0

There is no payoff to anything that was promised by the first movie in the new trilogy and to my discontent, there is no narrative coherence. Also but not the worst: cringy, childish/cartoonish and partially obstrusive humor, strange choices made by the characters, hollow performances, weird romance and a pointless 30 minute detour? Why can Rei use all the jedi tricks without proper training? Purple Lady had a very late realization. Casino planet? A lot of wasted potential. I'm flabbergasted. Switching directors mid-trilogy seems to be a poor choice in hindsight. I think I just should stop caring, it's not worth it anymore.",0

337,"This movie changed  Luke Skywalker from a brave Truth seeker fighting evil into one about a confused wastrel whose only wisdom is ""everything's relative dude."" By extension this movie transformed Star Wars from a story about spiritual warriors seeking a higher truth and defending the galaxy from Luciferian evil to a story about social Justice warriors. All meaning has been sucked out of the myth. The deep religious undertones that made this story so resonant have been replaced with nihilism, post-modernism and cultural Marxism. It is a direct assault on everything this myth stood for for forty years and if Disney thought people were too stupid to notice they were wrong.",0

340,"""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to"". These words, spoken by Kylo, undoubtfuly relate to the Star Wars saga after 2015 and the premiere of TFA. The saga is in agony. It kills the heroes of old you once related to. It will kill anything you held dear about the old movies. And you, dear viewer, should kill any hope you may still have for the SW tale to continue in a right direction taking into account that the last episode of the newest trilogy will be in the hands of Jar Jar Abrams (who started this mess), and the entire consecutive trilogy spawned in the sick mind of RJ - creator of the latest film - TLJ.TFA, longly awaited, twisted the galaxy far far away that we knew. It was a calque of ANH gone wrong. I have posted my review of it 2 years ago, so will not go into detail about that movie. The only thing left when I went out of the cinema (did not buy the BR/DVD to see - not worth the money and my time) was hope. Hope for the next episode to set things right. To create new characters who you may relate to. To create the new EU (the old one Disney crossed out when buying the franchise). RO launched in the meantime and it fueled that ray of hope that things are heading in the right direction for the saga as well. But that hope unfortunately was hacked to pieces by a machete with the premiere of TLJ.The movie continues to dismantle the universe once so beloved by me. It also raises questions. Why Disney, having basically unlimited resources, hires a guy whose only achievement is a mediocre movie to continue with the greatest saga of all time? Who is overlooking this entire project, as there is clearly no proper management over the creative aspects. In the previous trilogies each episode had some consistency in the storyline. Now the viewer (at least me) is left confused. New characters are created just to kill them off/abandon in the next movie? A cliffhanger at the end of TFA (as weak as the film was) leaves us with great expectations- meanwhile it's blown off after 10 minutes of the next film with Luke throwing his sword away and milking the sea-cow (example of hideous ""humor"")? Why have more sensible ideas been crossed out from the EU, substituted by ridiculous ones which now are ""cannon""? Examples: 1) bombers in space, slow as hell, dropping bombs with the force of gravity? Even in the previous movies there were B-wings shooting torpedoes- which makes more sense than having to get so close to the enemy warship; 2) hyperspacing (although hyperspace ""logic"" was already tampered with in TFA) into enemy ships- why did they not think of it in all the previous movies?! It would have saved millions of lives (Death Star 1 destroying Alderaan; Starkiller destroying even more worlds)! Oh- probably because a woman wasn't in charge of the Rebel fleet then- that would explain it. Retarted men could not have thought of such a simple solution. But why does Haldo sacrifice herself and the command ship instead of just hyping all of the transports (flown by droids) into First Order ships..? There's tons of similar stupidities in the plot mentioned by other reviewers, but the last one I mentioned takes us to the feminist ""touch"" to the New Star Wars, which is unbearable. I understand the SW universe was dominated by men (because they're sci-fi's ""target""?), and there must now be a ""par"" that we let women in 50/50. But why must their characters be so flat? There were plenty of strong females in the EU: Leia, Mara Jade, the commander of the test Death Star etc. They had ""balls"" and were memorable. Why did the screenplay writer now lower the standard so much? Didn't he notice this creates a caricature? Even hearing Leia now makes me wanna puke because of the things they make her say (did not happen in the OT). The worst though is the Asian chick - every time she said something it literaliry made me make a facepalm in the cinema. Especially her last words (""make love not war""). I really hope this character does not survive (she was wounded)... She's just meaningless (as 1/3rd of the move with the subplot she's in). Contrary to the women, men are plain stupid (""salt!""), hot-heads (Poe; although admiral Holdo seems to be into that type of men from time to time- as she states) or cowards (Fin wanting to escape; Luke- who is a travesty of himself from the old days and the old EU). Also Kathleen Kennedy making her campaign ""the Force is female"". WTF?! At least we know who's forcing this crap and who should go to make things better.There's far more idiocies to describe, but I must end here, as the review's limited to 5k characters.The thing I have to add at the end: I was a life-long fan of SW (since like 3). I have a 1yo son now and I am ashamed I have bought him SW clothes/gadgets and wanted him to follow my footsteps in embracing the SW universe. I will have to burn all that now, just just like Yoda did to the sacred Jedi scrolls. Let the past die. Let SW die. Shame. Not into SW saga anymore- don't honestly care.",0
341,"The context does not match the previous films, the motivation of the characters is poor, the 1 rating is for visual effects and sound. Destroy the vision originally conceived by Lucas.",0
342,"It breaks my heart to write this but this movie is truly soulless and all around awful. Absolutely poorly written and conceived. The characters are flat, weak, one-dimensional, and out-of-character. The structure is massively flawed and the plot is riddled with holes.I’ve seen every Star Wars movie in theater at least four times on top of countless viewings at home. I will never watch The Last Jedi again. It is hands down the worst in the franchise. I’m going to watch Attack of the Clones to cleanse my pallet…The filmmakers main goal across the board was to destroy and manipulate our expectations by breaking rules set in the Star Wars universe and by debunking every possible fan theory based on questions set up in The Force Awakens. If you want to play with audiences expectations do it in a standalone genre movie by playing with its genre conventions, not in an established canon. They pulled this “Tricked you / surprise card” so many times it was repulsive. Maybe try using two or three of your brilliant mind blowing disrespectful spins on fan expectations.I’ve never had such polarizing different opinions with critics as I do with this movie. I spent countless hours reading fan reviews and watching youtube reviews (positive and negative) and the problems that everyone has are consistent across the board. I’m having a hard time understanding why this would be the best critically reviewed Star Wars movie when I feel this is the worst produced… The filmmakers were more concerned with burning the past to build the future that they want. They don't care what the characters or story deserve and are trying to kill the Star Wars mythology.The original trilogy’s themes were hope, faith, loyalty, family and redemption. The Last Jedi dismantles that and it’s theme is “Let the past die, kill it if you have to.” and to disrespect everything that made Star Wars a universally beloved saga. Star Wars was about the eternal fight of light versus dark and finding the balance between the two. The Last Jedi is grey, bleak, and full of politically correct social propaganda being shoved down your throat in every other scene. Honestly this movie is subversive, divisive, and extremely hypocritical. Entertainment should be entertainment, don’t politicize our escape that actually bonds everyone no matter their age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or religion.This movie intentionally tries to retroactively destroy everything we loved about the Star Wars movies that came before it.",0

345,"I was hoping this would be a good movie, but I was disappointed. The plot and its execution in the film was awful and it made Luke and Leia's characters have far less influence on the film than they should have had. New characters are introduced so suddenly, and their acting is forced very badly, and one new character in particular really, really gets on my nerves. Carry Fisher and Mark Hamil managed to save a very, very small amount of this movie's integrity with their acting skills, but sadly the executives behind this movie made the film so bad that not even Mark and Fisher could save it. With that out of the way, I'll explain why I can't stand this movie:1) The plotIn order for you to understand why I dislike the plot and its execution in the film so much, I'll have to explain something from the past first. Remember the original films? Remember how in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi there was a perfect balance between conflict and elaboration on the plot? There was always a right time to have a space battle, a lightsaber duel, or a a clash between two armies, and then there was always a right time to have characters like Obi-Wan and Yoda to deepen the plot. It was a perfect balance. In this film, all of this is poorly executed. The action scenes did a great job at being action scenes, of course, but many of the characters themselves were awful at trying to make the audience care about them. EVERYTHING in this film is rushed, including scenes restricted to just dialogue!Basically, this movie's plot starts with the good guys, being the Resistance, trying to escape their home base from the bad guys, being the First Order, who are out to completely destroy the good guys. The good guys escape, but then this turns into an on-going chase as the First Order's fleet tries to completely obliterate the Resistance. In between the main plot, we have Rey trying to learn to become a Jedi, and Finn going on a very cringy adventure with a new character that literally adds nothing to the story, but more on that later. The film then ends in a final battle on the planet of Crait between the Resistance and the First Order. You'll understand why the plot is so badly executed in my next points.2) Mark Hamil's role as Luke Skywalker has been handicapped by bad writing.Luke Skywalker, along with Leia were undoubtedly highly anticipated characters in this film. Sadly for Luke, however, is the fact that his character has been reduced to a bitter, pessimistic old man living as a hermit. Also, he ends up being a heavily flawed character with poor moral judgement and appears to be incompetent. You'd think that a Jedi Like Luke would have become wiser and very, very powerful, but with great restraint. I pictured him as being more noble. In essence, Luke is angry about the past. What Luke essentially did leading up to the plot of this film was resurrecting the Jedi Order, only to end up having it go right back to near extinction, and he's now a bitter old man who thinks he did all of this for nothing. You'd think he'd manage to show strong resolve like Yoda, but naturally that's not the case. The plot makes him look worthless. What's even worse is the fact that his character is flawed, because out of fear and contempt he tried to kill Kylo Ren in his sleep, when he was still a student in the Jedi Temple. A Jedi like Luke, who managed to defeat Vader and restore balance to the force (although temporarily), one who was always hopeful despite the odds, has been reduced to a sniveling, insecure wimp. To add insult to injury, Luke Skywalker loses a fight to Rey, who is supposed to be completely inexperienced in the Force and is a beginner at best. Now we see that Luke is not only an insecure wimp, he's also an insecure wimp who cannot adequately defend himself in combat, despite the fact that he has been studying the ways of the Force for years, and even managed to resurrect the Jedi Order. Why couldn't the writers just allow him to defeat Rey? Obviously with great restraint, of course, since he is a Jedi, and Jedi should be good.2) Carrie Fisher's character, being Leia, is also handicapped by the plot.Leia should have been commanding the Resistance fleet in the entire movie. But no, she has to be unconscious through a large portion of the film and replaced by a new character, who is completely subpar, hesistant and incompentent, until she finally regains consciousness.3) Rose Tico, a new character, is awful and unnecessary.Rose Tico is a new character that you probably can't stand. All she is is a character who works on pipes, is socially awkward, and suddenly meets Finn and thinks her life has changed because she had a conversation with a war hero. Once again, forced, awful acting makes her a character that I really dislike, much like Jar Jar. Also, she makes a really stupid decision to save Fin at the end.",0

349,"Terrible film. Even from a basic plot and character point of view it sucked. We got to see the destruction of Luke's Character which was a real low point in my opinion. I think people who like this film simply like pretty lights and visuals and the fact it checks every PC box imaginable. Just a bad film. How did people get paid to make this film? It's like welfare for hollywood types. Show up, create a turkey, collect a paycheck. If you like the original trilogy, avoid.",0

352,"If this is to be compared to The Empire Strikes Back, then it has failed in the one thing that a mid-point sequel in a trilogy should do; I no longer care to watch the finale.Is it because it is too quick to introduce new features to the force? No, I don't care. Is it because it because I'm a Star Wars 'fanboy' and feel betrayed by the uncharacteristic actions of canonised characters? Not a jot although others seem to be. Truth is, there is just no story; nothing. It is 152 minutes of great soundtrack and pretty effects. All the subplots leave you wondering whether they are included just to showcase nostalgic elements. Unfortunately, the whole film is a mere collection of dead-end and pointless subplots. Humour and cuteness are uncomfortably forced, and relationships are unnaturally rushed. It is not even possible to provide a spoiler as it ends where it started, with no arc, either for the characters or in terms of plot. Sure, people die, but they seemed like they wanted to. About half way, I felt the same. I awarded it 2/10 as the actors performed well. Everyone else above the line was terrible; guilty of nothing more than raiding our earnings. Most worryingly, Disney also appear to have bribed most respected critics. That must have been one comprehensive press pack as this film truly is a turkey that has irredeemably ruined Christmas forever along with respect for a lot of reviewers.",0

The space battle does not make any sense. Heroes dying, I have no issues with it, eventually they will. The plot of sending people to the casino world is useless. Sure, he based the Force powers shown on the movie on Extended universe novels, but again, the problem is the lack of imagination, he could take several good plots from TFA and develop them, but no, he didn't care about any of it. Also, the most sad part of this movie, is that he basically gave the middle finger to ""ALL"" suffering, blood and tears shed from episode 3.5 to episode 6. Now, the Rebels barely have an spaceship. At least after episode 3, there was a senate and the rebels have enough time to organize and fight back. RJ ruined this trilogy, hopefully JJ will come up with something to make it interesting again.",0
356,"Episodes 1-2-3 were clumsy in many ways but the story was actually interesting. Episode 7 was a lazy recitation of Ep.4 but as a movie it worked. But The Last Jedi is the episode that killed the franchise. The movie itself is a mess, you could remove 3/4 of the scenes without changing the plot. As a second installment of a trilogy it completely throws away most of the original ideas from 7 instead of building up on them and does nothing with the remaining elements. This feels more like a very bad fan-fiction that should never be an official sequel.  Rian Johnson is just trolling everybody out of ego and shows how terrible he can be as a writer/director.

Luke does things that are so out of character, the only way i could see Disney saving this train wreck is a total wipe of what has happened. I don't think Rian Johnson even watched any of the previous movies, it really doesn't seem like it. This movie was a disservice to the universe, the characters, and especially the fans young and old. I really hope Disney goes for a nuclear option in episode 9 and scraps much of what happened in this movie. Make the events of this movie a crazy dream if you have to. Total garbage. Here are a more concentrated list of issues: 1. The Death of Luke2. Luke’s Legacy & Behavior3. The Death of Snoke4. Finn & Rose’s Subplot5. Rey’s Parents are Nobody6. Death & Return of Leia7. Death of Phasma8. Humor & Tone Issues9. Dropped Force Awakens Subplots10. Plot Holes11. First Order Fleet Chases instead of Destroys12. Vice Admiral Holdo Sucks13.

363,"DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS! Lucasfilm's dark empress Kathleen Kennedy needs to get a message that she should give keys of SW to someone who truly loves it. Disney isn't wholly to blame because they let the Marvel movies and Pixar work independently under them with great results. But if anything they should have intervened with this garbage production. It could be called Star Wars: The Anticlimax. Every (action)scene is a disappointment, except maybe one throne room scene. I saw this with a free ticket and came here to warn people. Many have fortunately already said many things wrong with The Last Jedi. This movie continues Force Awakens's nullification of our classic heroes' character arcs, force feeding us one dimensional new ones (but they are so diverse!) and giving recycled story beats, only this time with really stupid twists. There is a way to handing the torch to new heroes while respecting old ones but this sequel trilogy has done about the worst possible job at it. Biggest disrespect is for Luke Skywalker. He should have been grown to be very powerful and the script should have risen to the challenge to give him worthy obstacles. They have all the scripting power of Hollywood to their disposal. But no, Rian and story group cop out the worst way. Oh and the galaxy feels empty in this, there's only Resistance with their deserted planets and the First Order, the rest of the galaxy is all on Canto Bight apparently.It's easy to guess why Darth Kathleen Kennedy handed keys of the whole new trilogy to Rian Johnson: He's one of the two directors who is willing to work for her without objections about direction of these movies and he agreed to cover this movie with heavy handed childish SJW/feminazi- propaganda. In the movie all white men are bad or just suck and all the women are great in every way. I bet that galactic **** is cackling all the way through when watching this propaganda piece. One point for Hamill's great acting. Not seeing Ep. 9. I have no intrest anymore.",0
364,"The most offensive, disgraceful film I've ever seen. Utterly unforgivable. This is a giant FU to SW fans, make no mistake. This is a student grade political tirade, hijacking the biggest franchise in film. I'm astonished and speechless. Disney need to be brought down for this.",0
365,"I watched this movie on DVD. Such an emptiness after watching the movie in the universe of Star Wars, I did not feel. Such a heap of absurdities of the scenario, so to disfigure everything that was created before this in the universe is the main but narrative of Lucas and others. I did not feel such frustration for a long time from films. After this film, even the 7th movie seems much better. BIG EPIC FAIL !!!",0
366,"With this new movie, the new Star Wars series is essentially reduced to this Lord of the Rings equivalent:-Imagine a sequel to Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King where Sauron had a son that actually manages to reforge the one ring in about 30 seconds.-Sauron's son uses the The One Ring to destroy all of Middle-Earth in about 30 seconds.-A new hobbit, that DOES NOT have the name name ""Baggins,"" embarks on the same exact quest to destroy The One NEW ring.The biggest issue with this new story is that it rendered the events of 1-6 completely irrelevant. All that mattered was that a woman named Leia met a man named Han and they had a child named Ben. That is it. Everything that the characters fought for in 1-6 is blown up in a matter of seconds in episode 7. And there is no reverse course here in episode 8 - it doubles down. To accept these new films as sequels is to accept that. You can't have it both ways.I'm not whining. It's simply a fact. And it's bad story-telling to suggest in the 7th chapter of a 9 part saga that what happened in 1-6 is not relevant.",0

Indicative of its complete ""middle finger"" to everything that came before it.From 'smaller points' like Admiral Ackbar being boldly insulted.To more massive characater assaults, such as turning Luke Skywalker into a cowardice monster.I cannot stress more, how faulty and far off the mark this film is.If you want more depth in these issues... just look it up, there's a billion other reviews that will say more than this.",0
368,"I live in Singapore. Asians usually like scifi. This is an 'meh' scifi movie considering the budget TLJ had but TLJ is definitely a TERRIBLE star wars movie.Preface: I'm an 80s baby, star wars is sacred. (even in asia.) Shutting myself from the hype train, I waited for the very last day of the cinema showing, so I can walk in to a near empty theater to enjoy the odyssey, the epic that star wars deservedly is.Again, Preface: I'm an 80s baby. Grew up with the original SW trilogy throughout the 90s, rushed to watch Prequels in the 2000s. Played the video games, read the books and comics, watch the cartoons and animated series, and yes bought toys and merch.So... about 2hr 30 min after, watching TLJ, I left the theater confused, (I understand why people had to watch TLJ 2 or 3 more times. And not in a good way). I slept it over. Woke up the next day. Thought about TLJ. Became more and more angry as I thought about TLJ. Slept again. Today, 2 days after watching TLJ = MORE ANGRY as I think about TLJ.Critique of TLJ = Really weak story, plot holes after plot holes after plot holes, weak characters with little development (Sadness here - Rey, Fin, Poe deserved to shine in this episode...WASTED!), characters introduced who are inconsequential, storylines that go nowhere, forced SJW-3rd wave feminist messaging almost every other scene. (There has ALWAYS been strong men AND women in the sw universe but now only women are strong, smart, courageous, wise....okay....), forced out of place/oddly timed humour (Oh my god the phone joke!), brisk pacing for a 2hrs++ movie which remarkably lacks substance or depth ending up with heroes I am uninterested cheering for, villains that are not threatening. Then, how TLJ handled an iconic character which has been celebrated for pass a good 40 years....disrespectful.  Excellent visuals and music though, which seems to be what matters these days.Ultimately you start to have the feeling that the director/writer of TLJ is giving you, star wars fans and the star wars mythos the middle finger all throughout the movie. Self indulgent, self satisfied, talentless hack. Who the f**k gave the greenlight for Rian Johnson to touch the star wars ip? People need to get fired for this. Thank god Rian Johnson was nowhere near Blade Runner 2049. As a fan of star wars for almost 30 years, literally almost all of my life (as of this writing), I'm done with star wars. I'm NOT EVEN INTERESTED IN EPISODE 9. WHO CARES? As an asian observer, if americans dont even care about their own cultural treasures then why should I? Star Wars is dead.",0

People who have always found Star Wars annoying and enjoy seeing it be exposed to revisionism. B. People who are casual fans of science fiction/science fantasy. C. People who enjoy seeing their political views mirrored on screen, regardless as to how well written the plot and characters are surrounding the politics. All they want to see is their politics validated, character development be dammed--and I should note I agree with the politics behind the movie; I'm not some anti-SJW person.

371,"Don't take a fan's words take Mark Hamil's, ""He’s not my Luke Skywalker, but I had to do what Rian wanted me to do because it serves the story well”.  This movie added NOTHING to the lore of Star Wars.  You learn more about the characters in the movie from interviews rather than the movie its self.  No resolution on Snoke, Knight of Ren, C3PO red arm, Rey's parents etc.  The managed to actually make you not care if there is another film.  Sadly the director Rian Johnson has been charged with creating another trilogy... The movie lacked originality, this Star Wars is a cross between Space Balls/ Speed (if your star ship slows down below this speed you blow up) and Mary Poppins (Leia).  The social justice warriors got a hold of the script made sure every evil person is white, all men an inept, and all women are the fearless always right, wise heroes.

Enjoying the fun visuals, but having no idea what they are even going to do in Episode 9 with no actual remaining conflict besides Rey and Kylo flying around for a movie before they have a battle? What kind of terrible writing do you have to do to kill off all the interesting characters, character assassinate the other interesting ones and then end the movie with no where to go? Boring boring boring boring. No rewatches required. This made JJ's Episode 7 look like a solid 8-9/10 and the prequels actually worth rewatching. Garbage. Burn it with fire. Not canon.",0

It opens with a Simpsons phone crank and goes down hill from there.This movie is filled with gaping plot holes, characters either doing dumb things or performing  contrary to their established natures, hates white men, and takes a flame thrower to all previous SW movies. If you take 10 seconds to actually think about what's going on, your head will explode.Numerous nonsensical items have already been listed on this forum, but I would like to offer one more because I haven't seen it mentioned yet. It's not a ""huge"" thing - just indicative of this illogical farce. Apparently, Chewbacca has no problem risking his life to chauffeur his new boss Rey (yes, she actually orders him around) to the enemy's flagship so she can ""save"" Kylo - the same kid who just murdered his best friend a few days prior. Can you imagine the Chewie of IV-VI (or any other sentient being) going along with this BS? WTF?I'm angry the creators and ""professional"" critics duped me into wasting my time and money on this garbage. But what really irks me is how Disney abuses its media muscle to attack those who dump on their 100+ million crap fest. I guess that's how the Alt Left operates these days.

I am not quite sure which is worse, this one or Clone Wars, but I think it's this one. Everything is awful, everything! I don't even want to get into the specifics.

Also, I don't have a problem with female leads,  its that they were weak female leads, all teary eyed, lets run away, have faith.  They're supposed to take on the Darkside?!   If Vader was still around he'd a boarded  that ship and lay waste to everyone.  Rose to Finn, ""We win by saving the people we love"". No you don't!  You win by blowing sh*t up. Oh man, the more I think about the movie the angrier I get.  When I was kid I was afraid of Vader and even at 40 when Vader laid the smack down in Rogue One I got a little scared.

380,"As a long time Star Wars fans who enjoyed The Force Awakens as a fun movie, I found The Last Jedi to be quite a disappointment. Personally I felt they got Luke's character completely wrong (never gave up on Vader who had killed many people, but feels darkness in Kylo and thinks about murdering him before abandoning his family and friends to be a hermit while the first order continues killing people - doesn't work for me). I found new character Rose an unwelcome addition who had no real place in the movie. Her 'mission' with Finn amounted to nothing and only introduced a stuttering DJ who was there to show 'people watch out for themselves'. The whole casino story was boring.'Cool' characters introduced in TFA, Snoke/Phasma/Knights of Ren are wasted or not mentioned at all and shows there was certainly no thought out plan for this trilogy. It is just being made up as they go along with Rian Johnson throwing away some of the most interesting characters TFA introduced.Luke's 'show of power' was incredibly lacklustre and a massive letdown and his overall story felt like a disservice to the character. Kylo as the 'big bad' for episode 9 is unconvincing and not intimidating enough and this movie did nothing to improve him. Rey is also too powerful and skilled for someone with no training in the force. The third lesson Luke was to teach was never even mentioned.The 'run out of fuel' plot line was unexciting, but lead to the only entertaining part of the movie which was Holdomlightspeeding the cruiser into Snoke's ship. It seems a wasted opportunity not to have Leia as the pilot as she'll now she'll have an unceremonious off screen death. It also begs the question why this light speed trick wasn't done before most of the resistance was killed or why this wasn't done in the past to destroy the Death Stars.Overalll this seemed to throw away the past of Star Wars too quickly, including only just introduced characters and concepts. Star Wars does need to move on from the Skywalker saga, but this was done in a hastily, sloppy way. I believe this would have been a better trilogy had they flashed forward 100 years and started there instead of destroying the past in such a terrible manner.Yes, the humour seemed forced and wasn't really funny, but that was the least of this film's problems.I can quite happily throw this film away as Luke does his old light sabre when Rey presents it to him. As someone who has watched all other episodes multiple times, including force awakens, I don't ever want to watch this movie again.",0
381,"""Dear Rian, please DO learn from your mistakes if you're going to inflict a whole trilogy upon us after this mess!""For the record, I rather like Rian as a director and as a human being. But this movie is an abomination. If it were totally standalone, it would be an average kind-of-enjoyable thing with many plotholes. But like this...it destroys the mythology, and offers nothing except meh-meh to replace what it destroyed. I WANTED to be surprised, but not in such a way that the surprises all ring hollow and/or unconvincing.Let's see why...Luke contemplating killing Kylo...nope. This happens to be a personal obsession of Rian's - ""if you met Hitler while still a kid, would you kill him?"" Check out his movie Looper for proof of this. And it could have been convincingly placed in this mythology...only it isn't. Something like that has to be earned, not shoehorned in. And yeah, it does character-assassinate Luke, this is simply not him, not even if he changed. An example (only one of the possible ways this could have been made convincing, and no it wasn't my idea to start with, got it from someone on the Net): if Ben/Kylo and all or most of Luke's students got converted by Snoke and rebelled, Luke may have been forced to kill them while crying, then could not bring himself to kill his own nephew. This WOULD have ****** him up to such a degree that he may have been the Luke we see in the movie. But not sensing unspecified darkness within Kylo, that just does not cut it from the same person who almost sacrificed himself to turn Vader. Oh, and it would have plugged the gaping ""where the hell are the Knights of Ren"" plothole quite neatly to boot. Not to mention paralleled both Anakin's slaughter of the younglings, AND Palpatine's making short work of everyone except Mace Windu in the prequels. A Luke to whom this happened would have cut himself from the Force - as he would no longer know just what the difference was between him and Vader/Palpatine. The way it's shown in the movie...what would be Luke's first natural reaction after the Kylo situation happened? Well, to talk it over with Yoda and Kenobi's ghosts. And how did he ""cut himself off from the Force"" anyway? Kylo would not think he was dead, because he would have felt it...aaargh!!!!!Space Leia...oh dearydear...not only does she save herself, she apparently also Force-reconstructs the Mon Calamari cruiser's bridge, since it seems rather intact later in the movie...'nuff said. RIP Carrie, you deserved a much better sendoff...Rose - yeah, annoying, but don't bash the actress for that - ain't her fault. Snoke, we hardly knew ye...yeah, we did not know much about Palpatine in the OT either...but we did not need to, McDiarmid based his performance there on the figure of Death from Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal...and that worked very well. In the PT, it did not - and one of the major problems there was that the characters - Padme, Palpatine etc. - seemed to be pulled out of thin air with no backstory whatsoever. The only thing we learn about Snoke is that he dresses like the late Hugh Hefner, and is apparently physically based on the WW2 SS-general Ernst Kaltenbrunner. As to how exactly he would turn anyone to the dark side, can't see it at all.Hyperspace tracking a new tech? And pray, how exactly did the first Death Star, or Boba Fett for that matter, track the Falcon? Or how did Obi-Wan track Jango in the PT? Through non-hyperspace? Could have pulled out of that hole by claiming that it used to require a physical tracking device to be onboard - this could even have provided a kind of reason why Holdo does not tell Poe what her plan is...paranoia and fear of FO spies (though it would still be daft that she does not tell this to the guy who just blew up that dreadnought, at least in private).Crait...far as I remember, in ESB, the only reason why the Empire did not bomb the Hoth base back to Stone Age was that it has a force field...the Crait base has none, so no reason at all for the walkers 'cept that they look cool...or maybe the FO forgot to include TIE Bombers among their gear...Hyperspace kamikaze stuff...oh yeah, but that makes all spaceships/Deathstars automatically obsolete. Plus the fact that they had to invent Holdo to do it (and do it way too late btw) since Ackbar has an Arab-derived name so the implications would be, oh dearydear...Feminazi stuff...I don't mind feminism at all (have 2 beloved daughters), but this got turned into such men-are-stupid-cuz-they-are-but-women-rock-cuz-they-are overkill that it provokes an opposite reaction...in a perverse way, this movie is Steve Bannon's wet dream, and I sure don't feel comfortable with anyone giving THAT guy wet dreams. I half expected Rey to tell Kylo: ""You're only jealous cuz I'm an actual woman, and you need to grow your hair long & act hysterical!""Mary Sue Rey - others have written enough about this.What a royal mess of a story.

383,"Rian Johnson is a heretic; what he did to Star Wars is a NATIONAL TRAGEDY.I'm not over it.allow me to free associate:lazy writing. cultural decay. socialist praising. capitalist damning. regurgitated FX/ideas. no ben burtt. misandrous. anti-white. destroys everything built nicely by Force Awakens. rose rose binks = worse than jar jar. made the prequels look like masterpieces. relegated many good actors and characters to the dust bin of time. shat on canon. cheated the viewer, with fake news (critics are leftists, and we all know leftists value their rigid ideology over art, hell, they don't believe in art, see pisschrist). TLJ will have zero longevity; it will become and remain the most hated and forgotten (repressed) SW film of all time. peace out, franchise! i give this 2 stars because i know how yer GD algorithms work. This film deserves a 0, MAYBE a 1, for John Williams. but the film was so bad I couldn't even hear the music, all I could hear was SJW harping: ""whites suck. men suck. star wars fans suck. tradition sucks. religion sucks. capitalism sucks. america sucks. animals are more important than humans. veganism is amazing. blah blah effity blah.",0
384,"The reason I have given Star Wars The Last Jedi a 0/10 is for violating the lore. It's supposed to take decades of studying in order to become proficient at utilizing the force and a lightsaber. All Luke did was tell Rey the definition of what the force is. Becoming a Jedi or Sith is a dedication of one's life to learning the mystery's of the force, it is a lifestyle, you can't become a Jedi just by learning the definition of the force. Anakin Skywalker, the chosen one, did not become a powerhouse immediately. It took him decades to hone his force and lightsaber abilities before he reached his prime. For example, if someone told me the definition of “Law”, I can’t just go immediately pass the bar exam and become a lawyer. I would have to dedicate several years studying in law school just to pass the bar exam. The fact that Rey was able to use the force and a lightsaber as effectively as she did in the movie is a blatant violation of the Star Wars mythos.There are seven lightsaber forms (Shii-Cho, Makashi, Soresu, Ataru, Shien/Djem So, Niman, and Juyo/Vaapad) that can take years just to master one of them. It takes at least one year to learn the first lightsaber form Shii-Cho(Form One), which is the lightsaber form that all Jedi must learn first as it teaches the basics of wielding a lightsaber. Shii-Cho(Form One) is the most basic of all forms and is taught to Jedi younglings as a foundation, and includes the fundamentals of stance, attack, parry, and landing a “Mark of Contact”. The strengths of Shii-Cho (Form One) are that it is the best form against multiple opponents and has good blaster deflection. However, Shii-Cho (Form One) weakness is that it’s the least suitable form for lightsaber dueling. Meaning even if Rey had mastered Shii-Cho(Form One), she would have been guaranteed to be defeated by Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel. For Kylo Ren had studied under Luke Skywalker and Snoke for years. As a result, Kylo Ren would have been able to learn more of the advanced lightsaber forms that are better suited for lightsaber combat, which would give him the edge over Rey. ",0
385,"I've just seen this film on Dec 27th, I shouldn't have bothered. I shouldn't have been worried about plot spoilers and read the user reviews, the critical ones on here are correct so I won't repeat most of what has been said already, other than the film has death star sized plot holes, some of the most ridiculous plot devices, lame humour, hollow characters, pointless side plots, a complete disregard for the previous movies and Star Wars lore, and some of the most blatent political correctness I've ever seen in a movie.I won't be watching any more Disneyfied milking of this franchise if the upcoming movies are this bad.",0
386,"The worst Star Wars movie by far. And also the least 'Star Wars-y' Star Wars movie. The creators have destroyed the soul of Star Wars. Credit to Mark Hamill for speaking out and admitting that Luke Skywalker is not the Luke Skywalker that he knew. Sadly, this will be remembered as the movie that knocked Star Wars from its pedestal among fans. The few memorable moments are only memorable because they are utterly cringe worthy. The new characters are abominations. I can only presume that Disney/Lucasfilm only employ cowards or Yes Men nowadays, because that's the only explanation as to why no-one behind the scenes spoke up and pointed out to the senior people at Disney/Lucasfilm what an absolute atrocity they were creating. The soundtrack is great though, so it gets one star for the soundtrack.",0
387,"This film is an utter betrayal to the entire Star Wars mythos. It literally destroys everything we came to love before it and proclaims a new order based on nothing.

388,It's hard to imagine being more frustrated by this movie.  It's clear to see Disney had no idea what they were going to do after the Force Awakens.  So much of the movie acts as a contradiction to what they first established and even the Star Wars universe as a whole.  All of the story seeds they sowed in TFA have now been dug up and there is now little I care about going into the 3rd movie.  Rei and Darth Emo will fight and Darth Emo will have some redeeming thing happen to him. The good guys will have a new hope for rebuilding the galaxy and Rei will start to train Jedi again.  I guess that's fitting The Force Awakens was a repeat of A New Hope.  The next movie should be a remake of the Return of the Jedi.,0
389,"Watched it, horrible. poorly written, took away everything that made the past Star Wars films great.

391,"This is the only film I've ever reviewed that I've given a zero. And believe me, it needs to be utterly abysmal in order to earn such a rating without a shred of hyperbole.In a nutshell, The Last Jedi revels in the sexism and racism it manufactures and proudly politicizes it as a ""progressive"" utopia, using the Star Wars franchise as an awkward vehicle to push this not-at-all-subtle social justice agenda.Imagine a beloved franchise being violently stabbed and bludgeoned to death, and then being spat on and laughed at by cultural vandals who care more about their utopian societal ideals than they do about any of your cherished memories. That's what this movie is. It somewhat reminded me of footage of those Taliban members going into the ancient Buddhist temples, toppling all the age-old statues and destroying historical relics because they can't tolerate anything that brings others peace that doesn't align with their own authoritarian ideological bent.Ironically, the cultural pendulum is starting to quickly swing away hard from third-wave feminism and the extreme SJW politics presented in The Last Jedi, which will leave it looking very awkward and out-of-place in 40 years' time, as its forced ""politics du jour"" will be representative of a long-gone era. (Unlike A New Hope, which wasn't crammed full of contemporary political issues of the late 70's and thus can still be enjoyed today without that jarring awkwardness of breaking the 4th wall).It's clear that Disney, Rian Johnson, and Kathleen Kennedy are trying to reboot Star Wars from the ground up, with the intention of introducing Generation-Z to these new matriarchic and gynocentric narratives as the norm. Having the kids of today growing up with them, as it were. They believe that using a wildly popular franchise like Star Wars as a carrier for delivering this propaganda will indoctrinate kids at a young age, while simultaneously burning down all the old ""sexist"" and ""bigoted"" films that came before it is an act of heroism. The message being pedaled is toxic progressiveness. However, this is failing for them in a big way. Just like it failed when others tried to ram social justice narratives into other much-loved franchises such as Baldur's Gate and Mass Effect. You think they'd learn that the vast majority of people do not want this crap in their entertainment and will retaliate against it with all their might, just as they're doing now by down-voting this turd of a film and speaking out about everything it did wrong.I, for one, am no longer interested in paying Disney one red cent to see Episode 9: Return of the Matriarchy.",0

I will not see it nor ever buy Star Wars merchandise ever again, but I will be interested in seeing the numbers it makes.  Tells me more about the world we live in if it makes good box office.

I do care about these!  The entire movie is a jumbled mess.  It seems to have been written by a committee of people that have never seen a Star Wars movie or taken a science class or a writing class.  They did the impossible by making space battles tedious and slow-moving.  They drop bombs in space--you know the place where there is no up or down.

I enjoy a lot of sci fi, fantasy and action movies, so I don't think I'm too much a critic either.It's cliché, predictable, illogical and I don't feel like I care for the characters at all (while I usually do in other movies).It feels like Disney tries to make the new star wars movie applicable for all ages to maximise revenue. By doing this, the movie naturally gets more cliché (as some people like this), predictable (as some people don't like change that much), and illogical/plot holes etc. (more sloppy store writing as some people doesn't care if something makes sense or not).I really enjoyed Star Wars 1 to 6, but the last three movies have been absolutely horrible after Disney took over.Seeing a movie that ruins the franchise and getting great reviews is just sad. That just means that Disney will keep making boring characters with illogical jokes just to move the plot forward in an entertaining way for 13 year olds.",0

406,"The worst of the whole saga, I felt embarrassed, sometimes much more than in the prequels.When you create a universe, you also create rules that give it plausibility and you can not break these when writing the script if you do not want to take the audience out of the movie.This is what happens in ""The Last Jedi."" Too many script's twists, some grotesque scenes, and the powers shown here by the Jedi (worthy in some cases of the Dragon Ball's Saiyans), added to an array of nonsense such as adding multiple story threads that do not fit, in poorly mounted sequences, just to give a reason to appear to the secondary characters, taking you completely out of the movie. From now on, script writers can take any easy way out they need without caring about rules and plausability.Subtlety in humor is gone forever, adding easy gags in almost every scene, some remembering Leslie Nielsen's films, or parodies like Space Balls. Mel Brooks could have directed this movie. These references are not necessarily bad, but not in the Star Wars universe.Some positive reviews stated this movie is innovative, well... they literally copied one scene from ""The Return of the Jedi"" and the dialogue lines in another one. Episode 7 remembered Episode 4 in a much less explicit way.Star Wars has moved to an even farther galaxy for most of its audience.",0
407,"This movie was disappointing drivel.  We walked out after an hour and a half. one word describes this garbage.  BORING !!  I found it ridiculous that they felt it necessary to have a short cameo by Chubakka, a short cameo by R2D2 and CP3O. Mark Hamills performance was unenthusiastic, unbelievable and boring.  The CGI scenes of the battle scenes grew redundant and unbelievable.  And what is the deal with GEN Leiha getting blown out into outer space and then returning to her ship?  Did she use her jedi powers to do that or what? Basically they need to bury the Star Wars franchise.  The last 2 or 3 movies have been losers and i dont plan on seeing another, if they are greedy enough to make another, even though i dont see what its point could be.  If you havent seen this rubish...save your money",0

Luke was used terribly he didn't get a huge light saber fight and he went through light saber training again and lost what 30 pounds for this role and all he got was a couple dodges? What about that stupid Rose x Finn? I mean Rose is a character we barley meet and it feels like this relationship is forced. What about Snoke then? He is a major character just like Captain Phasma yet there is no character development both of those characters had so much potential yet they die with only 10 - 20 minutes of screen time on both movies. This movie is just a disgrace to Star Wars and hopefully J.J. Abrams who is very talented is able to save this trilogy and honestly Star Wars all together.",0
420,"I don't normally write film reviews, but wanted to get my thoughts on this movie out there only because I care so much about this franchise. I am not a die hard fan, but I am someone who loves movies and grew up watching the original trilogy as a kid. Over the years it grew to become one of my all-time favorite sagas and I was genuinely excited when Disney announced they bought the franchise and were going to make a new ""Skywalker saga"" trilogy. I thought the Force Awakens (TFA) was good, but not great. They played it safe, but understandably so from a business perspective. Rogue One was excellent, and I thought, really showed how they could expand the film universe in exciting ways. Together I had high hopes for how they could develop the new trilogy and enrich the new characters while rounding out the Skywalker Sage (as they now call it). However, when I saw this movie not only did they not round out that saga, they essentially killed it. This second movie is almost entirely disjunctive from TFA. Whole thematic elements are abandoned or developed in an entirely about face manner. Having reflected on it, it doesn't even make sense from a story perspective. It honestly feels as though they did it solely to say they took risks or made a ""risky"" film. I mean virtually nothing was developed ... Rey's apparent force abilities, Snoke's recruitment of Ben Solo, the mystery of Luke's saber calling to Rey .... nothing. Not only that, but new elements like the force tree, the first Jedi temple, ancient Jedi texts, NOTHING. It honestly felt like a 2 year bait and switch. Which is one thing in terms of expectation, but what about story-telling? The result is a complete mess. Rey has unreal force abilities without any Jedi training, while Luke the son of Anakin Skywalker who was created through a virgin birth of force needs weeks of training with a 900 year old Jedi master?! Kylo Ren's arc of struggling with the light was completely obliterated with the result that he is merely bad because he is. No fall from grace, no tragedy, nothing. In addition, what about Luke and Leia. Seriously?! We waited since 1983 for the return of Luke Skywalker, you build it up with him standing on the cliff ... and he throws the saber over his shoulder like a piece of trash?! Setting aside the idiotic place you put him from a character perspective, you really think he would disrespect the saber Ben saved from Anakin all those years, gave to him as his first saber ... even out of respect for Ben and Anakin that seems absurd. I mean, really. Plus, how does a man who abandoned his training with Yoda when he sensed his friends were in trouble on Bespin and refused to lose hope in his father despite his allegiance to the Emperor completely give up his commission from Yoda to ""pass on what you have learned"" since he would be ""the Last Jedi"" all because he sensed evil in a 15 year old kid? Really? He would hide out for 30 something years while his sister is pleading for him to come home and allow his best friend to be murdered. Honestly makes absolutely no sense. I could go on and on. Stepping further back plot points make no sense. A 2 hour space chase scene?! Really you had three years to write a sequel and that was your concept? Or Space Leia - how disrespectful to Carrie's memory. Ugh. Honestly, this movie was heartbreaking at almost every level. I have lost faith in Lucasfilm after this. Seriously who authorized this piece of garbage? I truly hope they can right course, but I feel like the damage has been done. I mean, really, if anything required kid gloves it was rounding out ""the Skywalker Saga"" (again their term) and how they treated characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker ... and they gave us this. It's a bell that cannot be unrung. I am completely cool with going a new direction, but there were dozens of ways to do that while still honoring the prior films. This again felt like going a different direction because they received flak for TFA being too safe. They wanted a bold movie, but bold for its own sake rather than one drive by the characters or story. The result is they ended up damaging the new trilogy and ruining the Skywalker legacy, which instead they have a responsibility to handle carefully. RIP in Star Wars.",0

427,"I have been a fan of Star Wars for as long as I can remember.  Every Star Wars film, including the prequels, has had moments that gave me goosebumps, the feeling I would always use to measure how a film made me feel.  I had no such goosebump moment in The Last Jedi.  The best word I can use to describe my experience is contempt.  From very near the start of the movie, I felt an ever deepening pit forming in the bottom of my stomach.  So much life is wasted in this film, heroic moments are ruined by modern sounding one liners or gestures.  Luke might as well have dabbed in that scene near the end when the director wanted him to look like a badass.  Why has the technology of Star Wars degraded so much and become so inconsistent?  Sure, the sound and visuals were great, and the music was awesome as always thanks to John Williams, but most movies look and sound great today so that is no longer the mark of a good film.  This film has no heart, no soul, or care for what came before.",0

436,"This movie was a huge disappointment and singlehandedly managed to ruin the legacy of Luke Skywalker, a beloved childhood character after generations of careful and considered development.  The movie was not all bad-- for example, the movie had good special effects and beautiful scenes at times; Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren and Mark Hamill's performance as the character he was forced to be were very good-- but in the end, this movie did not feel like ""Star Wars"".  Why could Rey who had very little to no training at all easily defeat Luke Skywalker who was a Master Jedi who actually did train with a master as well as defeat a throne room full of praetorian guards (albeit with Kylo Ren's help) also trained to defend Snoke?  I can understand that they are saying that Rey has a lot of raw power, but that doesn't mean that she automatically knows how to levitate a mountain of boulders, use mind tricks and wield a light saber.  It has been well established that it takes much time and training to become proficient at using the Force, but not in this movie!  I get that they were trying to introduce the new characters and make them the focus of the movie, but Rian Johnson seemed to go against everything that was already established and purposely change things just to be different-- and this was all done to the detriment of the characters and the Star Wars mythos.  Why can Yoda, as a force ghost, conjure lightning to affect the real world?  If he can do that, why aren't other force ghosts fighting the First Order and vice versa?  Also, if Leia who was only force sensitive can fly back to the ship when she is blown out, why couldn't Emperor Palpatine keep himself from falling down the reactor shaft when Vader threw him down it?  It also seems that Rian Johnson purposely went out of his way to prove all of the online speculation and theories that surfaced after The Force Awakens wrong by coming up with the most ridiculous thing he could fathom and putting it in the movie.  Not only that, but it seems as if he gave JJ Abrams the finger by saying, ""I don't care about all of the plotlines you set up in The Force Awakens"" and proceeded to drop them with no answers.  Why did Luke leave a map to find him in The Force Awakens?  Why did he consider murdering his nephew that he only sensed darkness in while not giving up on his father Darth Vader who had actually murdered scores of people?  In the end, this movie managed to push me away from the Star Wars franchise as I will likely not be taking my family to see the next film in the series.  If the director is willing to do this to Luke Skywalker, why bother investing any time in any new characters?  If they are not going to remake this movie, the best thing Disney could do at this point is start the next movie by Luke coming to from a vision of clips from The Last Jedi after Rey hands him the light saber and Rey asking him, ""Luke, can you hear me?"", to which he answers, ""I have to try to save them...""",0
437,Despite personal preferences this is a new nadir for the sw universe and movies in general.Dont listen to the on payroll critics.Even Luke dislikes this latest moneygrabber from disney.,0
438,One rule to be a good Sci-Fi film is not to contradict yourself. This film does that several times over. It doesn't take itself seriously. It is too much of a soap opera of relationships. Its a good film for kids but not anyone 13+. Looses 2 points for falling below expectations.,0
439,"The Good: - Main 4 actors are amazing and their characters are intriguing- Took risks- Some impressive creativity in some scenes- Did a much better job of creating new worlds and creatures like the old Star Wars movies than the previous Disney movies- Some of it was fun- High production values- Well directedThe Bad:- Humiliated the main old characters- Took huge amounts of time in plot lines that mysteriously went no where- Still loosely structured on the old series of movies- Several critical plot elements didn't make any sense, collapsing suspension of disbelief- The Social Justice themes were way to aggressive (the new Star Trek has progressive elements without being emasculating or humiliating)- The plot was scattered and emotionally confusing and sometimes slow and boring- Ultimately felt commercial and like a segway to the future rather than an exciting work of art like the old movies- Lack of development of characters and resulting events made it hard to care about the outcome- The attempts at humor were more often than not too much and didn't feel realBottom Line:- Had its moments, but a lot of potential was wasted due to the movies many fundamental mistakes overshadowing its good elements. The Star Wars series is now a high end sci fi movie which is a shadow of its former self.",0
440,Filled with pointless scenes that do not push the plot forward and horrible comedy relief. It is worse than all the Michael Bay films combined.

444,"The Last Jedi is wrong on so many different levels that I don't even know where to start. The plot is bad and features heavy agenda pushing. Please, don't go to see this film. It will ruin your perception of what the Star Wars is about.The good things are easy to list: Amazing visual effects, good soundtrack (albeit it heavily borrows from the existing old Star Wars music) and high production values. For those three things I have to give some points on 0 to 10 scale. But everything else is just betrayal of the highest level.Then there is the bad stuff: Actors are dull and uninteresting. Instead of demonstrating the content of their characters, they've been reduced to nothing but their external appearances. There are absolutely pointless scenes like the space casino thing which accomplishes nothing. The ""sacrifices"" people make here are utterly pointless and stupid. The film is way too long. And numerous other things other reviews surely will mention but I try to keep this spoiler-free and short.This and the previous film are utterly non-canon to me. They do not follow the Star Wars Expanded Universe well enough to make me interested. To me Star Wars is dead and Disney killed it. At least I still have my books, comics, games and the original trilogy.",0

451,"If Disney wanted to copy Marvel's movies they could have started a new franchise (Fighters of the Galaxy?...) instead of buying the Star Wars brand and turning it into something completely different. Did no one tell them that Star Wars was popular because people liked it as it was, that people liked the story, characters, and even the serious tone? Is it necessary to turn everything into a superhero movie full of bad jokes? Well, I'm sad for two reasons, first and foremost, I no longer look forward to see any future Star Wars movies, what made them special is not there anymore, and secondly, why all blockbusters have to be carbon copies nowadays? Where did imagination and originality go?? I can't believe that with all the money they have, they cannot do better. Clearly they aim for children and teenagers that will fangirl at the possible love lines. But even the children get tired at some point when you only offer cheap copy-paste.",0
452,"This was simply not Star Wars, but the typical radical-left, political opinion piece.We can start with the absolute ridiculousness of the mary poppins flight through space scene after being fully exposed to space for a couple of minutes. I'm no expert, but I believe your blood boils at around two minutes of exposure. Then go on to bombs dropping in space and finally end at the arcing turbolaser blasts in space. Just disregard seven prior movies and go with that.Apparently Luke and Anakin wasted a ton of time training to become powerful Jedi. Rey just pulls it out of thin air and becomes more powerful than Luke and Kylo, despite their life-long training. The entire Finn/Rose plot was a waste of time, serving only to put the pro PETA, anti-war (in Star WARS), and anti-capitalist brainwashing of the left.It destroyed any story arc from TFA and any previous movies. Every reason to come back and watch episode eight was a complete waste and this movie leaves no reason to come see nine. They made the First Order a joke... literally. Kylo is an emo preteen while Hux is a source of entertainment. Phasma was a complete waste and easily killed by the janitor. There is just no threat from the FO anymore. You KNOW Rey will just come melt faces, so what's the point?BB8 can take out squads of soldiers alone and pilot an AT-ST. Poe was just a joke through the entire film. He actually would have been better served not being in the movie at all. Luke was not the Luke that was developed over a trilogy, countless books and comics, and tens of games developed as canon by LA. Why didn't he go to the salt planet? He died anyway.... it was so useless.As useless as the juvenile attempt at humor. Star Wars traditionally had some silliness in the movies, but not a fart joke every three minutes. You just cannot take this movie seriously and can't enjoy it. It alone has destroyed my faith in Disney to stay true to the franchise. I enjoyed TFA and loved Rogue One, but after this, I see they are sacrificing everything that made Star Wars what it was to push radical politics and make a quick cash-grab.  It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't give this hack director (who was solely responsible for this mess of a story) his own trilogy!  He quite clearly does not know how to write or direct Star Wars, and judging by this, shouldn't even write or direct a television commercial.Avoid this movie and disregard Disney's decree to wipe most of the Star Wars canon if you even liked the franchise a little. You have eight good movies and a ton of books, comics, and games that are both cannon directly from Lucasarts and EU. Avoid this movie if you are even a casual fan of any type of entertainment and don't feel like wasting your money.",0
453,"Overall very disappointing movie at all. Even worse than Episode 7, never thought that would be possible. Too much influence from the SJW´s. The film has many scenes that were not really thought about. As a real star wars fan, this broke my heart completely, to see this awesome franchise get destroyed so hard and used for making money (Porgs).",0
454,This movie was a dumpster fire of progressive political agenda and pathetic story telling. Shame on you Disney and Rien Johnson.,0
455,"Symbolism in this film is NOT subtle:  Luke tossing the lightsaber behind his back? Thats Rian's contempt for everything thats gone before. Luke squeezing alien sea-cow teets? Thats Disney milking the franchise dry.  All that chat about ""killing the past"" and the Fascist/Communist book-burning? Thats Kathleen Kennedy reappropriating SW's burnt out husk to serve political agendas. Utterly DISGUSTING piece of film that will only be more despised with age.",0
456,"As an original star wars fan this episode has lost the plot. It seems to tick all the PC boxes though. It is a reasonable film, but a very very bad star wars film. It broke the original story and try to establish new and absurd bases for star wars saga.The movie consists of three main storylines and two of those are 100% artificial and would not have happened if certain characters acted in a logical way.

460,"I left the theater on the night I saw Star Wars The Last Jedi thinking that it wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great. But it wasn't awful. At the same time I left feeling bothered. A kind of itch in the back of my sensibility. Something I couldn't put my finger on. I thought about it all night and into the next day. So I decided I would write out the plot on paper to get out everything i still had in my memory bank. As I wrote I began to see more and more clearly the reasons why I felt the way I did. I felt this way after the first 10 minutes of Aliens 3. I loved Alien and Aliens. Ripley had taken us on a compelling and exciting journey and we left feeling satisfied. I loved the surviving characters that were left at the end of part 2 and felt satisfied that they made it through. And then at the beginning of part 3, the writers kill off every beloved character and impregnate Ripley with an alien so she could die in the way she feared most. This is what The Last Jedi felt like. I wont get into the caricatures they made of every character or the plot holes or the story inconsistencies. But they all exist. and I understand. I think i know why. I think we are at a unique point in history. So much awareness and understanding is exploding in this country. We need more movies where all the women are heroes and martyrs and powerful. And we need more movies where men are shown to be men. reckless and angry and wishy washy and cowardly and power hungry and animal abusers and bullies. I believe there are ways to convey all of this. There are many really good movies that have been doing this wonderfully. But I think with the Last Jedi they tried but failed. I will say that it was alot of fun to see visually. It was gorgeously shot. There were a few very creative ways they expanded the mythology and universe that i really appreciated. The action sequences were riveting. The lightsaber fights were amazing. But I wish it was a different movie. I would say go see it and if you leave thinking it wasn't bad but it wasn't great, leave it there and don't overthink it.",0
461,"I don't have time to explain everything wrong with this movie, so I'll sum it up. It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie is the superficial description of the malignant issue at hand, despite what individuals defending the film may claim (trust me, most of us love women and didn't really notice or mind those themes. We wanted space battles, cool bad guys, interesting world building/characters, and lightsabers dammit! Stop redirecting the issue at hand in a way reminiscent of the current gun violence issue). It took two hours following the film for me to move past denial, and realize that the film was terrible and I hated it. There's more to it, but no one has time for all of that. It was the most emotionally disappointing movie I've seen in my entire life. Never thought I wouldn't care about seeing another new Star Wars movie again, but Rian Johnson proved me wrong. For what it's worth, the only good parts of the film were Mark Hamill's excellent (if uncharacteristic) performance, and that Praetorian Guard Fight.",0
462,"A lousy script, politically correct casting, and more feminist claptrap; Kathleen Kennedy ruins Star Wars.",0
463,This movie was so disappointing it actually hurt. I went there wanting to see a Star Wars movie and i saw a 3 hour run of silly jokes and stupidly lucky scenes where the resistance survives. Everything that happened i could have said it will before because the movie is one big cliche set in the Star Wars universe. Oh and Luke was disappointing no wonder Mark Hamill was upset with where his character was going.**** movie. If i knew i would never go and see it in the cinema.,0
464,"A bit a good parts in a sea of bad. TFA and Rogue One had me very positive on Disney's Star Wars, but this movie has destroyed its credibility. The plot was weak and seemed very incohesive to the previous movie. Contains a handful of cringeworthy moments.Get Gareth Edwards back.",0
465,"I'll admit, I'm a Star Wars fan. Not an ultra-mega-fanboy fan--just a regular, mortal fan who maybe read some EU when I was a kid.So when I walked into The Force Awakens, I tried to be pragmatic about it. Of course I wanted to be floored a la Empire Strikes Back, but I was prepared to be simply entertained like I was by Rogue One or, to a lesser extent, The Force Awakens. Sadly, at the end of TLJ, I walked out really disappointed. While I absolutely agree that the movie delivered great special effects and exciting moments, I found much of the plot to be forced and hollow. Some of my complaints are problems with modern action movies in general. For instance, the original SW movies spent enough time in each setting to establish some sense of place. Example: when Luke trained with Yoda, it actually felt like he had been training for long enough to gain some knowledge. In these new movies, one or two lessons and boom: Jedi Knight. Then it’s off, breathlessly, to the next contrived problem.Other issues, however, are specific to this movie: character overload, corny jokes, unnecessary plotlines, a stupid premise, Laura Dern’s character (why?). Where critics gush over “Nonstop Action!!!!” I was thinking “This movie is just throwing stuff at us because it doesn’t know what else to do.” It like, when the writers outlined the story, they were just like “and then, this! And then, this! And then, this! And then, this!” and so on, ad nauseum. It felt more like Marvel or Fast and Furious than Star Wars.And that’s what really bothers me--the series feels lost from a story perspective. The Empire had this great, rich history as the benevolent Republic turned fascist. The First Order, in comparison is just thin. It seems like something writers came up with to deliver “Star Wars” action. ""There has to be a bad guy, so let’s just write one in. Oh and we’ll need stormtroopers.""Star Wars is supposed to go somewhere. Trust me, I’m no fan of the Prequils, but in comparison, at least they knew where they were going. The issues with the Prequils were mostly technical—bad acting, bad directing, bad scripts—whereas the issues with this new series are both technical and fundamental. Is it the worst Star Wars movie? In absolute terms, not even close. It’s still more watchable and enjoyable than any of the Prequils. To be fair, I loved Adam Driver’s character and I thought the Snoke plot twist was brilliant. But in exchange, Star Wars has sold its soul. Disney is churning out Star Wars-flavored cotton candy. It’s all sugar, no substance. And given that these movies are the last opportunity to use much of the original trio in a meaningful way, that’s really sad.Finally, I’ll focus on the real world for a moment: I don’t understand why this movie has gotten such good reviews from critics. Maybe Disney’s scare tactics really have moved the needle on intimidating publications out of writing bad reviews. In any event, with all the praise and the giant box office opening, there’s no reason that this same formula won’t be used again and again in the many future movies currently planned.The Evil Disney Empire won. Lucasfilm has turned to the Dark Side. There’s nothing for Star Wars fans to do but flee to exile while their galaxy is twisted and plundered—and hope that someday, the light will return.",0
466,"It's not a movie, it's disaster. Lack of logic, lack of interesting characters, awful plot-twists. Waste of your time.",0
467,"It has been a sad year for Star Wars. First Star Wars Battlefront 2 with all the microtransactions and pay to win mechanic.I didn't think anything worse could happen. I underestimated Disney.First what they ruin about the original trilogy: Han's character development in the OT has been completely undone. He's back to smuggling and being egotistical. His dead was incredibly stupid. Leia has had her republic for 30 years only to end up with less rebels and an empire that is less human than the OT one, has 2 clowns as Palpatine and Vader. Luke was a beacon of hope and someone who would always be there for friends and family. His life was rough but he became the hero the rebellion needed even if that meant his life was on the line. In TLJ you will learn that Luke becomes an utter failure with low self esteem, couldn't care less about his former friends/family and goes to a cage to die. On top of all that: Vader, Luke, Yoda, Obi-Wan and Palpatine are incredibly weak in the force if you see what an untrained Rey can do. She's completely overpowered and wins at everything. Mechanic? Np. Pilot? Np. Beat Luke and Kylo in combat, np. This destroys the entire 2 other trilogies and Star Wars in general.The new characters do not get any character development. The story is stupid and unimaginative (has been done a gazzilion times in pretty much ALL sci-fi series). Can't they come up with something better with the money and writers who work for a blockbuster movie? This movie has no idea how space works (bombs falling down as if ships have enough gravity pull (death stars is an exception because of their HUGE mass). Leia floating around in Space for some time after not being hit by anything apparently. People opening the door to let her in: problems opening a door in space. Phasma was once again completly useless. Snoke was a total pushover. Force users have a ""force aura"" around them. Otherwise Jedi and Sith could just flip each others lightsaber off in duel or make them trip etc. Killing Snoke because he wasn't paying attention shouldn't be possible. Space and Star Wars? This movie doesn't get it.Also Kylo Ren? Is he a joker character for whatever side needs him the most? He should be in a mental hospital.It ruined the OT, it destroys loved characters, adds lackluster new characters, doesn't have a good story... Great shots though. Good CGI. I would rate this movie as being average. Probably rather direct to DVD. But bc it is a blockbuster with the Star Wars label which doesn't just destroys itself but the OT as well I cannot not give it a 0.",0
468,Never been this disappointed in a star wars movie ever. the utter garbage dialog didn't make sense storyline didn't make sense.,0
469,"This review contains spoilers.  The first one is that the movie spoils the whole series.First off, Luke Skywalker•	Why does Luke spend decades moping on an island while the galaxy is going to hell around him?  This is not consistent with the character we saw in Episodes 4, 5, and 6.  Luke Skywalker is not a quitter.  And he doesn’t abandon his family and friends.  If he is supposed to have become this type of person, we should see a strong and plausible explanation for this dramatic shift in his character.•	The explanation given for Luke’s flight from society is that he almost killed Ben Solo because he was corrupted by Snoke.  This again is NOT Luke’s character.  In his own past, against all odds and all facts staring him in the face, Luke committed himself to rescuing his father from the Dark Side.  And he did it.  He learned that someone even as dark as Darth Vader could be saved.  So as far as we know, the only time Luke ever tried to save someone from the dark side he was able to do so.  Why would he then become so jaded and think he couldn’t save Ben?  It doesn’t make sense.  Moreover, when did Luke Skywalker become a cold-blooded murderer who could kill his own nephew while he slept?In addition to pooping on Luke, The Last Jedi also fails to deliver on the promises set up in The Force Awakens.•	Promise:  There is some cool reason why Luke was hidden away for all these years, and why a portion of the map was left in R2D2 so that Luke could still be found.   Reality: No reason.  He’s just a bitter, jaded defeated man moping on an island.•	Promise:  There is some cool link between Rey, Luke, and Luke’s lightsaber, along with a story of why the lightsaber was there.   Reality: No explanation.  And there’s no connection at all with Rey, she’s just some random force-user who happened to pick up his lightsaber.•	Promise:  There is something cool with Rey’s parentage.  Reality: Nope, nothing.Also, character development and characterization are weak in this movie:•	Rey:  She doesn’t really change in The Last Jedi.  And why is she so powerful with no training?•	Finn:  If anything, he reverted back to a selfish coward, and had the same arc as in the previous movie, which was getting shamed into helping out the Resistance again.•	Kylo Ren:  He’s probably the most interesting character, because he does grow.  He decides he doesn’t need his overlord telling him what to do and takes matters into his own hands.  But I'm not sure I even care.•	Poe:  He has no growth, unless you count mutiny as character growth, but it doesn’t really change him.•	Snoke:  He created a force bridge connecting Kylo and Rey.  Why?  Why connect his minion with some random force-using woman half a galaxy away?  We know there are plenty other force users in the galaxy, so why did he feel the need to connect these two?  Why does he care?  This seemed like an excuse to connect the two characters, with no reasonable motivation for the character pulling the strings.The silly side plot...•	Finn and Rose fly to a casino in another star system to get a code cracker.  And somehow they’re going to convince this guy to come back with them to where the lead ship in the First Order is waiting to destroy the Resistance, and have him go ONTO that ship to help them.  Yeah, that’s plausible.•	This whole side plot felt like it was invented just to give Finn something to do in this movie.Some people claim The Last Jedi takes Star Wars into a bold new direction, and people are just complaining because it’s different.  That’s not my complaint at all.  In fact, I welcome change to the Star Wars universe, and I was hoping for something even more different and amazing.  But at the very least, I expected consistent and interesting characters, along with a well-crafted plot that fulfilled promises set forth in The Force Awakens, even as it opened new mysteries or character dilemmas of its own.Here’s the bottom line for me.  After the original Star Wars, after The Empire Strikes Back, and even after The Force Awakens, I was left wanting more and I couldn’t wait to see the next movie.  After The Last Jedi, I’m not left in anticipation at all, because they’ve left me nothing to look forward to.  Some kid pulls a broomstick to him?  Who cares?  I’m not invested in random people in the galaxy, I want to be invested in the characters on the screen, and the poor characterization in this movie fails to get me there.  Despite the amazing spectacle and the fantastic music leaving me amped up at the end of the movie, I’m ultimately left feeling flat and disappointed.",0
470,"I think this movie is the one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Having grown up with the OT, I'm a long-time Star Wars fan, although not a fanatic, and I really enjoyed TFA, despite its flaws. I am giving TLJ 1/2 point for cinematography (although I felt there was too much CGI; JJ Abrams did a much better job mixing practical effects with CGI in TFA), a 1/2 point for the musical score, a 1/2 point for the audio, and a 1/2 point for the acting.Unfortunately, the plot and lack of consistency with Star Wars cannon/lore is what ruins this movie for me. There are tons of plotholes (summarized very well by many other reviewers) and ridiculous plot devices are employed repeatedly (too much deus ex machina and too many ""gotcha"" moments, just for the sake of trying to surprise the audience without them adding anything to the overall narrative). The main plot and subplots mostly go nowhere, leaving us with little interest in what happens in the next movie. The tone is often off (e.g., the entire Canto Bight sequence feels like something from Harry Potter). The comedy was over-the-top and bordering on slapstick at times (e.g., Luke throwing the lightsabre over his shoulder). The characters are either uninteresting (e.g., Rose), annoying (e.g., Rose, Holdo), poorly developed (e.g., how does Rey become so powerful and proficient with minimal training?), or inappropriately handled (e.g., Finn, Poe, Snoke, and especially Luke; Mark Hamill was right to voice his concerns). There are few compelling character arcs. The new force abilities demonstrated are inconsistent with what we have seen in any of the preceding films and are, for the most part, ridiculous (e.g., Leia flying through space, astral projection, force FaceTime, etc). Although I was not invested in any of the major fan theories leading up to the movie, I did find it annoying that many questions posed by TFA were either ignored or answered in a very underwhelming way. As many other reviewers have pointed out, why make a big deal of these questions only to discard or minimize them in the sequel? Also, the political messages (e.g., anti-capitalism, animals rights, etc) did not need to be in there and added little to the overall narrative.Lastly, I'm not a bot or a member of the alt-right. I'm just someone who likes (liked?) Star Wars. I have absolutely no problem with having female protagonists and an ethnically diverse cast. I can only hope that Disney and Lucasfilm are taking the audience feedback seriously. They had the perfect setup to make an awesome Star Wars movie that moved the story forward in a meaningful satisfying way, but they blew it. I know it's impossible to please everyone, but there is a middle ground that I think would satisfy the majority of serious and casual fans. As we have learned with TLJ, having great actors, cinematography, CGI, and musical score will not save a movie with a terrible plot and screenplay.... P.S. I *really* wanted to love this movie. Extremely disappointed....",0
471,"Pro: It's a fun mindless action movie. If you liked episodes 1-3 and are bored of the original 4-7, this one is for you. It will likely be very profitable. And I think it gives a good view of what 'that Star Wars thing' looks like from the perspective of people who haven't seen any SW films.Cons: The plot is muddled, and it's hard to get into all of the low-stakes rabbit trails that the characters take. The main innovation seems to be self-parodying jokes that refer to how wacky it's become. This will probably appeal to people who see the Star Wars franchise as an opportunity for comedy, but it doesn't otherwise really bring any significant developments. I still have faith that Disney can come up with some original ideas that don't blatantly contradict themselves and move the story forward, but they haven't reached it yet.Also, if hyperdrives were that explosive you'd think they would have developed light-speed torpedoes long ago.",0
472,"Where do I start, oh boy...they just killed my favorite saga, what the hell where they thinking, you know what Im not even wasting words, this movie is no worth it, they killed Snoke in the most stupid possible way, I still don't like Rey (worthless character) Kylo Ren is OK, many plotholes, many worthless scenes (like the casino one, wtf)Oh and this chinese mecanic who's name i dont remember totally pointless character as well. This movie was crap, I really liked The Force Awakens despite the bad scores but TLJ is a movie I wish i could erase from my brain, I give it a 2 just because I loved Joda Muppet and that's it.",0
473,"It’s amazing to see people giving Star Wars: The Last Jedi a 10 stars rating.  It’s actually quite laughable.  The Shawshank Redemption is a 10 star movie.  Good Will Hunting is a 10 star movie.  A Beautiful Mind is a 10 star movie.  There are several other films that have well-earned that coveted 10 star perfect rating, but TLJ is not one of those films.  Not by a long shot.  TLJ is nowhere near the quality of the films mentioned above.  Most people giving TLJ a high review are not even sharing their thoughts as to why they feel TLJ deserves a perfect score.  That’s disgraceful and looks suspicious.  This is how plenty of those 10 star reviews go also. “Even though I don’t consider TLJ to be a perfect film….10 stars.”  Although there are flaws in the movie….10 stars.”  Like I said before, laughable!  On the other side of the coin, there are scores of people laying down several examples and reasons why they didn’t like and/or enjoy this film.  I’m proud to be in this camp.I watched TLJ twice.  After my first viewing, I left the theater feeling unsatisfied.  After the second viewing, I left the theater feeling disgusted.  There are so many great negative reviews pointing out all the flaws in the film which, I for the most part agree with, but I wanted to touch upon how horrible the movie ended.  Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So the film ends with a feeling of hope.  Rey has everything she needs because Yoda says so.  Rey doesn’t need any Jedi combat and force training, because she has a few ancient Jedi texts to read through.  I tried this type of training once in my life.  When I was sixteen, I bought and read through Bruce Lee’s, Tao of Jeet Kune Do, hoping to become of great fighter on my own.  I trained a little on my own like Rey did in the film.  Twenty five years later, I’m still waiting for the book reading to pay off.  This is essentially what’s being proposed in The Last Jedi.  This is absolute nonsense.   After all, Abrams did start off this Mary Sueness in Rey, so I suppose it’s only fitting that Abrams has to finish it.  My only question on this topic now is who is going to train Rey?  Answer: No one or a Luke force ghost which IMO are both terrible options.  Good luck Abrams.    The resistance has everything they need also because why…did I miss something?   Recap: Luke is dead; the resistance is down to 20 or so people, they have no capital ships or star fleet, no small star fighters or bombers, etc .  The only ship in the resistance arsenal is the Millennium Falcon.  When the resistance called for aid on Crait, no star systems came to help.  No one even responded to the distress call!!!  But hey, there’s a force sensitive slave kid at the end of the movie who’s going to take that broom and squash the First Order with it.  The movie tries to portray that even though the resistance got their butts kicked (except Rey of course) that the resistance will come back stronger than ever.  How?   The way the story was written, there is no possible way for the resistance to come back from this butt kicking.  If the solution is to write that all these star systems want to help now in IX you better give one hell of an explanation as to why they changed their minds.  As far as I’m concerned, hope is dead for the resistance and the Star Wars franchise, especially with the way Kathleen Kennedy is running things at Lucas Film.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy left a massive mess for Abrams to clean up in IX. The Force is human, it is not female only.   The force connects all of humanity, female, male, black, white, Christian, Muslim, Atheist, Democrat, Republican, young, old, jocks, nerds, you name it…it unifies.  Mr. George Lucas, thank you for bringing Star Wars into this world.  Your Star Wars truly unified.",0
474,What a boring waste of time this movie turned out to be.  Was slightly interested in Rey possibly going darkside but thats it.  Everything else felt like pure undirected garbage.,0
475,"Much   said already about    this piece  of crap , I m just sad  because I started   watching  the  Star Wars saga in 1977 but I quit now, they simply destroyed it",0
476,"This movie is utter garbage, with flimsy characters that seem to be here only to destroy the lore of the serie, and to backup the SJW agenda of the movie director and the producers. All the true Star Wars fans will be outraged by how they threated the lore of the movie, and how poorly the new characters personalities and motivations are drawn.",0
477,"Well, let's start with most disapointing aspect: All, that was in TFA, all of this unresolved plot points were thrown away. Thanks, Disney, my expectations about you were right. 0 points for you. It's seems to me, that people forgot or even didn't know, that movies are stories at first and visuals at second. And this is second disapointing aspect of film: A ridiculous exchange from plot to visuals. 0 points for you, Disney. Repeating a scenes from original trilogy is not an issue here. It's just a symptom of one of the worst problems of this film: Lack of understanding and appreciation of source material. I don't know if director is a Star Wars fan, but I know something for sure: Fans never mix their favorites with mud! 0 points for you, Disney.And in the end... we have... 0 points! What a surprise!",0
478,"Even Mark Hamill said the script was deeply flawed. More than that, it's a disgrace. Rian Johnson and Disney have rounded up the cannon and lore as we know it, kicked it to its knees, and blew its brains out. No longer does Star Wars have a meaning or a message.",0
479,"I had an unsettling feeling about this film when the ""can you hear me?"" jokes started at the beginning of the film. it only got worse from there. Just awful, dreadful movie-making. ONE scene stuck in my memory: that of using a capital ship as a Weapon of Lightspeed Destruction. The rest was easily forgotten. This may be the 1st Star Wars movie I don't purchase or see again.",0
480,This film has the worst script ever. like a blind person tries to explain a film to a deaf person.And the plot holes... oh the plot holes...,0
481,"Has some great performances by Andy Serkis and Adam Driver, but is surrounded by some really thin scripting and cheesy - ""one liners, lets try and appeal to 8yr olds"" humour eg Porgs. When you're given the whole Star Wars Universe and this is all you can come up with is really sad. Sad to me because I love Star Wars, grew up with the toys from in the 80's and have an ingrained affinity for the Star Wars universe etc, but I am flawed as to how 100's of millions of dollars can buy pretty looking action scenes, yet a boring plot, mediocre performances and immature scripting. Remember those scenes from the originals that gave you goosebumps at pivotal points? This movie sadly has none that I can recall. I can imagine the pressure from Disney to sell toys must be immense, but if this movie had some substance... as a 43yr old I would've bought an expensive toy for myself. Now, my advice is, wait to see it on Netflix (with a 60inch TV or better) especially given how long and hollow the movie is @ 2hrs33min.",0
483,"I’m a casual Star Wars fan, not a die-hard or a bot. I felt compelled to register and leave this review because of the media campaign to pretend that this is a good movie. It isn’t. The writing is very poor, plot holes all over the place, pointless characters (Rose)... in one movie Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy managed to destroy everything good about Star Wars. The treatment of Luke’s character is so poor, so lazily put together, so incoherent, so blatantly disrepectful of the original trilogy... What boggles the mind is how nobody (apart from Mark Hamill, bless his heart) tried to course correct this absolute insult of a movie. This isn’t bad because people “refuse to accept change” or “didn’t get what they wanted” or “have a problem with strong female characters”... this is bad because the writing is absolutely brain-dead.",0
484,"This film was hot Garbage, Rian Binks is no fan of Star wars that's pretty obvious, apart from some parts looking impressive on the big screen, all the rest was terrible since when was star wars a comedy??. I feel missled as I really enjoyed the trailer but after watching this crap they hid all the bad stuff. and the story was shocking and why end Luke like that, He should have watched Logan that""s a much better way to end a great character, I will never pay to watch another Star Wars film. and I did like TFA and rougue one was very good.RIP Star Wars.",0
485,"highly disappointing sequel, abysmal writing and poor character writing and development makes me not recommend this movie to anyone. Mary Sue characters and forced character (rose) story arcs just take the fun out of the star wars lore. Nothing was explained, ton of plot holes and no regard for the lore will make any star wars pull his hair out. Save your money and time.",0
486,"TLJ was the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced at a movie theater. I had low expectations to begin with. The only reason I saw it in theaters was because I didn't want anything to be spoiled for me: Rey's origins/past/parents, Snoke's identity/past, and the Knights of Ren. It turns out that there was nothing to spoil. All of the questions from TFA were completely ignored. I immediately told my friends how disappointing this movie was in order to save them $15 and 2 1/2 hours of their lives. I felt it was my duty & responsibility to do so. I wish someone had done the same for me.",0
487,"MICKEY STRIKES BACK: DISNEY 'LASTS' THE JEDI -Spoilers follow. If you are a fan of Star Wars lore & charismatic main characters traversing a powerful story arc, Disney provides epic disappointment.  Rebellious heroics, compelling battle scenes, Luke, Yoda, Chewy, R2 & C3PO -all scrapped in this debasing of SW. The foundations of Jedi lore: master/apprentice traditions, humility, purpose, self development, virtue, loyalty -all cast aside. In the new SW one girl possesses all of these traits without having earned even one of them. And if you've had enough of compelling real locations, riveting light saber fights, & memorable side characters, then this is your ticket.  In this new SW universe a few strong women reprimand heroes & lead faceless 'rebels' into obliteration. Devoiding the audience of any care of outcome to characters, no established struggle is connected to us, so who really cares if they all die? The few intriguing characters are gone just as soon as we were drawn to them. Snoke, powerful Supreme leader, easily taken out by an errant saber. Benecio del ‘DJ' exhibiting Han Solo like charisma –all the better to banish him in a few quick scenes.  Luke went to all the trouble of projecting himself holographically (note: holographs can’t be killed) only to die from the labor of it. Poe, the one character exhibiting clear heroic struggle, was reduced to submissiveness for all his 'wrong moves', which turned out to be right after all. i.e. Had he gone in with fighters (which can also carry bombs) to blow up the Dreadnaught, instead of being sidelined for an undeveloped new (female) hero to do so much later, far fewer rebels would have been pointlessly killed. Instead of X-wing dogfights, we are dragged through the sleepy drama of large ships inching through space. The far superior New Order force is unable to overtake nor flank the Rebels –an excruciating plot device. This epic chase slogged us over an hour of nothingness. Suddenly we are transported to the 18th century suspense of a seagoing ship taking 3 days to driftingly overtake another. So let’s spare the further detail which will be suffered by those who still choose to see this film (code: bring a pillow & eye covers for act two). Yet we still have to get to the burning heart of the 4 mysteries we shared going into TLJ.1. What about Luke Skywalker? 2. Who are Rey’s parents? 3. Who is Snoke? 4. Will The Last Jedi use TFA as a springboard to broaden the SW universe?....1. Luke Skywalker, the heart of  the SW universe & all that we know him to be, is suddenly debased & expendable. The new Luke no longer believes in the Force. He is easily bested by a novice. To make matters worse, he betrays family-his nephew, Ben Solo, causing the storm to follow. This means that all his personal arc & the prophecy fulfillment (SW I-VI) of Luke bringing balance to the force, which he did with his father, is negated. Luke's most powerful trait, his belief in Good is also lost. SW VIII invalidates all of the greatest Star Wars' values & achievements by debasing the fundamentals of who Luke Skywalker is. Simply put, we should not have bothered to spend the previous 4 decades watching Star Wars & sharing the values in the Jedi allegories, lore & collections we all so treasure. It all means diddly now. Luke ends worse than he began.-And Yoda, evidently unimpressed that his teachings led Luke to save the galaxy years before, pops up for a few seconds to second the notion that it all has to burn.Luke’s three final accomplishments were to argue with a teenage girl as if he was still the same teenager we all met on long long ago on Tatooine, to lose belief in all that he earned through the Star Wars epics, & to die without just cause.2. Who are Rey’s parents? ‘These are not the parents we are looking for, move along.’ In a quick quip Kylo Ren invalidates all deeper interest, revealing that Rey’s parents were no-name deserters. So, no mystery to hold onto there. Unless… this is a clumsily written misdirection from a truth that would be deeper & the only logical possibility...In that this epic has no other Force lending fertile couples other than Leia & Han Solo, Rey IS Kylo Ren’s sister. For now, she is not. Her parents were nobodies.3. We finally get to see Snoke in the flesh. He is very impressive with powers not shown before in SW-the ability to mind bridge other force users to his own ends. His origin, why he is so powerful, his aims & other abilities- never to be known. Before we could develop a better understanding or compelling fear of him,  he allowed a carelessly placed lightsaber to be easily used to kill him.4. I went in to the first showing, open to the joys of suspended disbelief, & with the Force of will to like this Star Wars movie irregardless of any incongruities & the occasional Jar Jar. The only problem was, by any measure of that far far away galaxy, this was not a Star Wars movie. It's just Mickey's Revenge on the Jedi.",0
488,Boring SJW festival. Terrible writing and no logic. Boring heroes and villians. Was dissapointed. Will not watch episode 9 or give any money to Disney whatsoever,0
489,"This movie ruined the well built Star Wars framework. Trashing a fleet of Star Destroyers by hitting 1 with light speed? Why all the space fight before? Bombardment in 0 gravity? Hmm.... Turning one of the most positive character to a bitter negative old man without proper backing, who dies of exhaustion? The director is very weak in respect of character building. Ray is a master technician can repair everything, self taught jedi whos power rivals the baddie who had years of training. An all powerful flawless character is ridiculous. 10 year old kids can come up with such hero. Leia flies in 0 gravity and survives (missing jedi training again).  Every baddie is neurotic. Where are the serious cool thinkers, who people can believe that they can build a serious war machine? And who is Snoke? Where was he during the original episodes and how does he ground the First Order? He is killed as an idiot nobody! How is that a couple of red guards are almost a match for 2 force users? These are all serious flows in the movie and that the director still does not comprehend what fans are talking about is the worst thing of all. This is more like Space Balls 3 than Star Wars 8.",0
490,"If you love Disney but hate everything Lucas brought to the original cannon, then this is for you.",0
491,"Real Bad. Hard to live up to the legacy but that didn't even try to fit in with the continuity of the other movies and such an awful ending. After that one, what is the point? Every new movie is going to keep changing everything set by the last movie; no mysteries will be answered; and clearly scrapping the bottom with plotting.",0
492,"Literally every character has been ruined. If you think that this is an expansion on the force awakens you will be very wrong. Writers have absolutely zero imagination, and have essentially thrown out what could have been a fantastic reboot of the series.",0
493,"DON'T waste your money on this cheap half assed and pathetic attempt at ripping fans off from their money and Rian Johnson have the audacity to say that ""it's too big to fail"" well it failed you failed and let down 30 years of story and love for a amazing sci-fi series and Idk if you just wanted it to be too pg13 and we need to make rated R because right now the last Jedi is just a sad joke. It's like you didn't even watch force awakens which I already thought was bad but no let's keep lowering the bar for what we call a ""great movie"" and then you just try to dismiss fans ratings and just say we are nitpicky and trolling. No you are just a terrible movie producer and you apologize and withdraw this pile of crap. Kill it like Eragon and start over with a writing cast that actually cares about star wars not just wants to make another marvel style money machine.",0
494,I rated this movie lower because of how awfully suspect the critic ratings are.  This movie was visually stunning and Mark Hamill and Adam Driver had awesome performances.  The major problem with this movie is that it ignores basic storytelling aspects.  This is supposed to be part of a trilogy which indicates that the story has some internal consistency.  If this was a stand alone movie the writer/director can make their own decisions.  Rian Johnson cast away every major decision that was laid out in the previous film.  Some have likened it the children playing the game add to the story with a sentence until it gets to one who totally changes the story that came from those before.  This movie had an inverse of the Empire Strikes Back story.  Several of the characters serve no purpose.  Major changes in the force made absolutely no sense when you look at previously established movies.  People say there are bold choices.  It is not bold to totally ignore established plot lines.  So much is desperately wrong with this movie and the fact that the studio insults the intelligence of the audience makes it necessary to rate it even lower.,0
495,"I created this account especially to write a review here and share my sad experience with The Last Jedi movie. I'm a teen. Yes, I'm new generation and I had never see a Star Wars movie before. My parents and two older brothers, and also uncles, aunts and cousins, most of them just love Star Wars. So I always wanted to watch these movies and figure out for myself what is so special about them. But it didn't happen until my friend called me and say: ""let's see the new Star Wars on the movie theater"". And I say: ""Yeah"". I was so hesited to finally watch a Star Wars! I was going finally to understand why so many people in the whole world take this saga almost as a religion, a lifestyle or so, why it's so important to them, even influencing their own lives. Then we went to the movies and most of time I was thinking: ""So this is it? That's the great Star Wars?"" When I looked at my friend she was just more interested in eating her popcorn than  understanding the movie! When I left the theater I said to her: ""What a pointless buch of scrap!"" I came home and said: ""Sorry dad, sorry mum but Star Wars sucks!"". They knew I was going to the movies but they didn't know wich movie I was going to see and so I saw the shock on their faces and they asked me if I was talking about The Last Jedi and I said ""yes"" and they looked at me with sad eyes and then my dad said: ""honey, this is not Star Wars. This crap you saw is only a Disney attempt to destroy our dreams in order to make more money, because they believe that every boy and girl of your generation is stupid to be fooled by this fake Disney Wars"". He was so serious that I have all of his words on my head until now and it happened three days ago. My uncle has the entire collection of six original movies of Star Wars in Blu Ray. He lent them to me, so I could see the true Star Wars. So, I picked up the first one The Phantom Manace and watched it. I just loved it! It has an intriguing story and attractive characters like Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Queen Amidala (I adore her!), a misterious villain and another that I found really scary, Darth Maul. He looked like the devil himself! And that little cute boy. OMG! I fell in love with him and I got very interested in what's the big question about him. Who was he? Why was he so special and talented? He've got some powers and I understood that the story of Star Wars was basically about him. The second movie, Attack of the Clones, I loved it even more,and the whole story is far more than just entertaining. The little boy grew into a rebel teenager and he is in love with the senator Amidala and then he loses his mother. At the same time there are many other interesting things going on in the movie, with Obi Wan investigating the bount hunter and... Jedi council, the battles... Everything about the movie is so enjoyeble, and the third one, Revenge of the sith, a sad and touching movie, I cried watching many of its scenes. Good acting, wonderful story, that matches perfectly witn the fourth one, A New Hope that comes and also explains everything. This movie actually brings a new hope as we Ani's twins grew up and fight against the Empire and the real devil of the saga, Darth Sidious. Then it comes the fifth The Empire Strikes back and more emotions come with it. We see Yoda again and the  ""No, I am your Father"" scene. I cried again and I wished from the botton of my heart that Luke could bring his father to the good side again. And that's what he does in the sixth and last (yes, last) movie of the saga Return of the jedi! It's complete and perfect. I also liked Jar Jar and the Ewoks (my parents are not exactly their fans). And I was really wanting to see all the six movies again! That didn't happen with the garbage I saw in the movie theater! So, the young guy who firmly believed his father could be saved and turned to the good side again is the same old master that considered to kill his nephew? Ok. His father was already in the dark side for more than 20 years, and even so he didn't want to kill him! But the boy was not even in the dark side yet and he was going to assassinate him and cowardly, when he was sleeping???? No! This is not the same character, this is not the same saga. I understand why my parents, uncles, cousins and many friends are so sad. Disney is really ruining a wonderful franchise. But for me only the six wonderful movies count and I'll be always happilly watching them on and on and on. The rest, as my dad said, is Disney Wars, not Star Wars at all. Disney almost made me think that Star Wars was nothing but garbage. And I'm happy to figure out that it's not because the eps 1-6 together make the most emotional and well written story that I've ever see or read in my entire (and still short) life. Period.",0
496,"Out of all the recent Star Wars movies this one was my most anticipated. Ok the Force Awakens might have just rehashed the Episode 4 story but it put the fun and adventure back into series and gloriously built up to the moment where The Last Jedi begins... Oh ok the start of the movie was crap. The middle of the movie was crap and yep the end of the movie was crap too, for all the reasons the other audience reviews have mentioned over and over. I so wanted to like this movie but it's crap - total crap with exception of the mighty fine visual effects. It's such a dog it just might kill the whole Star Wars series completely.",0
497,"The visuals and sound are the only reason this gets a 2. The story gets a big, fat zero. What they did to Luke Skywalker alone is probably the most heinous thing ever done to a movie character - ever. This movie pretty much ruins everything that was said and done beforehand. It is a deconstructionist, post modern social justice piece of garbage.",0
498,"This is not the Star Wars we love. I dont care about any of the characters. We dont get any cool Jedi fights, the one with Luke Skywalker was dreadful.",0
499,"Committed character assassination, redefined the force and had mostly useless characters. They might say it's new and modern but it isn't. It is horrible what they have done to this amazing 40 year old epic journey.",0

501,"This is without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie in the franchise, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. No, I'm not saying that because I expected something different and am disappointed. No, I am not saying that because a beloved character dies. I am saying this because the movie has poor pacing, poor tone, completely self-contradictory and illogical plot movements, plot holes everywhere, no character arch, and simultaneously destroys any hope of the new characters being interesting AND the legacy of old heroes. The ""gotcha"" reversal of expectations moves, which became horribly predictable, were nauseating. The comedy never landed, and destroyed the tone. The feminist and animal activist politics were completely overbearing (and self-contradictory). At every opportunity to create good character development, the movie falls flat. Do we need to talk about alien boob milking, ships that go exactly the same speed for an entire film, useless Canto Bite missions, dying from over-meditation, or any of the other nonsensical events? Do we really need to go there? Because I can. Trust me when I say: this is not the Star Wars you were looking for. Avoid.",0
502,Luke deserved better than to appear that he just got out of a re-hab and angry at everyone and everything!!! Terrible plot!!,0
503,"Truly, truly horrible movie that fails repeatedly in almost every way. It does its utmost best to make you hate the legends you grew up with. And it fails at that, too, thankfully. Utter garbage.",0
504,"This movie defies all expectations - not by exceeding them, but rather by tossing them into the trash compactor. The force is treated with little respect (I am aware it's a fantasy story) and the Skywalker bloodline is made irrelevant; anyone can be a Jedi with little to no training. By the way we are to now to ponder in a postmodern sense about whether the Jedi are ultimately a good thing. We are treated to not-so-subtle lessons in how terrible men are at leading and accomplishment, while simultaneously drilled on how great women are at all things. The larger than life mastermind of the wannabe Empire is dispatched as if he were nonessential to the plot of the new trilogy. The same fate befalls the underused Boba Fe.... I mean Captain Phasma. Finn, who really needs a good story line, is now sent to an ultimately useless mission that spins as an on the nose / finger wagging moral lesson on war and greed. His pal is a new character created to ensure sales for the international market. BB8 isn't even developed beyond a couple of quick scenes, but Chewbacca does make a cameo near the beginning an end. It's as if the director wants to say to all of the fans, ""Star Wars is silly and forgettable, laugh at Luke drinking milk from the teat of a sea cow and shut up!"" It is an epic troll, a spit in the face of the spirit of the original trilogy.",0
505,"Star Wars, The Last Jedi is representative of the lack of storytelling skill endemic in some quarters of modern Hollywood.The film lacks logic, character development, suffers from disjointed tone and offers nothing to carry the Star Wars saga into the future.It simply represents a series of disconnected vignettes that refuse to allow characters to develop, and despite the excellent visuals offers nothing of substance. At all.From it's opening minutes the script devolves into farce; there is a terrible monotony to the pacing of the writing where any potentially serious moment is immediately attempted to be lightened by an elementary school level joke. The audience is subjected to a non stop barrage of character assassinations, (the old guard in particular; Luke (he has to die, we get it, but the script missed a huge opportunity to send this character off), Leia (reduced to farce), but also the new characters suffer from a writer/director who has apparently completely failed to understand his audience.In a bizarre directional choice any attempt at adding backstory to the significant players is wasted on a sub plot to rescue 'horses' that achieves nothing. Not even rescuing the 'horses'. They are simply left for dead. It's symbolic of the whole film.  As a pure piece of entertainment spectacle the film has also failed. The audience I was part of in Tokyo left the theater in a state of confusion and shock. Recently there have been some great Science Fiction films made (Bladerunner 2049, and further back Ex Machina). while these films inhabit a different genre, I mention them because of the consistency of their tone, the character development that takes place, and their ability to tell us a story we can invest in and carry beyond the theater.In contrast The Last Jedi is totally forgettable. It fails as a comedy, a work of science fiction fantasy, and most importantly it fails as a coherent continuation of the film that proceeded it in the Star Wars story. I have rated it a 2 for it's technical and visual prowess. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone above the original trilogy or any alternative work of science fiction or fantasy.",0
506,They've killed the saga with this movie and turned it into a joke anyone who's a starwars fan of old who's been waiting for the end of this saga had just been kicked in the teeth. This movies plot was very weak as was the script direction humour and lore everything was off the mark even the language felt wrong for a starwars movie. The rebellion who won 30 years ago and should of been in power have been reduced to the resistance the what? Yeah the resistance instead of the rebellion. We were expecting a Fin and Rey movie discovering the force and becoming jedi and we were treated to the po dameron show they should of stuck to their guns and killed him off in the first of the trilogy. Still they've done the same lame thing with the bf2 single player campaign which is utter trash. The director claims to be a starwars fan but i have my doubts. Was that Yoda using force lightening to burn the tree? Isn't force lightening a dark side force? It has been in every piece of starwars so far. After bf2 and these two terrible movies I'm done with starwars the franchise for me finished at return of the Jedi. Screw Disney and screw Rian or whatever his name is I'll be boycotting them both from now on.,0
507,"what a waste of time, totally predictable, no soul, no usefull massages, just a few special effects worth mentioning, simple commercial product nobody needs...",0
508,I am literally still in shock. Its painful to see the death of a franchise. To be honest if anyone manages to see this review out of the thousands all I can say is don't let disney win. Don't let them take your money so they can milk you for money money to sell crappy chicken porg toys. Lets send them a message that they actually have to give a damn about this beloved franchise and not just milk it for money.,0
509,"A tragic tale of a director/writer who froze when it came to step up to tell a potentially great story, ripped off two of the original trilogy movies in one, ruined a great classic character and ended a story where the characters went through no changes. A pointless plot, a failed attempt at shock and awe but somehow managed to pull rave reviews from professional critics. Everyone is a critic, but this movie makes me trust the payroll critics even less.",0
510,"Having always loved the Star Wars franchise and after seeing the Force awakens and Rogue one i had pretty high hopes for this one and was looking forward to this movie. But all ready at the first scene something was not right, Poe calling Hux was a horrible cringe moment and from there it just got worse with the jokes, they might work in the marvel universe but it does not work in Star Wars.  The horrible story arc of Finn and Rose which was a complete waste of time, the Canto Bight scene all for the sake of watching a little kid force pull a broom in the end and at the moment when Finn actually have a good scene trying to stop the big Laser its ruined by Rose, which then goes on to deliver the most cringy speech ever in a star wars movie. Now comes the question how did they not get shot to piece by the walkers as they crashed very close to them ..?? horrible writing.The story Arc of Luke is also very disappointing, I wont even go into detail but it is just awfull. The story of Kylo is that he still a whiny EMO which is on purpose to make Rey look better and here comes the Kathleen Kennedy influence. Rey is just Meeeehh there is no reason to relate to her because its obvious that she is female version of Luke but much more bland and no depth. And ooohhh the plot holes here we go. Why didn't Holdo just tell Poe what the plan was..?? Why would Luke try to kill his Nephew because he saw some darkness in him, considering how he would not stop to try and turn a much more evil being that he barely knew..??How could Snoke escape Darth Sidious and Darth Vader clearly he was strong in the force and had experienced the rise and fall of the empire which means the 2 sith lords should have sensed him, where did his dark side training come from..??Where are the knights of Ren..??Why didn't the resistance not just use the 2 fregats that ran out of fuel as weapons like Holdo did with the last cruiser..?? There are many many more points that makes this movie so disappointing but I will end here.Overall it was such an disappointment to watch.",0
511,"As a standalone movie, it's okay.  Some pacing issues and WTF moments but not terrible.  If it were the first ""Star Wars"" movie ever, I'd probably rate it a 6-7 (overall enjoyable but with some faults).  It's not though...As a Star Wars movie with almost 40 year of backstory, lore, and character development...it's pretty bad.  It breaks almost everything that has been built until this point.  I feel like it was written by someone with only a passing knowledge of Star Wars or who intentionally trolled fans.Actions don't fit with characters, there are some significant plot holes, Jedi training breaks with every other movie (Rey is instantly god-like but Jedi training normally takes years/decades), notion of the force and balance goes against everything pushed in the prequels, timeline doesn't fit well with the immediate aftermath of the previous film other than Rey/Luke, the end of the space chase makes you wonder why this isn't done all the time to take out capital ships/death stars and makes all the previous military tactics look stupid, etc.  The Force Awakens set up a lot of mysteries and this movie basically said none of them matter and was sort of dismissive of them in my opinion (e.g., Rey's parents, Snoke, Knights of Ren, what's Luke been doing). Also as a practical matter, Princess Leia is a character that probably should have gone out in any number of points in the story but she's the only one who survives.  There are a lot of epic moments she could have died heroically.   Given the realities of the situation, this doesn't make much sense.The Rey/Kylo interaction is pretty well done.  That would be the highlight of the movie.  Most of the other characters are weak or just not well developed.",0
512,This movie is an awful **** Realy It's the worst Star Wars movie ever I seen...,0
513,This is not only the worst Star Wars movie to ever be created but also one of the worst movies i have watched in my entire life. However if you're into SJW feminist propaganda then you're going to like it.,0
514,I made the mistake of paying for this steaming pile. First of all this movie is about 45 minutes too long. Second it has no emotional core to it - it feels like a script written by committee with a direction to be less obvious this time around in plagiarizing empire strikes back. I give up.,0
515,"Here's all you need to know about the Last Jedi:Luke Skywalker ended up an attempted child murderer who was sucking an alien walrus' mammaries while Han Solo, his best friend, was dying. Yoda ended up a book burner, burning 1000s of years of patriarchal Jedi knowledge. Admiral Ackbar ended up dying to make way for the Lesbian Feminist Alliance. Poe Dameron suffers from toxic masculinity. Finn suffers from toxic masculinity. Kylo Ren suffers from toxic masculinity. All men suffer from toxic masculinity and belong to the patriarchy. Women are perfect. Men are evil. Make sure you vote for the vagina in 2020. The End.",0
516,This film is the worst Star Wars ever made. It deserves some credit for some of the action scenes. Apart from that there is nothing left of good. The story is completely flawed and characters are utterly underdeveloped. I regret having watched it.,0
517,"Spoilers. It was absolute garbage.1. Leia in space was jarring.2. Many times there was emotional tension, and it would immediately cut to something else.3. How are Finn and Rose going to just escape the chase, do stuff, then make it back without the empire harassing them?4. The crystal fox was unique and fantastic, but only cheapened with more of them just walking around amongst humans. A single crystal fox acting like the white rabbit alice in wonderland motif would have been sufficient. Having dozens of them was in poor taste.5. Rey is a mary sue. She got less training that Luke Skywalker, who is also a mary sue.6. The jedi fight scene looked contrived. It panned forward as the red knights were twirling like ballerinas in a tarantino film. How were the red guards supposed to even see through their visors?7. Why was there a romantic interest from Rose over Finn only so Finn could throw his arms around Rey again?8. Why did Rose decide to taze someone when the rebels are a voluntary force?CGI-but-also-muppet Yoda was just a bad mix. His characterization was nauseating.9. The coastal alien milking scene was something like it was straight out of Rick and Morty, not Star Wars.10. The rebels had nothing to celebrate at the end. The pilot character had people kamikaze at the beginning and they were reduced to like 20 people.11. The beginning scene with the bombs being dropped... how can you drop bombes in space? The explosion of bombs in space isn't going to be effective in the vacuum of space.12. The thief that helped Finn and Rose mentions weapons sales to both sides, and then it's never brought up again. That was the single most important thing that Rose and Finn found out and they didn't bother to tell the other Rebels when they got back.It was just a bad movie.",0
518,"Why critics loved this movie: it subverts and destroys everything that comes before, so it's ""unexpected"" and jarring. It turns the subtle humor into pure camp slapstick.  It invalidates the original's journey of heroes by placing them all in a universe of ultimate failure, deep self-doubt, and sorrow for what could have been.  It destroys well-loved characters in meaningless moments.  Literally everything about this film is Anti-StarWars.  Massive plot holes and ignored history are almost championed as the CGI dazzles your eyes, and the ""powerful females"" and ""heroes aren't real, everyone is their own hero"" memes are inserted erratically and without any real emotion.  I think BB-8 is a good metaphor for this movie overall: instead of the charming and beloved character you got with R2D2, here you get a constantly spinning mess with no soul or love, and occasionally the head flies off because humor or something.  This movie is an insult to movie-making, an insult to fans of the Star Wars universe, and an insult to storytelling.",0

521,Probably the worst competently made movie ive ever seen. I genuinely felt upset  for at least a week after I first saw this piece of trash out of sheer disappointment. The prequels were bad but this movie ruined Star Wars. Even after the prequels I was still a die hard Star Wars fan but now ive lost all excitement for this brand and will not see another one of these movies in the theater.,0
523,"Just so we are clear. I am not a bot. I am 56 years old and first saw SW in 1977 at age 16. I have watched all the SW films MANY times and I have tens of thousands of dollars in merchandise.I did not like force awakens much but only because I thought it was a rehash and reboot rather than a continuation. They could have taken a risk and done something new and fresh. I have watched it again but only for the Millenium Falcon and Hans!Last Jedi is a different beast. It's bad. VERY VERY BAD and for all the reasons others here have posted and then some. I will never ever watch it again. never ever buy any merchandise it generates. did I say never?Some would like to think that these negative audience reviews are fake or bot driven but it just ain't so. Last Jedi is so bad that it motivated me to sign up and have a say here and also on Rotten Tomatoes. I rarely do reviews.that's the real reason for the backlash. not bots. just motivated real people. and if we, the audience, actually loved it, the gross takings would have been much more than $591m. because I would likely have seen it more than once.like most others this franchise is dead to me. I will never re-watch it. never buy it for home. never buy merchandise. did I say never? I will also NOT go to the theater for the next one. I'll just watch it free on Netflix if its any good.Dear Disney may I kindly suggest you listen to your audience rather than these few twit PC critics and PC journalists who choose tickle your ear. Or, better yet, listen to me.thanks.",0
524,"This movie just ruined my childhood heros, i really love the original saga but this one is the worst by far. The jokes are stupid, not funny and had nothing to do with a star wars movie !The Scenario is flat, the way Luke dies is a nonsense...Too many things to say against this movie, i don't want to spend to many time on it !",0
525,"I wanna start of with saying i made an account just to this review here.Simply the worst star wars movie to date, bunch of bland characters that you aren't even given a proper chance to connect to. Not only that it kills off important characters like it was nothing, hey wanna know about Snoke? well too bad, it was too much work so we'll just kill him off, oh but Phasma must be an interesting character right, she could put up a fight right? nope, gets killed off just as fast as a 12 year watching porn would climax.Well atleast the story might be good you ask? once again not really,fights are drawn out so much and not very interesting at all to say the least. What strikes me a lot is how well Rey fought against THE EMPIRIAL **** GAURDS TOO **** WELL, are you **** me, the most highly trained guards in the galaxy gets killed off by a little girl with no prior experience in combat that trained against a **** boulder... really?! oh yeah and Finn should be dead atleast 2 times in this movie, no way miss asian woman could have saved him the in front of that canon.and oh the plotholes in this movie... i could write a lot about this movie and how much of a disapointment it is to me, but i simply don't have the energy for me to rant on. Rian Johnson you have failed and ruined Star Wars forever.",0
526,"The film has its pros and cons. Still I can't rate it higher. Especially after what Rian Johnson did with Luke. It's awfull. There is no character development, interesting subplot or finishing plot threads from TFA, but it has a nice graphic.",0
527,"This movie simply sucks as a Star Wars main movie.It seems Rian Johnson wanted to tell a story, while completely neglecting the Star Wars legacy, bending it only as a mean to arrive at a certain plot!The whole setting is forced. As the second entry of the trilogy, having a fairly good starting point from TFA, I don't understand why the galaxy situation was not explained. It just seems like a lazy writing work, when Star Wars is all about the galaxy as a whole, about politics, different groups and aliens.Which reminds me, the majority of the caracters were human. Why in a Star Wars movie?? I think it should never be a Star Wars episode. Maybe as a standalone, detailing one of the countless battle scenes between a Rebel/Resistance group against the Empire/First Order, with different characters(!), it could have been a good idea. But as one of the main episodes? Forcing the characters to change only to fit a plot written by a seemingly newcomer into the Star Wars world?? Come on...I believe that in order to make Star Wars movies, some strong and maybe completely different approaches to filmmaking must be adopted.For example: to have a (or a team of) writer(s) respecting the lore as much as possible. There should never be a person in charge of the franchise who doesn't respect the established rules;Assign the same producing/writing/directing people behind a complete trilogy. Only then can we have consistency. The work from JJ Abrams in TFA was completely destroyed in TLJ..I give it 1 for the amazing sound and visual effects. The acting is also quite competent, even convincing. To bad it doesn't make up for the direction of the movie.It seems to me we have a waisted trilogy.Just hope this doesn't ruin the franchise..Cheers!",0
528,"I am still stunned at how jaw droppingly awful The Last Jedi is. It truly is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! No character development, nonsensical plot, poor continuity (e.g. the Resistance stated that being tracked through hyperspace was impossible, yet the Millenium Falcon was tracked through hyperspace in Ep.IV - Leia even states ""They're tracking us""), plagiarisation of the previous films, etc, etc, etc. I can't believe how this pile of sh*te ever managed to make it to the screen. No doubt that Disney will keep the SW gravy train a-rolling, but I for one won't be boarding again!",0
529,"I gave this movie two stars only because it's Star Wars film and I am biased. Overall the best way for me to describe this film is that it's one giant itch that never gets scratched. My main issues are with Luke's overall story, Snoke's lack of story, not enough light Saber, Leia space Jesus.......never mind this movie is all bad.  /sigh",0
530,"I cant believe this film belongs to the star wars saga, how can someone destroy a history of something in so little time? There is not a connection with the first movies. OMFG",0
531,This movie was an offence to the Star Wars franchise. The prequels were better than this load of garbage.,0
532,"Awful recycled plot with little to no character development. Rehashed action scenes that make you think you've seen them before somewhere such as the original trilogy, and just a disorienting 2.5 hour mess of a movie that does little else besides assasinate characters you care about and shove down your throat characters that you don't.John Williams kills it as usual, and the movie looks great but the story is so bad you can't help but feel that it is truly meant to just be insulting to the fanbase on purpose.I can no longer support anything Rian Johnson directs from here on out. Easily the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I had a lot of problems with Episode 7 (plot holes mostly) but I generally enjoyed it in theatres. I hate this movie, I will never watch it again. This movie does nothing else for me besides make me hate it more the more I think about it.Skip this movie Star Wars fans. Do yourself that favor.",0
533,The film was completely disconnected from the force awakens. Every single setup leading into the film was squandered. All major plot points were traded for SJW politics. Not one male character who wasn't completely ruined or evil. The introduction of Rose and Holdo led to a wasted 30minute side story and the dismantling of previous plots through the destruction of space battle.,0
534,"A certain amount of disappointment is, I think, inevitable given the hype a single film had to live up to, but even with that, I was... REALLY disappointed. A lot of it was the treatment of Luke's character, which (even though I'd been prepared) felt like an assassination of spirit. A lot of it had to do with side plots like the casino arc which dragged, and didn't advance the story (however much I loved rose and continue to love Finn). There were plot holes that made me screw up my face in the theater and mutter, that doesn't make sense. The way it leaned into prequel levels of ridiculousness in the over the top battle sequences all felt hollow. That was the biggest disappointment for me. I think there are ways the story could have leapt to a new generation with new struggles without selling the triumphs of the previous generation as meaningless. which is what this new movie has now done, and looks set to continue to do. The new movies have wiped away all the victories of the original trilogy and returned us to exactly the same balance of power that existed when we first met Luke and Han and Leia, which makes not just this film unwatchable, but every film that became before unwatchable as well.I expected to leave the theater either ecstatic, or furious. Instead I just felt sad and empty and uninterested in seeing any other new star wars films in the future.",0
535,"This sequel had so much potential (because of ep. VII) but keeps letting you down over and over throught the entire movie. It has some good things, but it has even more bad things.Good things about the movie: - Good visuals- New ways of using the force- EntertainingBad things about the movie:- The portrayal of Luke's character is inconsistent (lets be real, this is not the Luke we know, the hopefull guy who saw goodness in Darth Vader, now is a whiny old man who doesnt care about anyone).- Rey is still a Marie Sue (this is more a problem of ep. VII, but this movie does nothing to correct it. Rey is good at everything with no explanation, fighting bad guys? Always wins. Piloting the Millenium Falcon? Sure! Using the force for mind control and grabbing objects after learning about the force just 2 min. ago? Easy! Winning Kylo using the lighsaber for the 1st time? No problem. Lifting giant rocks with no training? I could go on and on...)- Why is Rey one of the main characteres? Besides talking to Kylo Ren and lifting some rocks what does she accomplish in this movie?- The whole casino scene is just pointless. (nothing is accomplished in this arc).- During the chase arc, why the New Order doesnt send small ships to attack the Resistance's main cruser? - Why general Holdo doesnt tell her plan to anyone? - Finn, Poe and Rey don't get any character development. (Finn had so much potential, but keeps getting blocked first by Rey and now by Rose)- Rose is pointless (there's absolutely no reason for her to be in the movie besides blocking Finn's character evolution).- There's not even a sentence about Snoke's motivations or backstory. (how did he fund the First Order? How did he find Kylo Ren and turn him to the dark side? - Phasma is wasted...again.- The humour is so... Marvel...- The knighs of Ren... no clue about them.- Leia Poppins (on paper sounds like a good thing Leia using the force, but the execution in the movie was so cringy).- There's any reason for Luke's death? (I don't mind him dying, but we get no explanation for his death... did he use all of is strength to project himself to another planet?).- American political agenda and SJW inflences (please don't bring those subjects to a Star Wars movie, this is not the right franchise to do that).- Besides Snokes death and Kylo being now the new leader, the story didn't evolve or go further from The Force Awakens.Ep. IX has a lot of problems to correct. I hope it does, but I'm not hopefull.",0
536,"This is the first time I give a ZERO to a movie. I left the theater feeling angry, disappointed and ultimately, sad.A friend told me I have to go and see the film a second time to fully understand it. I think I'm not that stupid yet (though that's what people imply when they say ""you did not understand it"") and after he said that I thought ""wait a minute, this is not how a Star Wars movie should leave its audience feeling"". Then I realized how bad the plot and supposed ""brilliant ideas"" this so-called genius ""Rian Johnson"" had, were. It may be a great movie. A great independent film. A great show for the new generation but it is a bad Star Wars movie. Period.And I won't even get to the part that upset me most (my childhood hero) because I'd be spoiling it for you and I don't mean to do that. Though, if you're a fan. Stick to the 6-chapter saga and forget about Disney. If you're not, why would you even want to spend your money in Disney?",0
537,It looks really good but the anti-white racist SJW degradation is beyond forgivable.  Another classic piece of media destroyed on the alter of a political narrative over the stories lore and good story telling.  Good going guys you ruined another cultural staple and turned even more people against you. Another series crossed off the list.,0
538,"Movie is watchable but thats it. SJW Kylo is a joke, Snoke a vasted villain, Luke a vasted hero... or hero teacher. If Chewie werent there, noone would notice. All male characters are weak and stupid, the females do the trick. Whole movie serves as a feminist propaganda vehicle. Basicaly it is a 0815 scifi flick and noone would notice, if it werent labeled star wars. Heavily disappointed.,.",0
539,"This movie seems to be blatant terrorist propaganda with strong communist undertones.  The characters are all very two-dimensional, with the exception of characters who were already developed in previous movies.  As an example, animals are given intelligence and personalities, convincing Chewbacca not to eat meat.  The comic relief is very poor.Several scenes, such as Luke tossing a lightsaber behind himself, or Snoke's red guards standing at ready, look like they were forced into one take regardless of the fumbling.The choice of actors is very poor.  Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker acted well, the rest may as well have been fumbling over lines.  Much of the awkwardness can easily be attributed to unfamiliarity with the part rather than being a part of the actual character.   The sum of the characters actions appears to be nothing, as the movie ends with nothing accomplished and only a handful of rebels left.The most glaring flaw of all, to me, is this sudden realization that you can accelerate a ship to lightspeed through another ship.  If that is possible in this universe, then it would have already been done for so many other purposes.   Lightspeed weapons would easily crack planets.  Lightspeed weapons would have nearly unlimited range to take out ships.  As even small craft can achieve lightspeed, the idea that this is possible completely turns the entire star wars universe on its own head.",0
540,"The Disneyfication of the franchise has taken away so much of what made it special in the first place. And dare I say it, but imho TLJ is now the worst SW flim of all time. Even below ep 1,2,3.Characters with no depthA Director with no knowledge of the franchise.A forgettable, nearly laughable villian in Kylo RenThe Disneyfication of the First Order.A plethora of really really bad young actors overacting to a huge degree. I'm looking at you Rey/Finn/Poe. The three of you might be fine in the three stooges but in SWs......And the **** is Rose doing? The lame gags and infantile humour might belong in a kids version of SW or the cartoons, but it has no place here.I just get the feeling Disney went with a bunch of young bad actors so that they could keep the fees low and squeeze the Franchise for all it's worth since the kids will be around longer and can be spun off into more side stories.TLJ felt less like a Star Wars Episode and more like a marketing movie for Star Wars written by big data analytics to pander to as many market segments as possible without actually delivering anything of substance.Well done Disney. I must say that you have hit a brand new depth of low when you make me pine for George Lucas and I hated episode 2.",0
541,"TLDR: This movie is safe, forgettable, and entirely unoriginal.I have seen it twice. I recognize that Rian Johnson had a difficult task, and lots of people were expecting TLJ to meet the standard set by ESB. I was not. However, I was also not looking for a movie that rehashed every plot point in ESB and ROTJ (to the point of parroting back dialogue), without even developing the new heroes we had come to love from TFA. As a female fan, I was excited to see the vulnerable, nuanced character of Rey in TFA, and spent the last two years defending her from ""she's just a Mary Sue"" detractors. Well, bad news, in this movie she actually is a Mary Sue. (Speaking of Mary Sues, when did Finn learn how to fly? A major plot point in TFA revolves around the fact that he can't, and now he can just hop in a cockpit and all's well?)At its heart, TLJ doesn't want to be a Star Wars movie, but it fails to take us in a new direction, or any direction. The plot and characters are stuck in place (literally). Prolific jump cuts make it impossible to build any tension and effectively diffuse what little there is. John Williams' score is actually tiring and tonally out of place with what is on screen. The short shots allow no time to develop musical themes, so we're basically reduced to ""Is Rey on-screen? Rey's theme is playing."" ""Is Luke on-screen? Force theme."" ""The Resistance? March of The Resistance 1000x!!"" The soundtrack is like dessert all the time, and leaves you feeling sick.My dislike of TLJ does not stem from being a butt-hurt fan with wish fulfillment issues. The few things lauded as gutsy in TLJ were actually telegraphed in TFA and I was on board with them. A particular aspect of Luke's past did not sit well with a number of people, but I was pleasantly surprised and felt that it worked. I won't say that TLJ was good just because it touched on a couple of interesting things that were teed up for it. This movie has almost none of the threads from TFA, none of the heart of ESB or ANH, and none of the mythos that underscores the whole franchise. It's just a poorly edited, hollow exercise in irreverent predictability.",0
542,"If you watched the original trilogy (episodes IV-VI) and have formed an attachment to those characters (especially Luke) you are going to get slapped in the face. Before the movies came out I kept seeing Mark Hamill interviews where he was trying to tactfully voice decent with the direction the movie was going. In one interview he actually states ""I fundamentally disagree with everything (the writers) think about Luke."" Man was he right. The Force Awakens left so many enticing questions to be answered, along with a bevy of mysterious characters who we all wanted to learn more about. The Last Jedi, not only fails to answer ANY important questions, it destroys the possibility or reason to ever answer them in a meaningful way (either through cheap and banal plot devices or outright character death). As in The Force Awakens the characters all have fast paced adventures while completely avoiding any interesting or meaningful character arcs. The movie is beautiful, but its all eye candy and no substance. Like eating a pile of real candy the initial sugar rush fades and you are left with nothing but the proverbial tummy ache. The more time I have to reflect on the film the more I think it was1. Terrible.2. May actually have fundamentally broken the Star Wars world. Perhaps it can be saved, but at this point I can't see how. It looks like Star Wars will end not with a bang but with a whimper.",0
543,A massively disappointing sequel to the Star Wars saga.  Plot holes and ham-fisted social commentary ruin this film.,0
544, While there are many critiques of some of the issues with this movie I will focus on a few that really ruined it for me. The 1st and biggest for me is the portrayal of Luke. in this move we are supposed to believe that Luke just gave up and went to some island to die because Ben Solo started to turn to the Dark Side. This basically undoes all character progression we see for Luke in episodes 4-6. This was just a leap to far for me and really pulled me out of the movie. i probably could have gone along with this plot point if they had spent some time developing this point. Instead all we got to support this was a few short flashbacks and some very short exposition. Maybe they could have cut the pointless Canto Bight stuff and spent some time here). One possible way this could have been down would be if Luke had been married and Ben Solo killed his spouse. I probably would not have liked this but I could have gone along with it.  Many people have said there is precedent for Luke going into exile because both Yoda and Obi Wan did the same. I don’t buy this. In this film Luke just gives up and goes into exile to die. Obi Wan went to Tatooine to watch over Luke and try and make sure Vader/Palpatine didn’t find Luke. Yoda went to Dagoba to bide his time and see if there might come a way to undo what had been done. From my perspective they both still carried a spark of hope. Luke just gave up with little explanation as to why. Are you freaking kidding me!?!? The next point I will talk about is the overall tone of the movie. The writer seemed to go out of his way to make sure we knew the that all the stuff from episodes 1-7 does not matter from this point on. There were some serious nihilistic undercurrents here. He went out of his way to say it doesn’t matter who Snoke is. It doesn’t matter who Rey’s parents are. The Jedi origins and history don’t matter. By the end of the movie the resistance is basically decimated with 1 ship and about 20 people surviving. I get that Disney probably wants to reset things so they can take the series in some different directions but did they have to go out of there way to tear down just about everything that came before to do it?  I really wish they would have finished out episodes 8 and 9 before trying to reset everything. The last point I will make is that the writer/director seemed to go out of his way to subvert every expectation. While I like some surprises i wish they were tied to a better story. I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was being trolled throughout this movie. You expect to find out about Rey’s past? Nope!. You expect to find out how the first order came to be? nope! you expect to find out more about Snoke? Nope You expect Admiral Holdo to act rationally and explain the plan so people know they are not just waiting for a slow death? Nope. Who are the Knights of Ren? Nope! You expect Luke to not be a bitter old man who doesn’t care that his sister is in grave danger? Nope! You expect that Finn will retain some of the character growth he had from the last movie? Nope! You expect Finn to go out and sacrifice himself to save what is remaining of his friends? Nope!  You expect Poe to not act like a complete ass twice? Nope! You expect this film to make sense given the existing canon? Nope!It seems like the movie was just one big head fake after another at the expense of making a movie that makes sense in the context of what came before. Its as if the director was so concerned with the criticism that the force awakens was just a retread that they decided to throw everything out the window whether it made sense or not. There were some of these surprises that I liked (especially the throne room fight). But overall I think this movie is a mess that destroys more than it builds. Worst of all the destruction has effectively eradicated my desire to see any more of the Disney Star Wars. I really enjoyed Rogue One and i thought The Force Awakens was ok. I even appreciated some aspects of the prequels. But this one just left me confused and disappointed. There is a Youtuber named David Stewart who has a few videos breaking down the issues with this movie (in a better fashion than I can). One of the points he made was that this movie has the aesthetic of a Star Wars movie but it does not have the heart of one. There is no heart here just window dressing.,0
545,"So this movie plays with our all feelings. We all know that Carrie Fisher died last year, and so I assumed this one scene would be here end. But no... How? It is not explained and that is horrible. It feels so misplaced and awkward, it hurts. So she still lives in this movie, and on the other hand she is dead and nobody knows what will be with her in the next movie. This makes no sense at all.Lukes appearance in this movie should have been cut out. The way he is portrayed here makes absolutely no sense to his character at all. This movie is so full of ""what the... why?"" that it hurts. So I hope Episode 9 starts with Rey waking up, realizing she had a really intense dream and then the story kinda progresses.But like this? No. There was a building up - a tension in this movie where I really thought ok, she will become a sith and Kylo will become a jedi again. But no. And the end of.. Snoke? We don't even know who he is, and apparently he is dead now? or isn't he?This movie just makes no sense. I absolutely dislike how they threated die old characters in this ""trilogy""",0

548,"For all those who say the movie was ""fresh"" and ""new"" keep reading, spoilers will follow.The main plot is that the heroes are in a ship fleeing from the bad guys in space because they can't make the jump to hyperspace... just like Episode V. Meanwhile the Jedi hero goes to visit the old Jedi hermit to train under him but he's initially reluctant... just like Episode V. Some of the heroes seek out a gambler archetype to help them but he ends up betraying them... just like Episode V.They have a battle on a white planet in a trench with speeders vs Imperial walkers... just like Episode V. A group of heroes sneak aboard the main enemy base in enemy uniforms to power down something keeping them from escaping... just like Episode IV. The Jedi hero is brought by the Sith apprentice to his master and the hero is about to be killed when the apprentice kills the master... just like Episode VI.ALL of the plot is ripped right from the original trilogy except the animal rescue scene in Canto Bight... which people who liked the movie didn't even care for. And then the movie destroys the character of Luke ""I can't kill my own father"" Skywalker who prepares to murder his nephew in his sleep like a psychopath. Tell me, if someone told you they held an axe above the their nephew while he slept and at the last second decided not to slay him, what would you think of that person?The main villain is a whiny little brat who has been bested by the untrained, inexperienced hero twice. How is that a credible threat? Think of your favorite villains; Voldemort or Darth Vader for example. They are good villains because they are scary. Because they seem unstoppable. It makes you want to watch more because you want to see how the hero can rise up enough to defeat them. But you don't even remotely have that in TLJ.I could go on about the dozens (yes, literally) of plot holes, lack of interesting characters, extreme female superiority, and more that contribute to this movie being a steaming pile of dog crap, but there are more than 3,000 other metacritic reviews that go over that already.Rian Johnson: ""Who's Luke Skywalker, and how do things work in space? Never mind, I'll just wing it.""",0
549,"One of the worst films I've ever sat through, full of private political agenda which had no place being in the film, a ridiculous 'Mary Sue' main character, terrible script writing and massive plot holes. Was looking forward to the Han Solo film but after seeing this awful mess I seriously doubt I'll ever bother seeing any more Star Wars films. The future of the franchise is not safe in the hands of Kathleen Kennedy.",0
550,"The story was a sloppy, garbled and confusing mess. The decisions Rian Johnson made with Luke's character were heart-shattering. I think I speak for most fans of the original trilogy: what they did with Luke in this movie was a betrayal of the character that we know Luke is. Mark Hamill said himself he was ""insulted"" when he read the script. I can only imagine how offended George Lucas is. I can't bring myself to see this movie a second time because it hurts just thinking about Luke. Disney is dead to me. What an absolute shame. What an absolute **** failure. Done.",0
551,"There are so many cringe worthy moments in this movie i don't know how people can say the word LOVE when it comes to describing this movie. I can see someone say it was ok but the bad moments in this movie were BAD. I'm not at all against going in a new direction i just wish they would have kept Luke out of it lol. I think this new Luke takes away from OG Luke. That super powerful moment when when we last see Luke in ROTJ where he throws down his saber and essentially his life when he tells the emperor that he's lost ""I'm a jedi like my father before me"". I guess it would be ok to take Lukes story where they did but that deserves a 3 Movie arc of its own not a 3 act arc. Thats one of my biggest issues with this movie. Luke has been ROTJ Luke in everyones mines for the last 30 some years to just take his character in a new direction in 3 acts is shameful to me. Also please don't put it on fans when the Force Awakens leaves off with this super emotional moment where Rey hands the saber to Luke, the look on looks face the emotion and tension in both of their eyes, a shot that seemed to linger on for 30 secs or so when we circled the characters to just end that scene an that tone that was set with a joke is just terrible.﻿ Luke not being true to his character, Luke milking a sea cow, Leia flying though space and the entire Finn storyline was enough to kill anything they might have done well for me.",0
552,"Honest review: This movie is utter trash. It completely takes the concepts and plot points originally set up in the first movie and just chucks them over their shoulder. Seriously, the result of Rey holding out the light saber to Luke ends in him just chucking it away. Where to start with this steaming pile of shiet. First, Rey is apparently nobody special. Her parents were junkers who traded her for credits then drank themselves to death and are buried on Jakku in a poppers grave. Snoke is nobody special as he is easily killed by Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren. These are two things that are set up to be major plot points in the first movie that are just chucked out the window in this new movie. The whole point of the movie is killing the past and letting go of your heroes so that ""new ones"" can rise. **** garbage. This is just an excuse for lazy writing and a very clear ""progressive"" agenda. There's the scene on the Resistance capital ship where the new admiral doesn't tell Poe her plan which results in him mutinying and setting up a plan of his own that fails because Fin and his new love interest Rose (who is beautiful by feminist standards), are completely inept. Why didn't the femnazi purple haired admiral just tell Poe her plan? I mean if you are planning to stealthily abandon ship and flee to an old uncharted Rebellion base, maybe that's the kind of thing you would want to tell the crew? So that, you know, they can prepare to abandon ship? Anyway, Fin and Rose go to the casino world, complain about capitalism, get arrested, break out, free some animals but not the slave children (Like WTF! you free the freaking animals but not the SLAVE KIDS!!!), partner up with a criminal they met in prison who later betrays them (big freaking surprise). . . Absolute trash. Next up is Fin trying to nobly sacrifice his life to save the resistance only to have his life saved by the ugly chick who wants his D. What could have been a great moment about sacrifice and real heroes ends with a horrible progressive sjw bullshiet speech about how heroes are bullshiet (WTAF). Next is Rey. OMG every scene with her and Luke was cringy AF! Luke drinks green udder milk that he squeezes fresh from some kind of ugly sea cow and complains constantly. We also finally find out what happened to the new jedi order Luke tried to establish. Apparently Luke felt a darkness growing in Ben, and decided to sneak into his room late at night to try and KILL HIS NEPHEW because he was afraid that Ben would turn dark. Surprise surprise, Ben didn't react well to that, bringing the building down on them, knocking Luke unconscious, and then Ben proceeds to turn to the dark side and kill or turn the new jedi order. I mean, Luke, the guy who was willing sacrificed himself to the emperors force lightening because he had so much faith in the sliver of light in his father, Darth Vader, the most evil bad guy ever, suddenly decides to lose all faith and try to KILL HIS NEPHEW at the slightest sign of darkness? WTF! Then there was a chance for the movie to be redeemed. After Kylo kills Snoke and he and Rey kill the Red Guard together, he reaches out to Rey asking her to join him and rule beside him and she says. . . no. Of course she says no, because this is **** Disney and good guys can never be bad. . . This movie would have instantly been better if Rey had turned dark, ruled beside Kylo, and the third movie was about everyone else dealing with the fall out of that with a Rey redemption arch. Or hell, it would have been more interesting if Rey attacked Kylo for the throne, beat him and it had been Kylo/Ben who turned back to the light, joined the resistance and then had to fight to try and bring Rey back to the light. But no. Instead Kylo stays evil, Rey stays good, and the movie is all the worse off for it. Finally, that light speed crash used to destroy the first orders capital ship was freaking lore braking as all hell. I mean, if all you had to do was light speed crash a capital ship into another one to destroy it, then why didn't the rebellion do that against both death stars? I could go on and on. This movie did have potential coming off the first one, and it literally just flushed it down the toilet. There will be those who will say that this movie is the most philosophical and intellectually deep of any SW movie, and they will be full of shiet. This movie was lazily written and directed. It's clear that they decided to go in a completely different direction from what J.J. Abrams set up and did so in the most disrespectful way. This movie is literally the worst Star Wars movie of all time. No joke. The prequels were better than this, because they at least had a consistent and coherent arch. SWTLJ, has no core story, message, or purpose to even exist in the SW universe at all. It's just characters doing **** that looks cool to set up a new trilogy free from the past and it's fans. I for one am a fan who will never watch another Disney SW movie again.",0
553,"Where to start? Firsly I loved Rogue One last year it felt like a story worth telling and introduced some new interesting characters. I hated the Force awakens and would rate it as my least favourite star wars movie! So i was really hoping The Last Jedi would take the Rogue One approach........It didn't!! So much potential with Luke and they just made him a grumpy old man who feels sorry for himself because his nephew turned to the dark side! Out of all people Luke should of been prepared for this potential eventuality......his dad is Darth Vader for heavens sake! So to turn him into a coward like this was unforgivable for me.Lazy writing throughout, no coherent exciting storyline, too much feminism and poor character development but ultimately it just wasn't a fun film to watch. So disappointed!",0
554,"If this was a random SF movie i would have said it was watchable and gave it like a 6, but since there is 40 years of material, movies, books, comics, computer games, this movie took a dump on everything..in letters ZERO. Want be givin money to disney in the future...",0
555,"Mark Hamill was totally right to ""fundamentally disagree with virtually everything"" with the director. It's horribly written, with wasted and/or pointless characters, and embarrassing dialogues. In brief, 40 years of glorious SW mythology turned to ash. This movie is a disaster.",0
556,"Amazing. Everything in this movie is wrong. Lazy writing, character assassination, nonsense plot, no build-up, lack of pay-off, and this, is NOT a Star Wars movie.",0

558,"This is for the blu ray/dvd...whatever you do, don't buy this festering carcass of a movie. It's NOT Star Wars, only the name is the same. The rest is laughably poor. Poor directing, poor storytelling and poor adaptation of a great saga. Do yourself a favor and enjoy the original Star Wars movies, forget about the Disney knockoffs.",0
559,Star Wars is dead....Disney killed it. Long live social justice warrior propaganda masqueradeing as a Star Wars film. Screw Disney and Kathleen Kennedy. The prequels are better than this garbage. 1 Star for Mark Hamill.,0
560,A movie that only has Merit based on nostalgia it tries to kill. If it wants us to kill our pasts and review this without respect to what made the prginals great I will. This movie has giant plot holes and kills any intrest I have in seeing the others. It feels like the director was setting up JJ Abrams to fail in the next one leaving him a giant mess after destroying all the plot hooks he was left.,0
561,J.J. Abrams gave Star Wars to Rian Johnson like Rey gave Luke the lightsaber and just like in the the movie when Luke thows away the lightsaber - Rian Johnson throws away Star Wars like garbage! Rian J has to be the worst story teller ever! How did this get aproved? Ryan Jonson seams to have no respect or understanding for the Star Wars univers!,0
562,"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a kind of mix between The Return of the Jedi and The Empire Strikes Back.After the fans' critics about episode 7, I hope Disney and Kathleen Kennedy have understood what was wrong with it, but they did not.In my opinion this is the worst movie of all the saga and I will explain why.Firstly, the movie is too long, I look at the clock several times while watching it, bad.Secondly, all that happens in episode 7 and all the story in the original trilogy is not taken into account to make the story of episode 8, so there is no continuity at all, so it could be called whatever instead of star wars.The feeling I have after going out of the cinema was that I have seen a long commercial to sell a lot of merchandising, what a shame of you Disney.Finally I have to say that I will never believe in the proffesional critic anymore, I have read the critics before watching the film and after it the only reason I found to make sens to the difference between the good critics and the movie is that Disney spends a lot of money paying for good critics, shame of you too proffesional critic....",0
563,"Last Jedi tiene cosas buenas pero ninguna logra que podamos perdonar que destruyeran al personaje de Luke, un pilar de la anterior saga, ni las precuelas cometieron tal barbaridad.

564,"This movie is a travesty. There is some good acting, and the visuals and score are par-none, but the destruction of everything that came before it, and the complete disregard for everything TFA set this film up for simply invalidates this as a real Star Wars movie.This is not Luke. This is not Star Wars.",0
565,"(STAR WARS FAN/FANATICS DON’T READ!)Upfront let me say I am not into Star Wars, Star Trek or, in general, sci-fi movies though I did see the first two of the former and vaguely remember liking them. For the last movie I was to see in 2017 “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” I would put it on my yearly list as one of the worst, most boring, one of the needlessly longest movie of the year but I am afraid if I do they would lynch me!I read a story recently that Star War fans were upset during showings because they thought at one point in the movie the sound had gone out and was going to stop the movie but the director/screenwriter had purposely done it that way. The distributor, Disney, had asked the critics not to give any spoilers but some did so the audience would know this was not a mistake. Folks the scene lasted 2-3 seconds maybe and a big fuss was made about this?To me the fuss should have been about the length of 2 hours and 30 minutes which could have easily been shortened just by cutting a couple of the aerial dogfights that just basically repeated the same thing over and over.A fuss should be made about the obviously placed species that you could just hear Disney saying, “We could make millions with this cute creature”!I know some of the history of the heroes and two of the villains but, unless it was told in another movie or I missed it in this one, why is Rey picked to be the next Jedi, unless it is politically correct to show another strong woman which the series has always had in Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia and now has another in Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo?Previous stars Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill and the aforementioned Carrie Fisher made strong impressions from their appearance in the first movie but, come on; Adam Driver an inheritor of the Darth Vader role?I was impressed by Oscar Isaac who has the same throw away style of Ford along with the gravitas the character needs. Kelly Marie Tran stood out as Rose a resistance fighter but I seem to recall John Boyega having, and being, a stronger in the last movie but here he is wasted.And why oh why does the music have to blast every 5 minutes? To keep the audience awake?The only good s about “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” was 1) though I thought it would never end it did and 2) it was the first completely free moviepass movie I saw!",0
566,This movie is an absolute slap in the face to real Star Wars fans. The prequels now look great in comparison. RIP Star Wars.,0
567,"Honestly, aside from the beautiful 'Kamikaze' scene, this film was only improved by Chewbacca's developing relationship with a bunch of puffins. This film is completely barmy. It's main theme is failure. They take a giant dump on everything that was canon beforehand and make the most appalling effort at reuniting the space twins after thirty years apart (spoiler: they talk about hair). This is meant to be Star Wars! Bad ass Sith Lords blowing up planets and force choking people! Instead we get realistic milking and a 'Train to be a Jedi' Course that might as well have been advertised on Wowcher. For me, the original Trilogy and Rogue One are the only films that have that genuine star wars feel. The rest is just awful. This film was......just......awful.",0
568,"The movie has no direction what-so-ever, from start to finish, as to where it is heading to and why. Horrible, horrible, horrible plot holes that will require either a true genius to fix or for the whole movie to be scrapped. Some forced nostalgic scenes between old characters do nothing for the movie and feel completely passionless.  Luke...oh Luke. I really and truly feel sorry for Mark Hamill, I heard some of the ideas he had for his character and they were so good...so good and so versed. They made sense and they fit in the Star Wars universe almost perfectly. Luke's newly developed character was shockingly bad! Although, if I start complaining about characters I will never stop it seems in this movie (looking at you Rose). Who the hell is this character, Rose, that suddenly jumped front and centre stage?!I hold no sentimental or emotional value toward Rose, Poe, Snoke and to some extent even Leia. When Snoke died I did not care, in fact I did care a bit. Why did the poor guy die? What did he do wrong? He wanted to just stop random rebels from destroying and attacking his so called 'First Order'. So what he took in a new apprentice. He actually doesn't care about Han Solo or anyone else...all we know is he hates Luke for 'some' reason, so WHY does he hate Luke?I'm not gonna go into the plot holes or the rest of the reasons why this was the worst Star Wars episode of all time. In fact, I have already given it enough attention and it doesn't deserve anymore!The only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because as a stand alone movie, it might not be so bad, even with all of its galactic sized plot holes...(also cause I like Mark Hamill, and also Adam Driver actually seemed to legit show some emotional performance).",0
569,Utter absolute bilge. Takes a massive dump on everything that went before. Even the preceding film. So angry/upset/depressed. Will not be wasting any more money in this direction. Not worth the heartache.,0

Virtually none of the character motivations make sense, their personalities seem to do a 180 whenever the 'story' demands it and they actively make decisions counter productive to what is meant to be motivating them.  It also contradicts Star Wars Lore from previous films.

Pleaseee this movie sucked not because of a new vision or direction but that it was just a bad story line which did not follow any thought out process, took fans to be too dumb to analyze the glaring gaps in logic, and non sensical plot. This is just plain bad story writing. Throw in making heroes look stupid, etc and this is what you end up with. A pretentious show using ""new direction"" as a veil to cover up a **** movie.that is what Disney and all the pundits will be claiming over and over. How can so many fans be wrong or ignorant as they are alluding to? This movie has split the fan base when it wasnt necessary. One can write a good script moves into a new direction logically and makes sense. This was utter garbage and its amazing to see how people defend it. Rubbish.",0

The acting was fine given the source material.Bad things about the movie:1. Plot inconsistencies, a lot of them.  I can normally go with plot inconsistencies if the flow of the movie makes me not notice them in the moment, but this movie had me going “What! Why?!” in the middle of the movie, and taking away from the movie.2. A lot of forced humor. Only a few jokes worked for me.3. No character growth, it seemed liked characters were going to grow, but the movie wastes all the moments and characters end up where they started at the beginning of the film. 4. The pacing was bad. The movie jumps all over the place and feels longer than it should have been.5. The movie has whole scenes that are basically revealed to have no purpose.  The movie steps on some of its own points.6. Inconsistency with previous Star Wars movies and specifically the movie directly proceeding it.  The movie disregards all previously established norms of the star wars universe, and also completely rewrites the nature and character of previously established characters.  This would be fine for a reboot, but this was a sequel.",0
576,"Easily the worst Star Wars movie to date. It's got all the problems The Force Awakened had and more. The plot makes no sense, the characters (Rey especially) are trash, the stakes are all over the place, and there's absolutely no sense of scale, among others. I'd say JJ Abrams' films are officially licensed fanfiction by Disney, but that would be an insult to actually good fanfictions with effort put into them. This movie doesn't respect its audience, and its audience shouldn't respect it either.",0

At least JJ Arbrams recycled garbage was watchable,  Rian Johnsons basically lit his garbage on fire then sat back to watch it burn! There was some awesome cinematic scenes and some good acting, but the story didnt even seem thought out, as if the director was just making it up on the fly and hoping it would all work out in the end. I do enjoy the new characters and they could have blended them with the old characters in a way that was fresh.  They could of moved away from having the same evil empire trying to take over and rebels fighting back that they have done for every star wars movie.

It's not even funny bad, its just terrible.",0
582,"Perhaps the biggest tragedy of a Star Wars film to ever grace the cinema, and that's really saying something considering Attack of the Clones is a thing. Where to even begin..I'm not about to launch into a scene by scene tirade, as many fans before me have done the same in a much more eloquent fashion, but I will say this: The Last Jedi fails in EVERY aspect of good film-making. It is a beautiful looking, million dollar turd. The plot zig-zags back and forth meaninglessly, the characters, shallow, unrelatable or insane. The **** they do MAKES. NO. SENSE. NOTHING in-universe makes any sense any more. Logic is completely thrown out of the picture. TLJ embraces pure, stupid emotion resulting in:- A laughing stock of the First Order, completely unintimidating and generally useless villains. Hux somehow hasn't been executed or at the very least relieved for his incompetence and Phasma has zero presence. She has no reason to exist other than to give Finn a shiny glorified punching bag.- A purple haired lesbian (yes this is part of her character because reasons) admiral who spouts drivel about faith while apparently having no faith in any of her crew to tell them the plan to escape the bad guys, dooming literally all but a small handful of them to a merciless death. She utterly fails as a leader and yet the movie pretends she's the good guy all along by turning her into a kamikaze pilot in perhaps the prettiest yet dumbest scene in all of Star Wars.- A deranged psychopath that claims fighting what you hate isn't how you win, despite earlier on her own sister doing the EXACT OPPOSITE AND WINNING, while simultaneously watching her hated enemy preparing to kill all her friends. Her enemies can do this as a DIRECT RESULT of her own actions. (How have the rebels not keeled over already with people like her and purple hair in it?! Oh, right. Incompetent villains unless when it's convenient.)- A menacing, all-powerful antagonist who is actually neither powerful or menacing and dies in the most pathetic way possible while monologuing about how unbeatable he is- The most uninteresting, aimless and actually all-powerful protagonist who by the word of Yoda has no need for training, trials or tribulations to succeed, she need only exist and her problems will solve themselves- A broken, dejected cast of old, respected characters who are shown to have lost all hope and just want to die sad and alone after having turned into a complete joke of their former selves. Luke Skywalker, legendary sci-fi hero turned suicidal hermit is probably the worst offender of the bunch. Not even Mark Hamill has any interest in returning for his role after this crap.The Last Jedi gets one point from me because there is only one thing I liked; Kylo Ren's throne room fight. Yes, the guy who has callously killed untold numbers and his own father is the only one I can root for..incredible. Unfortunately he's the only one who seems to have a pulse in this film. There is nothing else salvageable out of the nuclear crater TLJ left in its wake. In one movie Rian Johnson killed what made Star Wars. How is this possible? From the get-go, this is someone who has been quoted to say he would ""be worried if everyone [thought]"" the movie he made ""was a good movie."" He would prefer half the audience hate the movie and the other half love it and he finds this prospect ""much more exciting."" Despite this, Rian has deflected every piece of negative criticism on his creative 'vision' like he's the Van Gogh of Hollywood. He seriously believes The Last Jedi is excused from any critique...NONE of it is valid according to him. Is his egg-shaped head filled to the brim with that much hubris? He also apparently believes that if Empire Strikes Back came out when social media existed, it would've been roasted to hell and back because Luke Skywalker ""..gets his ass handed to him."" by Vader. (Only if you made it, Rian..Only if you made it.) Someone with this mindset was given ""complete creative control"" over the cultural juggernaut sensation that used to be Star Wars. I simply do not understand how Disney could screw up so hard. We fans are not impossible to please; Tickle our fancy right and we'd have dropped hundreds of thousands on you just like we did with George. Instead, Disney and its peons have opted to directly insult their own consumer-base for their failures, pushing for some 'toxic masculinity' or 'anti-feminist' nonsense. REAAAAALLY SMAAAART.I no longer have hope or an interest for the future of this series. This is the last SW film I'll ever pay to see as long as Kathleen Kennedy is head of Lucasfilm. A colossal waste of talent and potential on all sides. The dream is dead, and it seems like Kylo was right all along. Time to let old things die, isn't it? Kill the past if you have to. (Ridiculous line..) I'll miss what Star Wars used to be but I've no regret over ditching this sad, soulless continuation.",0

Low on food and supplies, the 9 remaining Rebels flee to Ahch-To to call all remaining resistance supporters to this new base, while milking sea cows and BBQing Porgs for nourishment.2. Luke, who DIDN'T really disappear into the Force (his mechanical hand didn’t drop onto the meditation stone, did it!?), but rather created a Force Teleport, returns to Tatooine to live in Kenobi's old home. Luke disconnects from the Force for the last time and begins scaring Tusken Raiders away from lost droids who venture off into the desert.3. Princess Leia, stricken with grief from the loss of Han and now her brother (or so she thinks), dies from a broken heart while traveling to Ach-To!!! However, we only get to read about this in the title crawl for Episode 9! :’(4. Kylo Ren, decides he can't live without Rey (Rey-LO!!!) since his Force Touch experience with her, throws Admiral Hux against a wall (again, again, again, again…) and deserts the First Order to search for Rey.5. Admiral Hux, whose face has been badly scared and injured from Kylo's repeated attacks, creates a mask to hide his face, and takes over as the new Supreme Leader. His first major decision is to change the name from the First Order to the Best Order.6. Finn, after trying to sacrifice his life to save the Resistance and finally bringing “meaning” to his life, struggles from depression which makes him flee the Rebels via a “secret” escape pod on the Millennium Falcon (even Han and Chewy didn't know existed) and returns to the First Order, only to complete his stormtrooper training and become the new Captain Phasma.7. Rose, finally fixes the hyperdrive on the Falcon after all these years!8. Chewbecca, rotisseries all the Porgs inside the Millennium Falcon and falls in love with Rose, who fixed the hyperdrive! They move to Canto Bight and adopt Force sensitive children.9. Rey, returns to Jakku to read the mind of Unkar Platt, and begins her journey in search for her drunk parents’ grave (who didn’t die but are casino bartenders on Canto Bight).10. Poe Dameron keeps blowing things up!11. Admiral Ackbar, who doesn’t breathe oxygen, realizes he TOO is Force sensitive, contacts Princess Leia (before she dies) to come and pick him up on their way to Ach-To.12. The young force sensitive boy on Canto Bight, leads a rebellion with more force sensitive kids against their captors to fight for better hourly wages while working with the Fathiers! They also fight for better treatment for the Fathiers, so these animals don’t have to run BACK-To-BACK races after returning from long planet voyages.13. Kenny Phasma, I mean Captain Phasma is DEAD for GOOD, so we don’t have to see any more lame fights!14. Supreme Leader Snoke, isn’t really dead! He was just using a really good puppet and will return for Episode 9 to reclaim his Empire from Kylo!!!!15.

587,"I really can't adequately express my level of disappointment with The Last Jedi, but I'll list a few of my biggest points of contention. The most jarring element is the change in tone. When Poe and Hux did their idiotic schtick in the opening scenes, my gut dropped. I hoped it was just a fluke, but sadly, it set the tone for the entire film. The dialogue, and campy humor felt like it was lifted directly from bad fan-fic written by a 12 year old with aspergers. The main story was so contrived, and made so little sense, that I wanted to get up and walk out. The subplots are completely pointless, go nowhere, are rife with political pandering, and leave a distinct ""prequel trilogy"" taste in the mouth. All of the set-up from The Force Awakens is completely disregarded, nothing is answered-or if it is answered it's  with an infuriating dismissive wave of the hand. There are several plot devices that are nothing short of a deus ex machina. The characters we've seen previously are treated with disdain, and the new characters are about as appealing as a colonoscopy. This movie was just awful. I truly hope that Rian Johnson is never let anywhere near a Star Wars movie ever again.",0

Slap-stick humor isn't wit, new characters doesn't equate to character development, poor editing mixed with a sloppy if not lazy script make this, simply put: a bad movie.",0
593,"Comedy in Star Wars has always been present. However, this take an entirely unpolished approach. Instead of the usual one or two characters making a joke every now and again, jokes are shoehorned into nearly every scene. Every character turns into a wise-cracking joke teller. In addition to poor delivery, the jokes are borderline satire with a YOLO swagger mixed in - making this a better sequel to Space Balls than an entry in the Star Wars saga.",0
594,"As a lifelong starwars fan I feel insulted, hurt and utterly not listened to or understood. It feels to me like Disney is trying to reignite a flame, a flame that inspired millions of children all over the world and started one of the biggest nerd cultures in existence. For me it's ok to create episodic Startrek movies, because the story lines are often disconnected and have situational meanings. This isn't the case for starwars. Starwars is a saga, a continuation of events that have to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. NONE OF THE EVENTS LINE UP.1) It is assumed Leia is a Jedi, when is this confirmed in official cannon? did Luke teach her? Did she discover most of this on her own? 0.o Where does this connect or have any meaning to the original movies?2) Kylo Ren is a completely ridiculous character. He is a comic book villain, designed to please a crowd of 14-18 year olds with emotional issues. Looking for a father figure but never finding it and hoping the world will bask him in sympathy.3) Snoke is killed off at the half way point. WHY!? He is the most mysterious and story driving character to appear in over a DECADE of starwars, he has powers that match the emperor if not succeed him, yet he's killed instantly by Kylo, yes a man who can basically see into the future, remain force cloaked for long periods of time... IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.4) When does the Empire develop a moral compass? Last time I checked the majority of it was a CLONE army and always has been a CLONE army yet they're now recruiting for the massed populas of millions of worlds? To have them leak secret plans, turn on the empire... Christ.... I dunnoThis movie has no direction, no purpose, it simply wipes the floor clean so Disney can create it's own cannon separate from the Lucas cannon. Kylo Ren is right when he says, ""Let the past die"" too right.Disney have killed Starwars.",0

Scene senza senso e logica, la fisica nello spazio completamente dimenticata e il povero luke che diventa un ologramma. I protagonisti rey finn e la chiattona asiatica da dimenticare. Il bravissimo Del Toro usato per un cameo. Tutta la storia è piena di buchi. Un filmaccio orripilante indipendentemente da cosa dica la crtica prezzolata.

There is so much wrong with this movie it is hard to even write it down.  EVER. SINGLE. CHARACTER. is absolutely terrible.  The ONLY reason I did not walk out of the cinema after 30 minutes is that I had friends there and needed a ride home.  I have absolutely ZERO anticipation of the Han Solo ruining movie or the or watching Emo Ren get beat up by someone who has literally picked up a lightsaber for the 3rd time.  Screw you Disney.,0
604,"Well you have gone and done it now Disney. You blew it! I can only imagine that next time we find out Micky Mouse is the true Sith lord. At times this movie felt like a fun ride, only to have the credits role with a dozen hot story holes. Oh but don't worry, I am sure you will be able to sell lots of your chicken Ewoks to kids this Christmas. Get out of here. There has clearly been no concise vision for this trilogy. A new movie does not need to be pumped out every year, take time and make it quality. Now I have to go back to the theater and see it again just to confirm my anger is justified. So don't think that high attendance means its good. And who are these critics saying the movie was 100?? Cowards, just because the franchise says Star Wars they need to claim its great, otherwise they risk being ridiculed in their own community. That's why I had to add my 2 cents, it is garbagio.  The only positive thing to come out if it all is Daisy Ridley, for that I thank you.",0
605,"Hilariously bad movie. There are zero rules to anything happening in the movie, the new order always fails to accomplish anything and the resistance seems succeed out of sheer luck. Also the Plot between Rey and Luke is uninteresting while poorly trying to imitate the excitment of Lukes first Introduction to the force.I could go on ranting about nearly every aspect of this bad movie in detail, but I want to spare myself from reliving to much of this awful experience. I guess after a mediocore Episode VII I will have to accept that Disney isnt capable of capturing the essence of what made Star Wars fun.Generally it doesnt at all feel like a Star Wars movie, and you shouldnt waste your money on going to the cinema seeing this movie.",0
606,"This movie failed at being a space-fantasy/ sci fi and it failed as a sequel to both TFA and the other SW trilogies. It was the epitome of superficial; very flashy, good visuals with no real substance or consistency. Not to mention the Space-balls level of comedy, plus tone shifts worse than the prequels. As long as you do not care about the franchise in any serious manner, and lower your scrutinising capacity, if you can pretend like you're watching a silly parody, the movie can be enjoyable. Then it becomes a mildly amusing action flick or fan-fiction. I imagine a lot of small kids will love it just as much as they'd love any other flashy, superficial movie. It is clear that the main purposes for these movies is to be a vehicle for Kathleen's political agendas and to be a huge advert for toys and games, because the symptoms of these aspects are very evident and seem to take priority over consumer enjoyment/satisfaction in general. There are so many meta moments, so many pointless, unsatisfying subversions, so much bathos. ~I'll try not to spoilAn entire sequence of the film, lasted for about a quarter or more of the movie, was utterly pointless, it didn't push the narrative ahead enough, it barely served as a plot device and was very badly written, it felt so out of place, tonally & visually, yet it was made into a priority. It only served as a plot device to show off a new female character and a new 'warped yet familiar' character, and allow the opportunity for certain other characters actually do something of 'significance' in the movie.It's not the only case of this kind of thing either.Snoke was very unsatisfying and still remains a mystery... a pointless mystery, as pointless as Phasma and the new guy, whatever his n-name was. Nothing was revealed about Snoke's history or relevance, apart from an icon on Luke's temple floor (which you'd have to read some book or look up online to know about). Kylo Ren was probably the most interesting character on screen, but his story still had many flaws and inconsistencies. Where are the Knights of Ren? who are they? Who knows, farts in the wind, for all the director cares.Many of the plot-twists were very wishy-washy, meaning shallow, purely made to get one over the fans or viewers. The main twist of the trailers (""time for the jedi to end"") turned out to have no depth/ explanation or philosophy, probably have to watch deleted scenes or read a comic to find out. I think it's quite lazy to simply highlight that the Jedi were flawed in the prequels, because that was already obvious to me and many others. If you're going to do that, at least don't do it in a way that makes Luke completely obnoxious & hypocritical. 1000+ years of pretty good work, keeping peace in the universe, and 1 crappy mistake and the Jedi are worthless to Luke, wow, such wonderful dedication, a true hero.Rey still feels like no character at all, she has no relevancy to the previous movies and there's no consistency to her character. She has no real relationships (she gives zero **** about Finn), she barely struggles with anything, there is no inner conflict, we are told she has no character flaws (she does but they're not considered as such). She's just the perfect vessel to move the story forward without having to explain anything or build the universe/lore. Not to mention how her motivations are inconsistent and purely meta, derived from examining parts of the audience. Kylo Ren's backstory with Luke was devolved into a rather unfitting experimental piece on 'perspective', at the cost of any logical consistency with Luke's character. Luke's story during the end of the movie could have been so much better, I must admit it had some merit to it, not a lot, but some. I find the most erroneous thing to be how Luke's earliest characterisation (chronologically) is basically a creepy, violent uncle. I agree with Mark Hamill entirely though, this is Jake Skywalker, a bitter, spiteful, cowardly hermit. The overall theme of the movie was ""Let the past die, kill it if you have to"", It also seems to set things up for a future of a tail-eating-snake cycle of repetition, which is probably not what George wanted...These movies will never be ret-conned, they are the new 'Star Wars' now, no matter whatever ridiculous, hollow disaster it becomes. I also doubt EA will have their grubby, greedy hands taken off this franchise. Nice little monopoly they have there. I'd suggest people start looking for a new spiritual replacement or successor.",0
607,"After seeing The Force Awakens I was extremely excited to see this movie. The Force Awakens was refreshing, magical, and mysterious. Yes there were monitor issues, but it was very entertaining and I hardly noticed them. So, after two years The Last Jedi was released and I was ready to go. Little did I know that I would be walking out of the theater in such disappointment. I couldn't believe it! This film did not deliver the same experience The Force Awakens provided. It felt like it was a tree whose core was rotten. It lacked something. A lot of something. It looked and sounded like Star Wars but it didn't feel like Star Wars. It felt poorly written with no clear direction. Many of my favorite characters had been completely mischaracterized. I could care less for any of the characters. There were so many moments where I found myself being ripped away from the movie and I realized I was sitting in a movie theater. Having to listen to a political lecture really took me out of the experience. I want to forget about life hear on earth and go on a magical journey and see people do impossible and amazing things. This movie was very disappointing and unsatisfying. There were many questions from The Force Awakens that weren't even addressed. The answers we did get were very underwhelming. I have very little hope for the next installment. We'll see.",0
608,"I actually created an account so I could give this movie a horrible review. I am not a bot no matter what Disney would like to tell you.Here are my beefs:1. Luke Skywalker is a different character than the original movies. If you want to have a character arc where he changes and becomes a hermit fine, but you NEED TO SHOW IT. I did not buy that he would have tried to kill Ben Solo since he exhibited the slightest amount of darkness. Remember he threw his light saber down and would not fight against Darth Freaking Vader and the emperor so he could save him. How am I expected to believe that he is now a completely opposite person? This is the same guy who told the emperor: ""You're Wrong, I am a Jedi, Like my father before me.""2. Rey is now all of a sudden a Jedi because what, She meditated on a rock for about 2 minutes? That is all of the training she needs to become a Jedi? She is after all a strong confident woman so the rules don't apply. Luke was on Degobah for months and he was still not ready to face Vader and escaped by the skin of his teeth. She is the biggest Mary Sue in the history of cinema.3. Apparently you can breath in space now. (See Leia/Bomber Pilot - Also there is no gravity in space so how did she ""drop"" the bombs?)4. Leia turning into Mary Poppins was the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie, any movie, EVER. Also, no one on the ship is sucked out after the door is opened, neither do they find it in the least bit curious that she survived the vacuum of space. She also has exactly ZERO Jedi training or any training with the force whatsoever but now she can use it to do **** that Luke Skywalker was never able to do?5. Snoke - What the hell is his back story, where did he come from and how did he create the first order? No need to explain any of that, just go ahead and kill him.6. What the hell did Luke die from? Meditating too hard?7. Luke sucking on the tit of some engorged sea cow. WTF?8. So Snoke can control and read the mind of Kilo Ren but he does not anticipate that Kilo Ren was about to kill him? WTF?9. The whole plot about the rebels trying to stay out of range of the first order ships was so so so so so stupid and unbelievable. You mean to tell me that the first order does not have any other ships that could track them down? Also when you are in space you DO NOT NEED FUEL to keep going! And can you remember any other time in Star Wars movies where the had to pull over to gas up?10. The whole Finn/Rose storyline was a complete waste of time. Rose is the worst character since Jar Jar Binks. I think they just added her to show another minority on the screen and for her to scream about how awful rich and white people are. She serves no other purpose. The blatant feminism and SJW crap in this movie is so out of place. All men are portrayed as bumbling idiots or evil (or both) and all women are amazing and can do nothing wrong, need no training to use the force, and are so much smarter than men.11. Laura Dern had perhaps the worst acting performance I have ever seen in any movie. She comes off as some super soft ""just happy to be here"" person and we are expected to believe she is some bad ass general/admiral. Also she had this secret plan to save everyone. Why the hell was it secret? She invited a mutiny since she was secret for no reason.12. Rose saving Finn at the last second was so dumb, so so dumb. And she falls in love in 5 hours? Him saving the day would have saved the movie to some extent. I am still rolling my eyes from her stupid line about saving what we love or some bull**** like that. We have gone from ""I Love You"" - ""I Know"" to this crap!13. Apparently on the casino planet you get thrown in jail if you park in the wrong place. Plus this whole sub-plot was just Twitter Social Warrior Justice bull**** being thrown in our face. I am in a dark theater to watch a movie and be entertained not preached at. Call me a sexist pig and bad person if you want to feel better about yourself but this whole part of the movie was worthless.14. So, I am not sure that Disney realized they were making a Star Wars movie. I  think they think Star Wars is a comedy franchise.15. What was the point of the penguin things on the island other than to sell merchandise?16. What was the point of The Force Awakens? This movie took all of the questions raised in that movie and decided they were not important at all and just threw them out the window. That was the saving grace of TFA is that it raised some questions to be answered in later movies.17. Kilo is Emo Darth Vader.I am not sure that Star Wars is salvageable at this point as long as Disney owns the rights. I will enjoy the original trilogy always and the prequels were not as bad as they were made out to be but I think I am done at this point. This movie was a giant middle finger to the original trilogy and people who grew up with STAR WARS.",0

614,"This is easily the worst Star Wars film ever.  Even though JJ Abrams was Executive Producer on The Last Jedi.  His vison was easily lost from TFA (which I wasn't a huge fan of but he left a lot of interesting plot points, literally gave the next person (Hack Rian Jonshon) a lay up to make a really awesome film). So many plot holes to count. They ruined lukes character and didn't develop any of the new ones as well.  Kylo basically gives a big F U to the crowd with his dialogue in Snokes throne room (Speaking through the hack Rian Johnson).  Honestly I get moving on from the past Saga, sure, but we all know Disney will make a million movies. So just make these last 3 good (well 2 now, well 1 now that this one is horrible) and then they can do what the want with the franchise.  They could have made their money and made a good film, but they didn't.  Too much humor in serious scenes.  I came in wondering a few questions. Who are Ray's parent?  Who is Snoke? Who are the Knights of Ren? How did Maz get Luke's Lightsaber? Just to name a few.  Zero answered.  I went in with 0 answers or expectations.  Got zero answers and lost all expectations.  Also, to those that say we are all complaining that TFA was too close to a new hope and this one was too far from the OT.  Well they stole most of everything from ESB and RTOJ in this movie.  Oh, except the slow speed spaceship chase.  No matter what I say you'll see it cause it Star Wars but I hope once you do you'll join the rebellion and try and get a film we deserve.  As the wise Lando once said ""This deal is getting worse all the time"".",0
615,"I can  not believe i was suckered into seeing this.If you love Star Wars, stay away from this film. It absolutely destroys Luke Skywalker, Underplays Chewie (And i know, noone cares about Chewie, Who is just sitting around all this movie, having lost Han and having not a care in the entire world)There is one shot of R2D2. There is two shots of C-3P0. So if you're a fan of the old series, don't watch this. It's going to hurt- and hurt alot. The film refuses to acknowledge basic space laws of physics- from bombs falling in gravity in space- to decompression only existing when it's convenient- to shields being on or off depending on convenience- to ships needing ""fuel"" to stay ahead even though vacuum provides almost no resistance and they would maintain their top speed without fuel. It also ignores the previous film completely. Every plot point they made is ignored. Every chance to make a good scene thrown away. There are 8 or 9 plot twists in this piece of garbage, and none of them were surprising. There is 20 or 30 jokes in this festering dung heap, and none of them are funny.Rian Johnson wanted to be ""New"" and ""Unpredictable"". He wanted it so badly, he sacrificed the soul of the series, basic storytelling, and Luke Skywalker. His attempt at ""Plot twists"" will only surprise those insipidly unimaginative enough to not see them coming.This film dazzles with pretty lights and colors, imaginative flight sequences, and strings them along on a plot so thin you'd have to fold it 10 times to wipe with it, which is surely all it's good for.Wanted to see something different, a smart and competent rey who doesn't abandon her training? You won't see it.Wanted to see a daring change, where Rey turns to the dark side? You won't see it.Wanted to see any plot where Rey develops as a character? You won't see it.Wanted to see Luke Skywalker go from a paradigm of hope and bravery to a scared, grumpy old man who tries to kill his own nephew in his sleep? You'll see it. People are throwing roses at this, calling it ""Brilliant"" and ""Unexpected"".It's the purest garbage i've ever laid eyes on. New fans are despising it. Old fans are despising it. It's score is sinking on every platform. Rian Johnson not only fails to capitalize on any mystery laid out in the much more admirable ""The Force Awakens"", but fails to even continue the basic plot. Luke goes from a man who went in search of a Jedi Temple for answers, leaving a map to be found- to a man who never wanted to be found and throws his own father's lightsaber off a cliff for a cheap laugh.JJ abrams meant that scene to be a passing of the torch, both from Rey to Luke, and JJ to Rian Johnson. Johnson literally enacted that scene, throwing the plot and mystery off a cliff. If i had to describe this movie, i would describe it thusly:Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is a freakish abomination of purposeful hatred bent on the destruction of all that came before it. Stumbling into life from the untalented and obviously egocentric mind of a director who views Star Wars as something subpar to be improved upon, instead of a massive universe of endless possibilities, it insults, belittles, and minimizes the efforts of many great storytellers, replacing their grand visions with it's own stunted and malicious message of ""Just accepting the new"" without thought. The film echoes this on every level, presenting somehow sluggishly a series of battles and intense situations interspersed with repeated jabs at the ""Uselessness of the past"" and to just ""Let it go, even if you have to kill it"". It does an admirable job of this- sinking it's inept and decaying claws into every facet of Star Wars, tearing away at universe and characters until nothing is left but the bare bones of a once great franchise.----------------------------------------------I award this movie 0 points. If i could award it less, i would.",0

617,"This review is coming from a neutral Star Wars viewer. I'm by no means a fanboy, and I can honestly say this is an objectively BAD film on so many levels. I won't go into the details, as they've been hashed over in so many other user reviews, but the writing and storytelling is shockingly lazy and shoddily done. It's inexplicable to me that this film is so highly rated by the so called ""critics"". Campy humor with no balance, non-sensical and thin character development, gaping plot holes that appear constantly throughout the film, sub-plots that are totally irrelevant to the story, a central plot that is mind-numbingly stupid (they're running out of gas in space), and a lot of excruciatingly bad dialogue make for an overall terrible 2 1/2 hour movie going experience. I'd seriously rather watch any of the prequels than re-watch this film. For real.

Terrible movie, horrible writing, wasted characters in Snoke and Captain Phasma, casino mission was forced inclusion for terrible characters that nobody wants to see, really Disney, nobody!  I am supposed to believe Luke would be afraid of and think about killing his nephew?  And his death is just a waste.  The director should never do another movie again, he should hide in shame.

623,"So Disney is really ripping my heart out on this film. Despite throwing in so many jokes, I didn't laugh even once.  I thought most jokes were ill timed and detracted from the moments they were cut into.  I would have preferred the entire thing dark without the weird awkward attempts at humor. The events of the film seem completely objective in achieving a blank slate to launch other products from.  The ultimate climax of Disnefying the Star Wars franchise into its branding machine.The visuals were very good, the action scenes excellent, art direction, choreography all great. Some scenes are really interesting.  This would have been an excellent movie if the writing from the start was good, but it wasn't.  The drama was forced and weirdly paced, had many plot holes, many parts this movie are disjunct from the preceding films (mediocre as it was) now completely reset by the events of this film.  So now there is a weird love-hate thing between Rey and Kylo, Finn got paired with Rose conveniently to lose the Rey love interest setup.  Seems like only yesterday Disney was wiping the Star Wars slate clean the first time, they can't even do two films without do-overs.",0

Christ I could go on and on about how Luke was turned into mess of a character (props to Hamill though for staying professional and doing a kick ass performance) how the middle of tje movie was just the most mundane piece of **** ive witnessed, ah man im so gutted.And seeing people defend it by saying only trolls are leaving a bad review?

626,"I have watched episodes 1-7 over 100 times and know most lines by heart. Since my first Star Wars movie, which I watched 35 years ago until episode 8, these have always been the series closest to my heart. Not anymore. Disney and the amateurs responsible for that joke really did a great job alienating so many Star Wars fans. To cut the long story short:1. I undestand now why Mark Hamill did not agree with the Director about Luke. I will pretend that the Luke story ends with Return of the Jedi. I feel betrayed and devastated after watching what he has become.2. Cheap jokes from B rating movies. We, the Star Wars fans are more intelligent than that. Who allowed such crappy humor in the movie?3. All questions after Episode 7 go in the garbage. Good job killing the fabula and the character stories, Disney. In short, I didn’t see any character stories in Episode 8. It all felt like a bad dream come true. What could have been done wrong with all characters was done wrong. Especially very terrible ideas about Snoke and Ray.4. This is the first Star Wars movie that made me bored on the 30th minute after watching it and I couldn’t wait to finish. I will never watch it again.5. Forget about all previous episodes. Disney did a great job restarting the series, unfortunately in the worst possible way.6. Bad character dialogues and story telling. I never felt excited or curious during the whole movie, which makes me feel strange as I have always watched previous episodes with great interest.I wish the series ended with episode 6. Damage is already done, RIP Star Wars.",0
627,"Holy **** this movie is just so disappointing. TLJ doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie, but like a Marvel movie with all the forced humour and no plot formula. Disney really ruined the franchise with this one. I am definitely pulled out of the franchise because of TLJ. I understand you wanted to create something different but you don't break the basic important laws/rules of the mythology while doing that. It's just so embarrassing. I wanted Carrie Fisher to get epic farewell but instead with got this disjointed mess of a movie.",0
628,"This movie killed Star Wars for me. It was so bad, that I simply don't care about the Star Wars universe anymore. There was so much potential wasted. For example, we've been waiting 30 years to see Luke Skywalker again, to see him just be a total jedi badass like vader was at the beginning of Episode 4. But no. We get a cranky old coward who milks aliens and fishes and just runs away for half the movie. We also got the lamest, stupidest space battles that have no bearing on reality. Why do the rebel bombers rely on gravity to pull their bombs down, in space, where there is no gravity? This movie is just such a joke, and wastes the interesting mysteries provided by Episode 7 (which also was bad), which clearly shows there is no one at Disney in charge of the overall story of Star Wars. The whole thing just totally turned me off of Star Wars and left me feeling totally betrayed. Why should I invest in a IP/Franchise/Setting if at any time, the stories I grew up with are all wiped away as no longer canon, only to be replaced with garbage like this? If they did it once, they can do it again at any time. Why give them any more money when they've clearly just given their fans the finger? I'm simply done. Star Wars is dead. Well done Disney.",0
629,"what a horrible, way too long, incoherent mess. even an empire remake would have been better.",0
630,"Technically, a decent film (5 or 6/10) but probably the worst Star Wars film ever.It's like Rian Johnson wanted to be some contrarian or disagreed with the philosophy of Star Wars and decided to (poorly) deconstruct Star Wars and turn the film into the ""anti-Star Wars"" Star Wars movie.He negates all the growth, values, and experiences made in both the OT and TFA but doesn't placate anything new in place of all the things he subverts.  We don't learn anything about the characters or why they do the things they do.  We don't learn why Snoke is interested in fighting the Jedi or where he came from.  Rey still hasn't received any training and yet, is the equivalent of Kylo Ren (all the Mary Sue accusers here gain traction to a film that could've easily negated their arguments).  The characters do stupid things that serve no purpose to the story other than to say, ""oh look, here's some vague and shallow demonstration of failure or growth"".The dialogue was out of place and wonky.  You had awkward phrases and sayings like ""Godspeed"" or ""chrome dome"" or ""laser swords"" which doesn't belong in a galaxy far, far way.The humor was awful and killed all the tension in the film.  It's as if the writer thought the Marvel movie quips were suited for the SW universe and brought it in to supplement all the violence and genocide.  Likewise, they wasted 30 minutes of the film dedicated to a boring casino subplot that ended up irrelevant to the plot.  Totally poor direction here.Anyway, it's just a huge disappointment. I am certain that I will NOT be watching the next two Star Wars films.  Likewise, I fear they will ruin the Obi-Wan film which will come after.",0
631,"From puzzled and insulted, to confused and heartbroken!Four days ago I went to see The Last Jedi, or so I thought... it turned out to be Fast & Furious The Political Correct Star Wars Marvel Franchise Block Buster Tropes Movie Series Entry 1.. After 10 mins I was puzzled by the setup and lack of competent opposition for our heroes. After 20 mins I was weirded out by slapstick and out of character moments. After 60 mins I was in denial... so many awful choices made for this movie. After 90 mins I was angry and wanted to walk out - a feeling I've never ever felt for SW or any other film before. After 120 mins I was insulted by so many strange plot holes and lost opportunities. After 152 mins I was confused... why would anyone do this to a beloved story? After a day I was just heartbroken :(",0

What garbage.",0
633,An exceptionally poor film completely out of line with the star wars universe built up over the previous films. Extremely cheap jokes thrown in removes any of the epicness of the film. Massive plot holes galore. An absolute disaster of a film.,0
634,"LoL to all these 10/10 disney bots and corru*ted lef*ie ""pro"" reviewers... how can someone call this best SW? WTF? Why? Because its promote feminism and hate toward males (and rich ppl)? Because of so called diversity... i wonder what would be the score without all that mary sue bs. When i look at this new ""star wars"" movie or new star trek TV show i can see that actuall quality doesnt matter anymore as long as you push right opinions and propaganda. So why is this worst star wars movie ever created? Is it only because of leftie agenda? Is this movie just a victim of evil alt right macho males? NOPE this movie has so many problems that even if all actors were white hetero ar*ans it would not save it and i would still hate it equally. Lets see... lore breaking bs, terrible jokes, annoying new cast and characters, ridiculous villains (pls first order sounds like some cheap fan fiction anyway... you should just do a new star wars trilogy about yuuzhan vong invasion those are real badasses not these space nazi wannabes), boring story lines with too much plot holes and no real impact, good characters wasted or even intentionally destroyed (like luke himself... because disney needs you to focus on mary sue, who is now most likely strongest jedi and best sword fighter and best force user and best anything), new aliens exist only to sell toys to kids, rebels have super thick plot armour and even thought they have apparently no tactical or military knowledge they always manage to win (i know SW isnt military scifi but pls it still has war in its name it doesnt have to be total garbage), soundtracks, acting and battles are all mediocre and theres really not a single good thing i can praise. I really love old trilogy i like prequels and i was able to survive EP VII (it was bad but with potential) and i read a lots of SW books... i may not be most hardcore fan but i still really like the lore and this was just utter insult and slap in the face. BTW: its really not about some blind disney hate i still like them for creating MCU and few other good movies and rogue one was amazing (with ten time better female character BTW) and i think that SW still can be save (not this trilogy but maybe the next one) but you disney ceo guys really have to kick Johnson off and find someone who actually love and know the lore then you have to stop promoting PC-BS and rather focus on creating good movie. Diversity isnt about mary sue female characters and lame incapable male characters...   also sorry for my english not my native language....",0
635,"If there has ever been a time I have been fundamentally disgusted with the Star Wars Franchise it's now. Corny love stories, poor lines and poor acting as in Episode 2 and 3 are forgivable, cringeworthy, but forgivable. A Terrible character like Jar-Jar Binks in Episode 1, while horrible in his own respect, at least had development, a back story and a compelling quirk (oddly lucky clumsiness which led people to speculate about what it means to be force sensitive). But this movie... This movie wasn't what I would call ""bad"" more so than a slap in the face for any new and old Star Wars fan.No this isn't a gripe about the awkward diversity of characters (the stuttering Codebreaker was actually refreshing.). What irritates me is that there is no compelling character development. There is literally none. Rey doesn't learn any real lesson from Luke and decides to act rashly and impulsively. Her punishment? Ren kills Snoke. Ok? I know this is meant to be a big turn for Ren, but this isn't foreshadowed, it isn't built up. Snoke was never developed into a compelling or threatening character so his death just feels flat...Another big problem is the Codebreaker plot. Why in God's name was this allowed to be in the movie? It's so far removed from the story that it makes no sense. Not only that but the whole thing was rendered pointless. The justification behind it was that a fusion powered interstellar warship was ""running out of fuel"" and couldn't escape because a DREADNOUGHT was tracing its location. What really bothers me about this is that Mon Cal cruisers are slower than Imperial Dreadnoughts and Tie Fighters are around 25x faster than them as well. A bomber fleet would have taken out the crippled ship in MINUTES. Also literally dropping bombs in space? LIKE WTF ARE YOU SMOKING? Leia surviving space for over 3 minutes? WTF?Worst of all Luke was gutted as a character. I dont mind the nod to Yoda's character by turning him into the ""scholar"" type, but Luke, being the ""Last Jedi,"" is the only living conduit for the light side of the force. That and his Skywalker blood would make him a literal God. Luke should have had a renewed vigor and faced Ren in person only to be outmatched by the only conduit of the dark side. Imagine Luke deflecting walker lasers with one hand and force crushing another set with his other as Luke deflects the barage towards Ren's walker Ren stops the lasers in place one after the other as he yells in a fit of rage (a potentially visually striking scene with time for a flashback to Luke's intended murder of Ren), ignites his lightsaber and jumps out of the walker (the walker explodes while he leaps towards Luke, letting the suspended lasers continue their original path. In the aftermath, a lightsaber fight begins.And here's another thing I dont understand why the lightsaber battles have been denigrated. Lucas used them as a plot device to create tension during dramatic character development. Sadly this movie lost ALL TENSION and FAILED TO DEVELOP ITS CHARACTERS. IT FOCUSED ON HUMOR, VISUALS AND IRRELEVANT POLITICAL JABS (ie the casino scenes). IT ALSO BUTCHERS ALREADY DEVELOPED CHARACTERS BY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THEIR MOTIVATIONS. TL:DR the movie is poorly directed, poorly written, ignorant of even the most basic of Star Wars lore, and, above all, I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth with nothing answered and no desire to see another Star Wars movie. I've never felt like that before about Star Wars even the trash of the prequels was better! I wish this movie was never made! I take is back this IS a ""bad"" movie 0/10",0
636,"This was a disaster. They destroyed my feelings and Star Wars story. F you Disney. I will not buy any ticket on your movies, I will not buy any goodies from you. Never EVER again.",0
637,"TLDR: Rather than watching this abomination, go take a nap. You will accomplish more and have more fun doing utterly nothing.No character depth, untold amounts of plot holes, and above all identity politics. If you support random insertions of people simply due to their skin color rather than a fit for the role, then this is your movie. I am still trying to figure out the asian girl's purpose. What was her role and why was she even in this movie other than the fact to bump the diversity ratings up a hair?Another note, all of the women held the positions of power while they delegated their authoritarian-like power to all of the men; but when someone would challenge the decision, the woman in power would essentially say ""I'm with her, do as I say because reasons.""P.S. the critics are extremely disconnected with the viewers. That fact is just as disappointing as this movie.",0
639,Thank you to all of the Star Wars fan base who have provided their honest opinion of this movie.  I have been an avid fan since seeing A New Hope on its opening night.  I will not support such a disappointing representation of Star Wars by seeing it in the movies.  Instead I will rent the bluray for $2 and most likely never watch a 2nd time.,0
640,"This movie is very much a mixed bag for me. There are things that I absolutely loved about the movie, and there are things that I not only strongly disliked but kinda ruined Star Wars as a saga for me. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece. The action is awesome; however, I wish so badly that they would bring back grand and epic scale lightsaber battles like in the prequels. The movie gave some great character depth to Kylo Ren and Rey, which I enjoyed. Now, one thing I hated is that they ruined the character of Luke Skywalker. I understand he's a changed man because of the events that are explained in this movie, but his actions are not like him at all. The Leia force reveal was both cool and laughably cheesy at the same time, so I don't know how I feel about that. The death of Snoke absurdly disappointing. Rey's parental reveal was a huge slap in the face to the audience and fans. The ENTIRE Finn and Rose plot should've been removed. It did nothing to further the story in any way whatsoever. If you took it out completely, not only would the plot remain unaffected, but the movie would actually be better.",0
641,"I don't want to say that the movie was terrible, in a technical sense. There were lots of interesting moments and it was gorgeously shot. And until the last 10 minutes of the movie I was mostly on board. But having Luke die in such an uninspiring way really killed it for me. Essentially, what we are left with is the complete negation of the original three movies. The heroes save the day in RotJ. That buys them a few years of quasi peace. Luke messes up Ben Solo's training, and as a result goes into exile for the rest of his life (note that he never gave up on Vader even though Vader was objectively worse). Then, finally, when Luke reconnects with the world, he dies due to...what? Overexertion? We have no idea. So what Rian did to possibly my favorite character ever is why this movie gets a 2 from me. The plot was honestly not great even without the Luke-centric objections, but like I said I could've gotten by with that if Luke lived or died in a blaze of glory or something coherent. Oh well.",0
642,"This managed to be even worse than the last one.  It's great for people who don't care about character, consistency, and coherence.",0

The most common description of The Last Jedi by paying customers, as opposed to paid reviewers, is that The Last Jedi is ""a dumpster fire of a movie"". This is an insult to dumpster fires across the galaxy.

645,"Great acting, Beautifully shot, but by far the worst of the SW movies. This movie, makes it so that there is no reason you should want to see episode 9. SPOILERS! All major villains are dead. Snoke dead, Phasma dead. Kylo Ren, not dead, but has already lost in both movies. So what are you expecting to happen in the final one. And even if all the above somehow come back to life and are EPIC AND POWERFUL, They will just lose. So its biggest sin without writing 100 paragraphs is that it ruined Episode 9.",0
646,"After the disappointing episode 7, I had my hopes up that this movie would be an improvement.  13 of us (3 families) went to a nice theater to see this.  The general consensus was that the movie was too long, hard to follow in spots, and generally just not that entertaining.  I have decided this will be the last $ that the Star Wars franchise will get out of us.  There are just too many other truly great movies out there to spend ones time enjoying than this disney-made-mess of a movie.",0

This film was a travesty. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of what he single-handedly did to ruin this franchise. If this is any indication of where this Star Wars franchise is heading, I for one will never watch another, and I have been a life long fan. Boo, Disney, boo.",0

649,"Just about everything that should be said about this movie has been said.  It is a terrible Star Wars movie and a good Scifi movie.  I personally haven't followed any other scifi franchises for thirty years.  Disney is missing the boat and losing the Star Wars magic.  I explained to my nephew in a way he could understand.  Think if Spiderman was infected with Venom ""DarkSide"" and Captain America chose to kill him in his sleep.  Now think if Spiderman was his young nephew.  Now think if Spiderman was Captain America's twin sister's child and the only family he has.  That is what this movie chose for Star Wars.  Skywalker risked everything for family.  It is a well established character arc.  Even his evil father renounced the Dark Side for family.  Now he is willing to murder a child in his sleep that his twin sister has asked him to protect.  Just for LS to think about that is too much of a stretch.  This type of decision from Lucasfilm storymakers are represented throughout the film.  Terrible SW Movie.",0
650,"This movie is absolute, complete, and unfiltered trash. A """"""film"""""" that has completely forgotten that it has a duty to tell a coherent narrative with fleshed out subplots and characters that people care for. Not to mention replete with plot holes.

Why did Haldo not just tell Poe the plan? So many awful scenes, Luke throwing the lighsabre over his shoulder, Luke milking the creature, the ironing scene, Leia's scene in space had the audience in stitches, every scene on Canto Bight, topless Kylo Ren, Anakin 2.0 and the list goes on and on. Johnson should be removed from any future Star Wars project as this was a terrible attempt at a Star Wars movie.

The bad jokes, the Mary sue Rey, Snoke, there is a lot of things wrong here but killing of these characters and not doing justice in doing so is a big dick move. I get it, there is new heroes, new age is coming to star-wars. I have no problem with that in fact I will support it for the future generation to enjoy same as I did when I was a kid. However, without proper story telling it won't work. Fans will not love Rey cause she is just strong and she is a female. Wonder Woman did it right why can't you? Too much political agenda as well. But what really hurt me is how they did Luke. I watch a lot of Hamill's disappointment and now I get why. Disney please don't do Episode 9 and return Starwars to GL. :(",0

I wasn't moved by any of the actors, and what was tolerable when I watched Star Wars in my teens, became unbearable this time.

662,"A usefull guide on how to take a legendary saga and rape it.Ruined classic characters, ruined lore, painful humor.Even if we don't associate it with the saga, it remains a badly written movie.And God, that no sense and meaningless plot! Two examples:1) The rebels are trapped on board of their cruiser and think they're all going to die.Poe Dameron asks several times if there is a plan and every time he is badly sent away.Everyone is so desperate that some rebels decide to help Poe in a mutiny. A f******g mutiny.How does Vice Admiral Holdo react? Doing and saying nothing!At the end of the story we discover that Holdo had always had a brilliant plan.Ehm, ok... WHY THE F**K SHE DIDN'T TELL THE PLAN TO THEM RIGHT AWAY?!? Those poor people thought they were about to die in few hours!But hey, that's right, it was necessary to humiliate Poe. Who cares about all those people worried about their lives. Ha ha, did you see Poe? Holdo just screwed you!2) Luke's hologram appears in the rebel base. He chats a little with his sister and then goes out for a walk.Yes, obviously he went for a walk, because apparently he forgot to say where he was going and why.In fact, shortly thereafter, we have a wonderful scene with Poe and Finn wondering: ""Is that Luke? What is he doing out there alone? Mmh... oh wait! Perhaps he's distracting them to allow us to escape? What do you think?""Ok...?Better to don't mention Rey (time she used a lightsaber: 2? 3?) defeating Snoke's personal guards.Maybe it was their first day, maybe they too had not finished their training yet.

663,"Probably the saddest movie review I've ever had to write. This was awful beyond words. In the spirit of not revealing spoilers, all I'll say is this: it was a complete departure from The Force Awakens, and the overall tone and feel of Star Wars in general. It was a reboot ... one movie after we got a reboot.You like Poe? He's wasted, and basically treated like an idiot the whole film. Like Finn? He's wasted too. Liked the budding potential romance between Finn and Rey? Nope, it's gone. Excited to find out about the First Order? Don't get your hopes up. Like Kylo Ren's cool mask? They got rid of that, too. Like Chewie? He's almost omitted from the film. It goes on and on.This is a movie designed as a middle finger to long time Star Wars fans, and even fans of The Force Awakens. This is a tear-down. This burns the entire lore to the ground and starts fresh, and it's as baffling as it is insulting.I fear that Marvel is next. Infinity Gauntlet will likely be the last non-political, non-social commentary Marvel film, and from here on out we're getting the absolute worst social justice garbage saturating every aspect of those films, too. 'Han Solo' will be the first Star Wars movies that I won't see in theaters. Which is something that actually breaks my heart.",0

It squanders a largely talented cast of actors including Mark Hamill to set fire to the legacy of the originals and succeeds in burying the franchise in one go.  Script is dire.  The plot is complete nonsense.  There is zero suspense and about million instances of just pure terrible moments. The Leia scene in space is just the worst thing that's ever happened in a film. That this made it through a test screening and an editing process is frankly astonishing.  I wish I'd never seen it.,0
666,A complete waste of time. This movie is so amateurish. It breaks off with original trilogy creating a bland story that does not answer any questions and creates even more questions. Avoid.,0

669,"No wonder Daisy Ridley wants out, and the cast didn't look as excited during the press tour as with TFA. This is not a bad movie from a movie making point of view (although it looks and feels more like a Marvel movie) but story wise it is plain bad. Terrible story decisions, it drags a lot during the middle with a subplot that does absolutely NOTHING to the story and goes on for about 40 minutes, lots of plotholes, zero character development. Revenge of the Sith is a much, much better movie. Watched twice, will NEVER watch again in my life.",0
670,"In a 152 minutes, the Last Jedi flushed all the lore, characters, as well as the myth and worldbuilding that had made this a beloved franchise. It was almost if there was distaste for anything Luke or Skywalker and now the characters of Luke, Leia, and Han are gone to make way for the new? The aforementioned characters and Skywalker legacy caried this franchise for five decades, hundreds of books, comic runs, video and rpgs, and several cartoon series. This movie seemed to want to make all of that non-important. GoT might as well flush the Targaryen's, Starks, Lannisters, and Baratheons. I can't see Kylo, Rey, Finn, and Poe carrying on such a legacy of their own both within the movieverse and without which made offing Han, now Luke, and of course Leia's next movei all the more tragic.",0
671,"How the hell a major studio is able to do a Star Wars without magic, without mythology, without character arc or hero's journey, in a big MESS of a script (nobody learns anything, nothing gets anywhere)...is really beyond me. This was dreadful to watch.",0
673,"The Last Jedi is a movie that tries extremely hard to be politically-correct, while at the same time promoting social ideals such as embracing inclusivity & diversity, that it forgets what it means to be a part of the Star Wars lore. For example, one of the most legendary and highly-respected protagonists in cinematic history has been reduced to an uninspiring hermit drinking milk off an alien-cow hybrid as part of his daily routine. Luke deserves better.Supreme Leader Snoke could potentially be a much sinister villain than Darth Sidious but was unfortunately killed off hastily, Darth Maul-style. Meanwhile, forgettable and insignificant token characters such as Finn and Rose were kept alive all in the name of ""multiracial-diversity"" and ""political-correctness"". And don't get me started on the space battles: It was vomit-inducing.Two-thirds of the movie was built on the premise that the fleeing Resistance cruiser was conveniently placed out of the potent firing range of the entire First Order armada hence the need for the lengthy pursuit. But that clearly raises more questions than answers. Firstly, the entire armada consisted of an estimated 4-5 First Order Star Destroyers including the massive Snoke's personal flagship “Supremacy”, all armed to the teeth with thousands of turbolasers, hundreds of laser batteries, tractor beams, anti-ship torpedoes, and this movie is telling me that none of these sophisticated & powerful destroyers could handle one feeble Resistance cruiser? Unbelievable. Secondly, General Hux could have just deployed his entire squadron of TIE Bombers to strategically target the cruiser's engines and shield generators, decapitating it entirely! Mission accomplished.The gigantic First Order Dreadnought that is capable of orbital bombardment from space was shockingly vulnerable to ""vertical-dropping bombs that defies space physics"" from one Resistance bomber.The ""finding the codebreaker at the Casino-Monaco Planet"" storyline was grossly unnecessary and a borefest. I understand the writers wanted to further develop the Finn-Rose dynamic but as a longtime fan, it would have been better to allocate the precious screentime to a more-engaging backstory about Snoke or showing more of Rey's Jedi training.Leia flying around in space without a spacesuit. Apparently being strong in the Force negates the urgent need for oxygen, being frozen, or propelling oneself through a microgravity environment. SpaceX, anyone?Snoke's death was unreasonably premature.Luke's death, while expected, could be better managed by the writers.Kylo-Rey intergalactic Force-Skype communication: The next Tinder in the making?My Conclusion: A Disney-approved Sci-Fi comedy specially made for the general audience, with Porgs for the kids, while leaving behind the tiny bits of crumbs for the longtime fans to scrimp on.Hey, as long as Disney makes $2billion at the box office and millions more on merchandise and other related IPs, who are we to criticise them? In the end, it's all business, profits, and nothing else.",0
674,The filmmakers were obviously more interested in hitting as many story beats as possible while zig-zagging between twist and turns instead of just telling a story about hope.,0
675,"More cons than pros in this one.- Plot holes- Bad pacing - Forced humor.- Terrible send-off for Luke- ""Leia Poppins"".",0
676,"Terrible movie.  Great concepts and themes, but poorly executed.  Plot holes the size of death star planets, contrived situations, and complete disregard for what came before.",0
677,"Pure marketing driven movie making, with little actual development, just abrupt plot changes.  Everything that was built-up in the first movie, is easily discarded by a highschool plot that wants to be more Michael Bay than the man himself.  Apparently ending with a 45 cinematic scene is enough to appease those whom are easily entertained, so they forget all the plot holes and abrupt conclusions for significant characters.  The rest of us are left wondering why this movie was necessary at all, given how little actual development occurred during the first hour and 45 minutes.  Rey suddenly becomes a sword master *before* Luke begins training.  The master himself, the very embodiment of forgiveness (especially for a family member) is turned into a homicidal, alien nipple sucking (for laughs apparently) imitation of what he is supposed to be.Edit - to all those claiming any view but your own *must* be due to trolls, you should look in the mirror and see what you have become.  Also, for those blaming the writers, the only writer is Rian Johnson (the director).  You can add a little for JJ Abrams as the Exec. Producer as well, since he should have been paying *some* attention to what was going on.",0
678,Waited 37 years to watch this crap.  From drinking milk from an alien boob to flying around like superman in deep space.  This movie has it all.  I could not tell if this was Spaceballs or Star Wars.,0
680,"Lucas would have made a much better movie. Should be renamed to Spaceballs 2.... This is how I would change the movie. I would get rid of 99 percent of the comedy. No Rose or Vice Admiral Holdo and no casino planet. Finn gets killed by captain phasma. Snoke is revealed as darth plagueis and actually faked his death before to palpatine/sidious. Rey actually gets trained by Luke for a year. Leia dies when she gets sucked out to space, she doesn't mary poppins herself back to the ship. No bombs are dropped because that was stupid. Instead poe and everyone on the ship are captured and held as hostages. Rey and Luke sense this and go to rescue them. Rey finds out that Kylo is her cousin. She is Luke's daughter. Luke tells her this. Rey's mother didn't wan't Luke around because she thought he put Rey in danger. She was also married to another man. They died and Rey was taken by strangers and sold off as a slave. Luke couldn't find her. This hurt him inside so much that it was part of the reason he left. He was ashamed of himself for losing her and then after losing Kylo to the dark side. It was the last straw. Rey forgives him and they have a moment. When they get to the ship Luke and plagueis have a great lightsaber duel but plagueis retreats and gets away. Rey fights Kylo but tries to convince him to turn but he wont listen. She defeats him but captain phasma tries to electrocute her from behind but Kylo puts his body in the way and is killed. Rey then fights phasma and kills her. They free poe and everyone else. They have a big funeral for the dead and Luke and Rey go back to training. Rey learns how to communicate with force ghost, Anikan, Obi Wan and Yoda. She becmes a Jedi. Darth Plagueis finds a new apprentice. The end.",0
681,"This is supposed to be Star Wars.  But it will never be Star Wars without George Lucas.  From the Fanfiction Awakens to this movie, the characters developed in the original trilogy are ignored and poorly written.  all of the new characters fail at everything they were trying to do.  Rose stopping Fin from being a hero was terrible.  Luke considering killing Darth Snape is too out of character.  Turning the empire into Nazis is laughable.  This was not Star Wars, this was Disney Wars and has ruined my opinion of Disney with Star Wars.  Can someone start a petition for George Lucas to write his own versions of episodes 7, 8, and 9?  We don't even need films, just books of the real story with Kira the Jedi.  But as for now, all I can think is Step into the grand tour, grand tour grand tour, step into the grand tour, Star Wars GT!  I hope Star wars bombs from here on out.",0

683,"I'm giving a 0 which is completely unfair for what is a visually entertaining production, but I'm doing it as a way to call the attention towards what I consider to be a very poor writing and bland underdeveloped characters. The movie missed a huge chance to be truly great. People don't see this franchise as just another movie, SW is a cultural phenomena that people feel invested in and Disney has shown a lot of disrespect to the original fanbase that made this franchise great. Also I'm all in for strong female characters and diversity in the cast, but forcing a political agenda with poor writing is truly sad.",0
684,Horrible a réal masse !!! Thank you Rian Johnson you distroyed Starwars A garbage,0
685,"I do enjoy a great standalone action flick from time to time in which a new foundation is established and from which new concepts are spring boarded. However, Star Wars is not a new concept, its root system or foundation is well established. To remove the foundation from something by changing many of its fundamental characteristics and load bearing walls, one will quickly find a new construction. In cases in which load bearing walls, key characteristics of the franchise such as but not limited to Luke Skywalker, are to be adjusted they must must be treated with respect as they are removed to ensure that the structure does not implode. In that same vein, they must be replaced with a load bearing wall that is equally robust if not more robust in the process if one does not intend for the structure to fail at the point of alteration. It is my fear that the load bearing walls that are being removed (Luke, Han Solo, etc.) are not being replaced with much more than sticks and drywall (shallow characters & plot) and as a result the structure, in time, will inevitably fail. I can appreciate the dynamic between Kylo and Rey. However, I feel their innate abilities, in particular Rey AKA Mary Sue, to have such command over the nature of the force despite a lack of training or(struggle) seems to gut some of the epic appeal of Star Wars. Such a counter intuitive deviation from the trajectory within the physical tapestry of the Star Wars Universe seems to rattle the foundation of what constitutes the realm known as ""Star Wars."" To slap the name of Star Wars onto that which is only a mere reflection of what was previously known as Star Wars supplants the series' uniqueness with ambiguity and shallow attempts at balancing character introductions without first fleshing them out. Many missed opportunities to set this adventure upon new heights followed from the method in which the movie was approached. Instead of remodeling a building and adding another story to its current foundation, the foundation was demolished, and an entirely new building was constructed in which only the outside appearance retains some semblance to the buildings previous greatness. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with trying something innovative with this series, however in doing such, it is necessary to first establish plot shifts that evolve out of a catalyst that is birthed within a plot that is consistent with and logically follows from the foundation. That is to say, plot innovation does not have to come with disregard to the past, it only need to logically follow, or be backed with a sufficient reason or cause, as to why the story line is shifting the way it is. To simply take and input characters without depth, to input force abilities without reason or explanation, and to construct every villain with the structural integrity of a scarecrow and the emotional maturity of a child so that every ""good"" character always wins, is just disappointing. Ultimately, without a robust reason for changes in a set system while simply interjecting them with a disregard for consistency, removes the core appeal replacing it with something that is seemingly a hollow shell claiming to be Star Wars whilst being something altogether different.",0
687,"I’m giving this 1 point to be fair because me and  3 other people in my group decided to leave the theatre after the first part of the movie otherwise I would have given it 0. I have to say that I’m a fan of the original trilogy but except another friend in my group the other two didn’t care about Star Wars very much so they were in just to enjoy a movie together (We are all about 30 years old).  I didn’t have great expectations, I’m not a fan of episode VII, I find it inconsistent and not original but overall I think it’s an ok movie, so I tried to have an open mind for this one. I did know about the mixed reviews but nothing could have prepared me for what I’ve witnessed.  I’m not going to debate the lore or the direction the story is progressing in these new films, I personally don’t like it because for me Star Wars was something else and I think Disney could have told a new original story for the new generations without the need to destroy  the heroes of the old movies and their accomplishments, but , I repeat, this is only my personal  opinion.  ‘The Last Jedi’ was very good visually but story wise it was ridiculous, rushed, full of plot holes and inconsistecies and I’m not saying that in refer to the original trilogy, but to episode VII and even with itself. The characters choices and many scenes are totally random and don’t make any sense. As if this couldn’t be enough the movie is full of cheap forced “funny” moments and evident  political topics that don’t belong in a Star Wars movie at all. We had I think 6 or 7 kids sitting in the row in front of us but I never heard anyone laughing once. I’m completely puzzled about the great reviews this movie is getting. Are good visuals, special effects and cute birds really enough to make a bad movie a great movie?",0
688,"Zero plot, characters bland and doing things without reasons... Time bomb after time bomb to link scenes in a movie with no plot. The deus ex machina resource is so used that I was counting the number due to boredom. The only good thing was the music. Same old music and same sounds from the rest. Truly disappointed.

The movie has many plot holes, comedy that always falls flat and is out of place, is heavily politicized, and is a slap in the face to serious fans of the series. I found little redeeming about this film.",0
691,"Horrible movie: plot is a meandering mess with no real point at times | poor acting with tons of exposition | the script is so poorly worded in places it doesn't feel at all real | the script also tries to force themes and world views in such a blunt manner it seems like someone injected an after school special in the middle of the film | this movie basically throws most of the lore and jedi groundwork from the other films.Ultimately in 20 years, we won't even remember this film compared to the original trilogy. Despite rating sites like this trying to give it nearly the same ratings (90 new hope and this is 85).",0

I will just speak to anyone who will watch this film as a film and not as Star Wars movie. This film is very beautiful. That's it. The story suck there are so many plot holes that I stopped counting, every single scene brings some inconsistancies that could potentially kill the film. The acting is good I guess, but the characters have 0 charisma, most of them are useless anyway. The pace is terrible, there is no link between scenes, everything is either too long or too short : the beginning take 1.5 hours is so boring and the end is a 1 hour long endless fight with no passion. Yes your read it well there is no ""middle"" between beginning and end in this film.",0
693,"Disappointing, horrible plot lines, and what's worse dismantles all that is good in the franchise.  I went and signed the Petition to have this movie removed from the Star Wars canon.  It doesn't deserve to be in the same galaxy, let alone dvd rack as the originals.  We need a redo!",0

695,"""The force awakens"" wasn't perfect but it gave lots of good plot threads for The Last Jedi"" to follow into. Rather then follow those plot points Rian Johnson jettisons most of the major plot lines from the Force Awakens, so he can weave together a plot hole filled mess of a movie. A movie about a in space chase that defies logic. The complete character assasination of Luke, who tried everything to save his father who had already fallen to the darkside even risking his life. That Luke who would do all he did for a Father already fallen as he was, would almost kill his nephew before he had even fallen? The pointless social justice plot that added an extra useless hour to the movie that amounted to nothing, from a lack of communication from the Admiral to Poe. The egregious killing of of Snoke so we can be stuck with an angsty whiny villain rather then an intimidating one.This movie was nothing but a massive mess that dropped ok ideas for bad ones and wrecked already well established characters.",0

Like straight up nothing.The whole rebel alliance are mentally handicapped that pretty much kills themselves for no reason, and everything could have been solved if COMMANDER PURPLE HAIR TOLD THEM THE PLAN.Purple hair is the sole reason why the rebel army almost got destroyed. Leya had a fake out death, everyone in the cinema got quiet and saw Leya float in death cold. It was sad. AND THEN SUDDENLY LEYA TURNED INTO SUPERMAN AND FLEW BACK TO THE SHIP.It was so god damn stupid it hurt me on a level i did not think was possible.Snoke died pretty anti-climatic and we have no idea what he was who he was or what he wanted.The only good part in the movie that really saved it from a lower score was Kylo Ren, everytime he was on the screen i was hooked and i really wished that the movie had focused more on Kylo, Rey, luke and snoke. Learning why the Jedi failed and what the future needs.Instead we got a rushed ending and suddenly Rey can use the force whenever she want. with no training. Only see this movie if you can do it for free because half the movie is just no worth the money and the other half is decent. But not good enough to carry the whole movie.",0
702,"Takes the promise of TFA, which was at least safe, and then just seems to revel in going against any and all Star Wars themes and characterisation. There is no progression from TFA - it’s like it never happened. There are horrible go-and-fetch plots which don’t matter, and the comedy is jarring. Worse of all, it made Luke a frivolous figure. If Johnson wanted to be clever and subvert expectations he did it, but at expense of everything the saga has established thus far.",0

They have shown zero respect for the beloved original characters and I am nowhere near emotionally invested enough in their new characters to actually care what happens to them. I'm done. TFA was bad enough but at least presented some hopeful plot points for the future. This new movie not only did not deliver on those plot points, but completely laid waste to the heart and soul of the franchise - Luke Skywalker. I trusted that Disney knew how to be a caretaker of such a legacy franchise. I cannot believe how wrong I was.",0

Luke dies because he tried too hard doing a hologram projection?  It's not that I don't like it because it's a departure from Star Wars of the pat.  I don't like it because it has no depth and it sucks.  If I wanted another fun senseless movie I'll go see an Avengers movie.  It's what they do.  Star Wars is the complete package, or rather was.

709,"Signed up just so I could make a review to balance out all those professional reviewers who are obviously on the take from Disney.I can forgive the film its blatant merchandising.I can forgive it trashing the internal consistency of the starwars universe (Oh - we can ram at lightspeed - shame no one thought of that in the last movies - would've saved a bit of time taking down the death star....)I can forgive it trashing the fans who love all the Star wars ""lore"" - the whole force/jedi/martial art training thing being turned into a harry potter style power. (thats not fair actually - harry needed to go to school)I can forgive it trashing any attempt to explain the laws of physics violations in some sort of sensible way - bombs in space ...what is that?I can forgive it having silly sub plots and  characters who are killed before we get a chance to know them.I can (just) forgive the space cows ( although I wish I could unsee them) I can forgive it a lot of things, if it was just a fun exciting film.But it's not. For some reason I started looking at my watch after about 20 minutes. Thinking about it afterwards, I think the problem is all the main characters are off doing their own thing, rather than bonding and banding together, bouncing off each other and actually involving the audience.  I couldnt give a fart in a jar what happened to any of them.  By the time it got to the moderately interesting last half hour I was over it. And they fluffed a chance to really make things interesting when the two main characters could have got together and taken the whole thing in a new direction, neither all good or all bad.But the thing I really can't forgive is killing admiral Akbar like that. Come on, he is an old friend - he should have at least gone down with the ship or on some mission of bravery - just being blown out of the window by a tie fighter - puhlease. This symbolises the whole film's attitudes to its history and the fans. Yeah I get they need a new direction, and that they want to get away from the heroic narrative and they need the new cast and all that, but there were a million better ways than this.The reason for all the hate is that everyone of us out here pounding our keyboards could have written a better story arc and  better reviews than what the well paid professionals have come up with. That's what makes me grind my teeth. It is nothing at all to do with the ""girl power"" or inclusiveness - it's to do with crap story telling and a bad plot.",0
710,"Simply awful. I am a die hard Star Wars fan and this was a huge disappointment after Force Awakens and Rogue One.  It is just a bad movie, period.  Disjointed storyline, cliched, cheesy, unexplained actions by major characters.  Wont go into spoilers but there were basically 2 scenes in the movie that I thought were worthwhile. I actually laughed out loud at points (unfortunately they were not parts of the movie that were meant to be funny) a throwback to what happened to me during Phantom Menace.

715,"As a stand alone movie, it is very weak. TLJ has pacing issues, inconsequential narrative choices, disconnected dialogue and monologuing, and almost no character growth or arcs. What some critics seem to like are the subverting of expectations. The problem for an audience member such as myself is that those subverting of expectations completely destroys my willing suspension of disbelief that is required for me to buy into a fantasy/sci fi movie. I had an understanding of the powers of the force that were contradicted in order to surprise the audience. The physics of space battles never made sense, but this movie adds in bombers, ""gas"", and FTL maneuvers that completely subvert expectations and make every space battle in the other movie no longer make sense. Characters go on quests for MacGuffin characters that aren't found and this call into question the narrative choice of creating that MacGuffin. Objects and character histories are set up as being important and then tossed off for a cheap shock. If they aren't important, they shouldn't be including in the storytelling or else I start to question the nature of the storytelling itself and this destroys my suspension of disbelief. I learn of a military industrial complex backing everything and this makes me question the insistence on a good vs evil structure in the previous movies. I am forced to conclude that Leia is just a patsy for the corporations interested in setting up and selling weapons to two warring parties trying kill each. The mythic story is lost and replaced with bad social commentary.All of these suspension of disbelief problems are easily overcome if I am emotionally invested in the movie. Unfortunately, the filmmaker seems entirely uninterested in making us care about the characters. I just didn't care.",0
716,I feel like Disney and this Ryan dude spit in my face. I'm thoroughly confused as to why critics are applauding it. Are they not star wars fans? This is the craziest thing since Trump won the election. At first I thought maybe Abrams would save it in 9 but he was exec producer on this one so he gave his approval. Have you guys seen the South Park episode where Indiana Jones gets used by Disney? That's what they just did to star wars. The murdered Indiana Jones afterwards though. I'll probably not see a Disney movie or two to just get even.,0
717,"Great acting and set design cannot save this movie from not owning being bad in its own right but also making other movies around it worse.  On its own this movie is badly paced and suffers from some glaring plot holes that canonically damage the Star Wars brand, at worst it destroys the character of previous characters and removes any desire to continue the lore.On a positive note the acting is solid with great choreography and even when the scenes do not hold up the emotion always comes through.  The movie looks gorgeous despite some interesting costume choices, the sets and visuals of this movie are simply stunning, never has Star wars looked so good and smelt so bad.JJ Abrams will return to the director's chair for the final instalment in the current trilogy, but most of that effort will now be required to steer this sinking ship back on course.  Any hope was lost immediately when moments that have been building for 30+ years are quickly dismissed for comedic relief.  Questions are either left unanswered or are given very unsatisfactory resolutions that will leave a bitter taste in your mouth.As an admitted hyper-fan of the franchise (I even have a signed Luke Blue lighsaber in my office) I can reluctantly be open to change when it makes sense within the lore, but some of the actions in this movie (light speed attack) make decisions made in the original trilogy look stupid and lessen the struggles undertaken by the heros.In short do not see this movie if you are a SW fan.",0
718,"Well well, the First Order doesn't do anything besides expecting the enemy ship to run out of fuel. You might ask where are the other ships and TIE fighters and why they don't attack the rebels. Yeah, Rian doesn't care.Kylo Ren can use the force, Rey can move rocks with her mind, but they somehow have to fight 8 guards instead of using their powers against them. You also have a subplot with 2 characters ( Finn / Rose ) that gets another sublot with slaves that gets another subplot with Benicio Del Toro. Everything worthless and could have been cut without changing a damn thing.Did I say Luke projects himself and his projection actually can touch Leia but can't be touched by Kylo's sword? Continuity? Rian doesn't care. Add in Superleia and a villain that dies for nothing. There are so many things wrong with this movie, that I could keep going for hours.",0
719,"Rarely does a movie give me the energy to write a review. I have never been as conflicted as i am with the last jedi. As a stand alone movie its good, i enjoyed it for entertainment, but as a Star Wars movie it is a FAILURE! Its as if they hired no loremasters, or cared if things made sense. The more and more i think about this movie the more problems and holes i find that is why i end this here.",0
721,"Great expectations for the first 7 minutes, then I became the witness of the end of a franchise. Nonsensical Plot, inexistent character development, poor CGI and on and on. A dark day for star fans",0
722,"I don't know where to even begin with this movie, it gleefully thumbs it's nose and mocks, via feminist and SJW claptrap, much of what made Star Wars great. Mark Hamill has said that he fundamentally disagreed with almost every decision Rian Johnson made for Luke's character and I've got to say that he's been very restrained in saying that because what's been done to the character of Luke Skywalker in this movie, is nothing short of cultural vandalism. Rian Johnson has made JJ Abrams look like Spielberg, it absolutely boggles the mind that Disney have given him a whole trilogy. You've got to wonder just what planet these Hollywood types are on. This most millennial of movies - preachy, shallow, self satisfied, lazy, boring and nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is - with a whole act that's completely pointless, is chock full of terribly out of place, cartoonish humour and laughably bad dialogue. Luke chose the island because it was ""the most unfindable"", I kid you not, he actually says that. He needn't have worried, I highly doubt this insulting hack job will be much sought after in the years to come.",0
723,"This movie is absolute garbage. It shows that nobody in Disney, nor on same Lucasfilm has any idea of what Star Wars is. Not even Kathleen Kennedy, who is supposed to be the custodian of Star Wars lore and story cohesion and after working with Lucas for many years, you would think something of SW lore and sense would stick with her, well , it seems she's just a business woman who's only in for the money and doesn't care on the quality of the product....or she couldn't say no to Disney whims , which make her a coward business woman.Anyway, is understandable that after the mess that The Force Awakens was , story wise, it would have been hard to fix that mess in the Last Jedi, or at least explain further some of the things portrayed in TFA, such as, who are the Knights of Ren?, Who the hell is Snoke, from where did he come from, how this apparently powerful being was out of the radar from the Sith of the galaxy (Palpatine and Vader)?. Why Rey is so powerful and knows how to master Jedi techniques where she had zero training before?. and a large etc etc etc.Well guess what, nothing of this is explained in TLJ and is actually discarded at all by Rian Johnson's horrible excuse of a script. He decided just to kill Snoke without providing background story, he decided that Rey is a nobody with nobody parents who sold her for booze. So she's just powerful, just because, you know, girl power and 21st century feminism. Knights of Ren was a BS invented by JJ Abrams and Rian seems didn't like that subject so he decided to just ignore them completely in this movie.And the worst sin of Johnson....he transformed Luke Skywalker into the ultimate coward in the galaxy. Yes, that same Luke Skywalker with many heroic traits from the original trilogy, that Jedi that sensed the good in his twisted and evil father (the second most evil villain in the galaxy, by the way) and went into a suicide mission to bring him back to the light , because he was family, that same Luke, years after in The Last Jedi era he decided to kill his nephew (the only son of his twin sister and his freaking best friend, Han), just because he showed few dark side tendencies....really Disney?.That made him a coward being and seems he didn't try anymore to bring Kylo back to the light or confront Snoke as the Master Jedi he supposedly was, he just left everybody, friends, family and decided he wanted to die alone in some forgotten island in a distant world. And for what reason Luke left a map so his friends could find him ""in a time of need"" in the first place, if the real reason for him was to escape to die alone and didn't want to be bothered?. It doesn't make sense at all.The way Rian Johnson's disrespected Luke's character like that is unforgivable. It throws to the garbage can the Hero's journey that George Lucas built for this character. Also, what was the point of Rose and Finn?, was just a distractor and made no purpose at all for the overall story. Why the admiral Holdo couldn't just tell Poe of her plans so he would't have call for mutiny in the first place? Is very idiotic of her part.And Leia Mary Poppins was ridiculous. Yes, she might have the force (she is the daugther of the Chosen one, Anakin Skywalker after all) and surely she also is strong in the Force, and might even have received training or some lessons from his brother Luke, but nothing of this is explained in the movie. Is just a Christmas miracle that she survived in the vaccum of space with no suit and  after an explosion blasted a few feet from her, it seems. Is Disney magic , most likely.In conclusion, this movie is deeply flawed and plain bad, Rian Johnson should just stick to direct and never touch a pen again to write ANYTHING.I don't have any interest of the 3 pieces of garbage he will supposedly create in the new trilogy Disney assigned to him. He dropped the ball severely in the Last Jedi. Movie is not worth the money or your time. You will waste 2 and half hours of your life in this.It seems that the real Star Wars story finished in Episode VI, Return of the Jedi. This Disney Star Wars is not Star Wars, is something else. Is not even good sci-fi.",0
724,"The Last Jedi is so bad that i had to race home and watch ESB to get the taste out of my mouth. I know how lobby Disney controls the reviewers and that's the reason why reviewers are always so biased in favor of this globalists shills but this is seriously **** crazy. Awful movie, just awful. Way to go Disney, trying to ruin such popular franchise with a puerile and cringeworthy plot. And last but not least, we don't need be to be experts to understand the politcal left-wing agenda behind this. This movie was surrounded with SJW and feminazi commonplaces that put to blash any decent human being.If it was possible i would have give this movie negative points but since Metacritic doesn't have that option i will stick with ZERO!",0
725,"This movie is horrible. Entire plot lines are introduced, then discarded. Got to get this plot point, hurry!  Whoops,  no that isn't necessary. The characters are uninspired, from the newest to the most iconic. I didn't care what happened to any of them. No one is a leader, everyone is an idiot. If George Lucas were dead, he would be spinning in his grave.  I have seen and love the original 6 movies for my whole life.I never want to see episode 8 again. Star Wars is dead to me now. I will not be seeing episode 9, and considering that Star Wars is my best loved Sci-fi franchise, that is saying something.  I read the books, played the games (board and computer), drew pictures of the Millennium Falcon as a child and saw all the movies on opening day, including Episode 7 (which was also a huge disappointment but at least felt like it might have been hiding something that I missed...)..I never will see E8 again, nor will I watch E9.  I could have gotten a bunch of monkeys with typewriters to write a better plot and more compelling characters.  It is almost as if the writer WANTED to piss on the Star Wars lore, just to say he could.",0
727,Disney just talk a dump on everything I loved about Star Wars.  All my old school Star Wars fan friends agree and hate it too.Question is can Star Wars recover or is the franchise dead?  Maybe Star Trek is the way to go now..,0

729,"I think the critics were paid off to give it a good review because there's clearly a gap between critic reviews and user score. This movie had some good things but overall I think it leaves the story in a terrible place. The Force Awakens catered to nostalgia while also bringing on new characters. The Last Jedi kills this nostalgia. First of all, I think that killing Han was a huge mistake and now Luke has been needlessly thrown away too. I was really hoping for a little bit of redemption when it appeared that Luke and Kylo Ren were in a standoff. But they went and ruined that by making Luke a weird force hologram thing which makes no sense. I hated the lack of lightsaber action. Don't get me wrong, I think episodes 1-3 had way too much and we became numb to it, but I don't even think two lightsabers even touched in this movie except for Lukes flashback of attempting to kill Ben in cold blood. I was hoping that TLJ was going to be the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the new series. It not only didn't live up to that expectation but failed horribly as a sequel overall. They basically threw away everything that was good about TFA. TFA built up this unknown but extremely powerful villain, Snoke, but then TLJ killed him off in the dumbest way without explaining who he was or where he came from. They also built up that Rey's parents were of some importance but then threw that down the toilet and now any random street kid can have the force. And the whole Casino thing was completely out of place and didn't add anything to the overall story because it ended up being a useless journey.There were some good things about it but overall it was a real disappointment and it ruined the momentum from TFA.",0
730,"Very disappointed in this addition. It stole so many scenes from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that it leaves one wondering if there was more rehashed content than original. Sadly, it doesn't even improve on those original scenes, but rather simply replays them with more CGI and less actual tension or suspense.I would go into further issues with plot holes, missing backstories, and ""If they could do something like that, why have they never done that before?"" moments, but this movie just isn't worth the time to explain them all.The popcorn is strong with this one.",0
731,"I can't understand why people who don't like this movie are giving a rating of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. It's like when it's your birthday and Rian Johnson gives you a beautifully wrapped present. You open it and inside you discover a huge turd. But hey, at least it was beautifully packed and you liked the package, even if it's smells like sh*t, so you are giving a rating higher then 0. The fact is that whatever you do a turd will be always = 0!",0
732,"If you judge this movie purely as mindless pew-pew laser fights in space, in some ways it delivers as a spectacle, but its all been done before.Otherwise, the film is packed full of non-events, plotholes, forced humour, and practically no character development. At the end of the film we are no further along the story other than Snoke and Luke are gone, and there are about 20 resistance left that all fit in the Millennium Falcon. All the battle scenes are repeats of previous movies, the main plotline is so confused its ridiculous. The New Order still design their ships with a big flaw that everyone including the resistance knows about, but the New Order don't bother to fix these weaknesses and design defences that can be taken out with a single fighter. The New Order has massively superior ships, technology and weapons but can't catch an inferior resistance slow capital ship because its slightly faster (WTF!) they don't think to deploy faster fighters or bombers to take out the ship or slow it down, or force it to change course, or force it to deploy shields so the rear is unprotected, they just have to wait for it to run out of space petrol. DUMB. It is there as a plot device to force urgency to the story, but the subsequent time-lines and sub plots don't align and the whole thing is a jumbled mess. I could go on and on about the flaws in the film. Its a film designed by committee dumbed right down to reach the maximum audience and sell merchandise and it shows.Ren is still the same confused emo kid. Rey is still the most Mary Sue of all Mary Sue's, she didn't need Lukes training after all. The new characters are so badly developed and cardboard that I couldn't care less what happens to them, I won't be seeing the next one.",0
733,"The Marvel-ization of Star Wars is complete. The new school of thought here seems to be: Who needs world building when we have big space battles and can make characters tell lame jokes like Poe's telephone support joke to Hux? Who needs character development when we can just throw in a female lead and make her all powerful with minimal explanation? Who needs to weave a story or tie up loose ends? Just make big explosions and a few by-the-numbers Big Battle Scenes™ and watch the money flow in. Just like Marvel Studios.Lucas had his issues but at least we all knew the story of Star Wars was the story of the Skywalker family. The OT and PT weaved a mostly coherent story, despite Lucas' 20-year-later retcons and ridiculous plot devices. This new trilogy is a story of what, exactly? Rey the Wonder Girl? I have zero attachment to her because instead of weaving a story around her, she's a Mary Sue who can do everything better than every other established character with no personal growth, loss, or development. She can do more in two episodes than Luke could by the end of three, or Anakin by the middle of the third. Compare her character development at this time to the same development of either Luke or Anakin and you'll see how farcical her character is.Finn and Poe should be the Han and Leia style secondary protagonists to Rey but instead both Abrams and Johnson try to spin them off as their own main protagonists. Due to this, we end up with half the movie being filler because had Leia or Holdo simply told Poe the Resistance's plan there would have been no need for the entire stealthy casino plot. Speaking of which, Benicio del Toro's talents were completely wasted in this haphazard story line. In a galaxy that we're told is full of scoundrels and ne'er-do-wells, ""DJ"" (literally his character's full name) isn't even top 20. Gwendoline Christie's talents were also wasted, as her Captain Phasma character is, again, left to be treated like a punch line (and a punching bag).Johnson squats and takes a Porg sized dump on the entire story line of Luke Skywalker and the original trilogy, and he does so gleefully. He turns Luke into a grumpy hermit who literally tells Rey to get off his lawn. Not that Rey needs him, it turns out, because why should she? She's already better than him, as Johnson makes apparent in a contrived battle scene. Luke's ""redemption"" comes in the form of two nostalgia pieces from old characters... neither of which change the fact that Luke is written entirely out of character. Something even Mark Hamill complained about months ago.Kylo Ren repeatedly stands center frame and repeats the lines of burning down the past. It's almost as if Johnson is using Ren to tell the audience that the old Star Wars is dead and the new Star Wars - HIS meandering mess of Star Wars - is all that's left. No thanks. I've been fooled twice now and as the old adage goes, shame on me. I won't be fooled a third time. It's crystal clear Star Wars has fully embraced the Disney dark side, a property to be exploited every year until it reaches a saturation point.",0
734,"What a disappointment! I wasn't really a fan of Force Awakens, but I adored Rogue One and had hoped it was evidence that Disney was finally capable of making a good Star Wars film. Oh goodness, I was wrong! This is a film that was made with no other intention than making as much money as possible from a wide audience and is actively hostile toward people who would call themselves ""Star Wars fans."" It's willfully ignorant of 40 years of lore and tramples over the source material.What was wrong with the film? Plot-holes the size of a Death Star. Most notably, the Finn and Rose sub-plot was completely unnecessary to the plot and added to the film's unnecessarily long length. The entire casino setting didn't feel like it belonged in the Star Wars universe.Wasted potential of Snoke. Why should his story bother to be told now that he was killed off so quickly? He was supposed to be at least as powerful as Palpatine and deserved more backstory before he was offed in such a haphazard manner.Luke acts very differently than he did in the earlier films and extended universe material. He was the ultimate sci-fi hero for four decades and we all wanted to see him operate at the height of his powers after training as a jedi grand-master off-screen for 40 years. How exhilarating was the final Vader scene in Rogue One? Imagine if we got to watch Luke kick some major amounts of behind in a similar manner? What did we get instead? A whiny coward who is nothing like his Return of the Jedi self and tries to kill his own nephew, which was really out of character. More Mary Sue nonsense where advanced force abilities can be used without any training at all and expert saber dueling capabilities can be achieved in no time!Capital ships running out of fuel? Is this suddenly supposed to be Battlestar Galactica? Light speed kamikaze suddenly being a thing in the first time of the history of Star Wars cinema? Why didn't someone think of that sooner? It could have ended every conflict prior like a super weapon!Disney got it wrong because they could have still made mountains of cash if they actually made a Star Wars film instead of whatever this garbage was. Instead, all they seem to care about is pushing their ham-fisted social agenda and erasing everything that made Star Wars the beloved franchise it once was. The studio has a lot to fix with Episode 9, but it no longer matters to me, because I won't be giving them my money to watch it.",0

736,"Went into this movie with so much excitement.  Came out so disappointed.  Never had a Star Wars movie that you walked out of and everyone you talk to was like ""Im not sure what to think""  The more you thought the worse it seemed.  Though a fast paced movie with many good parts, nothing seemed to come together.  Then, everything is rushed together at the end to wrap up bad writing.  The Main Plot is 2 capital ships chasing each other in and out of hyperspace.....thats it!  Couldn't come up with something better?  Totally destroyed Luke's character.  Wasted Chewbacca and just a glimpse of R2.  Leia was Superman?  really? It was the swinging on the vines in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.  Luke milking a boob creature?  I really wanted this to be good and kept waiting on the edge of my seat, but it never came.  Then finally Luke walks out to face the resistance and I thought here we go, they could do something awesome here and make this a great movie with one final scene, but nope.  He isn't really there and dies from the effort of not really being there.  What?  The most famous Jedi in the Galaxy and he dies of exhaustion?   Really only had 2 scenes that I was a fan of:  Yoda and the throne room scene.  Glad Abrams is back for episode 9 but not sure what he can do with this.   Maybe Luke didn't die and can re-materialize not in ghost form.  Maybe he just phased somewhere else.    Really I wouldn't have liked it but would have been a better movie if Luke turned bad.   Hope they recall their decision to give this director a trilogy.",0

Star wars was about a vast universe with lore, background and character development.All this is gone. No one cares why someone is a bad guy, or a good one. And you will never discover anything. Just throw in more pokemon-like creatures and silly jokes.We once mocked George Lucas for lines and bad writing like ""I'll try spinning"" or ""I hate sand"".After this movie, we all miss George Lucas. Yes. It is that bad. And utterly pointless.Let's call it quits and keep Rogue One as the only new SW movie in an otherwise pretty much bulletproof 6-logy.

Carrie Fisher flying through the vacuum of SPACE like Mary Poppins was as embarrassing as Zach Quinto's Spock yelling ""Kaaaaaaaahn!!"" in Star Trek Into Darkness.

749,"The original Star Wars films were about victorious hope, the unity that binds us all, and overcoming the evil inside yourself. Luke Skywalker is the embodiment of a character archetype that is as old as storytelling itself. He rises from nothing, pursues knowledge and enlightenment, overcomes despair, becomes a savior, and through courage and determination redeems the sins of the ones who came before him. His purpose as a character and as an icon is to personify everything a human should hope to become.In The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker tries to murder a child in his sleep, then cries in a cave for a few years while the world around him crumbles, then gets lectured by a teenager about responsibility, then dies nonsensically. Knowing that, go look at every other plot point and twist in this movie. The film's sole purpose isn't to push things forward or to build upon anything. It is reckless subversion for the sake of subversion. It is deconstruction with no meaning or purpose. It is a cynically assembled soapbox, made by people so arrogant and unappreciative that they would stand atop the legacy of one of film's most quintessential tales just to make an uninsightful, short-sighted point about ""leaving the past behind"", and toss some hamfisted political notes at the captive audience. It is worse than any corporate cash-in or any moronic prequels. The Last Jedi is an articulate attack on Star Wars itself and everything it represents.

750,"Star Wars is a lot of different things—Myth, Fantasy, Soap Opera, Action, Love Story, etc.  But what makes Star Wars special is that it is about love and friendship.  Star Wars heroes prioritize love and friendship above all else, and this prioritizing drives the story.  Anakin went to the dark side to save his wife.  Luke left home to be a Jedi “like his father.”  Jyn’s father joined the Empire “to protect [her],” and ensured that she would find the plans to the Death Star by naming the file “Stardust,” his nickname for her.  Instead of leaving with suitcases of money, Han risked his life to save Luke twice (at the end of A New Hope and on Hoth in Empire Strikes Back).  Darth Vader spent all of Empire Strikes back trying to find his son.  And Darth Vader ultimately found Luke by setting a trap—Vader knew that his son would prioritize his friends, so Vader captured and tortured Luke’s friends to cause Luke to come to him.  Leia and Chewbacca turned around to save Luke at Cloud City.  Lando refused to call off the attack on the second Death Star because he knew that his buddy Han would get the shield down.  Anakin came back to the light side to save Luke from the Emperor.  Rey turned down handfuls of rations instead of giving away BB-8.  A Star Wars hero never leaves without first making sure his friends are safe.  One of my favorite moments is when, during the escape from Hoth in Empire Strikes Back, the action stops for a few seconds to show Luke watching the Millennium Falcon fly by—Lucas and Kirshner made sure that we knew that Luke knew his friends were ok. Sometimes this prioritizing leads the characters to good outcomes, like finding the death star plans, Anakin’s redemption, etc.  Just as often, it leads to bad outcomes, like Anakin turning to the dark side, Luke jeopardizing his training, characters putting themselves in harm’s way, etc.  But it’s that this prioritizing is driving events that has made all generations connect so deeply with “Star Wars” for over four decades. In “The Last Jedi,” this prioritizing was buried deep beneath the surface, if it was even present at all.  Rey’s priorities were finding her place in the universe and protecting the Jedi order.  The other characters’ priorities were winning the war against the First Order.  And there is nothing wrong with this.  But it’s not “Star Wars.”",0

It felt very much like one of those stereotypically sexist sit coms where the Dad is an idiot and has to be told what to do by his clever wife.  Anyway, not very inspiring stuff.  I watched it with a largely male audience and it fell pretty flat.  We all just kind of shuffled out at the end having felt thoroughly lectured.  I mean there was even a bit in the middle which felt like part of educational video about mansplaining as one of the idiot male characters gets told off for being stupid :-(",0
757,"Are they serious? Didnt they learn from the 1st one that they need to push the story forward instead of making a C grade retelling the old stories? Wow, so glad I didnt pay to watch this.1st of all, the replacement characters remain unlikable because dialog and character building is poor. Attempts at humor are not funny nor charming, and the plot development might as well be written by someone with a high school level intellect. Plot holes abound in what is sadly yet another attempt at a retelling of the same story from the 80s... how you can make more plot holes in a story remake? Well they did. and they threw in a few eye rolls as Rei continues to be a lore destroying super Jedi that has more power than all the previous Jedi combined without even trying and barely any training. The sensitive storm trooper who didnt want to kill can now kill as many of his brethren while smiling. And oh apparently the rebel are now so dumb that they dont even consider looking around for an exit when they are trapped until the magnificent leader says they should look around and after asking Lea if its ok to look around with him... lol. Luke who is supposedly a master Jedi at this stage in his like, is now the guy who either died due to being out of shape or by a 3rd rate sith dork who lost storm trooper in melee combat. But he he sure fooled him for a minute to allow a group of worthless idiots escape... I guess this was his Obiwan moment when he went up against a full powered Darth Vader and had no chance of winning... except in Lukes case it was against a kitten with the IQ of a wet towel. They basically took a dump on all three original movies (and even the prequels if you care about those) as well as all the written lore that came after not to mention common sense. Luke got killed while projecting his hologram... why? To give the rebels time to escape when all they had to do was look around for an exit and shoot themselves out. But they were too dumb to figure that out. It took sacrificing Luke (who didnt actually need to die, he could have pulled out the second they started looking for an exit) and Rei to move a few rocks to do what would have been trivial with the guns and equipment the rebels had with them. And all this happened why? Because they ran out of gas lol.Good bye Star Wars.",0

759,"Wost ""Star Wars"" movie I have ever seen; and the last two were not exactly good. This movie proves that making PC a priority over writing makes a terrible movie. The good guys are on some sort of constant women/minority kaleidoscope cycle throughout the movie which just feels forced; particularly with the dull writing. Not sure what the PETA thing in the middle of the movie was; both absurd and irritating to me. The pre-Disney Canon has myriad epic tales about 100 times more interesting than this movie; maybe Disney needs to stop being ignorant, and use those to make actually good movies instead of pushing PC liberal socialist agendas in lieu of actual Star Wars.",0

763,"I'm a huge star wars fan.I love sci/fi and stars wars is one of the reasons why.. I was very hyped and exited to see this....but the whole ""Disney owned"" came along....It's by far the worst star wars movie ever, and the most boring as well..The potential of old and new characters, all to waste.. No epic Jedi training, No epic High Master Jedi Luke action (oh right we saw him milking a space cow,also we see a terrible astral projection ""fight"" with Kylo that brings him to death...JESUS) , terrible villain character progress(Kylo ren,no one feels scared,threatened or feared at all).. Failed attempts of humor and the usuall recycled motives and space scenes. A lot of scenes like Fin's where boring and others where totally out of star wars tone. So the result is: 1)The epic old characters are gone without grace and also without even been ""used"" propperly 2) The new ones are boring and hollow, some of them are gone as well allready, like Supreme leader Snoke (what a joke) 3)Forget the Jedi/Sith theme 4)There are new creatures like Porgs, so Disney can become even richer from toys to keep paying the critics and butchering every epic/historic franchise along the way.. The script was clear: Destroy star wars, any way possible..",0
764,"An utter character assassination on Luke Skywalker. It was like that episode of South Park with Spielberg and Lucas doing unspeakable things to Indiana Jones, but worse. This went on for two and a half snooze-inducing hours. Boring and inconsequential subplots that have no relation to the main conflict. Extensive cross-cutting. Cheap humor at the expense of the lore. Rey's journey is bland as a shaved potato. Waste. Hubris. Idiocy. No answers or respect for the past films. No understanding of mythology. Tone-deaf dialogue and boring direction. Lazy cinematography and choreography. This is the worst Star Wars film and I am done with Disney Star Wars. It's no longer canon to me and this is the last time I'm paying to them in theaters. Give me 200 million dollars and I would have made a far better movie than this piece of trash. The Porgs were cute, though. Oh and check out my essay on Medium called ""The Last Jedi: On the Character Assassination of Luke Skywalker"" (I can't link it here, they'll delete my review again).",0
765,This movie was an abomination! It is completely full of plot holes and doesnt even try to be consistent with the previous Star Wars mythology!I am so extremely disappointed with this pile of garbage! Have these writers ever seen a previous Star wars movie? Disney totally took a huge dump on my childhood!Who was Snoke? Why was he even in the movie if you just kill him off so easily? Why is Rey so good at EVERYTHING that took Luke THREE movies to get good at? Seriously this movie is AWFUL! Thanks for killing Star Wars Disney!,0

768,"Originally I liked this movie, but after some thoughts, the movie leaves a very bad taste in my mind.  Something is just fundamentally wrong with the story.  It seems that a lot of people have this kind of experience.  Now why is that?  Most films do not do that, why this one does?  I think this is something the writers of later Star Wars films need to seriously consider.Now I will offer my 2 cents as to why that is.  But first realize that it’s not just the hardcore fans that may not like this movie.  I am a fan, but not a hardcore one.  I only watched Star Wars movies and nothing else (no books, animation, lore etc), probably like most people.  The reason is more fundamental than the SW universe itself.Might contain spoilers.The writer tries very hard to tackle many themes in this movie, and he/she failed in many of them.  Let’s take a look at 2 of them:The Force is For Everyone / Everything: Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with this idea, and it does not violates the stories of previous Star Wars films (there were many Jedi/Sith, and Obi-wan also explained it to Luke in similar ways etc).  But the problem is: to use/harness something, one should require to  WORK for it, even if they are talented.  It’s like writers need to learn and practice how to write, engineers need to learn math and science, even talented Mozart need to learn from very young age about violin & piano, and Jedi needs to learn about the force and practice using it.  But in this movie, people can use & harness something so great without learning & practicing.  That just strays tooooooo far away from people’s everyday experience, and when this happens, people will feel some kind of fundamental inconsistency (Mary Sue etc), and start to feel that this is a bad story.Flawed Heroes: This is another theme the movie tries to develop in several plot lines, but failed.  Once again, there is nothing wrong with this idea, and flawed heroes, tragic heroes, legend vs reality theme has been tackled in previous SW films.  However, when you have characters that act in ways that do not follow common sense, you need to clarify it somehow.  And when you have an established character that did something so fundamentally against what they were...it just does not work.  Flawed heroes do not mean a fundamental change in characters, it just meant that heroes have BOTH vice and virtue as well.  There might be many other failed themes, but these are 2 I can think of now.  The writers of SW really need to think about what kind of story are they trying to tell, instead of trying and failing all over the place.",0
771,"Terrible writing. Dues ex machina everywhere. Can't express my disappointment. Killed off story's setup by force awakens,  and completely betrayed likes character. Carrie Fisher is both the best and worst part. Best acting worst portrayal. She's basically super girl.",0
772,"Reading through the media’s reaction to The Last Jedi I get the impression that I, as a star wars fan, am not allowed to have an opinion on this star wars movie. “You don’t get it” they say smugly- it’s a new direction. A new direction, I guess, that involves reinventing established characters, reinventing an established universe, and destroying established lore? “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to” says Kylo Ren, and I absolutely believe this is what Rian Johnson wanted to do. Yoda destroys the Jedi tree because it’s not the point of the Jedi religion, apparently. He does this while laughing at Luke remember - no respect for the Jedi heritage, the sacrifice of their ancestors, or even some basic respect for preserving history – no, the agenda is to destroy it all and start from scratch. What kind of people usually adopt this approach?This “Reinvention” borders on the petty. JJ Abrams has set up a fascinating and mysterious villain in Snoke –  but this doesn’t suit the agenda, so he is killed – easily and stupidly by an immature apprentice who was just born better apparently. So into the trash with the enormous amount of training and effort that mastery of the force demands - Rey has no teacher and yet she’s just as strong as Kylo. So complete is Rian Johnson’s vision that he is not content to stop with reinventing Star Wars. American storytelling has relied heavily on the brash, aggressive young warrior for generations, and Poe Dameron is certainly that man. He is skillful, courageous and knows when to take risks – exactly the kind of soldier a desperate rebellion needs. At the start of the film we see him lead an assault which costs the rebellion dearly – kind of like the battle of Scarif in Rogue One. Heroism, sacrifice, perseverance against the odds - with the incredible outcome that a terrifying First Order weapon is destroyed, the Fleet is able to escape …and Poe is demoted and chastised?Of course it’s not enough that he is shamed – he must be taught obedience - Poe is humiliated as he struggles to save the rebellion - is kept in the dark by his command and is ultimately shot by Leia. The lesson is obvious: The western warrior archetype is a fool with his head in his cockpit, motivated only by the selfish desire for glory. So much for the western storytelling tradition. See also: the contempt in Luke’s voice when he says “a legend” to Rey, before he walks away from everything his younger self fought for. See also: Finn’s brave self-sacrifice to defend the rebellion, denied by Rose in the most staggeringly senseless act of the whole movie. Fortunately a magic super girl -a heroine who has achieved incredible power, not by self introspection, sacrifice, life experience, or sincere effort, but by literally doing nothing - is on hand to save everyone from the consequences of their awful decisions. It also helps that enough of the rebellion was senselessly murdered that the remainder can comfortably fit aboard one small freighter.So Rian killed the past - and what did he have as a replacement? Stupid jokes, cute critters, cast diversity and storytelling incompetence.",0
774,"The last Jedi is a bad movie: it is horribly written, full of plotholes, and the lack of character developpement is astonishing. It is also a treason of the Star Wars Universe.

How could someone make such stupid mistake...- What was purpose of not telling Poe plan??? Thanks God captain gender studies is dead.- Luke character development is so wrong from the start... Luke always was the one who kept hope alive. He would never abandon his friends... But The most stupid part was Yoda laughing on destroying Jedi temple...- Snoke development is fuc*** joke.

779,"I did not think Rian Johnson could screw up this badly. It is a mystery to me how he can consider himself a Star Wars fan. Perhaps what he really means is that he was a fan of Star Wars action figures, because that's what this movie feels like--a child playing with the figures, smashing them together, throwing them across the room. Having a ball of a time with them and yet, not understanding any of the characters they represent.

785,"I will attempt to keep this review spoiler-free. I saw this movie on saturday. I came out of the cinema feeling conflicted. Last Jedi continues Rey's personal journey towards becoming a jedi, sheds light on Kylo Ren's past, and shows the resistances continuing plight against the war machine of the first order. Unfortunately the way the movie does this, does not sit well with me. The movie is too enamored at pulling the rug out from under viewers expectations. It is one continuing sequence of plot twists and turns, most of the time for no particularly good reason. By doing this too much, it manages to undermine the emotional value of its characters and action. Most of the time I don't feel like cheering for the heroes, or being excited about what happens to them next, since they are mostly unlikeable and unrelatable. For example Laura Dern's character comes out of nowhere and establishes herself as unlikeable with the first words that come out of her mouth, so I am not at all interested in her ultimate fate despite it being a major event. Somebody might be excited by the terrific visual effects, but I'm not, especially since the whole fleet chase is utterly ridiculous in its unbelievability. The movie also has several utterly wasted and shallow characters and scenes that fall flat. Such as poor Phasma, who could have been entirely cut from the movie and nobody would have noticed. Benicio Del Toro's character is nothing but a shallow plot device, and his screentime can be calculated in seconds. He also has no redeeming qualities that would make us root for him. He comes, does his plot thing, and leaves. We forget him instantly. The porgs are more annoying than funny, and I'm not a fan of the ham-fisted vegan message of Chewbacca scene. There is also too much negativity in the movie to make it really feel 'heroic' or 'epic'. Everything the main characters do, is failure in one form or another. This, coupled with the director's pathological need of surprising the viewers, is not really enjoyable to watch, sorry.  Yes, this follows the SW formula of trilogies, where the middle chapter puts the heroes through their darkest times, but too much is too much. There is simply not enough to like about the movie. Speaking of failures, the worst crime the movie commits is not telling the story of Luke Skywalker. By this I mean the events that happened between return of the Jedi and this film. You'd imagine that after fans waited 30 years for Luke to kick ass as a Jedi master, we would be treated to at least some. I am not opposed to what happened to Luke in this movie. The scenes were cool and appropriate. The problem are the things that remained untold, because Luke's entire life after destruction of the first death star appears to be a failure. I guess it maintains with the movies ultimate downer theme.  The one thing that does work in this movie, is Rey and Kylo and everything related to them. Kylo Ren's story and his interaction with Rey is very interesting and I look forward to seeing what happens to them next. However Rey and Kylo remain almost entirely detached from the rest of the movie. You could have removed Kylo and Rey from the movie and everything between resistance and first order would have still happened. The whole movie is fragmented in this way and I don't like it. Kylo and Rey story are the only positive thing about the movie, so its not a total loss. (However I wish we could've made without the obligatory shirtless scene; which is so predictable now its almost a meme. Thor did it mere weeks before in Thor Ragnarok so its even more blatant)There is also the thing that Last Jedi continues to copy the original trilogy (particularly empire strikes back) pretty blatantly, unfortunately I can't go into specifics without introducing spoilers.",0
786,"Johnson's take on George Lucas' universe is at once both bold and new, but also in conflict with JJ Abrams' characters and, at times, even itself. Major characters and events from TFA are ignored or reinterpreted and this proves to be both the film's greatest strength and weakness. This is a great star wars story wrapped in an inconsistent tone and a painfully awkward relationship with the Force Awakens.",0
787,"I couldn't stand that this movie was turned into a giant political statement. The whole movie felt like it existed just to push agenda.

792,"This movie was a terrible movie in the main arc of Star Wars. If these are direct sequels to 1,2,3,4,5,6 then they completely undermine and ruin characters from those movies. The end of this film leaves Episode 9 basically nowhere to go and no characters left to care about. Why were people super excited for Star Wars The Force Awakens? Was it Poe Dameron or Finn or Rey that had them really excited? No. It was Han, Luke, and Leia back in a new story. Yes, it was cool that we were getting new characters, but the core of the excitement was seeing the end of the story for our favorites. The Force Awakens had problems, but the new characters introduced a lot of fun new mysteries and questions. Finn and Poe and Rey and Kylo were fun. Han and Chewie felt like Han and Chewie and when Han died it was like a kick in the nuts because it was so beautiful to have him back.Last Jedi has none of that. Luke is insufferable and is sulking on the island being a dick to Rey for most of the movie making her boring and him boring. It turns out that after Return of the Jedi Luke went to train a group of Jedis and failed when Kylo went nuts. Then he hid on an island for the rest of his life. So the big hero of Star Wars basically accomplished absolutely nothing with his life. In the end he shows up as a jedi hologram to fight Kylo Ren as a distraction for the resistance to pile on the Millennium Falcon and get away. Then he dies. It was a cool fight, but what a waste of Luke Skywalker as a character. He's gone now and we never get to see him as a badass master that's likable and fun for an entire movie. What a waste. Luke's death should have been in Episode 9 if they were going to do it.Further, they faked out Leia's death and then let her live by having he blasted into space, freezing, and then Superman flying herself back into the ship somehow. What the **** And she lived through the end of the movie. What a waste. Now for Episode 9 there are no original trilogy characters that are left. Which would be great if any of the new characters were awesome or there was a big mystery left or conflict ahead. Is there?Rey's parents are...no one. That was kind of a neat reveal because it says anyone can be a force wielder. There is no one left to teach her how to be a Jedi though she seems able to just kind of know everything on her own (which is dumb). Snoke it turns out is also no one and he's dead. What a waste there. Kylo Ren is angry and angsty and dumb. He's a blunt instrument with no cunning and no cleverness now leading the First Order. Finn spent the movie with a new character Rose and together made the prospect of watching paint dry seem fun. They had no chemistry and had nothing interesting to do. Their jaunt on a casino world was insufferable. Finn almost sacrificed himself at the film's end and that might have been a great move for his character. But, he lived so expect more boring stuff in Episode 9.Captain Phasma continues to be a character that fans talk about and theory about, but I don't understand why. In two movies we've learned nothing about her other than that she has a shiny suit and keeps fighting Finn. BB-8 and the Porgs are honestly more well developed characters than Finn, Rose, Phasma. That's pathetic. It became really clear how bad Finn and Rose were when Benicio Del Toro's character DJ showed up with an actual personality. Here was a fun character played by an actor with life! How refreshing. He gave the tedious movie a kick in the nuts, but then was gone too soon.Admiral Holdo. Worthless. Terrible performance. Why kill Admiral Ackbar and give command to Holdo. Yeah, her lightspeed jump to destroy the Snoke ship at the end was cool, but why did she delay so long in doing it AND imagine if Ackbar did it. It would have been a beautiful end for that character.The film ends with the ENTIRE resistance fitting onto the Millennium Falcon after literally no one in the universe would come to help them. Does the universe prefer the First Order? Seems so. Luke, Leia, and Han defeated the Empire like 40 years ago. And then...nothing changed. This movie effectively made the resistance look moronic for continuing. This is another huge problem for the movie. Lucas created a universe that felt huge. With planets and people's everywhere. Where are all those people and planets? Rogue One had fun characters and planets and people. This has nothing and it suffers for it. Hell, I'd take some Episode 2 political **** just to explain why the fight against the Empire/First Order has been at a standstill for 40 years.Disney ruined Star Wars with The Last Jedi. I don't care at all to see the conclusion of this saga or where these characters end. What a bummer, especially after TFA left me excited for more Star Wars where the prequels didn't.Edit: Two years later and this has only gotten worse. What a terrible film",0

Massive plot holes riddling the story, no character or motivation development and a Mary Sue character at the heart of it all. All this i was expecting based on episode 7, what i wasnt expecting was to be bored. The story is lackluster and ultimatey pointless. Imagine the longest, slowest most boring car chase scene youv watched, and extend it to 2 and a half hours of movie and youl have some idea of what Episode 8 has in store.Overall a marginal improvement in some respects on episode 7, but thats not saying very much really.Disapointing!!!",0
795,"The Last Jedi was an abysmal mess.  Storylines that went nowhere, underdeveloped characters, horrible misplaced jokes, and just a whole lot of nonsensical garbage.  Leia floating like some frozen Mary Poppins space angle, Snoke (whoever he was) getting sliced in half (hey look your shoes untied!). Rey going down a hole, maybe to the Darkside, but no just repeating finger snaps, a plan foiled because Finn parked on the beach, some stuttering character who was central to the plot then not, Luke milking some space sea cow,  a terrible light saber scene with Ren, Rey and imperial guards, on and on and on it was awful.  Anyone who found this movie even remotely viewable could not have had anything invested into it.  And then there is the way they wrote out Luke.  There aren't enough words to say how disappointing it was to see Luke Skywalker after 30 some years, the ultimate hero of a generation of kids, written out so poorly.  This movie was criminally bad.  The only reason I gave it a one (1) was because it was Carrie Fisher's last movie.  Otherwise it would be zero (0).",0
796,"So let's get the good out of the way first.  This movie is gorgeous.  I really mean drop dead, omg, praise jeebus gorgeous.  The sets are amazing, the effects are stellar, and the musical score really sets the mood.It's a very shiny veneer to cover up the dog **** plot.  Whoever wrote this needs to have his writing card revoked.  Seriously.  Most of the plot revolves around an 18 hour stand off by which two *space ships* are trying to catch the other.  The rebels are trying to flee, the order is trying to catch.  They can both see each other but neither can really do more than spout platitudes.  Why is it like this?  Why can't one ship simply burn a bit more fuel to catch up?  Why can't they hyperspace one ship ahead and set up some kind of pincer attack on the rebels?  **** you that's why.  The rest of the plot is patently idiotic as well.  Rey and Luke kumbayaing on some distant planet but never really accomplishing anything.  Finn and some diversity hire going to a casino to *save the animals man* and wasting everyone's time.  I had high hopes for Kylo Ren to.  After the first movie I was one of the few that really liked Adam Driver and his portrayal of Ren as a tortured soul sort of juvenile sith/jedi.  In this one they just decided to make him a whiny brat.  I was even more disappointed in Rey.  Gone is the optimist fun loving, bright eyed Rey from the first movie.  Instead we get yet another mewling and crying Katniss character to act as the *strong female lead*.  I'ma close with one last criticism.  Leia flies in space.  Yes, superman flying in space.  That happens.  They had myriad ways to let Carrie Fisher die a dignified death during this cluster**** of a movie, but instead they choose to have her fly around in space.  Rian Johnson, please, for the love of god, go back to shooting indie films with your boy JGL and leave the big budget stuff to people who respect the canon.",0
797,"What a complete total waste of time. This movie was utter sh*t. Disney has completely disrespected the originals and concocted a big money grab for their pockets. I have never written a review on a movie however I feel I need to for this. If you loved the originals, you probably fell in love with watching Luke, Leia, Han Solo, Chewie, R2-D2 and C3PO. They had prominent roles that heavily contributed to the feeling of Star Wars. We fell in love with the characters. I didn't feel attached to the characters in TLJ. Felt as if everyone was thrown into a grinder to let them blend as best they could. Forced humour just took the piss. They killed off Luke as if he was nothing. He barely played a role. Leia, flying through space like superman? WTF? She wasn't trained in the force yet she can do that? Snoke can't even see/feel a lightsaber moving next to him and he's some super powerful force wielding bad guy? Who is Snoke? Cheap Porgs? Cant Disney come up with quality ideas for battles.? The end scene of this felt like Empire Strikes Back on Hoth, Disney tried hard here, it really did. It sucked. They did the same thing with TFA, with the attack on the StarKiller like A New Hopes attack on the Death Star and Return of the Jedi, where Lando and the X-Wing fighter fly into the centre to take out the Death Star from within. TFA wasn't the best, however it left the door open for an incredible sequel. TLJ could have answered a lot of questions. There is so much crap to write its unbearable to think about. Sh*t acting...Throw a touch of ""cultural diversity"" in. Asian girl and a black man run around trying to save everyone. There is another post on MC, very well said, along the lines of, all white men are bad and women are superior. Almost felt as if there was a feminist movement going on. What about a send off for Carrie Fisher in the end credits like Fast and the Furious did for Paul Walker?Disney you have destroyed it. No doubt you lined your pockets deep. In the end thats all that mattered to you.",0
798,"I'm still mystified by what I saw.  The movie differs so much in tone, is so sprawling, and at least in the case of one plotline is completely unoriginal.  If you're going to steal a plotline, at least do what Abrams did in Episode VII and steal a previous Star Wars plotline.  The jarring changes in tone, even within scenes, is off-putting to say the least.  The arbitrariness behind how the director, producer, and writers discarded what was built in Ep VII is worthy of pause.  It's clear they want to take the series in a new direction, but the casualness with which they are discarding tradition and story is mind-boggling.  Even putting all that aside, the viewer will be frequently lost as the film bounces around from one scene to the next, wondering if anything of significance will finally move the story forward.Wait for the Blu-Ray, if you insist on watching.",0
799,"Absolute garbage. One of the worst script I've ever seen in sci-fi films. It's full of plotholes, inconsistencies and idiotic characters. Not to mention violating even the simplest laws of physics like neglecting weightless in space or surviving in space without a spacesuit.I feel really sorry for Hamill that he had to play that character, what they've done with Luke Skywalker is outrageous. With age comes wisdom? That's not about him in this movie, in Episode VIII with age comes obtusity, cowardice and lunacy. Yes that's how Luke Skywalker depicted there as obtuce timid lunatic who looks like he needs immidiate medical treatment.If you are interested who's Snoke, why Rey has force abilities, why Ren suddenly turned into dark side, you will find no answers, moreover Snoke seems to be removed from the storyline being killed like an idiot in the middle of the film, this is probably one of the ''surprise twists'' creators were talking about.There are no positives sides in the film except for decent play of Hamill and del Toro. Many people say about stunning visuals, but come on, who you can surprise with visuals in 2017? Modern technologies allow to make pretty good visuals even in mediocre sci-fi, let alone such expensive works like Star Wars, so this is no longer a feature you can brag about.",0
800,"It's Bad, slow plot, unuseful and void characters, big plothole and no sensation of epicness. Please stop. Why there is humor parts ? and why the humor part make this film so ""guardian of the galaxy"" ?",0
801,Had to create an account to get this off my chest and move on. The plot in this movie is absolute nonsense. I have never seen a sequel outright pretend that the previous movie never even happened. Everything TFA built up in 2015 TLJ just outright avoided in an attempt to be unpredictable. This unpredictability absolutely invalidates the story up to this point and spits in the face of anyone who was actually invested in the Star Wars saga up to this point.,0
802,"Before you call me a neckbeard fanboy, I just want to point out that I'm a girl and tired of these strong, badass female leads (like Rey) dominating Hollywood. The Last Jedi happens to be another addition to this nauseating trend. Here is my review: The Last Jedi is a lackluster, disappointing movie. Horrendous flat characters, unnecessary side plot, and contains poor dialogue. Yup, that’s Disney’s Star Wars for you! Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy definitely ruined our beloved, special franchise. If you don't see the flaws in this film, I assume you prefer quantity, not quality, Star Wars movies. 0/10 from me.",0
803,"Disappointed is the word I would use to describe this movie :-( Too much time spent with Rey and Luke at the Jedi Temple, which amounted to nothing in the end. Some good humour,disappointing end, didnt like the Fin/Rose storyline, especially when Fin was 'obsessed' with Rey, but magically forgets her at the end! Pointless 'codebreaker' storyline, ridiculous encounter with Fin and Phasma, which had a shameful ending! Was expecting more from Luke..... No where near as good as the more superior Rogue One, which had, breathtaking scenery,script and actiing; sadly which TLJ does not. Rogue One, then Force Awakens, then TLJ in order of best of the recent three.So gutted, dont know if I will bother rushing to see the others. I've been a fan since the beginning :-(",0
805,"I've sat through it twice, ignoring all the lore that came before it this movie does no favors for itself.  It fails to push the galaxy in any direction.  One giant stalemate that goes nowhere.  If this movie didn't have ""Star Wars"" in it's title we would have all laughed at it's terrible production value and moved on to the next thing.",0
806,"Easily the fattest turd to have ever slipped through Rian Johnson's anus. How anyone can give it anything above a 5 speaks volumes to how there will never be a short supply of idiots. The treatment of Luke and his legacy is shameful. People dare to say it's good for being bold. Being bold for the sake of being bold is good? REALLY? Then why isn't Donald Trump the most popular politicain in history? This movie is indefensible. Those who do it are part of the problem. Disney has killed this franchise. Between this travesty of a movie and the recent mistreatment of Star Wars by EA, this franchise is on its way out. Millions of fans cried out in terror. And were suddenly silent.",0
807,"Very weak story! Force Awakens was just a weak unoriginal rehash of A New Hope and now Last Jedi is just simply weak. Why is the rebellion even weaker than ever when they defeated the empire?! How is the New Republic destroyed by blowing up a single system when the Star Wars universe is 100,000 plus of systems? Where did The New Order come from? Answer is some Disney idiots got a hold of the story. I hate everything about these episodes 7 & 8!!",0
808,"I really disliked the movie. It's that bad, and it's clearly polarizing because it's ""Star Wars"" and because it feels totally disconnected from the original movies. Even TFA was more thematically coherent than this hot mess.I personally feel that the movie was out of tune with the rest of the saga, I didn't like the need for jokes every now and then, for useless and uninteresting plot arcs, for the eulogy that ""just trying"" is enough, and that you don't have to aim for greatness, but just being stubborn is okay, even if your decisions lead to thousand of deaths: it's all fine, you are a good looking actor! All is good!Kylo Ren is the usual emo kid (that's probably why this movie is liked by this hipster generation), Rey is - without any explanation - one of the most powerful force user in the galaxy without the need for a training. Luke is just an old bitter hermit who can remote fight another powerful user and trick him, the same user that just tricked Snoke and killed him. Wait, what? Consistency, where art thou?Maz reached out to provide a ""contact"" for a useless arc that just lead to a lot of people dying, but yeah Finn got a love interest in Rose so everything is fine, alright audiences?Leia flying? For **** sake, what did you have in mind, screenwriters? Do you think that moment was more powerful than the princess maybe dying for real, carrying consequences?Instead let's kill Ackbar off-screen, just to make a nod to older audiences.What really puzzles me is the fact that a lot of people are not liking it and that the main theme is ""they are trolls"": maybe the ones that didn't like the movie are the most vocals, ok - but again, Star Wars is an iconic saga: there are people considering ****ing football a religion, so I don't see much of a difference. I really didn't like the movie, so I can't put a good vote to it. Let's see what will emerge in time, but I doubt this movie will stand the test of time. Beautiful visuals, but it's this movie that instead troll the public.Ad maiora.",0
809,"So this was not only a bad movie, it was a bad SJW movie as well. All the men are imbeciles and all the women are strong and empowered. I give up on Star Wars, episodes 7 and 8 need to be stricken from history.",0
810,"Did not like it as much as I would have liked to like before watching.Felt like Episode 7.5, a filler. Not a full story or resolution. Overall made well, directed well but many plot-points exist, things that I don't agree with and neither the fans (check reddit). I had high hopes, but movie under deliveredThis movie deserves 1/10. It's a slap to fans' face and disgusting humour-injection throughout the movie.",0
811,"I wasted my time and money. Next EP9, Use ""hyperspace attack"" to destroy each others. Don't need new fighter, bomber or anything else. 10 secs battle scene and rest full of love story.",0
812,"This movie could have been easily a decent movie. If it would’ve followed the elements of good storytelling.  Rian Johnson is a moron. He is a fool and a dimwit. Simply put, he is a simpleton whose incompetence to tell a story, let alone a good one will forever be the reason he is a failure. Rian deserves an amazing F- for not doing what kids can do. You can't make any movie, let alone a Star Wars movie without holding onto the basics of 'telling' a good story. YOU cannot make any movie without having a decent script, some decent direction and a decent understanding of how to tell it. You can't have Plot holes let alone hundreds of them. All stories, books and comics follow the ‘basic’ concepts of ""STORYTELLING."" It is not DIFFICULT to accomplish the ordinary task of telling a Story. Small Children and young Teens could've told a better Star Wars story!The movie bombed beyond bombed because of money, Rian’s ego, and George Lucas’ weakness for selling out; Episode VIII goes down as the worse movie in Star Wars, worse than the prequels because Rian J. couldn't tell a story. Rian J. couldn’t tell a fairy tale to save his Life. Even George Lucas got storytelling right regardless of his C.G.I. dependence. Rian Johnson will forever be the guy who killed Star wars, killed its Mythology and Killed the World that Millions and Millions of Fans loved...because he simply wasn’t a good story teller...That is what everyone is so upset about. There was no story here, which is incredible because J.J. Abrams handed one to him on a silver platter. All he had to do was continue what was started and tell the story. Instead of continuing what was started, Rian J. burned everything that was set up and then tossed it out the window; along with all Star Wars common sense, mythology and force rules. Star Wars lore has been forever changed! It is now mixed with our own universe (Godspeed?), marvels universe (too much slapstick comedy)and Lucas’. And I don't even want to go down the road of Politics. NOW STAR WARS is POLITICAL! While Disney will deny believing this movie was a failure, because a few hundred puppet critics says so, (Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic) it will in the future. They won’t take into account the nearly 120k audience critics that have given this movie a horrible 54%; and that's only 5 days. It falls everyday down 1%. Just watch that numbers plummet this Christmas weekend. I predict Disney will look upon this decision, to trust Rian J. with The Last Jedi, as THEE epic failure in launching this new era of Star Wars movies. Shame on you forever Rian! How you simply could not do what children can do. Also, the criticism is just getting started. It’s not even been a week. Can you imagine years of this? The prequels are still getting heat 12-17 years later. And yours tops them all because of your lack of skills telling a story, not the lack of story. (Abrams gave you a story) This movie is yours for life; I can’t wait to see how your future career path spirals downhill because of your epic failure. Why is it so bad? Because Rian J. created the worst Star Wars movie that could've possibly been told -and it didn't have to be. That’s the heart breaking truth for everyone. It didn't have to be TOLD SO POORLY....Nobody cares that you went in the direction you did, nobody cares that you don't understand how the Force works or how you portrayed Luke so inaccurately and killed him in the most unimpressive way.....Everyone expected and accepted all of this in Disney’s new Star Wars... It's how you told the Story Rian, it's you couldnt tell the story. That will forever be the reason you failed. I hope they fire you in the coming months, I hope you realize just how great a monstrosity this was, and I hope the movie Gods blacklist you, curse and condemn you to Hollywood Hell!",0
813,Initial reaction was just kinda meh. Now that I've had a day to think about Last Jedi I can say I HATE this movie. Disney was so impressed with this movie they gave Rian Johnson control of an entire trilogy of Star Wars films? What were they thinking?!,0
814,GAAAARBAAAAGE!!! Skywalkers are what STAR WARS is about! Plot holes galore. No cohesion in this trilogy. You would of thought they sat down and talked about the damn story and made sure it made sense first.,0
815,"This movie was Disney's order 66 to destroy the Star Wars saga and all the emblematic characters of it. The best they can do is apologize and make episode 8 again and that this was a mistake, (Mark hamill was right.)",0
816,"The movie commits two of the greatest sins of Star Wars, 1. It is boring 2. It is stupid. The effects are great, the acting is solid, the plot is just slow and above else, stupid. For example (I'll be vague to avoid spoilers) if you can blow up half of the enemy ships by doing a certain act, why don't you do it at the start of the event? This happens over and over again. The saddest part of this is that it will make a ton of money, and they will do a sequel. The worst part about it is that the director was green lit for 3 other Star Wars movies. He needs to stop. Now. All the good will from Rouge 1 is gone.",0
817,"I was really disappointed in this movie. Just sh*t on the whole series up til now. Even as a stand alone movie, if I didn't go into with all of the back story, it was still very mediocre.

818,"5 star for the visual, casting, acting, and sound.  -5 star for the worse-then-jar-jar dialogue, self-contradicting continuity and shallow bullet-point characterization.  I hope after all the greedy and political mofo milk this franchise to the bone and die, true star wars fans can take over and replace this garbage with the original canon.  Jaina Solo and Mara Jade are vastly superior female protagonist than the random op girl (forgot the name... that's how bad the character is. lol) that poor Daisy Ridley is stuck with.  Force Awaken was at least trying to create its own mythos...  this one completely trashes everything including Force Awaken's story while adding nothing.  Boycotting the last movie.",0
819,"Worst Star Wars movie ever. They literally destroyed the entire Saga. The characters are empty, Finn is worst than Jar Jar. If you are a real Star Wars fan, YOU WOULD NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE !!! don't give money to this people that destroyed everything. Not even George went so far with the prequel.",0
820,"I can't believe this is where we are. Me giving a 1/10 for a Star Wars movie, a franchise that helped raise me, a franchise that I could basically forgive anything, and give my money to, how can a company be so disconnected from it's core base, and ruin the franchise. It would seem like it would be an impossible task, as so many people in the past has managed to create great content for the Universe, whether it be fan made movies, or video games. I'm just dumbstruck, the people who enjoy this movie must be bereft their common sense and somehow be on drugs to enjoy it.George Lucas created star wars for 12 year olds, disney created star wars for social justice warriors and stoned hippies. Star Wars was a subject without political agendas, it was something anyone, anywhere no matter what your religion, your political standpoint, your race or your birthplace. Everyone could connect to star wars, and there was a unity, a bond between all humans in that.This, this is not that! This breaks that bond! This makes it us vs you! Those of us with common sense who can see the **** we're being served, and  those of you who think what you're being served is sweet chocolate.Star Wars is dead, long ling the evil coorporation empire disney, who ruined a strong and bonding bond for all mankind.",0
821,"WORST STAR WARS SO FAR. Terrible movie on it's on it's own without the star wars name attached. So extremely slow and boring in the beginning, middle, and end with suprisingly almost no space or ground battle you have NOT already seen in the trailers. Jumping around characters and irrational plots. Blasting political innuendo into every other scene.SPOILERS:Why didn't part of the FO fleet jump to light speed ahead of the resistance fleet? ??",0
822,"Lets face it, a lot of high scores are due to nostalgia and the initial buzz of seeing a sequel to the much beloved original trilogy.Just the title crawl and the music alone gave me goosebumps. I was constantly on the edge of my seat because I was so invested in this world and its characters that I grew up with, it had nothing to do with good story writing. I had the same feeling for the Force Awakens, when I first saw it I thought it was the most amazing film of all time, it was a sequel to a movie I had been waiting for more than a decade. But after the initial buzz wore off and I had time to reflect, i thought it was a pretty average movie. The excitement of seeing the OT characters, environments, and props masked the movie's weaknesses. The same goes for The Last Jedi, quite frankly it just didn't feel like an official Star Wars film, it felt like a fan fiction.For all the die hard OT fans, imagine if a good sequel trilogy was released shortly after the OT, i just cant fathom it resembling anything like the sequel movies we got (not in terms of production, but in terms of the overall direction of the story). I understand why Mark Hamill said he ""fundamentally disagreed with everything about Luke Skywalker's character"" in the Last Jedi. The optimistic Jedi who wouldn't give up on Darth Vader contemplated killing his nephew who hadn't even turned to the dark side yet?  In terms of the story and production, it didn't fit the setting and universe of Star Wars.I think a lot of the high review scores are due to nostalgia, strong attachment to the characters and universe of Star Wars, and a burning need to have quality sequels to a great franchise. Take away the bias and wishful thinking and think carefully about this movie, you will realize how disappointing and average it really was.",0
823,"Disappointing, cluttered movie with no sense of direction and waisted characters. I have read and written better fan fictions than this movie. Still visually stunning though. Good comedic moments and loved every scene with Luke and Rey. Good to see Mark Hammil in a new star wars movie where he actually talks.",0
824,"This movie is a slap in the face to all hardcore Star Wars fans. I enjoyed TFA but this is piece of garbage . Disney , I will not give you anymore of my money. After 30 years I’m done .",0
825,There wasn't any real point or worthy storyline to this movie. I also felt the new character selections to be weak and poorly chosen. Of course any Star Wars movie will get a big opening with lots of loyal viewers but this movie was flat out awful....,0
826,"So this movie fails primarily in the writing and story departments.  The acting is good, the budget is up on the screen, some jokes work.Some don’t, and the plot is nonsensical.  It’s too long and there’s easily 45mins of film you could cut that would make it better.  It does a deconstruction of Luke Skywalker and teaches him a valuable lesson with a Disney quote.  Nobody wants to see that.The biggest flaws, besides the plot that makes little sense, is how it mistreats the heroes and villains.  Luke and Rey are mishandled, Luke is given a hollow and contrived story.  He tries teaching Rey but it’s worthless.  He changes his mind cause he saw a video.  He dies cause the movie is over.  Rey is set up pretty good in the last movie and turns out to be a crazy liar in this movie.  How that makes her a hero I don’t know, it just makes her insane.Snoke is killed in a stupid way that makes him look weak.  Kylo is ultimately reduced to his worst traits, a sniveling brat making horrible decisions.  He gets tricked by something that shouldn’t have tricked him.  He keeps the backstabbing red headed general alive for quite literally no reason, in fact he should have every reason to murder him and elevate the next guy.Not speaking as a Star Wars fan, just as someone who cares about good writing, story, cohesive plots and solid filmmaking.  This isn’t it.  Consider the number of times the movie has BB8 outright murder people or save the heroes.  Consider the number of times the movie does plot twists just for plot twist sake.  Consider the number of times the movie dips directly into prequel territory with goofy, cartoony high-speed CGI “action sequences”.It needed a rewrite and reshoot, and cut nearly 1 hour.  2/10 might be too generous.",0
827,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I went in prepared for the worst. Somehow, they managed to exceed my expectations. This movie is horrible. I honestly can't think of a single good thing about it other than that the music (almost all of which is from earlier Star Wars films) and that it isn't a remake of The Empire Strikers Back. Besides that, there's almost nothing good about it. The pacing is terrible, and it jumps between scenes with completely different emotional tones and, despite being the longest running Star Wars movie ever, speeds through practically every scene. Extremely important story moments are covered in only a few minutes, while unimportant scenes seem to stretch on as long as possible. Most people I talked to had little idea what the plot even was, aside from the information provided by The Force Awakens. The plot makes no sense either, and would be avoided if the characters weren't complete idiots who make mind-numbly stupid decisions, such as hiring shady criminals in a dark alley to help them, or wanting to escape on ships that they know don't have weapons. There's also no explanation as to the current political situation, and it's unclear what's even happening in the Galaxy at large. It's not even clear who's funding the inexplicably recreated Empire, and it's not even clear if the New Republic still exists. Worst of all, everything was reset and everything that ever happened in the original movies means absolutely nothing now. Every victory every won by the Rebellion, every superweapon destroyed, every system liberated - are all meaningless. Han Solo returned to being a smuggler and divorced Leia and was murdered by his son in the most obvious trap imaginable, Luke Skywalker became a failure and ran away to pout on a deserted island and also ultimately died, and the New Republic the rebels fought and died to create was destroyed by in five minutes of screen time by a new Empire which is inexplicably strong enough to build a planet-sized superweapon which is now left to be opposed by a new Rebellion which itself will ultimately be destroyed when they inevitably make another trilogy. The writing is insulting. There's one scene where Leia is sucked into the vacuum of space and somehow survives floating through it for several minutes and pulls herself with the Force to her ship. The dialogue is filled with ""jokes"" which are always as out-of-place as possible. For example, there's one scene where the entire Resistance is evacuating where Leia says to C-3PO to ""wipe that nervous look off your face"", or something to that effect. Rey is still a flawless Mary Sue who, according to Yoda's force ghost, already knows everything contained in the entirety of Jedi scripture, while Luke Skywalker's character was completely ruined, and he went from leading the Rebellion to victory against the Empire and being set to recreate the Jedi Order to a failure who attempted murdering one of his students and burning down the original Jedi Temple. Yoda's ghost later shows up to burn down the temple for him through the Force, which begs the question of why force ghosts have never interacted with the physical world in such a way before, and so why Yoda doesn't just go kill Snoke himself, who wouldn't be able to fight back as Yoda is already a force ghost. Also, while Yoda is destroying the original Jedi scripture by doing this, he mocks it and says that Rey already knows everything contained in them, as noted above. The cinematography and directing are also terrible. Even though the sets and environments are beautiful, the camera seems to have no idea what it's supposed to be doing. It will randomly cut away from the characters for two seconds to the top of a mountain or something else nearby and cut immediately back to them as if nothing happened, and other times will cut between different characters, forward in time, or even to dreams or hallucinations without giving any indication that it switched to something else. The film also seems to have an obsession with randomly making things slow motion and silent during action scenes, which feels out of place in a Star Wars movie, extremely overused given its inclusion in seemingly every action scene, and also takes you out of a scene that would otherwise be engaging. Thank you for reading my review.",0
828,"If you're an intelligent person with good taste, you might find this movie hard to watch. It's the worst of all star wars films, and it feels like it's a completely different (awful) universe to the one the other films inhabit.

Either they did not try to tell a story, or we have to question the writer's intelligence. I do give them credit for a couple of very interesting ideas that disappeared like raindrops in a sea of stupidity.",0
836,"I waited 30 years to see my boyhood hero wield his light saber and all I got was a pathetic, depressed old man milking disgusting alien teets. This is the first Star Wars movie that I left feeling sad;  not because beloved characters died, but I came to realize the franchise has no interest in connecting the old with the new. Seriously, Luke deserved better. I had no emotional response to his death scene, just a bad taste in my mouth.  In terms of Snoke, Star Wars 7 did a fantastic job developing a shroud of mystery around him.  I feel the writer gave a giant middle finger to all the background theories out there by purposely killing him off with an amateur jedi trick without revealing one shred of a background story.  It seems like writer Riam Johnson is like Kylo Ren and wants nothing to do with nostalgic ideas of the past. Kill them all with no explanation and lets move on.",0
837,"This movie is an absolute disaster. From the very beginning, when a terrible actor playing a terrible character is sent in one X-wing to fight a star destroyer fleet, I started to worry. Then the screen writer (who obviously doesn't understand humour) decides to try and turn it into a comedy with that ""I can't hear you"" garbage I thought ""Oh no... What have they done"".... Then one of the biggest dreadnoughts in the galaxy is taken down by one bomber dropping bombs IN ZERO GRAVITY..... and it just goes nowhere but downhill from there. Leia turns into a dead flying witch, Finn fails in his search for a code breaker but luckily finds one in his prison cell (so badly written). BB8 driving an AT-ST (WTF), General Hux, and that STUPID ending with Luke projecting and then dying without explanation... This movie SUCKS",0
838,"This is the alien covenant of SW. We complained that The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope, so we got trolled with this one as revenge. Funny thing it is actually a bad copy of The Empire Strikes Back and the Return of Jedi with everything wrong.",0
839,"To quote Mark Hamill ""What a piece of junk!""Remarkable in it's stupidly conceived plot. Off color humor more suited to a low budget screwball comedy than something with the weight of star wars. Desecrated everything fans loved about the saga and fills the void with a far stupider premise.Unwatchable. In fact I wish I could unwatch this incomprehensibly trashy movie.",0
840,"It completely dumps on all of the established lore from Episodes 1-6 on how one becomes powerful with the Force.In the original trilogy it is established that even though he is the heir to one of the most powerful Force wielders to have ever existed, a being that was literally created by the Force, that Luke must undergo rigorous training to wield the Force. In Disney Wars all of this is jettisoned out the airlock. Rey has been repeatedly referred to as a ""Mary Sue"". To be fair this is a slightly misogynistic and not entirely accurately description. She could have very well been a male character and her arc still would have been completely unbelievable. The problem is that despite the fact that she has grown up on a backwater planet with no training she is somehow all powerful. She instantly knows how to weild a light saber, Force influence people, and leviatate objects with no guidance. All of this despite the fact that it has already been established that even Anakin the most powerful Force user to ever come along had many years of training in the Jedi Order to develop his skills. Yet she can pilot the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo, she can wield the Force better than Kylo Ren or even Luke for that matter. She ultimately has no character arc or character development of any kind because she is already complete when we first see her in TFA. Her character is the very definition of static and boring.The villains in Disney Wars are completely inept and bumbling and not at all menacing. Crying Ren is an angsty emo teen who looks like Napoleon Dynamite with a cape.(he should have just left the helmet on). He goes on and on about how his parents didn't love him enough and has comical temper tantrums that even cause his subordinates to not take him seriously. When Vader raged he would literally choke the life out of one of his bridge officers. They paid the ultimate price for their failures. Like I said before-- MENACING! General Sux is a punching bag who exists soley as a whipping boy for Snoke and Kylo Ren. Brienne of Tarth I mean Captain Phasma is a character that gets utterly owned by the heroes in TFA. She gives up the Starkiller Base codes with nary a struggle. She is then somehow welcomed back into the First Order and shows up in TLJ only to be completely owned again this time by Finn. She literally has about 3 minutes of screen time I think. What was the point in having her as a character? Snoke is a complete copy and paste of Palpatine and has no backstory. He is ultimately just a place holder in these movies. A guy who was waiting to be killed so that Napoleon Dynamite could take over the First Order. When your villains are not menacing and scary it kills any sense of suspense.The plot is basically non-sensical dues ex machina crap. The fleet is being chased by The First Order and is running out of fuel? Since when has that ever been an issue in these movies? So they spend the majority of the film on an extended chase scene that ended up being completely boring. Finn and Rose go to a Casino world where they are supposed to meet up with some code breaker that will get them on board the First Order's Dreadnought but then meet some random guy (Benecio Del Toro) and actually TRUST him! How stupid can they be?! Of course he ends up betraying them ultimately.This movie portrays Luke as a complete coward defying all characterizations of him established in previous episodes.. We are supposed to believe that Luke, a guy who immediately went to save his friends on Cloud City after having a Force premonition in ESB is now content to sit in a hut on an island while his friends and family are decimated by the First Order? Also we are supposed to believe that Luke, a guy who attempted to save his father from the dark side in ROTJ to the point that he laid down his arms and was prepared to self sacifice himself for the cause was going to murder his nephew because he felt the dark side dwelling in him? WTF? lt was a lousy and badly contrived characterization of Luke.Near the end of the film Admiral Purple Haired Wig saves the day by flying a cruiser into the First Order's Dreadnought in hyperspace which COMPLETELY OBLITERATES IT and most of their fleet. Guess that the Resistance should have just done that from the get go instead of stupidly letting their ships get picked off one by one. Oh and why the hell didn't they let Admiral Ackbar a known and beloved SW character make the sacrifice instead? At least then the scene would have had some emotional resonance.At the end Luke becomes One with the Force but why? How did he die at the end? Did he have a Force-related aneurysm? This is never explained. He just disappears into his robes ala Obi Won/Yoda style after doing astral Force projection across the galaxy. Lazy writing and plot holes you could pilot a Star Destroyer through. The Force is weak with this one. One point for good production values.",0
841,"The movie is absolutly terrible.Disney brutally murderes our most beloved childhood memories and has a laugh while doing so.(1) Our favourite heroes act totally out-of-character. Watch Rotj (Epsiode 6) before and you will see what I mean. It is just terrible to see what Disney has done to the #1 hero of my childhood (Luke Skywalker). I know understand why Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagrees with everything Rian Johnson (the director) has done to the character and I think it is an understatement.(2) The movie is spammed by over commercialized stupid humor. What might work in Marvel movies (of which i like most) has no place in Star Wars.(3) The story doesn't close any loose ends but creates even more.(4) The movie often shocks for the sake of shoking instead of going along with the story.(5) Star Wars was always conceived to be based on a steoretypical hero-saga and as a optimistic movie to teach moral ideals. This is simply not the case anymore it is littered with postmodern nihilism.(6) The Soundtrack is still John Williams, but we certainly know better from the Maestro.(7) The story is written in a way as to devalue and annihilate everything the protagonists of the first 6 movies have fought for. Like Disney would want to make people forget that there were even SW movies pre-Disney.(8) Disney/Kathleen Kennedy/LucasFilm promised for the last 3years that the whole point of rebooting the Canon (except for the 6 movies) is to make them more coherent which is a blatant LIE after this movie.(9)The acting was professional and the actors were really in their roles, too sad it was wasted on such a movie.(10) The movie has a few bigger plotholes, atleast one of them big enough to change the outcome of the complete movie during the first 20 minutes (hard to describe without spoilers) - and a smaller one regarding the geopoltical situation for exampleEpisode 9 would have to put so many things right and retcon so much to leave me with even the slightest interest in the franchise that it is almost impossible.I will take any future SW release with strongly reserved cautioness if at all.",0
842,"Warning, this is long and I want to get it off of my chest. Massive spoiler’s are to be found below.Major plot points built up in The Force Awakens are just thrown out without any regard for delivering a satisfying reveal to the audience. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars to take a large family to two movies and spent over four hours of my life watching their movies. This is poor story telling.The story telling sells out the importance of the previous six movies in a similar manner! The Jedi order is meaningless, and their legacy is not worth passing on. The previous battle against empire was all for nothing, and none of their sacrifices matter! This is bad story telling. Admiral Akbar had no reason to be in the film. Like everything else they name dropped him and he was there only to be killed off. Why even put him in the film at all?Snoke was useless and a buffoon. He was just a cartoon villain that cackled until he was effortlessly defeated by a brat. The character looked terrible in this movie too. Just a waste of time and money. Captain Phasma was completely wasted as a character. The character served a purpose yes, but the purpose would have been much better had Phasma been used to any effect at all. I feel bad for Daisy Ridley. I have no idea if she can act or not. Her character hasn’t had any development as she is going to succeed at everything that she tries. Rey has the depth of a wooden fence post. This is a problem with the story itself. Luke failed for two movies in a row before he got it right. Rey hasn’t really needed to learn anything. And she didn’t learn anything in this film either. Well she did learn one thing. She is an unimportant nobody and that’s it. Kylo Ren is something like taking the worst parts of episodes 2 and 3, then telling the actor to ignore anything else. Again, this is a story telling problem. I haven’t got a clue whether Adam Driver can act based on these Star Wars movies any more so than with his counterpart. They bring back Yoda. And they have him say that the old Jedi order was not worth worrying about, but to follow your heart. You know who else said that? Palpatine… Now based on the merits of this movie alone it’s one of my favorite scenes in this film. But that doesn’t mean that it’s objectively good! Compared to couch lint cat food smells more edible.This movie is just about tarnishing Luke’s legacy. They have taken the previous hero of three movies, one that completed his hero journey, and then Disney beats him like a piñata hoping for cash to fall out. Why bring the old guard back if you just want to ruin their character’s and kill them off? Luke got off easy in this, only Luke and one other character got to be real heroes. Finn is nothing more than a loser and to top it off he is denied his chance to prove he has metal. Yeah he kills Phasma, but that’s not much harder than killing any old storm trooper. And those are cheaper by the dozen.This movie was not a good Star Wars movie. The main issue for most of the movie is a situation that is handled very poorly due to questionable writing. The sub plots that come about because of this situation are silly and suffer from questionable writing as well. They commit the worst sin of any form of entertainment. They are so boring that only the main plot with Rey and Luke made me stay in the theater seat at all. But this plot didn’t leave a good taste in my mouth either. I’ve seen better science fiction from late night TV in the 90s. Whatever they pay these writers, they should go and buy some rights to fan fiction and save the money. It’ll pay for another few frames of CGI I’m sure. There is such a thing as suspension of disbelief. They couldn’t maintain mine during a Star Wars movie. That’s a bad sign of things to come. They have completely closed themselves off without any real setup for the next and final movie in this trilogy. I don’t care about Rey and Kylo fighting. Rey has already beaten him in The Force Awakens. She seems like she wants to redeem him, but that leaves me disinterested. There isn’t any other plot that was left to setup the next film. This is not good story telling. They didn’t do anything to make me want to go to the theater for the last movie in this trilogy. Everyone that I was rooting for is either dead, made a fool of, been shown to be jerks, or I know that they are in no way a threat and will surely win against any odds. There is one more thing. In fact, it may be the most important thing of all for any movie that claims to be in the Star Wars franchise. Two light sabers never clashed in combat. That’s right, a Star Wars movie without a light saber duel. Many here will claim this is wrong, however they are calling a scene a duel when it is clearly something else. Even the Phantom Menace had a duel!",0
843,"Here's what stuck out to me:- The First Order is worse than the routine stormtroopers-can't-shoot gags in the older films, the director is establishing that the First Order is so ridiculously bad at their jobs that it makes the Resistance look terrible for ever having lost any lives to them.- Next, Poe takes out ALL of the cannons on a dreadnought (I think it was called) with a single x-wing and without any help.- During the first half hour or so, there are a *lot* of characters introduced without reason.  It feels like everyone's OC (original character) got screentime.- Chewbacca just kind of disappears from the plot randomly.- When Rey reaches the island Luke is living on, there's this sea monster thing you see briefly in the water behind Rey.  It wasn't particularly offensive but I remember thinking ""was that necessary?"" and from then on there was a constant barrage of CGI aliens and creatures that was like the prequels on steroids.- Soon after Luke milks an alien species.  The camera zooms in on its nipples.  It seems put there entirely to make kids go ""eww!"" and is roughly on the same level as fart jokes.- Maz shows up and says there's a master code breaker and that they need to recruit him.  Finn and, for some reason, Rose go to a gambling planet.  The whole place is.. really far from Star Wars aesthetic.  It's this kind of super high fashion Lady Gaga music video.- The code breaker is introduced and is a character for like 10 seconds but then doesn't even matter, why is he even there?  Why are so many of these characters even there?- Around this point they randomly establish that the Resistance gets its fighters and weapons from a slave labor planet then just kind of ignore it later..?  What?- There's a whole blatant allegorical element to the gambling planet and, listen, I hate oligarchies too, but it's really childish.  There's pauper children and a whole side plot with these animals which are kind of like race horses and it doesn't really go anywhere.- There's a weird furry hole that is the source of dark energy on the island and Rey falls into it but it's actually not that bad, there's just some water and a trippy mirror that she sees a bunch of copies of herself in, then she's out of the hole later and it never really seems to matter.- Luke is involved in this line of thinking that the Jedi and Sith are basically the same.  He does a terrible job at explaining it, basically saying that the Jedi are vain and the Sith are genocidal.  Are vanity and genocide really on the same level?- Leia is suddenly a Jedi god.  Not a master, a god.  She can fly around in space and knock down doors with her damned mind.  At the end of Return of the Jedi it was established that like Luke, she was force sensitive.  This is fine.  Her suddenly expressing more power than Yoda is not.- Snoke's death is weird.  He's apparently super powerful and can sense all your thoughts but can't sense Kylo sneaking a lightsaber next to him and igniting it into his gut.- Laura Dern shows up with purple Hunger Games hair and is a REALLY uncomfortable character.  The actress has a history of roles in films as realistic modern day people (and she really is a magnificent actress), and she comes across like that here.  It feels as awkward as casting Reese Witherspoon or Julia Roberts would have been.- Poe stages a weird coup against Laura Dern and then is pretty much instantly foiled, seriously the plot does a sharp, tight loop here for no reason and everyone forgives him while he's still unconscious.  Like, everyone could have died?  Why are people acting like it was cute?- Okay, if even BB droids can operate assault vehicles alone and take down a hallway full of guards, why don't they?  Why even have troops?- During the escape from the Resistance flagship, they claim that the First Order won't track small vessels.  Why?  In A New Hope a star destroyer tracks even tiny escape pods, why has technology gotten worse?- They go to Crait (no, not krayt like the dragon) and Rose reveals that she's in love with Finn.  We seriously don't even know her and they've had absolutely zero chemistry up until this point and the scene is really uncomfortable.- There's a fight scene with Kylo and Luke.  Okay, we established that Leia is a force god, right?  Well Luke is now a Super Saiyan ultra mega god who can project himself across the galaxy and physically interact with people and he goes Obi-Wan Kenobi style and he's like ""if you kill me I'll just get stronger"" but then he's like ""Sike that's the wrong number!"" and pulls out all the way across the god damned galaxy.- The pauper children were straight out of Oliver Twist and kind of uncomfortable and the film ends with some kid who I can only assume has a terrible cockney accent and is like, a chimney sweep or something, using a broom as a lightsaber.Anyway, at least the prequels are watchable now.",0
844,"If someone could explain the need for childish ambiance, the stupid jokes, slapstick comedy and inconsistencies, I might be able to like this movie. But as it stands, this is not a good movie, it's a ruin.",0
845,"I am absolutely baffled at what the mainstream critics see in this film that led them to give such high praise. It’s so perplexing that I dare say it almost feels conspiratorial. I’ll sum it all up like this. Sitting here right now, I would rather watch any of the prequels again, any of them, before I sat through this film for a second viewing. The prequels, despite the painful slapstick humor and boring dialogue, at least felt like Star Wars. This film was barely recognizable as a Star Wars installment, took zero risks, and will be the first Star Wars film released in my lifetime that I will not see more than once in theaters. And no, making a jumbled, disjointed, unrecognizable mess that stupidly kills off important characters is not “taking risks”. It’s bad filmmaking. Almost nothing of consequence is addressed in this film. None of this makes me happy to say, I wish badly that it wasn’t true, but alas, it is. At least for me, and for other fans as well as I see the negative reviews pour in.I really wish Lucas was still in control. The man created Jar Jar Binks and forced us to sit through his painful dialogue and potty humor and I’m still saying that after watching Episode 8. There were moments in this film that were so patently absurd I would have laughed out loud if I hadn’t been too stunned to respond. Instead, I sat there in quiet disbelief. Some of the stuff that happened not only looked ridiculous but was completely unnecessary to move the story forward.You are left wondering ""What in the ever living hell was that?"" Certain decisions made for characters were so radically out of place it left the viewer with no chance of being invested in the remaining story. This was not brave or surprising. It rang as fundamentally untrue and felt like shock and awe simply for the sake of it. And the totally overboard self-deprecating humor was just too much. This is fine situationally, but when you poke too much fun at The Force and the Jedi, it’s hard to take them seriously when you need to rely on them to drive the story. Star Wars humor has always been about the tension between characters or whimsical bits for the kids. It never poked fun at its near-sacred foundations of the Force and the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith. These are serious topics for the characters, the fans and the saga as a whole. Lucas always treated them as such.I’ve never felt so indifferent to Star Wars in my life after watching The Last Jedi. I think a big part of that is because I’m not confident at all in Disney's ability to do this thing right going forward. Additionally, even with JJ Abrams’ best effort, I currently see no way that he can salvage the mess that Rian Johnson created. It’s just too damaging. It’s almost as if Rian Johnson disagreed with Abrams’ direction for Episode 7 and sought to make a point by slashing away everything set in motion in The Force Awakens. I wish Episode 8 could be redone entirely. I now have no interest in Episode 9 whatsoever. I cannot believe I just wrote that! But I must admit it is true. This felt like a Disney cash grab, a rip off cloaked in Star Wars garb. Disney thought all they needed were space battles, lightsabers, and furry creatures and we would eat it all up. Anyone who appreciates decent filmmaking or has any love for the Star Wars saga is at risk of being terrifyingly disappointed.This is NOT Star Wars. Disney FIX THIS NOW.",0
846,"The problem is not that Last Jedi and Force Awakens are vastly inferior to the original films; it's that, without cynically piggybacking off the original films, there would be no reason for these movies to exist at all.  Not only has Disney has subverted and disrespected the original films' themes and strongest character, the new characters are bland and unmemorable.  And the central conflict is an incoherently plotted rehash of the Rebels-vs-Empire dynamic.  Also, while I was initially excited by the return of the original films' aesthetics, the ""traditional"" Star Wars vibe has come to feel like a sad, bland recycling since it's in the service of bad storytelling.  Star Wars has become a hollowed out shell and, based on the Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes scores, people are starting to notice.  Here's hoping Disney will course-correct, though I'm not counting on it.",0
847,"Sorry JJ, you gave this guy an easy layup, and he blew it, I think I am finally done with star wars after watching this.  Just a bad movie, not much more to say, the fact that it has the star wars name on it doesn't matter, just bad",0
848,"Pathetic is a very simple way to describe what Rian Johnson did to the Skywalker saga. And today he's saying that 80-90% of the comments he receives in twitter about his film are positive and that he understands those of us complaining but basically, he's sending us to hell. What a coward!",0
849,"Honestly if you thought this movie was good you're part of the problem, and probably an idiot. There are a lot of complaints to be had about the changes and the broken story lines from the previous movie, but that isn't what makes it a bad movie. This is FUNDAMENTALLY a bad movie: dialogue, directing, plot line, sequencing, all of it was complete garbage. It's not just a bad Star Wars movie, it's a BAD MOVIE. Like what the hell is Rose?? She is one of the most annoying characters of all time in any movie ever.",0
850,"Movie could have been great but the sjw code of doing business in both the comic industry and the star wars film series seems to be: ""Kill off everything beloved by fans and replace it all with our roster of **** characters."" Only bright side to this is I no longer want or have a reason to see episode 9. Thanks for saving me some money Disney.",0
851,"Not joking, this is the worst movie i have watched. Pure trash!0/10 and it was hard to even stay and watch the whole thing. People cheered when I yelled **** in the end. Horrible movie!",0
852,"THE 'CRITICS' DESERVE NO RESPECT - NOTE THEIR NAMES - IGNORE THEM FOREVER. Do not see this movie if you really loved the original trilogy. Please do not go the cinema. I watched the originals on repeat some days when I was a little kid. To me, this new Star Wars was a rap*e of the spirit of the films. I have never been so angry during a film, or walking out afterwards. Star Wars was not just a movie, it was a sub-psychological spiritual doctrine for the western countries, it was beautiful, inspiring, romantic and wonderful. Don't let this molestation enter your memory of it. There are about 15 moments you will literally wonder if they were trying to destroy the franchise for good.. and you thought Jar-jar was bad!",0
853,"This movie is a mess. I don't think I've been so disappointed in a movie since the Phantom Menace. Go watch the angry Joe review and the list of reasons they disliked large parts of this movie. I agree with almost all of their concerns and have many more to add. Rian, Kathleen and crew set out and destroyed the legacy characters. I normally watch Star Wars movies multiple times but this movie killed that. Is remarkable what one movie can do to damage a brand.Congratulations on your investment Disney. At least I can save some money by cancelling the trip next year to see Star Wars land at Disney World.",0
854,"Wow all I can say is this is without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie of all time. If you like plot holes,useless characters and destroying old standards then this movie is for you. I am glad I will never have to watch this abomination again.",0

856,I don't normally write reviews but I wanted to actually speak out in hopes that all the people with negative criticism can hopefully be heard by Disney and they can remove Rian Johnson from any future Star Wars films. I am left wondering if he really is a fan of this franchise. I've gone to both first showings in my local movie theater for The Force Awakens and Rogue One and never have I seen this kind of reaction before. On Thursday after I saw the Last Jedi when I walked out I overheard someone say this was the worst movie they've ever seen and one guy actually broke down outside the room. These three kids dressed as jedi and Rey were really upset about the movie. It was ridiculous how gloomy it felt when people were walking out. The Force Awakens and Rogue One did not do this to the viewers. Even if I did somehow enjoy this garbage I don't think I could've been happy after seeing all the reactions around me.,0
857,"I am a BIG star wars fan but this movie sucks.....LUG SKYWALKER DRINKING FROM A SEA MONSTERS NIPPLES ...NOUGH SAID. shameless disney toy ring advertising, crap aliens, too many characters, sorry will rephrase to many useless pointless annoying characters. horriblr script that does not honour original characters.",0

859,"Faithful Star Wars fans will not be pleased. Rian Johnson's Last Jedi is a masterclass in bad-form and poor taste. Visuals are as good as FA or R1, but the story, tone, mood, and pacing are a disaster. Last Jedi goes in a radical & disappointing new direction that discards what Force Awakens had set up. Entire main characters from FA are reduced to cameos or quickly discarded. Plot threads from FA are not explored but are quickly/brutally dead-ended. Characters/Lore from the OT are mocked & handled very disrespectfully. Plot holes are huge and everywhere. This film should rightfully be named ""The Last Star Wars Movie"".",0
860,"Damn you disney!You killed my favorite franchise and part of my childhood in the process!In favor of creating something ""original"" and appealing to a new generation (""let the past die.

To me, this is the last jedi indeed.",0
861,"Poor Mark Hamill, I can't imagine his feelings when he read the script. Nice job Disney, in destroying one of the most beloved movie characters of all time.As if that wasn't enough, half the movie is meaningless filler and there are so many plot holes, it's like it was written by a 5 year old.But seriously, Luke trying to kill his only nephew?Leia flying in space like Superman?A whole fleet of star destroyers chase and cannot shoot down one small ship for 3/4 of the movie?Super powerful villain Snoke ended like that? Also, Kylo was turned by Snoke although he was studying with Luke? How and when?BB8 - a droid - controlling walkers? Why not make it fly the Falcon next?As for the characters who are just killed off or play no real part.. they are just there for no reason but to sell toys.",0
862,"I laughed and cried the entire movie, for reasons that the writers did not intend.  Luke Skywalker; from hero to disenfranchised island bum.  I could rant about all the reasons why this was a tragedy but I refuse to dedicate any more of my precious time on this calamity.",0
863,"The Last Jedi, unfortunately, is a mess, though a technically brilliant mess but a mess nonetheless. I’ll tackle the issues one by one. It’s literally death by a thousand cuts for this film. It doesn’t do things catastrophically wrong, but it screws up with many small but pivotal things at once.  1a) THE PLOT -  or rather the lack of it. Characters don’t move forward in any meaningful way. The plot too is pretty much non-existent. All it does it tie up some thread plots but there is a serious lack of forward momentum. Whereas, The Empire Strikes Back (the BEST Star Wars, period) ended with “I AM YOUR FATHER” moment, resulting in one of those 2nd in a trilogy film, which have a brilliant climax and yet sets the next one. The Last Jedi, however, does not have an end aim. The climax is non-existent, and the stakes just don’t feel high enough. What exactly is the end-game? 1b) THE THREAD INVOLVING FINN AND ROSE – So there is a full 30-35-minute thread dedicated to these two where they are tasked with infiltrating the Orders’ Main Ship and to disable it’s tracking device. So far so good. They go to this planet, in order to find a hacker, have an elongated chase sequence, get the wrong guy, board the main ship, get caught and basically do nothing! So, you have 35+ minutes of screen time which literally adds nothing to the core story or fits in the larger schema of things. 2) LACK OF DRAMA – The film lacks a gut-punching scene or any scene which evokes some kind of an emotion. How does Rey realize her potential? The Empire Strikes Back had a whole sequence dedicated to Luke being stranded and figuring out how to master the force so that he can escape the planet and join the battle. His motivations are set, and his actions have agency, Luke goes through the struggle before becoming a master. Rey just does it, goes through no hardship, she just gets it. In this movie, however, everyone sans Luke lacks personality in their characters. They are just harbingers of actions with no purpose and nothing else in between. It’s all too generic, the plot, the motivations, the set-pieces. 3) LACK OF HEROISM – The film deviates from its ‘western’ roots to something which is well, universal as well as generic. You do get a feeling that this is more of a feminine film (female commanders/fighters all of a sudden), which is fine. But then, fleeing instead of leading the charge and not doing something of consequence is not exactly I say ‘dramatic’. Where is the dramatic sacrifice (apart from one scene)? Where is the heroism? And the most heroic guy (Poe) gets reprimanded for it! Where is the risk-taking? And where is the audacity? There is a massive undertone of feminism and equal representation which is fine as long as it is not at odds with the well-being of the film. Give everyone a chance but not at the expense of the plot. It almost feels like a quota system with equal representation at work. Ok, so let’s give our female lead a scene, follow it up with a scene of the black guy and mix him with a South-East Asian. Now, get the female queen and then the legendary Luke……rinse/repeat and everyone go out happy. As a result, what suffers are the characters. No one is given enough time to cook, no plot thread is taken to its logical conclusion. It’s corporate flattening at its worst. This flattening strips the film with any kind of personality it could have possessed Even Luke dies in a supremely uneventful way. Like C’mon. Luke is Sci-Fi action hero incarnate. The destroyer of Death Star and Vader and you kill him like this? His death should have been bombastic, instead, it’s a whimper. All he does is brood and milk aliens :/ You just don’t screw with the character of Luke Skywalker like this.... case closed. For Rey, what’s her heroism? She can lift Rocks!! Great! She thinks she can change a bad boy in her own image, even better! 4) KYLO REN – Seriously, this character is THE WEAKEST LINK in the film. Vader inspired dread, Skywalker inspired Heroism, this guy just inspires pity! All he does is sulk and cry and behave like a baby. How can this character be taken seriously let alone villainous? 5) UNPLACED HUMOR – Star Wars usually have had its share of humour. The banter between C3PO and R2Ds, Han Solo’s one-liners. But they were treated in an almost Shakespearean way, i.e. there were scenes set aside for comic relief. Here, unfortunately, jokes come at the most inopportune dramatic moment. Villains lose their power when their action ends in humour, or Luke his heroism when (spoiler) after being attacked from multiple Tie-Fighters and AT-Ts shrugs dust from his shoulders. The film is generic, too generic in fact. Like Luke’s X Wings in Empire Strikes Back, this film is stuck in a swamp. Hope the force is strong with the next instalment and I dare say with it possessing a bit more heroism and pathos. P.S. – The owl creatures are cute, but c’mon, they gotta serve a purpose!",0
864,"This movie ruined Star Wars for me and my daughter.  I am usually very forgiving ...but not with something like this.  I don't know how to explain it ...but it seemed like there were a bunch of cool things that didn't fit together in 1 movie.   There was no concise storyline.  They seem to add stuff that they didn't need to just to do something cool.  I can't imagine liking this movie even if your not a star wars fan....it just doesn't flow or make sense. I think my daughter summed it up best at the end of the movie...she turned to me and said ...""Wheres the star wars?""",0
865,"Just like in Back To The Future 2, what if you could go back in time, to an evil past where everything you once loved has been destroyed and shat on. Welcome to Star Wars Episode 8, just like Final Fantasy 8, anything labelled with an eight should fill you with dread. This film takes all the things that were good about the original series, sticks them in a blender and shats on them. In a move by Disney to make Episodes 1-3 seem good in comparison. All your favourite characters and their images are ruined and instea filled with social justice propoganda. You shouldn't even watch this movie even for free, as the hours you will waste watching it, not only will have you grasping for those hours of your lives back, you'll be forever traumatised knowing that Disney came and ruined your childhood memories.

Laura Dern’s character is such a pivotal historical figure in the series and deserved such a large climatic role unlike Admiral Akbar who you rightfully unceremoniously killed off and literally gave his seat to someone no one cared about. I love how you developed a new character - Rose but completely ignored any development of prior main characters. I love how righteous and powerful every female character is in the movie and all male characters are impulsive and/or bumbling broken idiots. More cowbell!",0
867,"I left it a couple of days after seeing the movie to let it digest before reviewing. In my opinion the movie was a mess. I disliked Ray in the last movie and I had hoped my opinion would change, but I dislike the character even more. I am not emotionally invested in he like I was in Luke's original story. She had no character development in the last movie and she was skilled in everything. In the last Jedi it was more of the same with still no explanation. Don't even ask me about the huge plot holes. Also what was the point in Snoke?. We are nearly at the final film in the trilogy and I am so invested with the latest franchise.",0
868,"After Rogue One my hope for the series was rekindled, but The Last Jedi was so stupid and shallow in every aspect that I came out of the cinema literally devastated. That was ""The Last Star Wars Movie"" for me. The legend of previous saga movies has been destroyed by the stupidity of this film. Episode VII was bad, but the 8th outruns him by light years with the level of plot absurdities, holes in the script and the usual lack of respect for the philosophy built by six previous films.",0

872,"This is my first review. I´m an all time Star Wars fan since I saw The Return of the Jedi on the movies back in the 80´s. Each and every movie has been a wonderful experience for me, and for my kids, who became fans themselves with the prequels. Say what you want about them, but they were entertaining and captivating for kids. But enough of the backstory. THIS MOVIE WAS A DISASTER. I mean, it was beautifully made, the cinematography was gorgeous, but the story and the storytelling was pure and absolute CRAP. Rian Johnson and whoever wrote the script managed to tear apart everything we grew up admiring about Star Wars, turning Luke Skywalker, the same Luke Skywalker who abandoned his training to save his friends in Cloud City, the same Skywalker who turned the most badass villain in the whole universe into the light side, the same Skywalker, well you get my point, they manage to turn him into a bitter wimp who won´t get his hands dirty even for his twin sister.  They fail to reveal the source of all mighty powerful Rey´s powers, they fail to explain Patricide Kylo Ren motives, heck, they even fail to explain who the hell is Snoke, who at time feels more powerful than every Sith before him.  The movie is a mess, and only screws us by taking our greatest heroes in the galaxy and turning them to nothing.  I´m beyond words to explain what a mess this movie created.  BTW, kudos to JJ Abrams, who managed to create the least likeable and reedemable villain in Kylo Ren. I mean, Anakin/Vader´s story was great, because he was as great a hero as he was a villain, he saved as many lives as he killed, but he NEVER did anything to the point we could think was unredeemable. (not even killing younglings). He really became Vader when he tought he had killed Padme and his child by mistake, but we knew different. He saved Luke when he was about to die. But Kylo is a freaking patricide who killed his father in cold blood and saw his mother blow into space and did nothing. JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson only needed to make him a paedophile priest to make him the most unredeemable person EVER. So, it´s not as we are waiting for him to turn to the light, we COULDN´T CARE LESS if he was hanged by the balls by all eternity.  Way to go screenwriters !!",0
873,"I will keep this simple. I would watch attack of the clones over this film. Not just a disappointing Star Wars film, but a bad film in general. We went from a director who wanted to make a Star Wars film so much that he remade the first one, to a director who clearly wasn’t interested in making a Star Wars film at all. I have never left a cinema more disappointed and deflated then I did after this film.",0
874,"RIP Star Wars! garbage! Disney has destroyed the best saga of all time.Rian Johnson filmed a video game, not a star wars movie! nothing for the fan of SW!",0
875,"This film is almost like a parody of Star Wars. I was lead to believe that this was supposed to be dark, serious, emotional; yet it turned out to be half sci-fi half comedy. (SPOILERS AHEAD)- Luke's character is completely wasted, there was so much potential for him to have a grand entrance, change the lore, further the plot, and have a meaningful conclusion. Yet they chose to make his opening scene start out with comedy, and kill him of exhaustion, or whatever..?- Leia officially has developed her force powers to the point where she can sustain herself in the cold void of space, and force pull herself through that space like superman. Vader could not live without his mask, despite being one of the most powerful force users ever, even after being turned into more machine than man. - Rey still does not get any official jedi training other than audio lessons about the force and the hypocrisy of the Jedi, yet takes out multiple praetorian guards at the same time, and lifts thousands of pounds of rocks. Luke could not lift the X-Wing after training with Yoda, who has been teaching Jedi for centuries. So, Mary Sue much?- WAAAAAAYYYY too much comedy in this movie. It's not that the comedy wasn't funny, it's that it felt like almost every other scene of this film was a comedy bit. The opening dialogue of the film is comedic. Also, Yoda is comic relief. Sigh.-  The film is very inconsequential as a whole. It doesn't really world build much at all or further the general story, other than the rebellion being in the same boat it's almost always been in, which is losing some and winning some. It does not expand upon the lore very much, other than the new abilities like force skype, and force astral projection(which apparently kills you, no matter how powerful of a force user you are). - Characters Finn, Poe, and Rose did not actually progress anywhere. Finn and Rose's sole purpose was to be filler in this film, then fight phasma, and kiss (come on?! seriously with the cliche?!). Poe is there to be annoyed with the stand in for Leia, a good pilot to win against any odds, and say, ""we're the spark that will light the fire to the rebellion"" in a cool way to play on the audiences emotions and provide exposition as to the point of the film.- Speaking on that ^.. What is the point of this film? Is it so that we can watch a 2 1/2 hour lock in between the rebels and the first order? Could you really not come up with a better story than that? Like idk, using the last of the fuel reserves to land on a planet(take us to another world with interesting dynamics perhaps?), defend the fortifications long enough to refuel the ship so that you can light speed through the ships (which was cool by the way, thank you) whilst being in an interesting place other than a cruiser? - ^ That's just the rebellion side of the story too. The mysticism side of the story, or the lore of the jedi, sith, and the force went pretty much nowhere. We found out that Luke knows of the Jedi's failures and hypocrisy, that Snoke is still just a random villain with no other motive than to simply kill the rebels, Rey is incredibly powerful with almost no effort. Again, could we not have used Luke's masterful force potential for something more cool? - The film mainly doesn't set well with me because I was led to believe that this was going to be a seriously dark toned story, (the trailers, the red and white drab colors on the marketing, ""it's time for the jedi to end"", the dark, menacing music and tone of the trailers) and then we got a film that dumps on the lore, spits on Luke, is stationary throughout half the runtime, drags on, uses every opportunity to get a laugh(Thanks Disney), and disrespects all of the fans who expected the star wars movie that you lead them to believe was to be. It doesn't matter to me if every fan theory was wrong, it doesn't matter if i didnt get what *I* wanted, what I do care about is you giving me what you lead me this film was going to be.",0
876,"There are many reasons this movie deserves a low score, but I will only focus on two: it failed to evoke a sense of wonder and it was offensive.Star Wars movies have found success despite their many flaws. They have never been Oscar quality films, yet they are wildly successful. I, as a fan, am willing to gloss over and reason away many of the flaws because the movies evoke a sense of wonder that is hard to find in other films. I have always felt like I was in a galaxy far, far away. Luke's journey through that galaxy has always made me feel like there is a greater purpose than this mundane life. Those feelings were expunged with poor comedy that serves as a public announcement, ""Hey folks, don't forget, this is a silly fantasy movie and none of this is real."" If the characters don't believe they are in a galaxy far, far away, how am I supposed to? Also, when you create a universe, you have to create a set of rules that the characters are bound by. Rian broke existing rules of the universe and introduced farfetched ones like little kids do during games they play with each other.I found this movie offensive on many levels. I only want to point out one scene though. When Rey hands Luke his old lightsaber, Luke looks at it for a few seconds before chucking it behind him without a thought about where it was going to land. Let me remind you, that this scene was preceded with Rey ascending up a long flight of stairs to find Luke atop this island, implying that Luke is still this hero that others have to ascend to in order to meet eye-to-eye. When she finally handed him his old lightsaber, he behaved as though the lightsaber had no significance to him. I get it, Rian wanted to take the movie in a direction nobody expected. Fine. He didn’t have to do it with both middle fingers extended though. If you don’t understand why this moment is offensive, let me explain. That lightsaber has a lot of history. It was Anakin’s lightsaber that was used as he turned to the dark side. He eventually lost it in a fight with Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan held onto that lightsaber for years while he watched over Luke. Luke, like Rey, has always yearned to know who his father is. Obi-Wan shatters Luke’s understanding of who is father was by telling him Anakin was a Jedi Knight, someone of profound significance. He offers the lightsaber to Luke as proof. This is the first tangible object that we know of that belonged to Luke’s father and is now in Luke’s possession. Luke goes on to fight Darth Vader at Cloud City. He loses his hand and that lightsaber moments before learning that his father is actually the evil man looking right at him. He probably thought he would never see that lightsaber again. After thinking about this history, to say that Luke is not flooded with memories and emotions when he sees that lightsaber is offensive. Him seeing that lightsaber, in contrast to his robotic hand that only exists because his father cut off the real one, should have been a serious and thought-provoking moment for Luke. Making that moment thoughtless trashes all the history that comes with that lightsaber and it trashes everything Luke struggled to become in the previous films. This is why it is offensive. Rian could have easily pivoted the storyline in this scene without being offensive though. For example, he could have had Luke look at the lightsaber for a moment and then look at Rey and something along the lines of, “I cannot take this. I am not this person anymore.” He could give it back to Rey and then walk away. This would at least acknowledge that the lightsaber has significance to Luke and I would be left wondering, “What happened to him? Why has he changed?” which seems to be what Rian was trying to convey anyway.I gave a score of 1 because there are a few, isolated scenes that I enjoy.",0
877,"This is a Disney movie, this is not a Star Wars movie. It is apparent that Disney want to take the essence of the Skywalker Saga and end it and they are not even ensuring that these beloved characters get their due. They are trying to shove all these new characters down our throat, but are refusing to even give us 5 reasons to care for these new 'heroes', who have so much screen time in sub-plots that have zero impact on the actual narrative. If the Expanded Universe was wiped out to give us this crap, I think genuine Star Wars fans have a right to be very very angry. Big Corporations cannot just take over a mega franchise like Star Wars, wipe out every single expanded universe story and then replace it with run of the mill garbage that has been made just so that it ticks a few corporate checkboxes.Fans need to reclaim Star Wars, before this Disney Behemoth turns it into another Marvel franchise. I actually feel hurt and let down as someone who grew up with Star Wars. There is not one scene or location in this movie that can even compare to Jabba's Palace. Not one character that has the complexity of Jabba. Honestly, the Phantom Menace was better than this movie and it is unfortunate that critics have been paid off by Disney to certify this movie as authentic Star Wars.",0
878,"Luke went to Vader trying to make him come back to the light, even so he has no idea how he's going to do that. Luke prefer to die trying to take back his father, the one he never knew, than let him stay in the dark side. Know he decides to kill his nephew while he's sleeping because he saw signs of the dark side. Really the same character? No, it's not. This is not Star Wars.",0
879,"Not a good Star Wars movie, but honestly not a good movie in general. Rian Johnson is a good director, but he somehow dropped the ball here. The B-plot in this movie is poorly written and honestly even poorly acted (Kelly Marie Tran feels like a television actress). The whole thing feels pointless. Another issue is how they really don't do much with Luke Skywalker. Aside from making his character contradictory to how he was in the original trilogy, his arc in this film just isn't compelling. The big reveal of what happened in his past just leaves you feeling ""meh.""",0

And then finally we get new variation from Empire Strikes Back only to have a throne room scene where the new emperor character (who coincidently has the greatest weakness of overconfidence... just like Palpatine) gets killed (albeit this was a good scene). Then kylo wants Rey to rule galaxy with him. Then massive plot hole of hyperdrive and hunk of metal.. uh Rian... you do realize you just put a super weapon in the hand of every bloke with a hyperdrive and a droid they tell to fly to their death right???

Lifelong, and I mean lifelong fan lost!",0
888,"I'm saying what needs keep being said loudly about The Last Jedi which is that it is an all round terrible movie.  I'm taking the time to do this so that eventually Disney learn the only way they care - financially - that we Star Wars fans will not continue to blindly pay up for rubbish like this.  I didn't go to see this multiple times at the cinema or buy it on blu-ray, unlike The Force Awakens.  That's them down already about £40 on last time from me.  Ensuring we real users give this movie its correct score on Metacritic is very important so everybody should continue posting reviews - we're not paid up professional 'critics' who conveniently score massive commercial films like this ridiculously highly regardless of the reality.Numerous other reviews point to the glaring plot holes all over this so I don't need to, but they are absurd to the point the film can't be taken seriously enough to review.  I was a fan of The Force Awakens, I gave it a 7/10.  Sure, it was far too plot derivative and obvious and didn't make nearly enough of some key characters, but is introduced a whole new beginning and some potentially interesting characters and storylines that had Star Wars fans discussing and buzzing with excitement for two years while we waited.  It did the job, it got us off and started with something potentially great.It's fair to say that Rhian Johnson, the director, has NO idea about character development, or crafting a coherent, well thought through storyline that is cohesive to the laws of the Star Wars universe.. doing so would have ensured there are no really glaring, stupid plot holes.  The Last Jedi has so many it can only have been put together by a fool who thinks that ""not being obvious"" is always the right approach.Questioning Rey's heritage?  That's actually quite a good 'surprise' to not play up to fan theories, but to make it not necessarily some huge deal (without going into the plot).  But what about the capability of characters to survive absolute zero in space and fly around and come back from the dead?  Or Luke's appalling treatment after no role in the first movie as some bad tempered old hermit who has an evil side and shows no traits whatsoever of the wisdom of a Jedi Master - which he is.  Not to mention the end of movie decision.. ""let the past die"" or whatever BS phrase they used.  That for me was unforgiveable and why it gets a 1 not even a 2 or 3.It's not clever, it didn't make for a good movie.  It made it a really, really bad.  Good movies have payback for time invested and give the audience what they want (in whatever capacity that might be) eventually - example being seeing Luke as the final unfold at the end of The Force Awakens.  All fans wanted Luke to have a central role in this movie - it wasn't 'clever' or 'bold' not doing so, it would be like a band going on and playing a couple of their minor hits then indulging themselves playing new songs to the audience all night who have come to hear their greatest hits.  That would piss off any audience, that's what Rhian did here. How about the poor, new characters crafted by JJ Abrams?  They also got scant development in this movie.  Rey's character development stopped as she continued her apparent ability to use the most advanced Force powers with zero training in almost no time whatsoever (remember this movie followed straight on from the last).Poe? Pointless, mutinous and comes across as ""the aggressive little hot headed man"" rather than the all action hero he was of the first movie.  Then there's a whole raft of really bad side plots and characters.  It's a shame to say that Finn now seems completely pointless too as a character.In short, whereas I left The Force Awakens really curious for more and wanting to see what happened with all these characters.  Now I'm just like Mark Hamill - I don't care anymore beyond writing this.  While Star Wars is in the hands of those pursuing making current socio-political statements within a sci-fi world, these aren't movies I will be going to see anymore.  Starting with Solo - I'll check it out on blu-ray perhaps, if somebody else I know picks up a copy.  I won't be giving Disney a dime or introducing my kids to anything but the originals until they get the message and fire Kennedy and remove this horrific idea of Johnson doing an entire trilogy more of Star Wars films.Hit them where it matters fans - at the box office with the future movies.

Instead... here I am.Welcome to Star Wars **** Leftist All-Minorities-Included Edition.I have read in the news that some angry Star Wars fan published an edited version of The Last Jedi without all the unnecessary feminazi, social justice warrior, vegan, diversity-at-all-costs nonsense... and all that remains are 40 minutes of nothing.I also had the same instinct to try to save the movie by editing out the nonsense. This guy saved me time and effort. Neither of them is worth the trying. We have to admit that this movie is **** beyond any repair.The leftist turn had already been slapped in our face through the red-dominated posters, which by themselves were a complete digression from the look and feel of the Star Wars franchise. The movie confirmed that it was at no point the intention of Rian Johnson to make a good Star Wars Movie. His intention was, and he may admit it publicly sooner or later, to shove in our throats tons and tons of barely concealed anti-male, female-supremacy, anti-western-civilization, pro-diversity-at-all-costs, leftist, anti-capitalist, animalist, vegan propaganda.Let me be clear about it. I am a 51 years old leftist, feminist, vegetarian, animalist man, but God this movie stinks!One may think that Rian Johnson spent 99% of his time trying to conceive a way to shove all this propaganda up our asses and only 1% of the time trying to write a decent script.The result is a movie which has been correctly described as a catastrophe, a travesty, a piece of the worst kind of agit-prop propaganda.Beyond that, on a strict cinematographic plane, it is full of plot holes, bad jokes thrown in our faces for the sake of themselves, unrealistic twists and subplots that add nothing to the story.And it does not a good service to the causes he so desperately wanted to push: the actions of the two women, admiral Hey-I-Am-Lesbian and poor-fat-ugly-stupid-self-appointed-minority-social-animal-rights-warrior Rose were so misconceived that they put at serious risk the lives of the rebels (Rose stopping Finn from destroying the cannon, thus giving the First Order the possibility to wipe off the rebels) or worse they caused thousands of deaths (admiral Holdo not telling anyone her plans and subsequently hesitating way too much before finally warp-ramming Snoke's starship).Freeing the animals (and not freeing the slave children!) only to have them most probably recaptured the day after by the rich-and-therefore-bad people of Canto Bight is not only useless. It is plainly stupid and puts in bad light the animal-rights movement.Is Rian Johnson a double agent of the worst right-wing white-male-supremacists? If so, good job Rian!",0
892,"I was all for this movie until the ending. You do NOT screw over Luke like that. There was all-around bad writing in this flick, and most characters became more boring, somehow being undeveloped as the film went on.

I get that Luke needs to pass on the baton, but have him do it in a better way, with valor and bravery, not wasting away on an island. This was just subpar in almost every way. I can't fathom what would make anyone enjoy this film. Rian Johnson's attempts to ""getcha"" and pull the rug out from under you by being subversive in his plot points only succeeded in making an awful movie with no real development or satisfying world building.

895,"This is literally one of the worst films ever made.The most visible problems are threefold:- Writing- Directing- ActingWriting has, in fact, quite a few types of problems:- Absolute hatred for the original lore of the universe itself. Old rules are broken, mysteries remain unexplained and become even more puzzling while the new additions are confusing, arbitrary and short-sighted.- Absolute hatred for the original story. Old characters are turned upside down. Killed outright for no reason, made dumb and impotent for no reason. Or made divine when they weren't. Why is Ackbar an irrelevant character in the background next to a Vice-Admiral? And killed without even having a close-up shot?- Insulting and condescending demagogy made to obfuscate the aforementioned. Yoda says the Force is... whatever. It doesn't matter. Luke is here to show that - whatever. The original saga and the prequels were crap. Said by the most beloved and most crucial character of the entire saga.- The lowest form of sucking up to the boss of the production: Kathleen Kennedy. A super-officer aristocrat lady is there to serve as Kennedy's ego trip, and a First Order officer is even called Kennedy. Since when do Star Wars characters have Earth names? Since now. Because ""sucking up to the boss"" day.- Complete disregard for the norms of writing Star Wars. Star Wars characters do not mention the concept of ""soul"", nor do they say ""Godspeed"". This changes things. It changes the philosophy of it.- The humor is criminally bad. Star Wars epic isn't an episode of ""College Humor"".- There's a persistent string of completely ridiculous decisions and behavior on all sides. This is like watching the ""Incompetent wars"". It's even worse than ""Battlestar Gallactica"" that started its trend.- NONE of the mysteries of the story are answered. They're not even cleared up a bit. There's a point at witch teasing becomes mocking. This is it.As for acting.... this is more of a director's mistake than that of actors themselves.But really - it's just as bad as TFA.

898,"***Spoilers***In short this movie, albeit directed by Rian Johnson, was another Jar Jar Abrams style unoriginal hack job copy paste from its predecessors; jam packed with special effects, prospective toy animals and story ideas of people who I presume, think that they are clever and/or special, but to their own detriment are not.What Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy & Co. did in the Last Jedi is berserk tabula rasa butchery of not only the original trilogy but their own work TFA as well, in terms of consistency and story.Sure they have to sell new books and create newer cooler characters, and when they can’t they just make the old ones uncool to make the new ones look cool, if that makes any sense.Let’s go deeper.First of all, as far as Star Wars goes, I like the original trilogy a lot and respect it, I really disliked the Force Awakens because of its mock-Emperor and Darth Vader wanna be villains, its Mary Sue protagonist and the script which was copy pasted from “A New Hope”. But if I was to develop a sequel to TFA I would have to respect it even if I do not like it and keep it consistent.But this film though, I hate it. Yep very strong words I know but unlike the film my feelings are sincere. I feel like Disney thinks that they can get away with any chance they take with the franchise because fans will flock to the theaters no matter what and throw away their money.I did not like the “Lost” style building up of intrigue and mystery Jar Jar tried to pull off regarding Snoke and Rey’s origins and reasons for Luke’s reclusion in the Force Awakens, and it is evident in this movie that they did not think it through in TFA to have any developed story or ideas about them then. Abrams, Kasdan & Arndt were just winging it. And evidently when Kathleen Kennedy and Co. & Rian Johnson decided they cannot wing it in this movie, heck they just kill the people / ideas off without explanation. For instance:-	Quickly they make Ren smash his mask. Yay no longer a Vader copy, he’s a real boy now.-	Again quickly, snoke is killed by Whino Ren, while bragging how supreme he is (and we still did not learn who the bleep this guy was in the first place).-	Lastly and in 10 seconds we learn that Rey’s childhood is a byproduct of bad parentage by insignificant no name junk collectors.But the worst for me is the guy we love for being able to overcome the dark side and refused to kill his fallen father which in turn led to the Emperor’s undoing, Luke Skywalker, according to this movie freaked out upon sensing the dark side in Ben Solo and tried to kill him in his sleep, just for a moment. The guy who stood for optimism and was literally “the New Hope” who redeemed the unredeemable bad guy Vader, reduced to a hermit that turned his back on his loved ones, and killed off Obi Wan style, with the most ridiculous new force power of projecting interstellar holograms. Dude please.Another major issue I have with this movie is that Disney, Rian Johnson or whomever is ridiculously desperate to be perceived as politically correct, diverse and inclusive; but in the end they come out as insincere since they just shove down an unnecessary parallel and nonsensical story arc of Finn and Rose with a little social commentary on capitalism, which is rich coming from Disney. As you know Disney has a rich history of depicting minorities (!).Suffice it to say I will not be paying Disney for anything from now on. I probably won’t watch a Rian Johnson movie either.Anyhow if you’re still reading lest make a soft exit by listing minor but nevertheless still very annoying stuff about the film:-	If you really wanted a Lando type character, here’s an idea why didn’t you just put Lando in the movie. Mr. Williams is alive and well last I checked.-	You call that jedi training?-	Luke milking an alien and drinking it caveman style?-	I didn’t see a point in the character Vice Admiral Holdo.-	I still don’t see the point of the character Maz Kanata.-	Force skyping of Whino Ren and Rey, I’m no millennial nope, not for me.-	Forced Marvel style humor every 2 minutes, I don’t even like it in Marvel movies either.-	1 ewok type cg animal to be sold as toys is unbearable, 3 is just repugnant.-	Damned Disney killed of Admiral Akbar.And on and on and on…",0

900,"A ""Star Wars"" film that nobody wanted and that nobody needs! Do you want to know how bad it is? I watched 39 minutes of it and exited the theater. Do yourself a favor and either watch ""The Room"" or ""Highlander : The Source"". At least you will be entertained by something that's not politicized to a core. There is a constant premise of Female superiority in the movie which ultimately does nothing for the women. The SJW is strong with this one, too! Main characters are like puppets on a string. Nothing relatable. Nothing intellectual. Nothing deep. No suspense. Not a single moment felt realistically StarWars-like. This movie is a raging pile of crap and everyone working on it should feel ashamed for being a part of it. You blew your chance to make Star Wars great again. You bunch of hypocrites and ignorant who care nothing for the consistency, lore and fans. And this is the reason why it will be negative, since you are the cancer of the Star Wars. You are it's Dark Side and there will be time when the Balance will be made anew. Maybe not now. But you will be forgottn, Disney's trilogy of travesty and despair.",0
901,"If you've never seen Star Wars or have no involvement in the actual story line, this is a decent movie. But as soon as you start to tie it into the series, it falls apart. Nothing makes sense; nothing is answered. I wish I had never seen the movie because I literally gained nothing from it. 1/10 simply because was a beautifully filmed.",0
902,"This movie lacked focus and interesting structure. The characters are great, but the writers need to be fired. There were 6 plots going on and it turns out only one of them mattered at all. Why not focus on the single interesting plot, rather than many poorly written side stories. I have lost hope in Star Wars.",0
903,"The only positive thing I can say of this movie is that there are some scenes that are visually spectacular. On the whole, however, the characters are unlikable caricatures with sloppy dialog. The story itself is a convoluted, meandering mess with nearly a third of the screen-time being utterly pointless. All the loose ends of the previous movie are either ignored or bluntly stated to be pointless. ""Mary Sue"" Rei Mary Sue's her way through everything as she did in episode 7, leaving no tension or attachment to her boring, vacant character. Add a dash of clumsy political ideological allegory and you end up with two and half hours of my life I wish that I could have back. I will not bother with episode 9.",0
904,I legitimately don't understand how universally positive the reviews for this movie are. I feel like almost every single directorial decision was made to either sell a toy or serve as a video game level,0
905,"I do not understand the critical acclaim for this movie. As far as actual storytelling goes, and filmmaking, this is not a good movie. Not only was I bored throughout large portions of this film, there was little development in the way of characters, and little to no reason to be emotionally invested in the plot, the characters, or the galaxy as a whole.Where do I begin.First off, I loved the Original Trilogy, I had my misgivings about the Prequels, I did not like The Force Awakens, and I adored Rogue One. In fact, I saw Rogue One four times in theaters. While Rogue One was not perfect, I was emotionally invested, and the scene of Vader in the hallway was worth the price of admission alone.There are no such moments in The Last Jedi. There are few memorable scenes. The dialogue is weak. There are whole subplots that are hamfisted and unnecessary. Characters are introduced with little to no reason, zero complexity, only to check the boxes of diversity.Luke has been ruined as a character. He has regressed. Some of the critical reviews raved about a lightsaber fight -- sorry, there is not lightsaber fight in this movie. If you think there is, you will be sorely disappointed. Walkers apparently do not make noise anymore when they walk. General Hux is a laughing stock. Can you imagine Gold Leader calling the Death Star and dropping a 'yo momma' joke on Grand Moff Tarkin? Sadly, this movie has turned our beloved Star Wars into ""Marvel-in-Space."" The few moments were we could have actually cared about a character's sacrifice (such as Finn), we are blocked from it, and forced to drink a contrived 'romance' instead, if you can even call anything that goes on in this film romance.I heard about the 'stunning' visual shots that Rian employed. Sorry, which ones? This movie paled in comparison to the shots in Rogue One.Next, the Galaxy is so small, it's been reduced to about 200 people. We have zero context for this war, and what's going on in this galaxy far, far away. It feels small, tiny, irrelevant. Stakes? What stakes?All is not lost. Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren is commendable. Ren is, perhaps, the most complex character now (but it's not saying much, I'm sorry to say). Admiral Ackbar dies in a bit of dialogue. What a waste.Snoke dies in an anti-climatic fashion. Another waste.Rey's performance has improved. The casino scene could has been skipped. 30 minutes of waste there.All-in-all, this movie was unnecessary. I believe that if you enjoyed The Force Awakens, you will probably enjoy this. If you enjoyed Rogue One, you will not like this. I left the theater feeling empty. The one scene that got me, and I mean the ONE scene, was Luke saying goodbye to Leia. I shed a tear here, but not because the movie earned it from me, but because I knew that Carrie was dead in real life, and her send off was going to be wantonly wasted in this movie that should never have been a movie.I'm devastated.I will never watch this again.",0
906,This movie murders Star Wars! Don’t watch it!!! This isn’t the movie you’re looking for! Spoilers*Luke’s a ******** ton of plot holesRay is made worse somehow!  Whole casiono thing didn’t need to be thereSuperman Leia!!!! ****ing hell!!!!,0
907,"hot garbage, spits in the face of the fans that kept this franchise going. It's not a movie, its a starwars themed political ad for feminism/ white man hate. The longer I think about the movie the madder I get that they ruined starwars. You don't have to make every man in a movie out to be an idiot and or Nazi to have strong female characters. Kennedy at Lucas films has to go and RJ needs to have his trilogy deal revoked I won't be watching it if he or Kennedy are involved. beyond that, it's still poorly written and throws the continuity of star wars out the window. I can't believe the character assassination of luke. not even mark himself agrees with how they did luke, sad just sad....",0
908,"I never write reviews. I either like a movie or I don't - either way I move on. NOT TODAY!!!Where do I begin with this farce? Everyone is getting some. Let's begin:1. Star Wars ""fans"" The new generation of Star Wars Prequel era sympathizers are here. ""The Sequels are untouchable!"" ""If you don't like them you're a hater who hates change!"" ""Star Wars fans can never be happy! What else is new!"" And other dismissive towing the line fanboy garbage.IF you think this is a good action movie? Ok. But this is NOT a Star Wars movie. It doesn;t feel like a Star Wars movie or hold true to the characters that they even built up FOR THIS TRILOGY.2. Characters:Snoke? Guy who started the First order? Seduced Kylo AWAY FROM LUKE (he had the power to do that) and the guy who triggered the events of Ep.7 and this trilogy? Who saw the ""rise and fall of the Empire"" according to the canon TFA novel? Who took over a fallen Sith Empire? Who desperately wanted Luke dead and who Luke knew of?He's nobody. Plot device to move plot along. Can toy with Rey and Kylo and toss them around like rag dolls but didn't see a slow moving lightsaber RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Even after boasting how he knew Kylo in and out. DEAD.JJ built him up to be a huge powerful menace. Serkis said he was more powerful than either Sidious or Vader: DEAD.Who was he? Why did he do what he did? Where was he all this time knowing he said he was around? Rian Johnson doesn't care. He's done away with halfway through the film.Luke? He's milking **** infested 4 titted Blue Milk animals while the universe clings to dear life by his failures. He is Ok with this and just wants to die. Selfish? Thought that was a dark side trait? He says he won't train Rey because the jedi need to end only to train her to show her why they need to end and then says he's not the last jedi even though we are told by Snoke he is the last jedi. Sure.Then they kill him. He dies. The original Luke. They had Mark Hamill and he commits suicide on a rock or dies of force illusion across universe something something? Shameful misuse.Rey? Lineage? Speculated for years. Hyped for 1.5 movies with flash backs and call backs and mentions and she goes in a dangerous cave and who were they? NOBODY. Oh and their DEAD.Then she magically escapes Snoke mega giant ship and takes one an army of tie fighters. OK!Finn? Character arc wasted. He's not apart of the new Jedi. He tries to run again. Tries to commit suicide into a Starkiller miniature and who knows if it would work at all? But you know, movie, I guess.Kylo? Loved him. Great acting. But shouldn't be Supreme Leader.3. Plot Holes the size of black holes.The giant Dreadnought has no shields but a resistance ship does. Purple hair lady doesn't tell Poe about why they are leaving he commits an unnecessary mutiny.THE RESISTANCE calls up Maz who is playing Battlefront 2 or something? And Poe knows her somehow. Should have been Finn making the call.The RESISTANCE TRUSTS their future on a guy who turns out to not be the codebreaker and they trust him because movie. No idea if he could do it so they trust a prisoner. I guess it might have been a sort of The Matrix follow the white rabbit or something but go f#$k yourself movie doesn't care.Asian girl says she loves Finn. Since when? Seriously? LOVE? OK!I could go on. This would turn into a Mr. Plinkett Star Wars movie review. And that is the only good thing about Star Wars is that we will get a Plinkett Review.Im done with Star Wars. All you excuse makers and nostalgia freaks can cirle jerk to this movie. Rian Johnson murdered 40 years of star wars. He's a fraud who made me appreciate even the Prequels. At least Lucas didn't f#$k his characters.goodbye Star Wars you only exist in 3 originals and legends books. Books they made LEGENDS for this farce to exist.",0
909,"There is one word that sums up The Last Jedi. DISAPPOINTMENT. This film is a bloated mess Rian Johnson completely fails to realise that Ep8 is the middle part of a three part sequel trilogy that should continue the previous narrative. Instead all the story threads laid out by Ep7 and the original movies are completely discarded and replaced with toilet humour and not so subtle political speeches about animal welfare, child labor and the evils of the super rich.Gone are the real world sets and practical effects of EP7 and we are returned to the lifeless CGI worlds that echo the very worst from the prequel era.The story does nothing for the existing characters and introduces more utterly irrelevant new ones that the audience cares nothing for.There might be an ok-ish movie buried here somewhere that a more subjective editor could've found by cutting down the running time to around 90minutes and disposing of the terrible subplots like the horrendous casino planet sequence that Rian Johnson introduces. Ultimately this movie is a huge misstep by Disney. If this movie has come through their scrutiny without reshoots then God knows how bad Rian Johnsons new trilogy will be.At the end of the day You're going to see this movie. You're going to see the Solo movie in May 2018 and you're going to see Ep9. That doesnt mean any of these will be good movies as the whole thing is clearly now just part of the Disney money making machine.RIP Star Wars. Mark Hamill...You were right to fundamentally disagree with everything done to your character.",0
910,"This Movie makes you miss George Lucas and rethinking your opinion about the Prequels. I actually Watched all Movies after i've seen The Last Jedi last week and now i'm a 100% Sure that The Last Jedi is one of the worst Star Wars Movies i have ever seen. I loved the OT and i even liked Episode 3. To be honest i like Revenge of the Sith more then Episode 8 and if Rian Johnson ever makes another Star Wars Movie, i wouldn't watch it. Disney and Rian Johnson killed Star Wars and this Movie felt like the End of the Saga. I hope JJ can save Episode IX, before Rian Johnson screws up Star Wars forever with his own Trilogy, that noboby wants to see anymore.I hate you Rian Johnson! I hope you read this and feel bad for what you did to Millions of Star Wars Fans!",0
911,What a waste of time. This movie was 2 hours of an OJ simpson slow speed chase through space interspersed with a 30 minute scene at a casino. While there were bright explosions at times you leave the film realizing that nothing has happened other than the murder of your childhood.,0
912,"Something fishy is indeed going on with critic reviews.  It's insane how well-received this film has been, both here and rotten tomatoes user scores are split down the middle while critics are unanimous with praise.  To the movie itself.  The in-universe plot-logistics are horrifically bad in this film and in fact insult the audience's intelligence.  The MAJORITY (>70%) of the movie consists of a long-drawn out chase scene between two fleets going on in the background, the First Order giving chase to the Resistance.  This is justified by the Resistance having moved out of the effective range of the First Order ship-mounted ordinance, thereby withstanding the barrage for longer.  Do what now?  THEY'RE **** SHIPS!  YOU'RE DRIVING **** SPACESHIPS!  MOVE CLOSER/CATCH UP TO THEM FOR **** SAKE.This single contrivance is essentially the core of the film.  It drives the entire plot, which involves the forgettable new cast LEAVING THE FLEET while it's under fire to find a computer hacker on SOME PLANET WAY THE **** SOMEWHERE ELSE to help them bypass the flagships shields to disable the onboard hyperspace-capable tracking (but without anyone knowing, because then they could transfer the tracking to another ship - oh but only one ship tracks through hyperspace at a time, like they can transfer it to another, but only one at a time can use it, so removing it from the one ship will work, just as long as no one finds out about it) which plan by the way they arrive at on the HUNCH that they have this simultaneously universe-breaking and incomprehensibly brittle tech in the first place.  That complete drivel will occupy, as I said upwards of 70% of the film.  The other core flaw in this film is Disney's refusal to take anything seriously, in the form of jarring Marvelesque quipping and tonal shifts.  The opening sequence following the crawl is by far the worst, or at least most noticeable example of this.  The First Order, upon arriving in their arguably menacing cruisers, are immediately established as the butt of ever possible joke to be made, courtesy of the striking and incisive wit of Po Dameron in the form of your-mom jokes.  The pure incompetence of the villains of this film, including that of even the once-somewhat imposing (we can at least give him mysterious, right?) Supreme Leader Snoke, is astounding and deflates any possible tension this film could have cultivated.This is not intended to be a complete accounting of the film's flaws, just the most grievous.  I expected to be disappointed by Luke's inevitable death, but I tell you truly that by the time that happened, I had long since stopped caring. This is a sad excuse for the continuation of the beloved Star Wars mythology.",0
913,"a film well filmed, but without spirit and far from everything that represents classic characters like luke, villains of jokes, plots of the previous movie wasted.",0
914,"Feels like a bad fanfiction, and it destroys everything about star wars. Especially Luke. The hero of generations is portrayed like a spineless scum.Shame on you disney, for me star wars ended after the return of the jedi. I have a 2 year old son, I will only watch with him the original trilogy.",0
915,"This movie was the worst flick of the year. Even if it was not Star Wars (which it sadly is) it would have sucked hard. The character development is non-existent. The plot writing is so absolutely terrible that half of the movie doesn't make sense, and the other half is completely pointless. I felt like the writers legitimately hated Star Wars, which would be fitting as they went on and destroyed basically all of the beautiful lore.That whole movie surved one purpose only: to sell toys and tickets. It's a hot mess and better not seen by anyone that loves Star Wars. Avoid like the plague it is.",0
916,a true sh*t they raped my childhood with this. and it is not due to the jokes or the small animals it is due to the completely loss of the star wars saga spirit. there are not true and well defined antagonists and too much holes in the plot.,0
917,"Pathetic sjw drivel. Visually exciting but really mostly boring and pointless. Way too long and a slap in the face to the original trilogy,. Really wanted to like it but left the theatre feeling empty and sad. No joy in this movie.",0
918,"To say this movie had plot holes would seem to suggest it had a plot. It is by war the worst Star Wars ever. I have never seen anyone actually get up and leave during a Star Wars. It’s not bad though. On a scale of 1 to Phantom Menace, I give it a trash panda. It’s worse. Way worse.The film felt scrapped together. Like someone at Disney grabbed scissors and spliced the movie together in an effort to make sense. The result was a hot mess of 2.4 hours that felt like it was trying hard to patronize fans based on criticisms on the prequels. What wasn’t taken into consideration was, like a fine wine, fans have actually come to understand the larger established canon. There are things in the prequels even regular folks have come around to appreciate thanks to the canon. Anyone who isn’t a fan would have felt they were in a showing of the Fifth Element. The movie is just “out there.” While the approach may work for a new film, such as Fifth Element, this is Star Wars and not a new film. It’s a legitimate and established franchise. There were established characters that had not grown. Literally. I felt as though I was watching Luke become a Jedi again. He was far more mature in ROTJedi than this movie. Relegated to a whining teen that felt that “things were not fair.” They failed in giving him the chance to make a grand entry and failed to deliver on the elusive question of “where is Luke?” That while effort of finding Luke seemed moot. Hamil could have sat this one and the movie still would have felt a bit more whole. There was no point in Rey seeking Luke in TFA. She pretty much knew all she needed to know. We get this huge build up of Rey only to find she’s less developed that she wasn’t in TFA. She’s not a legacy character. Her role felt like a teen scream role. She survives and can be killed off in the beginning of Episode 9. Pop in a new Jedi and repeat for another 4 films. This is how this movie leaves things. A soft teen flick ala Disney.I still don’t understand the point of Phasma and what exactly her deal is with Finn. We had this in the original trilogy a long awaited encounter between Han and Jabba. We knew exactly why from the beginning. Luke didn’t have the monies. The gangster saw Han as a son and part of the family.  As is typical of gangsters, one shall not dishonor the family. Jabba was going to find Han for his disgrace. This disgrace would one day catch up to Han and we knew it wasn’t going to be good. It would take all the heroes to settle this and that would not be good for Jabba.  With Phasma, we still have no clue why, out of thousands of troopers, she’s obsessed with Finn, a janitor. Like he is the only defector? Shirley there are other defecfors. These are just a few of the subplots that seemed unnecessary and not worth inclusion into the film. It felt like a extended episode of a tv show. If they didn’t want these sub plots to carry over, then they could have just left them out and put more into the story or made it 70 minutes long. Instead, it’s a 2.4 hour show about the tragedy of a ship lost at sea. We saw it in titanic. We saw it in poseidan adventure. Same routine. Someone is in charge and people don’t trust their ability to lead. Whether it is a ship is going down, a war that seems to be lost, or a plan that has gone awry, there will be descent on leadership. Typically it’s gives us something powerful and either the leaders will lament that they saw no other way or fall victim of their own devices. Here, we just have a sinking ship that also represents the franchise itself.Luke was wrong I’m the trailers. The Jedi don’t have to end. The franchise needs to end. We literally saw how the franchise dies. With thunderous applause.I left this vague to not reveal spoilers.",0
919,Star Wars: The Last Edge-Lord throws away the good work done by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens (TFA). TFA was a safe movie but it left a number of easy layups for the director of the second movie. Who were Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? Who were the Knights of Ren? Why did Luke go into hiding?Any Star Wars fan could have come up with satisfying answers for these questions that also kept mass audiences entertained and kept the money flowing in. Rhian Johnson (The Ultimate Edge-Lord) obviously hates Star Wars and this is his attempt to sabotage the entire franchise. Why didn't Kathleen or JJ stop him?,0
920,Absolutely awful worst star wars movie ever the prequels were better im not kidding Disney have ruined star wars im not interested in episode 9 now at all.,0
921,"Star Wars is dead. Not just now, after TLJ's release, but since the release of TFA. If the only means of driving the story forward is to denigrate and humiliate the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of the original trio then your story is trash and not worth telling. The characters are not worthy of their predecessors. Disney, Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson have done irreparable damage to the saga. It's because of this that the above four will never receive any of my money ever again. You humiliated my childhood hero, Luke Skywalker, and I will never forgive you for it. The Star Wars saga ended at the completion of Return of the Jedi. Our three heroes lived happily ever after and the shadow of the Disney juggernaut is but a bad dream.",0
922,I've tried. Really. But each day I hate this movie more. It's just a huge slap in the face. Really really sad. I've no idea how JJ Abrams can salvage this mess with just one movie. It's just terrible. There were boos in the crowd opening night. That didn't happen with attack of the clones!,0
923,"If you were alive for the original trilogy, don't see this movie, Luke Skywalker is from the Bizzaro world of Star Wars who acts and does things that would be so alien to the original character it's sickens me.  Disney makes Leia into Mary Poppins.  It's just a hot mess, with special effects and an OJ Simpson Van chase.  The dream is dead ladies and gentlemen.  RIP Star Wars franchise.  I don't know if there is anything in heaven or Earth that could cause desire in me to see another Star Wars film.",0
924,"I saw this movie and left in a state of utter disappointment.  Overall I don't think it a good movie, but further it is a terrible Star Wars movie.  The plot had holes you could drive a truck through, the attempts at jokes and comedy had terrible timing and either fell flat or felt out of place in a Star Wars movie, there was very little character development, and all the build up and mystery developed in the previous movie (The Force Awakens) was disregarded and turned into a big let down.  Luke Skywalker's portrayal was way out of character and to some extent a betrayal to the fans - Luke deserved better.  Finally, from the perspective of the fans, the mythology, lore and ""rules"" of The Force and Star Wars were ignored or disregarded which made the whole thing hard to accept within the established mythos of Star Wars.  The pace, timing and editing just did not feel like other movies in the series.  I think this is the worst movie in the whole series.  I was concerned when Disney took over, and up until now I thought things would work out as The Force Awakens and Rogue One were pretty good in my opinion, but now I feel like Disney ruined Star Wars by throwing out all the rules and the things at least half of the fan base treasures about Star Wars.",0
925,"I really hate this movie,the director **** on luke's character, and all star wars mythology.All i saw was a succession of incoherent moments and many boring scenes",0
926,A truly terrible film and a slap in the face of any true fan of the original triology or of decent film making in general. While not one for conspiracy theories I honestly have to wonder if many professional critics were incentivized to give a favorable review....or they were shown a vastly different film than I was.,0
927,"This is the only Star Wars movie that left me leaving the theater emotionless, unattached to the characters and without the need to see ""what happens next"".Many will say ""it broke new ground"". It did. But the ground it treads is of a very dark path. Not story wise, but film-making wise. Let me explain. This movie is a corporate statement from the creators, that reads:----.From now on:.- Instead of providing answers to previously set up questions, we will simply subvert, dazzle and destroy.- Instead of setting up insteresting story arcs, we will provide shock value and fan service.- Instead of avoiding plot holes, we will simply have characters acknowledging them and laughing at them.- Instead of showing the drama involved with galaxy spanning destruction, we will have characters simply mention key plot points.- Instead of establishing meaningful locations and characters with purpose, we will find technobabble-ladden excuses for nice trailer visuals.- Any interesting characters will only be developed in licensed games and books.---.This movie marks an era where the story is just an excuse for nice trailer visuals, where continuity errors are solved with one-liners and where everything revolves around selling toys. In this light - I never thought I'd say this - The Last Jedi makes the prequels feel like great storytelling. At least The Phantom Menace had purpose. At least The Attack of the Clones had long story arcs and held the trilogy together. What a sad development for the franchise and film-making in general.",0
928,"Que mierda acabo de ver? Innova para mal. Decepcionante y giros inesperados mal encaminados, Mark Hamill lo predijo y Esta entrega de Rian Johnson despierta interés para los nuevos fans pero destruyó a los viejos fans.",0
929,"I dont know whats wrong with this movie, but its the first time in my life where star wars did not make me overwhelmingly happy and i'm not excited for the next installment.",0
930,"The critic reviews are inexplicably positive.  This movie was a disappointment.  I was excited during the opening scrawl and by the end of the movie I felt as if no answers had been provided, the plot felt rather pointless and the character arcs were non-existent or shallow.  Luke and Snoke were completely wasted.  Leia had a terrible scene and the question of Rey's lineage was pointless (unless Kylo lied to her which could be possible, but doubtful at this point).  I understand that SW wasn't made for adults, but this one had far too many cheesy moments that made me feel like I was watching Phantom Menace again.I readily admit that I may have simply been expecting too much from this movie.  I hope others can find pleasure in it and I hope I can actually enjoy the next Star Wars film because I don't want to hate this trilogy.  The only reason that I am giving this a one instead of a zero is because of Laura Dern's death scene and the fact that I love Star Wars (and a few other moments sprinkled in here and there as well).",0
931,"A new director takes the helm of this movie and it shows. Unfortunately, he is somehow WORSE than JJ. Plotlines and character arcs established in the previous movie are abandoned or simply dismissed. Certain mysteries established in Force Awakens will be left permanently unsolved, while others have an anticlimactic resolution that would've been better left untouched. Excessive use of humor during serious moments fall flat and eliminate the drama of what could otherwise have been powerful scenes. Every new character doesn't contribute to the plot AT ALL, and just seem to be there to be there. Multiple plot holes are glaringly obvious, and causes a major subplot to be completely unnecessary and only seems to be an excuse to give new characters screen time. Overall, this movie feels rushed, and only released to sell toys for the holidays, and add new maps and characters to Battlefront 2. Best to wait until this movie is on Netflix, but even then, I wouldn't recommend it.",0
932,"This review contains spoilers.There's so much wrong with this film, it's hard to know where to begin. It feels like it was written by someone who doesn't actually like Star Wars, for people who don't like Star Wars. It's the same criticism I have of Star Trek Discovery -- it's not Star Trek, it's a new show pretending to be Star Trek for people who don't actually like Star Trek. For one thing, TLJ is a complete tonal mess. It's afraid to take itself seriously, and so it throws in inane jokes at inappropriate times. It also undoes practically everything that the previous movie set up. After finding Luke Skywalker, [it becomes apparent that he didn't want to be found, so who created the map that was the driving plot point of the first movie?](#spoiler) Snoke was set up as a badass villain, capable of incredible feats of force manipulation, who seemingly comes from nowhere. Okay, I can get on board with there being another dark side user on the level of Sidious being out there in the galaxy, so long as it's explained. But [they kill him off unceremoniously, and we're just left hanging.](#spoiler) I mean, Sidious was strong enough to fight Yoda -- a legendary Jedi master -- to a draw, which I would have thought was a big deal. Having some other guy on his level should also be a big **** deal, but it's never actually explained. Rey's parents? Again, just glossed over as a big **** you to the audience. Keep in mind, I actually like the fact that [she's not a Skywalker](#spoiler), but it bothers me that she has more raw power than just about anybody we've seen, which I'll get to in a sec.Luke Skywalker's character was completely butchered by the writers, to the point where I doubt that they've ever watched a Star Wars movie. Rey is a completely overpowered Mary Sue whose powers feel unearned, because even Luke Skywalker -- the son of Force Jesus himself -- had to struggle and lose before finally becoming strong enough to face his father. Rey is somehow strong enough to perform incredible feats with the force, despite zero training, because apparently she's just that good. Then there's the new general who goes out like a hero, but again it feels completely unearned because she's a nobody. And don't even get me started on the scene where Leia -- another force sensitive with zero training -- [manages to fly herself back into a spaceship like Magneto](#spoiler). **** that **** And of course, there's Benicio Del Toro's character, who made me want to post elephant dung to the director.There's just so much wrong here, I can't see myself going to see the third one. It's not Star Wars.",0

934,"Embarrassing. Pure ego service for the director. Rian Johnson took 7 films of story, and broke that story in a single film. Most of the tropes from the 7 movies - broken. Strong story elements from Abrams revitalisation of Star Wars - broken. Johnson came into this film like a spoiled child breaking other people’s toys. In the process of “making it his own” Johnson dismissed much of what is good in Star Wars. Furthermore, the story as a one-off was incredibly weak. A “chase scene” that took the WHOLE film. Introduction of a mediocre new character at the expense of character development for established characters. Bringing an immensely self-pitying Luke back in order to turn him into a force ghost. Flying Leia. Snoke as a non-entity. And is Finn an interesting character anymore? From the perspective of story it’s incredibly weak. In terms of spectacle it’s strong - reminding me of...prequels. I hope Disney takes note of the fan response. It will take a number of books and comics to make Johnson’s “story” work for Abrams to build on. Abrams is a miracle worker in terms of bringing back beaten, broken stories - but I’m not sure even he can salvage this. May the force be with him. I really hope Disney reconsiders Johnson for a trilogy...",0
935,This movie is trash. If you don't care about Star Wars at all you may like it. Its a disgrace to the franchise and should never have been made.  We want George Lucas back.  Prequels were better than this trash.,0

944,"My main problem with this film, is that it had a complete disregard for the mythology and the heroes journey as a narrative tool. Instead we got a really lazy attempt of the writer to be self-aware and postmodern. The story has no weight and builds up to anti-climactic ""jump-surprises"" (instead of scares).It tries to destroy tradition and mythology in a very cynical way and thats why I think many people feel trolled by this movie. Aside from that it also completely seems to ignore the logic of war, politics, science and leadership. I can go on and on, but this movie is weird and bad. And I'm going to stop obsessing over this and move on with my life. Bye bye Last Jedi...",0

We have a great Skywalker story, a good spin-off (Rogue One), great TV animated series - but we do not need more of this junk.",0
946,"LAME-LAME-LAME-ZERO ON ACTING-NO DEPTH-CLICHE-CLICHE-CLICHE-NO ORIGINALITY:  Film is more concerned about political equality than giving a real story. Actors are unappealing and the movie lacks true relationships between characters, no romance, very little good quality humor. Kylo Ren is a JOKE. Everything CGI lacks effort. Destroys the essence of the Star Wars spirit.  Rogue One was a quality movie. Why can't Disney recognize the quality in Rogue One over the last two episodes of Star Wars? I guess its all about the money now. Its unfortunate that the younger generation will believe Star Wars is about low budget comedy and open to any characters regardless of whether they bring power to the series. BAD-BAD-BAD.  Shame on Disney and Greed.  They must have bought out Rotten Tomatoes and other major reviews. The real opinion is shown in the overwhelming negative comments.  Only the first 3 original Star Wars that George Lucas created will remain legendary. However, Rogue One has my respect. BOYCOTT - BOYCOTT - BOYCOTT!!!",0
947,"I have loved every Star Wars movie so far, even with all their flaws. But this movie is the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen and the biggest movie disappointment of the decade. Spoilers ahead.This movie is just littered with plot holes, it feels like they scraped all their ideas from episode 7 and just came up with their own dumb ideas. The movie fails so early on when they pick up from where episode 7 ended. The introduction to Luke's character is insulting. How incredibly disrespectful to have Luke to throw his fathers lightsaber like that, just for extremely poor comedy. It is just terrible they made one of my favorite fictional heroes into an unlikable, cowardly idiot who apparently has not learned anything over the years. Sure he has learned some new powers, but apperantly he has forgotten everything from the Original Trilogy. He faced his own darkness and won, this internal struggle he goes through was so incredibly unnecessary because he has already faced his own darkness before. They pretty much just turned Luke into a worse version of Yoda. And the big set piece showcase at the end of the movie is so poorly handled that it comes across as a parody. And the worst part is that they also kill him off in the dumbest way possible... His motives also does not make any sense for his character. Such as he does not want anything to do with anyone, but then why did he leave the map for his location in episode 7? Why did he even travel specifically to the first Jedi temple for no real purpose? Why would a character that risked everything to save his friends and his father, somehow just abandon everyone? Even at one point he wanted to kill his own nephew and at the end he says Kylo is completely lost and can't be save anymore. Even Leia agrees with him, are you kidding me!? Luke who saved Vader, who was way more corrupted by the Dark Side than Kylo is, somehow just abandons Kylo Ren to the Dark Side... I never thought I would say this, but I really hate Luke in this movie, because I don't even recognize him as the same character. Mark Hamill is an amazing actor, but I did not feel like I was watching Luke at all... But enough about Luke, I got to move on.The whole story arc with Finn, Rose and Poe is completely pointless. It leads to nothing, or actually it leads to the deaths of a lot of resistance members. Had they not done anything in the movie, then it would probably have turned out much better. So why would I like these character now when they are just characters who make terrible choices that leads to lots of deaths. And why did not that Holdo woman just tell them the plan, then none of that would have happened.They also ruined the character of Rey as now she is just someone with no special lineage, but somehow she is beyond powerful even though she has had no training. I did not like that people called her a Mary Sue in TFA, because I always thought there had to be a reason for why she is so powerful. But no, she truly is a Mary Sue and completely one dimensional. I don't care anymore about her character anymore as she has not earned her powers or her place as a real heroine. It also cheapens the force as now it is trivial, anyone can somehow become more powerful than those who have been conceived by the force itself. Small kids can force pull brooms with no guidance or training at all.  And who is Snoke? Why is he so powerful? Who knows, they kill him off and leaves another plot hole. And he is like this super powerful sith who can connect Kylo and Rey together from across the galaxy... But somehow can't notice Kylo Ren betraying him in the dumbest way possible. And why did not Kylo Ren use his force powers in the fight that followed?The writing in this movie is just horrible. So many hamfisted plot points that makes no sense, pointless characters like Rose has way too much screen time for no real reason. One can say that the laws of nature and physics is important in fictionl works such as Star Wars. But when you break the rules in the same movie, then it is a problem. As we are shown that bombs fall inn space in the beginning, but we are shown that there is vacum in space when Leia gets blasted. So did the writers just forgo any form of logic here? There are some cool action sequences and visual scenes, the music and cinematography is amazing. But that is the only thing this movie has going for it and when the context that those aspects are supposed to enhance is complete garbage, it becomes irrelevant. This movie is far below average, I can't believe how bad this movie turned out. And it is baffling to me that such a stupid movie riddled with plot holes have critics praising it. These are supposed to be professional reviewers, how can they not see the glaring issues in this movie? Really shows that one should never trust them.I do have to congratulate Disney, you ruined the saga for a life time fan. I really have no more interest in this story anymore.",0
948,"Mas aya de que mi visión de los jedi es contraria al planteamiento de monjes que meditan sobre piedras, esta película es un insulto a los consumidores, empezando por el hecho de que corta todos los misterios que eran la base de crear una nueva historia desde que empezó en el episodio 7, ya no solo te insulta, si no q te deja desamparado, no hay nada mas, solo repetir el ciclo, no aporta nada al universo solo recicla lo que ya había, es poco mas que una broma; aparte de todo esto la película esta llena de una lógica absurda por parte de los personajes, sus estrategias militares son absurda y ese absurdo es previsible, solo puedes quedarte con cara de tonto mientras ves como la cagan, lo único que se salva son algunas escenas por su valor como fotografía y diseño y algo de buen simbolismo, casi como un cuadro porque una vez empieza a moverse dan ganas de pegarse un tiro.",0
949,"I thought Rey was supposed to be the main character but she doesn't do anything.  She just magically becomes a Jedi after less than 18 hours of training (her training was intercut with the slow-speed, OJ's white Bronco-style space chase in which they said they only had 18 hours of fuel left) and one lesson that she completely botched (she messes around with a lightsaber too, but Luke just watches her from far away--guess she's got that covered).  But what's worse is that she doesn't even really want to be a Jedi!  In FORCE AWAKENS, she's constantly avoiding the idea (when she finds Luke's lightsaber, she says, ""I don't want it!"" and runs away, and right before that she tells Han she just wants to go home).  And the force, to her, seems more like an annoyance.  She's always talking about this thing that's inside her like it's an ulcer or something that she's trying to get rid of, and when Luke asks her what she thinks the force is, she's really flippant and gives him some stupid answer about ""you know...lifting rocks and stuff.""  No reverence, awe, wonder or curiosity whatsoever.  Wouldn't be so bad if she eventually learned something and grew to appreciate these awesome abilities, but she treats Luke and the caretakers like total garbage.  Her only motivation for anything she does in any of these movies seems to be...well, I have to because the Luke Skywalker character in these ones is a girl this time.Then when the third act comes around, the movie just throws up its hands and gives up on Rey.  She all but disappears during the finale except to fly around and shoot TIE fighters from the Millenium Falcon's laser turret, which we've established time and time again is something that any character can do.  And then the final sick joke in which she lifts some rocks--her mockery of the force brought full circle--as if Rian Johnson was listening to Weird Al's ""Yoda"" while writing.I suppose I somewhat enjoyed the ending.  I actually didn't mind Luke's story in this movie--it's okay to let a character go dark as they age, no matter how good they might have been before.  But it was so Luke-centric that the other characters got sidelined.  I was really hoping the new characters--Finn, Rey, Kylo, Phasma--would be developed more in this one, but they don't do anything. Even worse, they don't seem to WANT anything!",0
950,"I loved this franchise and never disliked a single movie until this one. It broke my heart how our hero Luke was disparaged and his character ruined. The plot made no sense. I liked the visuals and the porgs. I had actually taken time off work to watch it several times, but instead woke up after Thursday night feeling heart broken.",0
951,"I waited many years to find out what happened to Luke Skywalker, whom George Lucas called the greatest jedi...and you have totally destroyed his legacy. Well done. Who the hell cares about any of the other characters?",0
952,"Citic score of 86? wow this website is seriously losing credibility. Remember these critics don't want to bite the hand that feeds them. Man did this movie suck. Goofy, vanilla kind of stuff concentrated at appealing to the mainstream audience to generate revenue from toy and merchandise sales. This trilogy is nothing like the original trilogy. Luke skywalker was very disappointing,he was a negative moaning winger the whole film. I'm all for race and gender diversity but this film has way over done it. A white hero, a black hero, an Asian hero, a male hero, a female hero but never two of each because that would upset big time company's who pay to advertise during star wars adds. They make more money appealing to the mainstream. That is exactly what this movie is. A mainstream revenue raiser with no originality that is carried by the SW name. Disgusting.The actors they casted in this movie look way to square and geeky to be real heros on film. Rey, the new jedi, looks like a person who just graduated from a university with a degree in accounting. Finn, the ex stormtrooper, looks like someone in real life who would never take any risk or do anything exiting. The new little Asian girl they casted, man she looks so square and geeky its not funny.",0
953,"Thoroughly disappointed by this movie. This movie just set up Disney to be able to get large amounts of money for the endless amount of Star Wars movies to come, by killing off the spirit of Star Wars, the Skywalker family. So many questions from the first movie that fans were dying to have answered remain unanswered. So many unnecessary moments, most notably the Finn/Rose ark, Rose is a completely pointless character that adds nothing to the story- and is simply a very confusing edition. The death of Admiral Akbar and Luke Skywalker are a complete joke- Admiral Akbar dies for seemingly no reason? They just mention that he died after an explosion, just to kill a beloved character. Luke apparently can just decide to disappear and die because he feels like it. When he died, I was like ""what happened? did he really just die"", big moments like these are vague and leave the viewer confused. They've killed off Luke, Han (and Leia will unable to be in the next movie). They killed the three iconic, original characters for what reason? To make a point that the new generation is going to fix all of the problems? This might be a good idea- if the new characters were even close to as interesting as the old cast. I can't say I like any of the new characters much. I still don't know what makes Finn so important, he was one of MANY stormtroopers and one day he just decided I don't want to be a bad guy? Can't any stormtrooper just do this? Is there a reason he specifically decided to join the Resistance? This- and many other questions, such as who are Rey's parents, (maybe that just isn't important), remain unanswered. The one protagonist character who had a good death was that lady introduced in this movie (can't remember her name), who sacrifices herself to blow up the Empire's ships. This would be a powerful scene if we cared about who she was. Also I really could not care less about Rey and Kylo's relationship. I hate Kylo as a character since he is a brat and killed his father and attempted to kill his mother (that scene was just very odd), which, someone trying/killing my favorite characters is going to make me hate them- but this movie tries really hard to make the viewer want to sympathize with Kylo. I personally do not. This movie ended with me feeling empty inside, and I really don't expect much from the next movie, but hopefully it can fix some of the terrible decisions Rian Johnson decided to make for this movie. I hate how these movies are pretty much made up as they go along- unlike the original trilogy which took a long time to prepare and make it as good as it was, with a lot of passion. Yes, you can't compare things/expect them to be as good as the original trilogy. But this movie, at times, made me want Jar Jar Binks to come in and fix all it's problems. This is the first Star Wars movie I genuinely disliked. Even the prequels, I thought had very good moments, and they did not RUIN the experience of watching the Original Trilogy for me. Whenever I go back and watch the originals- I will think about how Star Wars has become a cash grab, and all of the original characters were  and killed off to try and make a ""surprising, edgy"" and ""unique"" movie. I agree with what Mark Hamill said- I disagree with every decision they made with Luke Skywalker in this film. I disagree with him NOT BEING in the next movie (assuming he is not, because they seemed to make it clear that he is dead). That is a huge missed opportunity. They introduce Han in the last movie, and Luke in this movie- and they kill off both of them? To make Star Wars ""fresh""? Sorry, but no, they did this so they can continue making movies with the new characters for many many more years, until every possible income has been lost from Star Wars. They killed them off so that they could get rid of the spirit of Star Wars, a huge middle finger to the long-time fans. I also didn't mention the stupid attempts of humor and one-liners thrown in. A mother joke in a Star Wars movie? You can't be serious. This movie is beautifully shot, has great music, etc. This can be expected because it is a Star Wars movie, created with millions of dollars. I do not like what they have done with this movie in pretty much every way besides that. Hell, they didn't even answer why Rey is so good at everything. Why can she fly the Millennium Falcon? Who knows. Why can she speak so many languages? I dunno. Why can she beat Kylo and Luke in fights? Beats me. And they didn't bother to answer.",0

956,"A frustrating experience that casts doubt on the professional critical review process.  As of this writing, The Last Jedi is scored at 86 and has received 0 negative reviews from a pro.I, being a modest Star Wars fan, saw the movie having not read any reviews.  I went in expecting to enjoy it.  I left disappointed, wondering what I had just seen.  The movie simply does not make any sense.  Characters have no believable motivation for behaviors they exhibit.  Actions do not have realistic consequences, even in the context of the Star Wars universe where we suspend a certain amount of disbelief.  Story arcs that seem promising go nowhere, and others that might have been more satisfying are resolved in the least clever ways with no subtlety or complexity, lost opportunities.For Game of Thrones fans, the whole thing has a similar feel to the drop off in quality and depth between season 7 and all the content that preceded it.  Seasons 1-6 contained all kinds of amazing narratives.  The fabric of the story was complex, overlapping, interweaving.  Events connect across years in ways that are hard to predict, exciting & interesting.  In season 7, the internal consistency breaks down.  Compelling characters give way to big explosions, more CGI dragons and a complete disregard for rules that have previously been established in the fictional world.  TLJ falls victim to the same types of problems as season 7 GOT.  A combination of bad story telling and disregard for common sense ultimately doom the movie to mediocrity.",0

959,"Cultural marxism promotes post modern moral relativism as being progressive, whilst rejecting moral absolutism as being old fashioned, quaint or part of some patriarchal conspiracy. In reality, polarisation toward the light (or dark) is the very essence of spiritual evolution for third density incarnated souls. The polarisation provides the necessary catalyst for dualistic conflict and eventual resolution. Recognition and acceptance of the light and dark within ourselves is not the same thing as giving in to this supposed stalemate and accepting the ‘greyness’ of being. We’re supposed to strive for one extreme or the other. Obviously, only a very small minority strive towards the dark ‘service to self’ path.Why am I talking about this on a TLJ review? Well, the OT became so popular because at its core was this spiritual reality. People are starving for spiritual meaning and these movies tapped into this in a big way. It couldn’t have been any clearer who the good and bad guys were. The music would tell you if nothing else. The makers of The Last Jedi, however, have rejected this established approach to story telling within the SW universe. Instead they’ve produced a morally ambiguous mess.As interesting as Kreia was in KOTOR II, a grey Jedi is not something to aspire to. I certainly wasn’t one of these people who wanted to see Luke that way as it wouldn’t have made any sense given his existing story arc in the OT. Maybe Abrams can resolve the central relationship between Rey and Kylo satisfactorily in the next instalment, but its to who’s satisfaction I’m worried about. Given what I said above, I don’t think this is a good thing and is part of a wider agenda throughout Hollywood and other forms of entertainment to morally confuse people under the guise of being ‘progressive’. Obviously there will be people who agree with this assessment and those who disagree. I’ve just tried to offer one explanation to those people who love this, admittedly, visually stunning movie why many huge SW fans, including myself, despise it. The plot holes, pacing, dumb and jarring humour, bad characterisation etc. that have most often been mentioned as reasons for disliking the movie are not really likely to illicit such strong feelings. I would suggest that its more to do with a conscious or subconscious recognition of this rejection of traditional archetypal story telling within the movie. This is by no means unique to this movie and has become widespread in recent years. This 'blurring of the lines' is a modern curse.My biggest issue with the movie is the character assassination of Luke. The obvious deliberate deconstruction of one of the most positive male archetypal characters of the last 50 years within popular culture is a cultural marxist’s wet dream. It had to be deliberate as there’s no way this was the absolute best way they could come up with to end his story. This was clearly going to enrage the fans of the OT so why do it? Perhaps, to make Rey look more positive in comparison or to provide a backstory for how Kylo turned to the dark side, albeit in a nonsensical and completely uncharacteristic fashion. Whichever way you look at it, the character deserved a whole lot better.",0
960,What a mess.One of the most disappointing movies I've seen. Rian Johnson takes the viewer on a two and a half hour slow walk through what looks and sounds like the star wars universe but is actually something more akin to an episode of Babylon 5 or Battlestar Gallactica.Some truly awful new characters and locations including an atrocious sequence on a casino planet that has come straight from the worst parts of the prequels includingappalling CGI animals and children that can't act and completely misplaced social commentary. Its like they put an advert for PETA in the middle of this movie.Lets start with the main problem of this movie. It goes nowhere. We start the movie with the opening text telling us the First Order now dominant in the galaxydespite the starkiller base having been destroyed and we end the movie with the First Order in charge of the galaxy.Kylo Ren begins as a whiny brat and ends as a whiny brat. Rey begins as an all powerful jedi (somehow !) and ends as the only remaining all powerful jedi becauseshe now has the ancient jedi books or something.There is no progression of any character whatsoever in this movie. The new characters introduced are dull and uninteresting and the old legacy characterssuch as Luke (Mark Hamill you were right to fundamentally disgree with everything done to your character) and Chewbacca are given deeply unsatisyfing send offs or are pushed to the background.The movie seems like Rian Johnson was just throwing ideas at the wall and whatever stuck became the story. Where was lawrence kasdan. Where was the lucasfilmstory group to reign in these terrible storylines that are completely outside the established star wars universe.The worst part of Episode 8 however is that it builds no sense of expectation or excitement going to Episode 9. There is literally no point to the last part of this sequel trilogy. Who is the audience supposed to be rooting for ?? what storyline are we excited by ???? Rey an impossibly perfect character we care nothing about. Kylo ? the now completely irredeemable whiny brat character ? Some secondary background characters like Finn and Rose ?? Leia is the only legacy character left and she cant be in Episode 9 now that Carrie Fisher is gone ?? Just a terrible movie that has killed the sequel trilogy dead.,0
961,I walked out of the cinema after really angry. They really did **** on Luke as a character and Mark as an actor. Not the exit the most iconic hero deserved. I understand the need to move on from the Skywalkers for the good of the franchise but that was a joke. Also where were the knights of ren that were so nicely teased in the previous film?

965,"I'm left wondering what the point of bringing Star Wars back was at this point. TFA came in by just remaining extremely safe and following A New Hope, and attempted to bring in new characters that it then refused to explain anything about. With the promise of doing something new with TLJ you're still not explained who any of these characters are and told that it's a good thing that we continue to know nothing about these characters, the environment or even the story. Well it isn't. Rey continues to be no one, who is super powerful for reasons no one can understand, Finn still has no personality but he has a new friend, and Poe is supposedly a great pilot but a huge moron about everything else.At the end of this movie...did anything change? Did the plot go anywhere? Who knows...all I know is that it took all of star wars old and new and threw it in the garbage because it couldn't be bothered to explain where any of it was going. Ep 9 is going to be a disaster.But hey...it's gorgeous to look at and the sound mix is 100% better than TFA",0
966,"This is the first Star Wars movie I've sat through and felt bored, confused and just stunned at how wrong it feels.Characters are ill used, shoe horned in or disposed of at random without giving them any proper story arcs.  I'm a long time fan since the first one and although I enjoyed The Force Awakens, it was too close to the original Star Wars for my liking. I'm more than happy for the story to deviate away from the other films but The Last Jedi seems like it was written in crayon by a child who never saw the last one for continuity.After waiting years for Luke to return and do something interesting, the best the script can manage is that he confronts Kylo for a few moments, dodges a couple of lightsaber swings and then promptly dies back on the island he apparently never left. Ridiculous.Although that's easily topped by Leia floating through space and then knocking on an airlock door to be let back in after being attacked on the bridge of her ship.I can't begin to explain how frustrating this film is given that Force Awakens was competent and Rogue One was excellent; that demonstrated a decent story and the balls to let the main characters all die in the name of telling a good story.With Smoke and Luke now dead (although he'll likely cameo as a force ghost in episode 9) and Leia to be killed off next, it's extremely difficult to really give a toss as to what happens with the story next.J J Abrams, you'll need a hell of a lot of luck in pulling this back....",0

From yet another painfully blatant mimicry of the cantina sequence from the original trilogy, to ridiculous and unsatisfying answers to mysterious plot points generated from The Force Awakens, this movie is nothing short of infuriating. Not only does The Last Jedi give us a collection of annoying and unnecessary characters, but it also manages to effectively ruin characters from the original trilogy we already know and love. Not to mention the plot, which is all over the place and disregards all the rules of the Star Wars universe that the previous films have put into place. Perhaps the most frustrating part of all is the movie's inability to have even a moment of seriousness without being broken up by a ""witty"" one-liner that ruins the entire scene. This might as well have been an avengers movie. From start to finish, this movie is overly ambitious, nonsensical, and irritating. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to stand up and scream, and I feel sorry for Carrie Fisher having her legacy disrespected with this being her final movie. I have no idea how we could have gone from the masterpiece that was Rogue One to this steaming hunk of cinematic garbage. I'm scared for what is to come after this sad attempt.Congratulations Disney, you ruined Star Wars",0
968,"As much as I wanted to love this movie, it utterly failed to deliver on so many levels. Disney, in all its previews, advertised the film as a serious epic focused on Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, with no doubt some appropriate comic relief as always. What they delivered was a farce -- tripping over itself with excessive and ill-timed humor such that no scene could ever be taken seriously, even ones that were intended to be. That combined with frenetically paced cuts and transitions, too many new characters, and terribly conceived sub-plots (the codebreaker/casino debacle), meant the main story and characters were left undeveloped with few burning questions answered. Even the opening premise, equivalent to a slow motion car chase with the First Order chasing the Resistance until they run out of fuel, was absolutely ridiculous. Ultimately, the plot felt like it went nowhere, just like the Resistance ships.  Rey's supposed ""training?"". Didn't happen. Who was Snoke and why was he built up as so important in The Force Awakens? No answer. Who is Rey and are her parents even relevant? Still no clue. The relationship between Rey and Finn? Left languishing. Who are all these new characters? No time to find out (or even--truly--to care) despite the 2hr. 30 minute length.  Perhaps most unforgivable of all, however, was the treatment of Luke Skywalker. While a dark and withdrawn Luke was initially promising, his diminished role and ultimate end were insulting to his character and, frankly, made no sense. Disney will make a lot of money on this film so I doubt the significant criticism from fans will matter. Regardless, Disney can't hide from the fact that they had advertised and promised a new epic Star Wars film. What they delivered was a cheesy, ill-conceived, poorly-written caricature of one.",0
969,"There are three big questions this movie NEEDED to answer as part 2 of a 3 part trilogy: Why was Luke hiding, who are Rey's parents, and who is Snoke? The movie gave no answers for some, and the ones we did get are so bad they ALMOST retroactively ruined the legacy of some of the characters. This script should have never seen the light of day, let alone gotten made. Mark Hamill probably wishes he had vanished irl instead of being forced to make this movie out of a contract he signed years ago before the Disney take over.",0
970,"this will hit Disney come episode 9 with no Luke, they will pay. It was so obvious what the fans wanted, a wise, lightsaber wielding luke. We have waited to see this version of luke since 1983.",0
971,"This movie distills Star Wars into a series of action set pieces loosely connected by jokey one liners and fake out twists. It is overly long, disjointed and poorly paced, like they tried to cram everything in but the essence of telling a good story got lost in the mix.Nearing the end I realised I'd been groaning at how ludicrous it all was, instead of getting lost in the moment and cheering along. It looks like Star Wars...but it's not.",0
972,"Sadly, a big disappointment, even the prequels were better than this.Now i know why Mark Hamill said to Rian Johnson: ""I fundamentally disagree with virtually everything you've decided about my character"" and he wishes that George Lucas Had Been Part of the New 'Star Wars' I think the critics got paid by Disney.Disasster.",0
973,One of the worst big budget movies of all time. An abomination. Mind blowing how they could make it this bad. Shame on you. Luke is a gutless wimp acting like he was before becoming a Jedi. Yoda just appears to blow something up (but never to help anyone). Leia flying through space? WTF!!!,0
974,"I wish i could say this was a good movie but it was not, they essentially ended a trilogy in 2 movies along with my interest. I grew up with the original trilogy so this is very disappointing. it was on par with phantom menace a lot  of forced jokes unlike empire that was a desperate struggle with suttle jokes/ innuendos this was almost slap stick.  Blahhhhhh  no better than justice league",0
975,"I'm so sorry for Mark, George and all universum. They did not deserve it. All the time I waited for Adam Sandler to appear and start dancing. I'm sooooooooo sad.",0
976,"Heres a stat for you... BB-8 kills more ppl in this film than Luke & Snoke combined lol! This is one of the worst Star Wars films ever! Rian Johnson trolled us all, thanks for nothing Disney... Absolutely no character development, boring subplot, the Marey Sue continues, the horrid story telling...  RIP Star Wars 1977-1983",0
977,Heartbreaking to see Disney ruin Star Wars especially the character of Luke Skywalker. On par with the Phantom Menace. Movie was too drawn out and all over the place. Unnecessary plot lines and very little substance.,0
978,"It's not avengers, disney. I am so dissapointed after watching. This film has some good moments, but VERY BAD humor and some people making me to give this film only ""1""",0
979,"This movie has serious script problems. Laura Dern's character is rendered completely obsolete by Luke Skywalker doing later in the movie exactly what she does: sacrificing hersefl acting as a decoy for the rebels to escape. Benecio del Toro's character doesn't add anything to the story, it's just like a fake Lando. These errors are the most apparent, but there are just so much info in the story, so much plot twists and climatic scenes, it doesn´t quite capture the epic feeling of this particular fantastic universe.It's really dissapointing, in a way that even the prequel trilogy, with all its mistakes, never was.",0
980,"I don't think a single piece of entertainment has ever made me this upset. Not only was this the worst Star Wars movie to date, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I made accounts for IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic just to let everyone know how horrible this movie was. I will not sit idly by and watch people give such positive ratings for something that has effectively ruined an important part of my childhood. Rian Johnson’s Episode VIII is a disastrous failure for this new trilogy and irreversibly tarnished aspects of the beloved originals as well.I could write a 10 page dissertation on everything that is wrong with it, but that would be a waste of everyone’s time just like Rian Johnson’s 2.5 hour long movie, The Last Jedi. Furthermore, it should not take 10 pages to convince you that this movie sucks. The storyline is lame and full of plot-holes. The dialogue is forced and written for five-year-olds, and many of the characters are blatantly meaningless. Keeping those gripes in mind, my biggest problem with this film was the tone. It felt like this painfully long WAR movie didn't go more than five minutes without trying to make you laugh with some cheap one-liner or slapstick humor. Rian Johnson has taken one of the few things that I am truly passionate about and turned it into a joke. Do not be fooled as I was by the Star Wars label, this is no Sci-Fi epic; this movie is a comedy and a terrible one at that.",0
981,"This was by far the worst Star Wars movies of all time. The only thing remotely good about this movie was Mark Hamill's performance as Luke. Even then, there were moments that were not Luke Skywalker at all, but that is not Hamill's fault.Slight SPOILERS -What I watched was not Star Wars. It was some Star Wars characters in a world with misplaced comedy (if I can even call it comedy…), a bastardized idea of the Force where any Cindy Lu can instantly gain in-depth knowledge and control of it, and so many subplots I forgot about the main plot—which was… Well it was about the… Um. What was this movie about?Daisy Ridley’s acting ruins a character that could have some serious depth. It is as if the ability to fake cry and look intensely in any random direction shows us who Rey really is. I think I am actually depressed that she will get other roles from these movies.Adam Driver plays Kylo fairly well. It’s unfortunate they debased his character into a whinny, beefcake with daddy issues. I say beefcake because SPOILER shirtless scene SPOILER.Snoke. What a waste. What an absolute waste and that is all.The Force Awakens wasn’t the greatest movie ever, in my opinion, but it was the best attempt anyone could have done in bringing back a franchise. What it needed was a great sequel. Something to do some explaining, character development, and maybe some epic fight scenes. What they gave us was movie with a brand slapped on the back.I don't think I ever would have imagined wanting Lucas back at the story telling. We need Lucas. End of story. I won’t go further because it’s just too sad. It’s too sad to see something with so much potential settle on a trash compacter as their new home.",0
982,Disney should stop doing Star Wars' movies since they're ruining whatever legacy this series could have ever gotten when it first ended. It was a waste of time going to the movies and spending money on it. This will only be successful due to biased fanatics who would watch or pay whatever these studios throw at them.,0
983,"Worst Star Wars ever, if we can still talk about ""Star Wars"" again...Horrible humour throughout the movie. Destruction of the Jedi lore and spirit, apology of the ""no no need of knowledge to do everything""... Yoda is awful, Leia is floating in space like supergirl, a whole part of the film is completely useless... This is a nightmare.",0
984,"“I at one point had to say to Rian, ‘I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you’ve made for this character. Now, having said that, I have gotten it off my chest, and my job now is to take what you’ve created and do my best to realize your vision.’” -Mark Hamill (On the ruining of Luke Skywalker in “The Last Jedi”) Any of you happy-go-lucky Porg lovers gonna argue with him?",0
985,"Honestly, I don't normally review things online, but I had to post one here.  The movie is beautiful and the acting is good.  There are a lot of very strong moments.  The plot is very weak, and it's poorly edited.  Johnson was written into a lot of corners by JJ Abrams.  Instead of playing along and being creative, I feel he mostly threw out Abrams plot and decided to go his own way.  The logic tends to fall apart quickly and frequently.  While everyone seems to be interested in Rey's parentage, an area most professional reviewers seem to leave out is the problem of Rey's abilities, and how she got so strong with the Force in the first place.  Most professional reviewers don't talk about how interesting the idea of a stormtrooper becoming a good guy is, and how this movie wastes that storyline, if not making the character less sympathetic.  And the dashing 'flyboy' is castrated, his leadership arc making very little sense given the ridiculous plotting.  All of the fan boys, and I guess I'm now included, will get vilified as misogynists for disliking the decisions of the female leaders in this movie.  But just HAVING a lot of female characters shouldn't make this a good movie.  I like Rey, and I love Leia, but their development is tragic, and the new characters add absolutely nothing in terms of plot development.  There are great set pieces in this movie, and were it not for 30 or so terrible prequel-esque minutes, it's well made.  But it's gotta be far down the list in terms of rankings for Star Wars movies.  I'd say just above the prequels, but far below Rogue One and Force Awakens.",0
986,"Boring and poorly paced story. The occasion gags felt forced and out of place for the tension that was trying to build. It did nothing to grow the cardboard characters that were one dimensional and disposable.We are supposed to be mad at Poe for taking down the dreadnought (which could have destroyed the resistance cruiser during the space chase) yet cheer Rose as she stops Finn from protecting... those he loved. The plot was heavily dependent on Mcguffin after Mcgufffin, more so than any other film I have seen recently. I wasn't as concerned about Luke's fate or Leia's force prowess as others point out but I think Star Wars needs a good injection of new. However, this hackneyed drivel with a memorable positive one liner here and there was not it for me. The movie did nothing to draw me in. The remaining villains were too goofy to make me feel like I should be on the edge of my seat worried about the fate of the resistance. Hopefully, Rian Johnson will take his movie's message to heart and learn form this failure of storytelling.",0
987,"Haha, the movie that killed the star wars for me was surpassed in suckage by the ""Last Straw"". This is the official end of the franchise. You cant be a sane person nor a SW fan if you like this **** Do you miss the prequels yet? Do you miss seeing actual jedi and actual sith duking it out? Do you miss stories that are written to entertain rather than to push the progressive agenda? I do.",0
988,Total garbage of a movie. SpoilersJJ Abrahams said that 7's main purpose was to find Luke Skywalker the Jedi Master the Ex General of the Alliance - 8 makes Luke into a dull burnt out coward who doesn't want want to help his friends or the cause. He barely said anything to Chewie or R2 after what being apart 30+ years?Rey- still no training Yoda- Why botherChewie- still awesome the only character who is stable and wants to fight regardless of what episode he is in (probably JJ Abrahams favorite like Spock- the  sidekicks get a bump without weaknesses when JJ is involved)Benicio del Toro- what a true waste of talent aligned with this hacker in 8Rathter watch 6 and the teddy bears take the down empire with a couple side dishes of 1 and Jar Jar than watch 8 again or even attempt to watch the 9 and the solo movie. Disney ruined this franchise- wont be watching anything else by them- time for Indies.,0
989,"I have to change my review for this film entirely based on recent events and rewatches on netflix... I tried to give Disney credit wherever it was due with my initial review (4/10), mostly due to some stellar cinematography and special effects... but I'm out now, I am completely out.Plot holes galore, ham fisted liberal agenda moments, terrible writing and acting, the complete character assassination of Luke Skywalker, and lore-breaking scenes are just some of the topics that can be explored with no end to tear this abomination down.Critical Fan Backlash:The main reason I have come back to make sure this review is harshly critical, is simply because Disney has gone out of their way to blame fans for the poor reception. Rian Johnson, JJ Abrams, & Kathleen Kennedy have all come out publicly and attacked a fanbase that has absolutely loved and adored this series for years. I will not be watching Episode 9 because of this. Disney needs to face the facts, you hired a director with zero competence related to the Star Wars universe, who then pushed out a narrative that destroyed every subpar plot-line the previous instalment set up, whilst simultaneously destroying one of the most beloved movie characters of all time, and awkwardly inserting political agenda topics into a world where they do not belong or are not necessary. All this, and in turn, you attack the fans for the backlash of this movie and the failure of Solo???I'm sorry but Disney has killed this franchise... If you are one of the people criticizing passionate fans for ""crying"" out, then you really have no idea how much a franchise could mean to someone. If they do not voice their displeasure with the series direction, then they are doing a disservice to themselves. I absolutely loved the original trilogy, enjoyed the prequels to an extent, and loved the older star wars video games, so it does kind of bother me to see it wind up like this... But, I can only imagine the disappointment of the more hardcore fans...Characters:""Out with the old, in with the new"" is not supposed to be done like this... The new characters are absolutely awful and robotic, Rey is a mary sue perfectionist for no reason, she has not earned any of the traits she currently possesses and automatically excels at everything she does, Kylo is a gigantic man child and has no evil appeal to him anymore seeing as he lost to Rey in Episode 7 who has no training whatsoever, Fin had opportunities to develop but it went nowhere, Admiral Gender Wars served no purpose other than to emasculate Poe and conjure up the worst escape plan of all time, and Rose Tico contributed nothing to the story and had a sub plot take up a large chunk of the run time, and that also contributed nothing to the plot.Old and beloved characters... Luke is the complete opposite of what made him one of the most beloved film characters of all time, instead of instilling hope and overcoming the darkness, he wants the jedi to end and be left to die after contemplating the murder of his own nephew?!? What?!?! Leia, also a beloved character from the original, is a shell of herself and floated out into the vacuum of space without dying and force-flew (breaking narratives) back into the ship?!? Again, What?!?! Carrie Fisher, tragically passed away during the filming of the movie, and you could not even send her out with an ending she deserved... Rest in peace Carrie. Chewbacca, just eats the toys Disney wants you to buy... Admiral Ackbar just goes away, hard to remember his role in the movie because it was non-existent. Leave puppet Yoda alone please.Story:Rian Johnson singled handedly destroyed any potential plot points that JJ Abrams set up in the first movie and created several lore breaking moments within this movie, bravo. Hyper speed suicide bombing, WW2 style bomb droppings in the gravity of space, force flying back into a ship through a broken airlock without compromising pressure whatsoever... Just a few errors, many in depth reviews on YouTube go more into depth than I ever could. In short, the story is awful, good luck with Episode 9 JJ, you have nothing to work with...Overall:Attacking the passionate fans that support your series to the death was the final straw for me, I do not even consider myself a hardcore fan, but seeing them get attacked by the directors/producers for voicing their opinions is absolutely immature and is appalling to see. The best thing that could happen to Star Wars is to remove everyone on the project and rebooting for 10, 11, 12, if it is not too late already. Kathleen Kennedy needs to go, and while I will acknowledge that here are ""passionate fans"" saying horrible things to Disney, they should know best about vocal minorities, there is simply no excuse for this behaviour. This movie is now a 1 out of 10 for me because the cinematographers and graphic designers did a phenomenal job. Rest in peace Star Wars & Luke Skywalker...",0
990,"**** It seems they've read every fan theory just to make it differently to try and ""surprise"" everyone, but it basically made me lost completely all my interest in episode XIX",0
991,"A little bit about myself. I'm not the type to review movies; honestly I don't care. After seeing this movie, however, and being a huge Star Wars fan, I must say this movie was a total disappointment. I think the prequels were actually good, the plots had structures. This movie on the other hand, the plot is everywhere. It is difficult at times to follow and there are parts that could be cut out. The whole Rose-Fin adventure is stupid, and feel the movie would have a much better flow without it. In addition, the humor in this movie is awful, its too in your face; it should be subtle. Its like Disney was trying to create material for Family Guy and/or Robot Chicken so they have nothing to parody in the end. The whole Luke brushing his shoulder off was totally unneeded. This movie should've been darker, but the humor really ruined it. There were a few great parts in this movie, but unfortunately  there's more bad that overshadows the good. I was excited after The Force Awakens for the next installment. After the Last Jedi though, I'm not as eager. I just hope J.J. Abrams can fix Episode IX and wrap this up in a respectable manner. Disney should cancel Rian Johnson's trilogy because clearly he doesn't know how to make a Star Wars film.",0
992,"I'm heartbroken with what they did with Luke's character. The galaxies most revered hero was reduced down to a grumpy, old whiny hermit who didn't give a **** about anything that happens to the galaxy at large. Also Leia is Superman now?! ALIEN MILK **** WTF?!And what a waste of a villain Snoke turned out to be. Kathleen Kennedy needs to go!!! George, you may have had directorial and scripting issues, but boy did you have a vision. Something Disney clearly lacks.",0
993,"Seeing positive reviews from critics makes me scratch my head. Is it possible so many of them are paid bots? Otherwise how could they rate a movie full of MacGuffins, gaping plot holes and logical inconsequences rated as high?Hundreds of user reviews already stated what's wrong with this move in regards of storytelling, screenwriting art and simple logic. It has absolutely nothing to do with being ""not Star Wars enough"" or ""taking bold decisions"". So I am not going to repeat it here, stating simply it is just a bad movie.I've seen one fan joking after seeing this: ""Come back George Lucas, everything is forgiven!"", and if before seeing ""Last Jedi"" I would swear I will never say prequel trilogy was actually good, now I must admit - prequel trilogy has at least two movies better than Last Jedi, I know it is hard to believe! So either watch it and see it for yourself or just skip this Star Wars and possibly everything that comes after it.",0
994,"Like a lot of others I find the positive critic reviews absolutely baffling. This is just a bad film. Contains a pointless and boring middle act, lame dialogue, charmless new characters and disappointing use of the old ones (including those introduced in Force Awakens). I don't know what they were trying to do here but it really didn't work. And this guy is directing a whole new trilogy? What the hell?",0
995,"Characteristic features of the episode:- Pale characters- nonsensical plot twists necessary only to increase the time of the picture- Absence of any logic throughout the screen time- Constant insertion of low-grade humor- Not a single memorable landscape except for the boundless cosmos and island in the ocean, it's Star Wars?!- Music at a low level- Expansion of the character Adam Driver, regression - John Boyega- Large unrealized concepts of the plot, many opportunities are simply chopped up to the root- It seems that the film for children of pre-adolescence A bitter aftertaste of disappointment and a sad mood. The film is a description of the ordinary day of the new resistance. There are no interesting designs, there are no epic battles, no battles on light swords. Only a parodies.",0
996,"UnfortunatelThe logic of the universe is not true to itself. Im going to list a couple of things that annoyed me:-How come the other stardestroyers don't fire at the fleeing rebel fleet at all, they seem utterly useless. The first order looks like a bunch of amateuers just flying behind the rebels, waiting for their fuel to finish. Strategy is obsolete.-projectiles/lasers fly ballistically in space when shooting the transporters. Theres not even a star or an anomaly that affects the shot gravitationally.-Rey can resist the lightsaber force pull as well as Kylo? She hasn't trained and she's still new to the force. Kylo is a well trained Sith that can even freeze people and blasters in time. -can apparently forcelift bigtime. Without any training, she's able to do something even Luke with Yoda as his trainer wasn't able to do initially. All he lifted was R2D2 and a rock in E5. -can apparently shoot down tie fighters in the millennium falcon better than Han Solo and Luke Skywalker together, even though it was Han's ship and despite him being one of the best gunslingers and roguepilots in the galaxy. (they had trouble getting rid of a couple of tie fighters in E4, whereas Rey singlehandedly just shoots down a bunch of them)- She fights several guardians of Snoke, that even the unhurt and much better trained Kylo had trouble defeating.This is exactly what I mean when a genre is not true to itself.- Finn is almost completely useless to the main plot. His plans didn't succeed, he's a running coward that only when he almost managed to clear his bad honor got spared by his chubby asian friend. -How come the two of them survived the exploding/burning hangar, while everything in there was dead.-force using Leia is about the worst I've seen in the movie. Everyone that is slightly force sensitive can apparently master it. Even the kid with its broom at the end. Even Anakin Skywalker wasn't able to do this under much more intense pod racing situations.-Everyone that feels the force is apparently able to talk to each other. Leia, Kylo, Rey, Luke, Yoda. How come they never used that skill during the clonewars or during similar intense situations? All Luke and Vader were able to do was noticing their presence. But not across half the galaxy.-What happened to yoda? Did he show Luke how to do it? It wasn't explained. Obviously Luke found a way to materialize a mental clone engaging in a Lightsaber fight halfway across the galaxy-spending all his energy and dying.-Most unexplained and ridiculous of all was the destruction of Snokes main ship. How come a simple command ship of the rebels can just hyperspace charge at another ship, destroying half of the fleet? Isn't that what shields are made for? How come it hasn't come to anybody's mind doing the same trick before? It seems awfully effective.-One fighter can take out almost all the turrets on a superstardestroyer? How come he could sneak through the shields or he could even get that close? How come the other stardestroyers didn't jump in or attack the rebels commando ship?-AtAts didn't really fire at all. Just watching the scene with Luke a couple of minutes later, they could've easily spent that firepower either on the gliders or on the trenches. Useless.-Killing Snoke seemed awkwardly easy-Why is there so much focus on the Porgs? Its a new designed Alien that everyone apparently things as cute. But measured by the amount and factor of appearance, not contributing anything useful to the story, they are just useless. Even Ewoks or JarJar had more to contribute to the plot. One can definitely see that they have been designed for one purpose - to raise merchandise.- Countless ""funny"" jokes kill the atmosphere. After all, it is Star Wars, not Marvel. Marvel lives of that comedy. Star Wars had a macho rogue smuggler that was acted by Harrison Ford. Of course he makes some fun macho quotes. But not everybody. All the time. Facing death. Not even sarcastic but stupid. Completely killed the atmosphere for me there Disney.It feels like thrown into some ADHD kids mind. Super short mainplot with a couple of useless sideplots, action ALL the time to not get bored by story. Star Wars used to live a bit of intergalactic politics as well. And even if Disney hasn't really adapted the expanded universe, has much to offer. And potential. Not anymore.Couldn't care less if Finn or Rey or Leia or Poe died the next movie. Its about time. The true hero in this movie with at least a little bit of character depth is Kylo Ren. Critics just gave this movie a good rating because they wanted to be invited to the next premiere.For now, Episode 8 not only made Episode 7 look bad again -as there doesn't seem a big idea where the Star Wars universe is supposed to go-, it almost killed Star Wars. At least for me. And I'm hooked since the first minute. It's an action movie with some lightsabers and some forcesensitive people. But no real Star Wars",0
997,"After Rian Johnson’s dumpster fire of a f@cking movie, Who gives a f@ck! I’ll fix it. Instead of 18 hr space chase, (dumb), Leia surviving the explosion into space (more dumb considering they know Carrie Fisher died) the Resistance gets to Crete where they fight against the FO, think WWI Battle of Argonne forest, or the Spartans in 300. They are decimated. Finn dies in that scene saving the Resistance by flying his cruiser into the battering ram making the ultimate sacrifice. Luke arrives on Crete, leaving after feeling Leia succumb to her injuries in search of Rey who left Ahch-To prematurely to confront Kylo. There Luke connects with DJ who sneaks him and Rose onto the Supremacy to confront Snoke who’s holding Rey hostage and Luke dies fighting Snoke and Kylo in the throne room not before taking out all the guards and saving Rey who escaped with Rose and DJ. Snoke barely survives, Kylo is visited by force ghost Anakin during the climactic scene of Luke’s death. The End. How **** hard would it be to give fans a glorious death. Something to look forward to in Episode 9. “Nah”, says Johnson, “I think I’ll just f@ck the whole Star Wars universe up because my corporate overlords at Disney can’t market anymore toys and **** off the old cast. That’s what we’ll do.” They want you to think that so we build all the hype like we did for Episode VIII all over again. They (Disney) don’t even have to spend a penny marketing. Bloody Brilliant! Hopeful in-denial fans will create fantastic theories all over again just to get **** slapped in the face like we did in this c@nt of a film!",0
998,I signed up just make sure Disney knows I hate thismovie.  I'm not a bot or a fan boy.  But the paid critics pushing this movie and the media questioning fans because they hate this movie is why I will never spend money again on Star Wars.,0
999,"Only a fisherman’s net has more holes than the Last of the Jedi’s Plotline.  Who wrote the map to find Luke Skywalker? Especially since he didn’t want to be found. Why did Luke die the way he did? He just literally disappeared into the sun. Who is this Snoke exactly? And even though he could manipulate Ben Solos mind and even predict his every move, it was almost humorous him bragging about this and then Ben Solos killing him just seconds later. Why didn’t the First Order kill the Resistance’s transport ships all at once? Instead they pick one off at a time. It was so predictable that obviously some would escape. Why couldn’t Holdo simply set a timer for a lightspeed jump and climb into an escape pod instead of sacrificing herself? She could have survived easily. And why didn’t see tell her plans to Poe? Which could have avoided so much mess…… I could list a dozen more plotholes. Plus this whole movie just felt like far left liberal hollywood propaganda bullcr@p rather than Star Wars. If we are going to have a female protagonist then OK, great. But Luke Skywalker was supposed to be the “One” and he couldn’t lift one rock with his mind when he was getting taught by Yoda for WEEKS. Now this female protagonist doesn’t even get three lessons from Luke Skywalker and she can wield a sword better than most and lift hundreds of boulders. This film try's so hard to be all inclusive with too many political points that the scripts reads like an SJW's students essay on a Canadian’s college campus.1.) Strong overpowered female protagonist who is basically flawless and never makes mistakes? Check! 2.) female leader leading the rebels and can fly through space like superman “check”! 3.), The vice admiral being another female leader who looks like someone who takes gender studies with purple hair ""check"", 4.) Female stormtrooper who can’t get shot like a normal stormtrooper “check”, 5.) main character good guys being black, Asian, Hispanic “check” or white females ""check"", 6.) female saving male character and basically being smarter and making correct decisions “check”. 7.) Every evil character being a white male ""check"", 8.) white guys being made fun of because of his ""pasty skin"" ""check"". Chewbacca becoming vegetarian, animal rights abuses, diversity, interracial relationships, weapons profiteering. This is supposed to be a galaxy far far away!  I understand wanting to give us this diversity, especially if the film is so big. But it seems that these over arching plotlines and stories just to make the characters fit. Has left a Star Wars with a watered down story that nobody cares about. At least DO IT Right, at least develop the characters properly!. By the end of the movie I didn't care about any of it.",0
1000,"**** Disney, **** Kathleen Kennedy, **** Rian Johnson, **** Jar Jar Abrams (for the plagiaristic wank pile that was ""SW"":TFA), **** everyone involved in this movie. Feel sorry for my brothers that got hyped just to see Luke milking alien **** terrible acting, terrible attempts at humor, Rey yet again being all powerful, Snoke dying like a **** Luke dying like a **** and Leia dancing through space like a spastic, geriatric superwoman. The Star Wars movies ended with Lucas. Of course, the original movies are the real magic, but I must say TFA and TLJ make the prequels look like masterpieces. Will not be patronizing any more of this wank from Disney or any corporate ****s that only care about bowing to the PC agenda and selling merchandise and more disgusting films to kids and clueless ****s that probably find ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" engaging and tasteful. The plot of this movie was horrible, the acting was for the most part utter garbage, and the direction they are taking with the new movies forces me to disown these new movies. I don't count these new movies as Star Wars canon. The Extended Universe is canon. Good day.",0
1001,I feel like the real content is locked in a loot box.Seriously: This film is so bad i cant even bring myself to sum up all of it shortcomings. I am done with Star Wars. **** done.,0
1002,"Very disappointed after watching this movie which I expected dearly since I grew up in the 80’s with Star Wars. Many are saying it’s a new beginning and some others are saying it’s fresh air for the saga. I wish that were the case. I did not want Rian Johnson to repeat the easy JJ formula or just give fan service but he destroyed a beloved character and made a movie which script is lazy and not worthy of the saga.SpoilersI’ll only focus on how he destroyed Luke Skywalker who was for many of us a hero à la Superman.That image of him about to strike Ben Solo in his sleep because he felt the dark side in him. That’s not Luke! That cannot be Luke because Luke already proved in the original trilogy he’s a much better Jedi than his ancestors.It’s true that when the Jedi sensed the dark side, they thought about getting rid of its carrier. When Mace Windu confronted Palpatine, he thought it was best to strike him down and get rid of the menace. The same thing happened when Yoda and Obi Wan discovered they had no other choice but to confront (kill) Anakin and the Emperor. Needless to say, those killing instincts did not achieve anything.But then, in the original trilogy we’re introduced to this farm boy named Luke. And we fell in love with his character and his growth and development over the trilogy. After the great revelation where he discovers Darth Vader is his father, he confronts Yoda and Obi Wan for not telling him and when the latter tells him he MUST face him again (obviously to kill him) and says he’s more machine than human, Luke says “I CANNOT KILL MY OWN FATHER” and when he does face Vader, after being tempted by the dark side and trying to protect his beloved twin sister, Luke is about to kill him but stops himself from doing it. He turns off his lightsaber and says he’ll never join the dark side.And now this director (who claims being a fan) comes and envisions a Luke who was thinking about killing the son of his beloved sister and his best friend?Shame on him and what a way to destroy the Skywalker saga!You’re allowed to like it but hopefully you’ll be able to see why many of us DON’T.",0
1003,"Complete insult, wish I could unsee to keep my childhood alive... not only the worst star wars movie ever but also a bad movie overall, absolute insult",0
1005,"Disney's done it.   They've “MILKED THE SPACE COW.” The Last Jedi (TLJ) is a deeply flawed and darkly cynical corporate product.   TLJ is not a cinematic experience, it is a product meant for purchase, consumption and disposal, plain and simple.   Like Thor:  Ragnarok, there was a reason for the Disney's review embargo.   Disney and Iger did not want word of mouth to spoil opening day ticket sales.The last few months of Disney's social promotion, press junkets, ""leaked"" spoilers, marketing propaganda and dare I say, payola, were carefully crafted to blunt word of mouth.    Much like the 2016 Presidential election, TLJ will be a challenge to the faith of Star Wars fans much like the current administration is to lovers of democracy.Yes, TLJ is that bad.The Director-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, blithely abandons the old Republic serial style of storytelling, brazenly abandons the visual style of seven previous films and two television shows, and inserts the Star Wars DNA only to plug the holes in this creaky, soggy, wooden beaver dam of a film.   How bad is it?TLJ is so bad, that whenever someone complains to you about Jar Jar Binks, you'll be able to immediately counter and say ... ""I'll see your Jar Jar and raise you Episode VIII.""    Where to begin? There's such a rich vein of flaws that a graduate student of film could write an entire doctoral thesis titled ""Poor Film Craft in 21st Century Cinema, How Profit Trumps Process.""    Granted, Voldirectormort was handed a tall order to flesh out and explain what the makers of its predecessor in 2015 published interviews admittedly could not.   TLJ fails in that respect .   Don't believe the marketing hype ... there's nothing of note to spoil.    Gone is the classic Greek three act structure.   Gone is the rising action.   Gone is characters put in jeopardy.   Gone is internal logic.  Gone are many practical effects.   Gone is Star Wars, it is.   On its own merits as a film, TLJ is the worst example of 21st Century, Comic Book of the Month Club Cinema.   Granted, TLJ has many beautiful shots, but it doesn't have a single scene which has the gravitas of the epic of which it is a part.  The plot is a melange of tenuously related scenes driving to a non-existent climax and flaccid denouement.   TLJ's dialogue isn't much better.   Gone is the wooden overwrought dialogue from the prequel trilogy which is only replaced by pedestrian overly expository banter.    TLJ's greatest sin is that it's boring.   By the end of this film, you'll be begging for Senator Palpatine's astro-political machinations.   The most fascinating psychological phenomenon of human behavior is that of the blind obedience epitomized in “The Emperor's New Clothes.”   You see that in the eyes of the actors.  I saw it in the eyes of the stunned-into-silence fans leaving the theater.   December 14, 2017 was the entertainment equivalent of Election Night 2016.I recommend that you not pay to see this film.   You can find original Netflix, Amazon and Hulu content that's far superior.    Not that the major broadcast networks ever air films anymore, but TLJ is so bad I would say wait for it to hit ABC.   It's not even Netflix worthy. These are dark, dark times for cinema.  The success of Star Wars original trilogy was always reflected in repeat ticket sales, VHS sales, DVD sales and Blu Ray sales.   TLJ is an expensive straight to video product.   Yes, it's that bad.    You'll see it in bargain bins at a WalMart near you in the not too distant future.As someone who was there in '77, it's hard for me to say this, but it's time to let Star Wars go.    My hope for the Millennial Generation is that some independent radical movie maker comes along an makes for them their generation's King Kong, Gone with the Wind, Wizard of Oz, The Godfather, Jaws or Star Wars.   Just let it not be a sequel.",0
1006,Seriously sapped all hope for star wars from my body. My suffering from watching this film will turn me to the dark side. If Disney leaves one worth turning too.,0
1007,"All in all, I don't understand the raving critics. After I watched the movie, I read too many reviews in disbelief. The user score on this website, however, tells a different story. The story of the disappointed. Hardly any critic ""criticised"" the plot holes, the not-very-menacing villains, the ridiculous superheroine-moment... Maybe Disney finally merged with the critics, too. This movie ridicules the whole saga.",0
1008,"All I have to say actors and actresses are great but I can see why Daisy Ridley doesn't want to do Star Wars anymore after contractual obligation and Why Mark Hamil said at Star Wars con before he was interrupted by Kathleen Kennedy that The Last Jedi Luke Skywalker isn't even involved, and Also why Mark Hamil is fundamentally against everything Rian Johnson did to his character, Mark I should have listened when you tried to warn us instead I wasted my money.",0
1009,"Please don't go see this movie, it's better to finish the story by yourself. It absolutely destroys everything that is good about Star Wars and gives nothing in return. Complete garbage.",0
1010,"I thought The Force Awakens was as bad as a Star Wars movie could be. Oh how wrong I was.The main conceit of the thing is that the Empire can't track ships in Hyperspace until now so the Resistance can't just flee the bad guys' fleet and the whole plot revolves around how the Rebels are gonna escape that fleet bearing down on them (also, why couldn't the bad guys call in another fleet to head off the rebels? Do they only have 6 ships? Or couldn't a couple of those have made a quick Hyperspace U-turn to get ahead? No, I guess it makes more sense to just have them follow afterward forever). Um, except that if one watches, the original Star Wars movie, Vader very clearly tracked the Millennium Falcon through Hyperspace to the Rebel base...Secondly, Rey and Kylo can see each other across space through the Force? F*** you, Rian Johnson.Oh, and Luke can astral-project himself (with a spiffy new haircut, a change of clothes, and Han's dice) across the galaxy and engage in lightsaber combat (with the wrong color lightsaber, I might add). Again, f*** you Rian Johnson.The entire casino planet just aggravated me. Why are 95% of the characters human and wearing Earth suits? Are they in Monaco or a galaxy far, far away? And why are all the games exactly the same as what I might find at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas? (Because these filmmakers are the laziest group of hacks ever given the reins of a multimillion dollar franchise, that's why.) When you're making a 2.5 hour movie, maybe cut a subplot that accomplishes nothing and turns out to be incredibly annoying. Just an idea.""The Resistance needs you because Kylo Ren has grown too powerful in the Force and the First Order cannot be defeated."" I'm pretty sure Daisy Ridley said that exact line 3 times to Luke. Remember what I said about lazy hacks?The sequence on Snoke's command ship where he tries to turn Daisy to the dark side was almost word for word the same sequence from Return of the Jedi when Sidious attempted to lure Luke to his team. It's great in Return of the Jedi (probably my favorite sequence of the entire 6-film Star Wars universe), but when you simply rehash it with different characters, shockingly it loses all effect.I am so tired of Rey. She has no character arc. She is poorly written and acted. She simply gets swept along with events and doesn't really have anything in the way of motivation. All of the new characters lack any originality or life that would interest me in their journeys. Finn is so ""gee whiz, wow"" as to be annoying. Poe had the most interesting arc here, going from being the a-hole who got a whole squadron killed to sort of seeing how to actually be a hero, but every one of his scenes with BB-8 still annoys me and since every decision he makes in the film is wrong I can't really find myself cheering for him.Why did the black ball droid who figured out it was BB-8 under the inverted garbage can let the stupid little droid go when all his co-conspirators were captured? Is it because he needed to be free for his deus ex machina appearance in the scout walker to save the day? Oh, I see, it's once again because these are lazy **** filmmakers. Gotcha.The porgs annoyed me. Does this universe need more cute characters to do something stupid n the corner of the screen? And the fact that they, the ""racehorses,"" and the crystal foxes seemed to be sentient enough to have emotions of fear, empathy, and surprise was just stupid. If you want to have a semi-sentient animal that's fine, but three separate such species on three separate worlds? Give me a break.The special effects were even bad! There was a scene with Luke and Rey standing on the cliff face (her first lesson, I believe) where the cliff is so clearly a green screen it is laughable.And that brings me to Luke. If you've seen the original Star Wars trilogy, the core of Return of the Jedi is Luke's refusal to kill Vader because he alone understands that no one is beyond redemption. In the face of his own death he stands up to the most powerful men in the galaxy to bring his father back from the dark side. Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with every decision Rian Johnson made with regard to Luke and I fully see why. Like Jar Jar Abrams, Johnson does not understand who Luke Skywalker is. His first instinct would not be to murder his apprentice when he sees darkness in him; it would be to do everything in his power to bring him back from that darkness. This isn't even a father he never knew. This is the son of his best friend in the universe and his sister. There is no way he thinks to kill that boy; he would die before that.It's unbelievable just how inept Episodes VII and VIII have been. I'm honestly not sure I'll bother seeing IX theatrically at this point because the truth is I simply don't care what happens going forward in this Disney fan fiction garbage universe.",0
1011,"This my first movie review online I never bother review movies at all.However, this movie angered me so much that I felt like I need to write a review about it online. This movie SUCKED so bad its so horrible. This movie put scar in my heart an scar that may take a decade to heal. In this movie Rey parents are revealed to be nobody's and Supreme leader Snoke is a nobody and just killed of by Kylo Ren, that weak little wimp gets to kill Snoke by tricking Snoke rather than having 1 on 1 fair fight that should have been saved for episode 9. We learn Nothing about Snoke. Knights of Ren are never shown in this movie.Don't even get me started with Luke Skywalker Disney and feminist Kathleen Kennedy along with the stupidest dumbest director Rian Johnson who not only don't understand Star Wars but they disrespected the old characters of old Star Wars movies. Luke Skywalker is completely different character he is grumpy barley teaches Rey anything Rey learn to swing the light saber like a true Jedi all by herself in 2 days where in the prequel took more than decade for Jedi to be able to swing light saber accurately. Luke is fully disrespected in this movie. Luke is not only coward and a disrespectful person but also he is so pathetic that he tried to attempt to kill his young nephew Ben Solo while he was sleep because he sensed the dark side in him I mean is this really the same guy who went on suicide mission to bring back one of the evilest villain of the galaxy aka Darth Vader back to the light side. So Ben Solo became Kylo Ren because is not his fault it was Lukes fault and he is just a dark side user for no reason from the beginning. Oh wait Lia is also force user her ship get destroyed and she is a vacuum of space and she can fly like superman or better yet Merry Poppins. Somehow She is not killed through her ship exploding but she can fly in space like superman this scene with Lia is so bad you would think its made by some dumb inexperienced movie maker. Rey parents are revealed to be just 2 junker selling her as a slave for money in another words a nobody's so all these 2 years of theory of speculation were just for nothing and biggest waste of any Star Wars Theorist time along with Snoke as well since he is killed and we learn nothing about him. Rey not only becomes one of the strongest force user and saber duelist but she does all of this in 2 days without learning anything from Luke Skywalker she even abandons Luke Skywalker and leaves due not learning anything and she even beats Luke Skywalker in 1 on 1 duel which is so stupidly done. Fin and the new Character Rose story is pointless and stupid as well and their story arc only gets no where other than Rose falling in love with Fin after just meeting him for 12 hours in the story. Captain Phasma comes back with zero character arc only to die a few minutes later by Fin some people say she is alive but at this point is pointless to bring her back for 3rd time just to kill her again and the actress who plays her Gwendoline Christie is very talented but just like force awaken she is a wasted opportunity and speaking of wasted opportunity Benicio del Toro character of DJ (lamest name ever in Star Wars) plays this pointless hacker character that is suppose to be a terrible copy of what Lando Calrissian betrayal arc in Empire Strikes Back where he betray Fin and Rose and just leaves the story pointlessly where as in Empire Strikes Back there was so much emotion between Han and Lando being best friends but in this movie del Toro character DJ is that character you don't care or have feeling despair and anger for betraying Fin and Rose. If del Toro played admiral Thrawn would have been so much better than this shallow character. The new planets in this movie are completely soul less I don't even understand why some people say this movie looks amazing visually because it does not look amazing visually the prequels had way better visual than this movie can ever have. Also the movie has barley any music score in it as if Disney decided to scratch the idea of giving an amazing and memorable music not just in this but Rogue one and Force Awaken as well.This movie will not only make you uninterested and unexcited for episode 9 but also puts scar in your heart by betraying and disrespecting everything the original Star Wars Trilogy stood up and will even make you not wanting to watch the original trilogy because whenever you watch the original trilogy you realize how pointless the outcome of everything Han, Luke and Lia worked so hard will be. Also Rey is the worst Star Wars protagonist she is good at everything with no hard work or training, she never goes through any hardship like Luke and Anakin and also the idea of self sacrifice for greater good is completely dead in this move. If I could I would vote this movie -8/10 its one of the worst sequel ever made and one of the worst movie ever made. This movie will go down as the worst Star Wars movie of all time.",0
1012,Feminism + Disney totally ruined Star Wars. Men are described as reckless and foolish. Women can learn Force without any effort and are wise. Sith and Jedi are nothing. THIS IS THE WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER.,0
1013,"Fundamentally the movie plot is ridiculous and beyond silly.TLJ is taking a huge dump on every SW Movie that came before it, even TFA.The best advice or message I can give you is: Don't expect much and you will enjoy it more. Cause with great expectations comes even greater disappointment",0
1014,"Filme ruim, muito longe demais de um verdadeiro Star Wars, a Disney se segurou para não estragar a série no 7, Abrams fez o melhor filme de Star Wars, mas agora esse EP 8, não explora o potencial dos Cavaleiros de Ren, a atriz que faz a Leia morreu e o que faz o Luke ainda esta vivo, mas o que eles escolhem fazer? escolhem desvalorizar quem esta vivo, jogam o cara que derrotou Dark Vader para último plano, pregam cotas de leptina e pregam que o capitalismo é a besta do apocalypse. A Rey uma excelente personagem se torna uma retardada mental, e tem sinestesia sobre a psicopatia de Kylo Ren, simplesmente Han Solo morreu em vão. Se fosse pra fazer um filme assim era melhor ter cagado no EP7, logo ninguém teria expectativa no EP8, agora pegar todo um público antigo e enganar, fazendo o EP 7 dizer que Star Wars voltou, e depois chegar no 8 e ser essa decadencia, PQP, não sinto nem um pingo de vontade de assistir novamente.",0
1015,"This movie should renamed as ""The Last Star Wars"".This movie was awful written...In my opinion the hole movie missed a nice story.  Rian Johnson could not finish new ideas and story plots, because jj Abrams had him in control with his plans for star wars episode 9.",0
1016,"This movie was a complete bloated mess, lacking any cohesion or sense. An utter waste of time. Every character is written as an incompetent moron and the attempts at humour are atrocious. To be honest I do not understand what anyone would gain from watching this movie, it feels like anyone could produce a better attempt at writing a more engaging plot with these characters. This is real let down from Johnson's  previous work.",0
1017,STAR WARS EPISODE VIII The PC AwakensBoring new character Ridiculous story line and annoying small creaturesSpoil all settings and fundamentals base on original SW series.I FEEL TOTALLY SAD :(,0
1018,"This disappoints on many levels.  As a movie in general, it is slow and just too long.  I didn't care about any characters.  As a Star Wars movie it lacks the fun and adventure I enjoy.The oddest thing were the attempts at comic relief.  They were all so poorly timed and not funny that they really detracted from any drama that may have built up.  It reminded me of when Leslie Nielsen would come into the cockpit when the plane was crashing in Airplane but that was funny and appropriate. Don't worry about spoilers because NOTHING interesting happens.",0
1019,"I thought the force awakens was bad, but this was even worse, what happened to star wars. Old iconic characters cheapened, a plot that is a mess and no compelling new characters to replace the old they killed off",0
1020,"The critic reviews are utterly inexplicable.  Kermode even liked it, I can't understand.  On almost every level this movie is a train wreck.  ..Where to begin.  Ok, so there's a moment of continuity failure that was so bad I actually had to turn the person next to me to confirm I hadn't had a stroke, blacked out for 10 minutes and missed a section of the film.  One moment Rey is on Snoke's flagship and the next she's somehow on the Millennium Falcon.  It's bad, really, really bad.  ..And that's the problem with this film - there are countless, and I do mean countless, moments like that.  I'll try and pick out a few which haven't gotten a mention on these user comments.  Luke Skywalker appears to have developed a severe form of schizophrenia.  While much has been written about how he displays none of the virtues of OT character, what confused me more was the total lack of logical consistency of the character we were presented here.  There's a scene where he literally lights a flare and walks up a set of steps intent on burning down the original Jedi temple, complete with the Jedi texts (a MacGuffian that actually hold absolutely no purpose in the film making this an utterly meaningless gesture).  He then hesitates and Yoda, who appears for no other reason, blows up the treebased temple with a lightening strike.  Now forget how incredible dumb this is.  How there are any number of countless other moments in time where it would have been fortuitous for Yoda to appeared as a deux ex machina to save the day with this completely ludicrous ability.  No, banish that piece of **** story writing, instead focus on Luke having a full on schizophrenic episode and immediately mourning the loss of the sacred texts which he moments earlier was on a mission to destroy himself.  I can only assume he now suffers from an undiagnosed, DSM V definable mental condition.What else?  On there's mountains, absolute mountains of stuff.  Pit of Sarlacc sized plot holes.  So they're chasing the remains of the Resistance fleet .... ok.  Why not hyperspace jump ahead of them and close the net?  Basic, basic stuff.  Primary school level stuff.  Why not launch your Tie-Fighters?  These are capital ships.  In modern warfare it's like saying the aircraft carrier could outrun the F-18 fighter jets that it hosts ..... basic, basic stuff.  ..What else?  Ok so I'll close with the Snoke issue.  So forget that he has no back story.  Forget that all those threads, that in retrospect where actually quite well constructed in The Force Awakens, were cut abruptly short.  Ignore the fact that Snoke literally claims that he read minds and has demonstrated this power minutes earlier.  Ignore it all.  Instead focus on how Rian Johnson has left the director of Episode 9 completely screwed.  The big bad is gone, replaced with a whinging emo child.  While Driver deserves the least amount of abuse for the work he's put in, his character is a sad joke.  Till the end Palpatine and Vader were unquestionably capable.  Deserved of the respect they they commanded.  Undeniably the end bosses of the series.  Kylo Ren on the other hand has been systematically owned by almost every character in Episode 7 and 8.  He barely saw off Finn at the end The Force Awakens.  Snoke shamed him infront Rey and his elite guard.  Rey smacked him around with zero training.  Luke basically gives him the finger in the final confrontation, which wasn't actually a confrontation.  Until Snoke's death, even General Hux commands more respect than him in the First Order. ..He is a near constant failure.  He is ... Christopher Moltisanti from The Sopranos.  He is the family **** up.  ..Indeed his facial scar is a constantly remainder of how weak he is .... but he's the big bad we've got to look forward to in Episode 9.  In the pantheon of great villians, while people will for decades speak of Vader in the same breath as the Id from Forbidden Planet, Hans Grubber and Hannibal Lecter, Kylo Ren comes in about as credible as Arnold's Mr Freeze from Batman & Robin and as capable as the two dumb dumbs from Home Alone.  ..It's now very clear why Colin Trevorrow was let go from directing Episode 9.  He clearly rocked the boat by pointing out what a cluster**** he was inheriting from Johnson.  I never thought I'd say this but JJ Abrams has my sincerest sympathies.  While after watching The Force Awakens I left the cinema enraged because of the unoriginality of simply ripped off Episode 4, at least it was well made and setup future movies.  It felt like a Star Wars movie, a near scene for scene, dialogue for dialogue rip of A New Hope, but a Star Wars movie all the same.  The Last Jedi however kills the saga in its tracks.  ..I say this with tears in my eyes and vomit in my throat but ... the prequels were better constructed, more coherent and added more to the saga than this monstrosity of a film.  It really is a dreadful mess.",0
1021,"First rating on metacritic. Any other movie and I might have given this 5/10, but I'm so bitterly disappointed this is the only Episode VIII we're going to get. Whenever I think back on it I get more and more annoyed.",0
1022,"1 point for Carrie and John Williams' soundtrack. A soulless, grotesque shell of what Star Wars used to be. The writing and dialogue is bland and even cheesy at times. And the worst thing is the lack of vision for beloved, franchise-defining characters. I'm so, so sorry for everyone who made Episodes 1 - 6 such amazing experiences. Disney, please stop!",0
1023,"Just like The Force Awakens before it, this movie is another example of big budget fan fiction. Completely disregarding the mythic nature and scope of this fictional universe, the character and story. The arrogance that was displayed before by ignoring George Lucas' story for the sequel trilogy, thinking they knew better about his own imaginary universe, is brilliantly materialized here, with the powers that be completely ignoring the classic character arcs and defining traits. Before, it was Han Solo that was reverted back to the selfish life of a smuggler. Now, it's the compassionate and selfless Luke Skywalker that secludes himself in fear and considers commiting murder based on a possible future. Besides disregarding characters and story, it also plagiarizes The Empire Strikes Back (not unlike The Force Awakens did before). The Empire vs Rebels on Hoth is displayed here. So is the secluded Jedi Master (except where Yoda did it out of necessity, here it's done out of choice) reluctant to train a Jedi wannabe, along with many other things. There's also no story or emotional investment in the characters. I was apathic through the whole thing. Questions needlessly created by The Force Awakens are not only not answered but ignored. It's a mess.",0
1024,"So we're supposed to believe that Luke, the earnest, selfless hero of RotJ both 1) tried to kill a kid while he was sleeping, after refusing to kill DARTH VADER HIMSELF, 2) ran and hid on an island, abandoning his friends when they needed him most, and 3) wants to destroy all the knowledge of the Jedi, in a fit of old man pique? I'm sorry, this completely ruins this new trilogy for me. All I wanted was awesome Force scenes from Grandmaster Luke, instead he just makes an Escape From LA hologram of himself? MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.",0
1025,"The whole movie was a mess.  There was so much copy and paste from RotJ and Empire.  Way too many illogical moments.  Humor at the wrong moments.  Lack of explanation, and awful world building and pacing.  This movie would be awful as a standalone scifi film let alone a continuation of the Star Wars Franchise.",0
1026,"Another Disney fan fiction more concerned with profit than the universe they bought. Again we see another predictable death to conclude the chapter, as fan favourites take a back seat to one dimensional token characters. Former trademarks of the franchise such as lightsaber battles and epic narratives are exchanged in this edition for a romantic comedy's worth of humour, shoe-horned into the film at the most inappropriate of moments. The big questions remaining from the previous installment are either brushed aside or ignored in a strange attempt to belittle fans who actually enjoyed episode VII. The future of the franchise is bleak if the last three films are any indication, as it is blatantly obvious Disney is not prepared to put in the work required to make a great film along the lines of Lucas' work and is merely concerned with cashing in on their purchased logo.",0
1027,"STARWARS is on life support. All the old characters need to go, Luke and Lea looked completely washed up. The new Characters are a joke, it's like they were hired by HR to fill diversity quotas. Even my daughter wanted to leave near the end.",0
1028,"Spoiler free, this installment of Star Wars was in a word, disappointing. The plot has more holes than swiss cheese. The movie neglected the fact it was the second act in a three part trilogy and chose to gloss over just about every mystery Episode 7 presented. The characterization of the classic characters was abysmal and the new characters fared little better. Ultimately this will go down as one of the, if not the, worst installment of the Star Wars saga.",0
1029,"Fatuous and insipid story-telling - TLJ left all of us dumbstruck and emotionally deflated.Kept thinking...now the movie will start to get good (and then it ended)Poor/uneven pacingTerrible script with nonsensical conversations. Inexplicable actions.Ruinous cringe-worthy sophomoric and inappropriately-timed slapstick throughout. Took away any sense of mysticism, gravitas, and wonder/awe that was the hallmark of the SW universe.Completely unimaginative, and rip-off of episodes 5/6 poorly gelled togetherWeak ""bad-guys"" that looked more like they need to be put to bed early without dinner rather than be feared or dreaded. No way these guys could go one weekend without being over-thrown by a million middling aliens with ambition.Risible annoying minor characters introduced for no point on side tales that went nowhereAbuse of a generation spanning icon (Luke) who is reduced to a character from grumpy old men and then ""dies"" for no reasonA pathetic purple haired leader who chooses not to let her crew know her (pathetic) plan and then forgives/forgets blatant mutiny in a casual mannerThe list goes on....WORST OF ALL: It was an insult to the audience/viewers. THERE WAS NOTHING NEW! They have hundreds of millions of dollars to make something novel, and exciting and awe-inspiring. They basically retold the SAME STORY. Can't they think of anything new? Continue to retool same story over and over. I have zero talent - but I bet I could have come up with something more interesting and inspiringThe only way to like this film is to be someone who has never seen any prior SW films. Or, on the converse be so brain-washed enamored with the lore/history and childhood wonder of the prior films that you just can't see this film for what is its - an abject failure at all levels. And I...wanted to love the film. I left feeling INSULTED",0
1030,"It feels like Disney are dead set upon destroying the Star Wars franchise people grew up with. They have turned Luke from a optimisitic young farmer who manages to escape the tyranny of the empire only wanting to make the world a better place. Into a bitter old hermit who has apparently tried to murder a young boy in his sleep. I absolutely loved Rogue One so i know its not me refusing to accept the new Star Wars movies.

Kathleen Kennedy is the worst successor to George Lucas because they has zero artistic instinct, but she knows how to make tonnes of money.",0

1034,"I was going to write a very poignant review, but it can really be summed up in two words: IT SUCKED! Star Wars has lost all of its magic, and for what? Mass appeal? Instead of ruining a cultural icon, why couldn't you just create a different franchise? Disney, you took this beautiful glowing universe with so much potential...and you sucked out its soul. Should be renamed - Star Bores: The Last SJW. Lame!",0
1035,"As an older fan hoping to be taken in an exciting new direction by this promising-sounding Star Wars film, I left feeling disappointed in every respect by the script. The remainder of the production - acting, music, VFX and direction, were all excellent - but as a narrative it was a pitiable disaster. The worst of all possible outcomes for a movie audience is to end up not caring about the characters, and that is where this travesty of a film led me.  All surface and no depth = wasted opportunity.",0
1036,Awful awful awful waste of star wars characters. A space opera that is singularly the worst drivel to ever be used as a continuation of an epic story like Star Wars. The need to place emphasis on characters that have NO background or proper story arc is beyond comprehension. Yes the midichlorians from Episode 1 are a joke but what has been done to the gaping plot holes in the last two films (not including Rogue One) is a travesty. Snoke? Dead...no explanation as to who or what he was. Luke? A broken shell of a man who never redeems himself (in terms of the character). Kylo and Rey? WHO CARES...... Thanks disney youve destroyed my childhood. I saw a copy of Episode 4 in a store the other day and got a stomach ache.... Look what you've done...,0
1037,I really should not have come out of this.Why would you do this?It is a movie that should not have really come out of a complete betrayal of Star Wars fans.The film director does not know what message he wants to convey,0
1038,"Here i will give you some quick easy stuffs:1.- Poor, weak, mediocre and bad story2.- Lame jockes that not even a 12 y old one would like3.- Characters with lack of personality and carisma, easy forgetable crew4.- Skywalker relevance turned into nothing, just like Han Solo's in the previous film5.- I am very worried about films and videogames going to the toilet, most of them are resulting in mediocre things since 2005, at this pace we will only have 6 rated thingsand people will be ok with it, gee......",0
1039,"Sad to see that they pay most of they official reviews to get a good score,non of people who watched rate it high must say its good move but this is not a star wars movie at all its some galaxy war movie. what makes star wars is jedi (sith), the mystery of force, the character and they stories.The movie starts in meaningless space battle, bombers and running out of fuel (wtf is this ww2 movie) and they run from order and they are chasing them but cant catch them, then they came whit some plan including some guy in space casino (las vagas) that casino was so out of star wars character, Star wars is not about money and rich people, and to make mothers worst that whole scene ad no point to story at end at all. Luke was so off character, non of his actions or words resemble the teachings of obi wan and yoda (jedi).Living on some rock waiting to die. Luke and Snoke die so meaningless deaths, at least they should let Luke and Snoke fight in some epic fight, and if one of them die i can live whit that but this. kylo ren is just so bad character like my friend say""i could come and slap him"" he have no charisma or aura of fear or respect around him,when you see vader and palpatin you could feel the dark side and Rey why was she in this movie she feels more like filler character lol",0
1040,"Everything was said, perhaps the dumbest movie I've seen in recent years. I just want to write to all facebook fans of this crap, you're destroying Star Wars together with Disnye.",0
1041,"Absolutely horrible.  Luke cuts himself off from the force?? I had to walk out to calm down a little.  Rey STILL has no training, yet she is just as powerful as Kylo Ren??  Luke couldn't levitate an x-wing under the tutelage of Yoda, but Rey can levitate a hundred boulders, again, with NO training??  Leia flies through space?? What is this nonsense? We wanted an original STORY, not a copy of a past movie, like The Force Awakens copied A New Hope.  An original story does not mean forsaking everything the original movies were about.  Luke would NEVER cut himself off from the force and go into exile, it's ludicrous.  And how about the tremendous disappointments of NOT finding out who Snoke is, or where he came from, or the terrible reveal about Rey's parents? I could go on forever and would have walked out of the movie theater if not for the hope that I would get to see Luke do something powerful at the end, only to be tricked into thinking something great was about to happen only to find out Luke isn't even present when he fights - if you can call it a fight - Kylo Ren. This killed Star Wars for me and I have no interest in seeing any further Star Wars movie and I've been a fan since I saw the original in the movie theater as a kid.",0
1042,"the movie is like marmite you're either going to love it or hate it. as a passionate star wars fan this movie really missed the mark I'm still confused over the writing and general plot direction, the feature was plagued with unnecessary jokes and failed to utilise important characters to their full potential.although there are some great visual scenes like the throne room fight and the fight on the salt plains, poor character development from the likes of phasma, finn, Luke and Snoke left me questioning the script and it didn't feel like a star wars film anymore.if youre planning to watch the film don't go in with any expectations don't get me wrong its good as a film but not part of a story trilogy",0
1043,"Poor & empty story arc.  Starts well but falls down very quickly after that.  Poor use of characters.  Continuation of story arc of previous films dismissed for nothing.  Visually it was stunning though lacked that 'Galaxy Far Far Away'  feel to it as everything felt familiar in an unexciting way.  Some parts worked well but for some reason the writers and director decided to through out all the history and cannon material that the Star Wars universe is built on, just to make there own rubbish up.  Very poor effort at story telling.",0
1044,"#CorporateCinema #MaryPoppins Clunky dialogue, wasted characters, plot holes galore, and sometimes just boring. I'm a huge Johnson fan but this was a complete disappointment.  This movie just doesn't have a heart.  Rey is a Mary Sue and there are not two cents about it.  They just refuse to take the time to have characters earn it.  The film is great to look at but damn, so much wasted.",0
1045,"I am giving this movie a 2 because the visuals are interesting. If this movie had another name in front of it other than Star Wars I would have to say it was a decent movie. Something like: space balls 2: the search for cash. Or maybe: Twilight 16:  Revenge of the brooding darth emo guy. The movie is a slap in the face to hard core fans who have read the books, played the games and have fallen in love with the universe and the lore. The writing of this movie feels like it wants to pull the characters out of the long time ago far far away and pull you right back into our over the top politically correct, dumbed down humor world.  Unfortunately, The Last Jedi feels like it was written by someone who either has no clue about or has contempt for the the existing Star Wars universe. The writers have no clue how to develop characters or advance a believable plot line. Everyone except the dead are in exactly the same situation in the end as they were in the beginning.  Except for maybe the giant space llamas. Even Luke has gone from self hermit exile to self force exile. The situational plot drivers feel like a bad sitcom scene.   The captain has to drive and go down with the ship even though we have all that cool auto pilot ai crap and robots who could have actually hit the center of the dreadnought or have instantly calculated a path to take out as many enemy ships as possible. Naaaa not dramatic enough for an underdeveloped character death right? I am still amazed they didn't have General Acbar yell, ""It's a trap!"" right before he flew out the window.  Why bother going into the Star Wars universe when you can just take Star Wars to Vegas.  Craps tables , slot machines and all. And giant llama racing,  cool cgi animal rights activism filler is much more important than spending time on actual character development.  Who goes to jail for a parking ticket anyway?  Hell even the physics from other movies doesn't apply anymore. In previous movies one of the fastest ships in the Galaxy could not out run a star destroyer. But as they were whining on a star destroyer about never being able to catch the slow tugboat looking ships I was hoping dark helmet was about to run in and save the movie with ludicrous speed. Watching the movie felt like a dumbed down Millennial rant on how old people are bitter and fundimentaly broken, teachers are useless, and kids are good at anything they want to be and get a trophy without ever having to practice or train.  And don't forget your portable safe space so if you run out onto a battle field to say something to someone everyone will stop shooting and forget they hated you. Its funny how the most powerful Jedi ever, had to train for years to learn how to do simple things. However Rey can use the force right out of the box and do anything. She can beat down jedi with out ever having to train in the force. Its sad we did not know this years ago. It could have saved the jedi years of wasted time, or at least saved Luke from 8 months of running around flipping through a swamp with a frog on his back telling him he was not good enough. No wonder he was bitter.  It makes sense to change the training a Jedi thing.  Kids now days might not understand or believe the concept of having to train and work hard to be good at something.  Yuck . Who would want to buy that toy?",0
1046,"There is no good addition or respect to the lore, half of the plot of the movie is a complete waste of time and the new characters do not develop further. Would not see again or recommend.P.S: Did you know that to destroy live on earth you only need 150g moving at light speed? that's a freaking baseball! Imagine a collision with the mass of a f***ing ship!",0
1047,"Truly disappointing. Feels like the franchise has lost its soul. Very 'Disneyfied' and felt like a strange mash-up between a Michael Bay and a Pixar film. Misplaced humour, random plot points, clueless bad guys and eternally lucky good guys with no risks taken with the characters or plot. Almost every event is entirely predictable long before it plays out. Very sad as I wanted to like this.",0
1048,"Just as Star Wars was getting good again Rian Johnson just tears it all down again with a movie that while may look pleasing, is a complete disgrace to the Star Wars franchise and its characters, even the newer ones that we were just starting to love from The Force Awakens.",0
1049,"I saw this movie on opening night. It was the first time I saw an audience cheer when the hero came to save the day at the end, then five minutes later, hang their head and leave the theater in silence. The jyst of almost every comment I heard (and these were the die-hard Star Wars lovers) was 'How could they do this to us'. One girl next to me was saying, 'Oh my God. Oh my God. I can't believe this. That movie killed Star Wars'.I couldn't have summed this movie up better. Here's why: The reviews lie to the public. Even IMDB. If you read their plot synopsis, it reads 'Rey develops her newly acquired abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker.'  WRONG! Luke REFUSES to train her. In fact, he refuses to train any Jedi and wants to see the Jedi die out. Apparently he has spent twenty years trying to train people to be Jedi, but when he discovers that Kylo Ren has too much of the Dark Side in him, he wants to KILL Kylo instead of saving and mentoring him. After Kylo escapes Luke's wrath, Luke goes to a Jedi temple and broods for another ten years over his failure, refuses to have anything to do with the Rebel cause and decides he wants to isolate himself there until he dies! I am not making this up! Yes, the same Luke who rose up to become a hero for the Rebellion, destroyed the Death Star, killed Darth Vader and dedicated himself to restoring freedom to the galaxy,apparently now wants to run his lightsaber through his own nephew, wants nothing to do with the Rebellion even as his sister begs him for their very survival, and wants to hang out on an island, milking the **** of some alien on the beach and watching little aliens running around doing his laundry (these scenes ARE IN THE MOVIE! I kid you not!) and brood about his failures until he dies.Sorry. This is not the Luke Skywalker that Star Wars fans know and love. This is bad writing to get rid of another beloved character in favor of Disney's new vision. How dare they. The writing. Atrocious. Remember the Battle Of Hoth In Empire Strikes Back? Well, you can watch a poorly staged, thinned out version of it at the end of this movie. Only wait. It isn't snow this time. It's salt! That means its totally different, right? But we've still got snow walkers and rebels in a trench with their guns, right?And remember when Lando and the Rebels took on the Imperial Fleet at the end of Return Of The Jedi? That's here too. Only now, you don't need 50 Rebel ships to take out a Star Destroyers 15 laser cannons. All you need is Poe Dameron and one X-Wing fighter to take them out. He's THAT good.And did you know that when Jedis die, it doesn't matter now because they can just come back to life as ghosts and interact with the living world te way they always did when they were alive? Yup, Rian Johnson the director apparently thinks so. Thus, Yoda can burn old Jedi texts and light fire to Jedi Temples. Now that we know this, it doesn't matter that Luke dies at the end of this movie. Rian Johnson can bring him back as though nothing happened in the next movie. By this new logic, hell, lets bring back Obiwan and Darth Vader and Quigon Jin and Samuel L. Jackson and heck, why not ALL the old Jedis. I could go on and on with examples like this.And for those of you waiting for a climactic lightsaber duel, when you go, pay attention to the terribly choreographed duel between Kylo and Rey and Snoke's Elite Guards. It is laughable. The scene more akin to a ballet with missed steps than it is to a violent sword fight. See it, then tell me I am wrong. It is embarrassing. And it is all on director Rian Johnson's shoulders.This movie is an insult to the original trilogy and is an insult to every intelligent Star Wars fan out there.",0
1050,"Easily the worst Star Wars movie that has ever been released, and that is saying something considering how bad the prequels and The Force Awakens were",0
1051,"Did critics see the same movie that I did? I cannot comprehend how a movie as disastrous as this can have such a high score. They literally took a huge dump on everything about the original trilogy. I think this raises questions about the influence of Disney in ""critics"" reviews.",0
1052,"My problem is TLJ has no respect at all to Luke as legendary character, and this is fatal to Star Wars universe. All the new characters are stuck with no interesting development whatsoever from TFA. Overall TLJ does not bring any positive contribution to Star Wars. TLJ story is like Luke or Leia had a bad dream, and that's it.",0
1053,"Such a disappointment to write a bad review for a movie I was desperate to love. I'm a huge fan of the SW universe. I even enjoyed episodes II & III (especially III), so I consider myself as easy to please when it comes to this great saga.There are many, many things I HATED about this movie, but to make things shorter I will list only 3 of my grudges. I picked them cause I felt other reviews didn't really expanded on them.1) They ruined the First Order's credibility as a genuine, menacing evil entity. How can a movie be any good if the evil protagonists are a laughing stock? In the early trilogy, the Empire was such a mean, impressive, cold hearted machine. Even the poorly trained Storm Troopers (did they all skip shooting training?) couldn't take anything away from the fear the Empire instilled. They had Vader and the Emperor, of course, but it wasn't just about that... Here, First Order is a joke. I mean who is stillscared of them after this movie? They can't take down a single X-Wing fighter with their most advanced war cruiser and full fleet, because he's ""too close to its guns""? Who can believe that? No, Rian Johnson wanted to make sure Poe's the hero once again. I did buy in when Poe took down 5-6 Tie fighters over the village in episode VII (he's an ace fighter after all), and that was a sight of beauty! But here, making a joke of a super destroyer like that takes all the fun away. I mean would you believe it if a Japanese WWII fighter pilot single handedly destroyed all the guns of a huge US battleship cruising in battle formation with destroyers, aircraft carriers, etc.. it felt the same. I know it's science fiction and all but basic rules of good story telling still apply. We don't buy it.Other examples:-they get fooled by a prank call (yes, I'm not making this up, sadly...)-they take forever to destroy a severely diminished Resistance fleet -they don't see it at first when such fleet sends all its escape pods towards a nearby planet (wait, weren't the First Order's fleet focusing 100% on their attention on said Resistance fleet?)-When they capture Rose & Finn, Phasma go full ""James Bond bad guy"" and take forever to dispose of them. In fact, guess what: she takes just enough time for them to be saved at the last moment. A good one : -Rey is able to escape safely after pretty much being in the heart of the main battleship and killing their Great Leader. Her escape from the battleship after the fight is so easy in fact, that it's not even worth one single second of screen time to explain how she did it! (note to self: when you're captured by the First Order, you'll be fine). -Their general (Hux) behaves like an angry teenager who makes hasty decisions.. Correction: I meant their new Great Leader (Ren).. wait, they both sound and behave like angry teenagers... Don't look for evil masterminds or deadly composure in the First Order's leadership. -The evilest of the evilest, the great and mysterious Snoke, is met with a swift and stupid demise that ridicule him.Need I even continue the list?2) The very, very poor lightsaber fights. I mean there are none. There's a time when they use lightsabers against other melee weapons, wielded by Snoke's elite body guards. But it's not Star Wars worthy. Save a few sparks (Rey's hand switch, Ren's light sabre headshot), it's simply a melee weapons brawl like you've seen countless times in medieval era movies, or pirates movies. They need to hire back the fight choreographers of episode III ASAP. Also, Kylo Ren's lightsaber may be the coolest looking thing ever, like a medieval sword... but slight problem: it seems to also have THE WEIGHT of a medieval sword. He looks so slow when he wields it!! It could be good, it could give him this unique style if he was assured and composed as a fighter, but he seems unsure, plus he has low agility, low creativity in his fighting. He seems quickly on the edge, without control (that was true also in Force Awakens). I mean you remember Sidious vs Yoda? Or Anakin vs Kenobi? Or, in a different style, the composure of a Darth Vador ? We want more of this! This is the standard on which you build on. Make it more gritty, more realistic if you want, but damn it Disney how dare you deprive us of an exciting and proper lightsaber fight!3) Rey's ""training"" with Luke. I'm glad they pushed what we know of the Force to the edge. That was great. But what was this ""training"" for Rey? Recap: Lesson 1, some life philosophy.. ""The force is everywhere my dear"". Lesson 2: ""a jedi can be bad also, you know"". Lesson 3... I don't even think there was a 3rd. Thank goodness. Ok, now, with that, go be a great Jedi Rey!And here I'm just brushing over the many problems (humor, casino scene, Rose's character, cheesy slave children arc, timing, Luke's behavior, etc). This Star Wars movie felt like a bad Battlestar Galactica episode, with a fleet chasing another fleet, depriving us of what we wanted from Star Wars.",0
1054,"Worst Star Wars film ever.It's not even Star Wars, it is Marvel Wars, or Disney Wars.Unlogical, with stupid jokes every moment.But visual effects were nice. That's the only plus film has.If this wasn't Star Wars movie, i would give it 3.But this is Star Wars, so i'll give 0.",0
1055,"Terrible script and plot, acting was sub standard apart from Mark Hamill.  Humour felt forced & far too many unbelievable things happened.Worst movie in the entire Star Wars saga.",0
1056,"Very disappointed in this movie. No reveals, no explanations and no plot. Disney has turned this into a cash cow for the sheep who only like 3rd grade scripts with no thinking needed.",0
1057,"What did I just see? So bored, disappointed and sad. Never been so conflicted over a Star Wars movie. Never smiled once. Humor was so poorly written, plot holes were wtf, wanted to walk out during casino bit. Only saving grace was Luke, and the way he was used was just sad. Given the sad state of everything else in America these days, I guess even Star Wars never had a chance.",0
1058,The film is just plain bad. I won't go in depth as better people than me can write a far more in depth review. The film has a weak plot and even weaker characters that either don't get developed or go directly against their development established in previous films (I'm looking at you luke).,0
1059,"Have you ever wanted to watch a SJW's wet dream? Look not further! Watch... as an Asian woman smashes the glass ceiling while completing the task her male counterpart could not, pushing a giant red button on a remote keypad. Not BIG enough SJW propaganda for you? Watch... as the Asian woman's sister goes from pipe fixer to an expert in the metaphysics of hyper-space travel. But that's not all, watch said sister suddenly become an expert rider of wild animals, point out social injustice on a planet that revolves around gambling and weapon sales, and save her dopey emasculated male at the last moment from certain death because he lacks the proper genitalia to preform a heroic act.If that isn't groundbreaking enough, how about spending sometime aboard the rebel fleet. Where Admiral Ackabar plays the male privilege card and pays the ultimate price... death. But fear not friends, there is a strong woman waiting in the wings, ready to lead and curtail alpha male Poe, whose male brain is only capable of recklessness without strong female leadership. Watch... as Poe leads the film down a pointless side story only to be emasculated from afar while watching a strong woman, who is flying a giant rebel ship completely by herself btw, teach alpha male Poe how self sacrifice and accountability really works.After climaxing on the SJW propaganda, be sure to get your fill of corny jokes, Luke Skywalker drinking green tit juice, Luke's Marvel comic character debut with a shoulder dust off, Kylo failing miserably like every other male character in the film, and BB-8 deus machina the entire plot line that seems to have been written by a team of people who believe sexual orientation is a social construct.I am giving it one point, because the oppressed black man actually does kill his white slave oppressor captain Phasma who happens to be female. Although this is conflicting, as it really is another SJW race card reference about Whitey keeping the black man down. Given that the character is female, I feel as though I need to give that a nod, as it could have been a straight white male.",0
1060,"Whatever this over-the-top, cringe-filled parody is, it ain't Star Wars. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's even worse than TFA. What a terrible year for Star Wars fans...",0
1061,"**Contains Spoilers** The Last Jedi was overall a disappointment. Only good part of this movie was the Kylo Ren - Ray story line. The Luke Skywalker storyline was the worst part. He should have gone down in the flesh fighting the bad guys using crazy force powers. Instead he was a coward, I think he died of a heart attack. The Rebel - First Order combat was also pretty bad. A third grader must have thought it up. There is no gravity in space, you don't have to fly over the dreadnought to drop bombs on it. The subsequent ship chase made no sense. The First Oder could have easily destroyed the Rebel ship with tie fighters or having other ships light speed in front it. The space combat aspect of this movie was garbage. The movie is very sexist, all the male characters were either stupid, cowardly, or evil. The humor was hit or miss, sometimes good sometimes misplaced. Disney will make tons of money on this movie but the franchise is in trouble.",0
1062,"This is what happens when far left nut jobs get a hold of nice things, they ruin them.  This movie is an embarrassment to the franchise.  Not as bad as the prequels but still pretty bad.",0
1063,"This movie is ok as a sci-fi adventure movie. The visuals are good especially for some space combat scenes. BUT, and this is a huge but, this movie fails immensely as a Star Wars film. Major characters are poorly developed or have abrupt ends to their arc. Meanwhile, Rian devotes a lot of screen time to new characters like Rose who serve no purpose. Character personalities and motivations also do not fit with previous movies. The Last Jedi will likely be viewed as the worst movie out of all the Star Wars films to date (yes even worse than Phantom Menace). Shame of you Rian for claiming to be a fan.",0
1064,"Let down, to say the least. From the first scene to very last, The Last Jedi is utter garbage. The story, if there is one, makes no sense and the way it's delivered is boring and unimaginative. I found myself checking the watch every two minutes, hoping that the end would come and release me from the sheer pain this movie caused. Once the end is reached you are left feeling empty, used and betrayed. I felt no connection to any of the characters, and I could not care less, what happens to the ones that remain alive. Here's some of the highlights:""Yes, this is Hux"". I had to chek the ticket, that I was in the right hall and it was indeed a Star Wars movie, that was playing, after that classic Scary Movie quality scene.Luke milking the whatever it was, and winking at the camera.Leia's superman moment in the open space. Such magic.The whole subplot with Finn and Rose. Every second with vice admiral Holdo on the screen is painful. She is one of the worst(if not the worst) characters in the history of Star Wars. Laura Dern's performance seals the deal. Luke's pointless death.All in all the worst Star Wars movie, including the prequals.",0
1065,"Worse than Attack of the Clones, which previously held the position as my least favorite Star Wars movie. At least parts of Episode 2 were so bad that they were fun to laugh at. This movie has no value whatsoever. Instead of doing anything meaningful with the setup of TFA, they squander the characters and plot in favor of shock value and bad jokes. Humor has always been a part of Star Wars, but in the form of characters joking with each other in universe. TLJ has too many winking nods at the audience that say, ""GET IT?? DO YOU GET THE JOKE???"" Yes, I get it. And your jokes suck. This isn't a different kind of Star Wars story like others are saying. It's the same story but told badly, as though it was written by a teenager who just discovered they could write fan fiction. By the end of the movie we still have the same old setup of good versus evil, but this time I've lost all interest.I think I'm done with Star Wars. Rogue One was pretty bad too but this is the last straw...I'm just not interested anymore.",0
1066,"Yes, the movie is terrible at character development, pacing, continuity (with other films in the saga and within itself), plot etc...The main problem for me however is not that it sucks at being a good movie. The way this production attacks everything we know and love about Star Wars, the disrespect, the impudence... Simply unbearable. The Last Jedi literally mocks with the previous films and with the audience who were expecting answers regarding some unanswered questions that arised in Ep.7. Disney and producers first create those questions, make the audience wonder about them, discuss them for 2 years and then WHAM! Now they are the most unimportant issue in the whole universe. Not even worth talking about in the movie. Not even worth to shoot a scene just to provide some depth and answers. Why? Oh right, to create surprise and excitement! The final point I'll be making is about what Star Wars is and is not.Star Wars is NOT just a simple series of films. There are hundreds of books which cover a time span of millions of years in this created SW universe. SW has a lore. SW has a tone. It has some rules even though they are not written. And whoever tries to create a literature / game / film etc. in this universe has to respect them.Disney erased the whole canon when they bought the franchise, leaving only some of the animation series and the first 6 films intact. I thought they were going to create their own version of the past and future of the saga. I thought they were simply trying to make some room for themselves to maneuver in. Now I see that they never respected any of it otherwise they would not ask us to ""burn the past"".I will not go and watch the SW ep.9 in the theater; neither will I watch any Disney movie in theaters and I will never watch a movie of this terrible director Johnson, Jameson whatnot unless the Disney board comes up with an official apology.",0
1067,"Great at times, very poor at others. But as a sequel to The Force Awakens, not great at all - it's like RJ decided to make a sequel to an imaginary version of TFA that only existed in his head. I saw it on opening night, as I left the cinema I wasn't sure how I felt about it. Thinking about it since, the basic plot, muddled character development and the multitude of missed/squandered opportunities are harder and harder to ignore due to their impact on the trilogy or the brand as a whole. Such a disappointment.",0
1068,"As a ""true"" Star Wars fan, I can say that this is nothing but a PC Disney movie. It is not Star Wars. What I mean by true fan is I've seen every SW film in the theater (this was and will be the last) and my ""man-cave"" is decorated in SW. This movie is the Crystal Skull of the franchise. Below is what is wrong with The Last Jedi:1. Luke’s death is meaningless and he dies a coward. That is not the Luke Skywalker of SW lore.2. Luke milks a space alien. WTF??3. Leia “Mary Poppins” Organa4. Spaceships running out of fuel?? When was fuel ever a problem in the SW galaxy?5. Way too much Guardians of the Galaxy humor.6. Snoke who?7. Rey’s full name; Rey “Mary Sue” Nobody8. Shirtless Kylo.9. Who needs Jedi anymore? We have SJW (Space Justice Warriors)10. By killing off the last remaining “old white men”, all the villains are white guys, all the good guys are minorities. Hooray for diversity!11. Grrrl power!12. Casino scene is a political jab at the 2%ers, yet Disney is part of the 2%ers.13. First trilogy people thought that being a Jedi was inherent to the Skywalker bloodline. Second trilogy, if you had enough midichlorians in your blood you can be trained in the ways of the force. This trilogy, everyone has the potential to use the force. In other words, everyone gets a trophy!!",0
1069,"Unfortunately terrible. Luke Skywalker spent the past 40 years as THE fantasy sci-fi super hero, but will now be forever remembered as a washed-up, pathetic, and damaged hermit. JJ Abrams set up so many intetesting story arcs in the previous film, then the current director decided to go absolutely nowhere with any of it. Apologists claim this is ""bold risk taking."" I remember when I was 15 and thought it was bold to be flaunt my propensity for risk taking. Turns out I was just an idiot.",0
1070,"Shame on Rian Johnson and Disney, this movie is the worst ""Star Wars"" movie of all times...What a pity, Me and my friends was very sad.It's a total destruction of the old saga withour any form of respect. Snoke is a joke, Rey's background is pathetic. All characters have'nt any charism and the story is a list of WTF.Star Wars is a passion for me and I'm very sad.",0
1071,"That's it, I'm out, I'm done. I will NEVER forgive Disney for what they've done to this series. I'll admit, I came for one thing: to see Luke do some awesome stuff now that he's a 9th-level Jedi Grandmaster. Instead he acts like a grumpy old hobo for almost the whole runtime.",0
1072,"This was not a Star Wars film. It is a Lord of the Rings style science fiction film set in a parallel Star Wars universe. A lot was ""thrown out the window"" with the direction the film took, including just about everything that makes a Star Wars film feel like Star Wars. Further more, it is bewidering how Disney managed to release Rogue One a year ago which absolutely nailed the Star Wars ""feel"" to the film, yet manages to release this a year later, which is completely tone deaf to the setting of the franchise.It makes no sense to defend the film's new direction when it doesn't remotely fit in the Star Wars universe, and to simply dismiss/label everything preceding this film as just the nostalgic views of a bunch of old nerdy people is not only insulting to those who support the franchise but completely insensitive to the decades of lore and millions of hours of work put into building the universe. It is evident from reading such reviews that facts and setting no longer matter when expanding upon an established setting, and that change for the sake of change is seemingly self-justified for the purpose of spitting in the face of those who have done nothing more than simply support the Star Wars universe.",0
1073,"2 hours of rebels running away, boring emotional drama of lame characters in SJW wrapping.The CGI is overused. The dialogue is boring. The characters are stupid. Camera work uninspiring. Setting kind of ugly with plenty of awesome options.But it has the Star Wards anthem and super-smart droids.People in this movie are naive and non-relateable. Couldn't care less for them since they're just a bunch of caricatures without showing any personal character or history.SJW agenda all over it. Women are now dying in bombers, fighters and big battleships, also all generals are women as well. Really Disney, how can you be so obvious?Fighting is boring and it seems all the ""jedi"" have forgotten how to fight with a light saber.""Bad guys"" are just a bunch of arrogant, naive and angry little kids who are angry a lot and love power. Why can't bad guys be wise, careful, contentious, ambitious and capable? Nah they just love the dark side and scream a lot. Boohoo such powerful villains...not.Don't pay for it.",0
1074,"So mundane i think it shattered the rose colored glasses of nostalgia. If you get bored by the exhausting Marvel sequels (except the recent Thor!), you will be bored here. They truly are beating a dead horse with this film. Next time I want to dive into the star wars universe I should just rewatch the originals. So disappointing. It's like someone described how to make a star wars movie to an alien, and then the alien tried writing and directing his own. Between this movie and the recent EA game, my love for star wars has taken a beating, and it really sucks.",0
1075,Absolutely disappointing effort. Disney has ruined this series. As a die hard fan the truly huge plot holes and lack of depth in the story moving forward is devastating.,0

1078,Worst star wars movie ever. Luke throwing his lightsaber over his shoulder was rians take on the franchise.It is an awful movie. Super Disappointed! Mary Poppins Leia & Coward Luke! You guys ruined Star Wars. I see there's no real Star Wars in future. There will be just cheesy Disney Sci-fi movies that are named as Star Wars films.,0
1079,"Not really a Star Wars film. More of like a Science Fiction film from China infringing on elements and characters of the Star Wars universe. If you thought Star Wars was a good movie then you don't really like or care about how good the Star Wars films were. This seemed literally more of a reboot. But it didn't go that route. Its still the same universe but now all of a sudden, everything works different and nothing makes sense. Gave it a two because visual effects did their job. Its confusing because Force Awakens, whether you liked or had mixed feeling for it... or even hated it, made you interested with these new characters. Some characters like Snoke, Poe, even ""Mary Sue"" Rey had interesting aspects to them that needed to be looked at more throughout the series. These characters literally make the clash between good and bad make sense. Well guess what? Absolutely not. Every character arc didn't matter. Snoke's character for example had to panned out. How does he gather the remnants of the Empire? Why do they follow him? What was his connection with Sidious and the Dark Side? Well... film goes... Who cares? It really is the worst Star Wars ever. Even worst than Phantom Menace. At least in that movie the bad actors had a role to play in the rest of the series. I watch this movie and go... who cares now? Where were the story designers? Where were the lore experts? Heard this idea that people who hated this movie are Fan Boyz or something of that nature... well maybe they just don't like bad movies. The only way a sane person liked this movie is if they go to movies to just say... well that was cool! And literally disregard the story and development of characters. If you liked the visual effects and the battles... sure... but even then at the highest maybe a 7 out of 10. The movie dragged. Too many parts where people who like that would be like... ""that part was just not needed."" The story was just simply put... bad. It really ruins the and warps the Star Wars universe. If you haven't seen it yet.... beware for Mary Poppins... in space.",0
1080,"A subplot that served no purpose since it was all unraveled and just let them to saying, ""oh they're trying to escape to that small planet over there which we should've seen coming by looking out these large windows...""  Some bad humor, these pog things that are apparently supposed to be cute but don't actually do anything.They even try to rehash the ""Traitor"" line from Force Awakens but it was just bad.  The fight scenes were badly filmed....The only real redeeming qualities of this film involved Rey and Ben.... Adam Driver and Daisy were excellent but the direction was just so bad and it didn't help that many times there was just humor which wasn't funny and was rather pointless (like much of it in the casino).  As someone put it to me... it felt more like a Disney film than a Star Wars film and is a HUGE stepback from Force Awakens and definitely Rogue One which was the pinnacle of the Disney Star Wars universe so far.  Force Awakens had some odd moments too (like the aliens chasing them on the transport vessel when they captured the Falcon...  but that was better directed.I can see that I should've come here instead of Rotten Tomatoes for a review but even there now, the users are rating this at around 56%.  Still, I used my Movie Pass and paid nothing to see it and I'm still feeling ripped off.  :)",0
1081,This was one of the worst movies of all time.  Such potential totally wasted.  The plot is crap.  The movie is largely about a ship.  Yoda for like 15 seconds.  The kill all the wrong characters.  Bad jokes.  This was just a tragedy.  Thank you Disney for killing Star Wars.,0
1082,"Star Wars is dying - let’s put it out of its miseryFor over 20 years I've been a Star Wars fan. (movies, music and games)I fear The Last Jedi will be my last Star Wars movie. It's totally clear now - Disney will destroy the franchise with its leftist SJW agenda.My view on the characters:Snoke the Joke: Nuff saidPoe: Oh oh... toxic masculinity, micro aggression, mansplaining!Kylo: Still a whiny emo bratLeia: Dies and then Marry Poppins her way back to the ship? Seems legit.Rey: mehLuke: Jerking off a sea cow. So sad.Chewie: Turns veganToken Asian Girl: check!Finn: Was he in this movie? He certainly didn't do anything.R2D2 / C3P0: uselessChrome Brienne of Tarth: uselessPlot / story:Casino scene:This is where the movie killed me. I completely zoned out during this scene.

Should have been done by Admiral Ackbar, not Purple Hair Lady no one cares about.Battle on Not-Hoth planet:I was getting excited seeing the setup, I thought this battle was going to resemble the famous Hoth battle. A rebel soldier in the trenches takes a lick of the white substance covering the ground.""Salt"". Wut. A lackluster battle followed.Even if I leave out Disney's SJW bs I'm still left with a very weak movie.Plot holes, cringe scenes, flat characters, dull story writing, badly placed ""humor"".Dear Disney, please choke on your leftist SJW non-binary PC vegan soy lattes.",0
1083,"Its a terrible film and it ruins the whole Star Wars saga in so many effing ways. 1) Too much comic relief that didnt fit the whole movie format at all 2) Way too many Cringe scenes like the Leia scene and most dialogues with Kylo 3) **** plot. They built on so many things just for them to get **** on later without explaining anything. If Finn didnt exist nothing would change. 4) No character development. Nobody cared about the chinese girl and her romantic affiliation. Nobody. Poe also got shat upon. And no Poe doesnt care that much about Finn. That makes no sense. 5) The whole luke arc. Destroyed his char once and for all. I mean literally, I dont wanna spoil it but it makes no effing senseBut the worst thing that infuriates me is the people who blindly accept everything disney shoves down their throats and try to support and make sense of every weak plot point, every plot hole or bad decision they made. Just because some totally ""unbiased"" critics claimed the movie is a masterpiece they dare jump on the love wagon claiming its the best star wars movie of all time???? Even better than ESB?? Thats humiliating pathetic and honestly disappoints me. It shows ppl are so easily influenced and have zero critical thinking or ability to judge something for themselves. This movie made it hard for me to enjoy rewatching the franchise i so much love and with which I grep up with...",0
1084,A film that left me devastated. The last jedi asks more questions than giving answers. There are so many plotholes and the movie is too long. Luke`s story line is for me as a die hard star wars fan total dissappointing. I hope JJ can fix this some how in Episode IX.,0

1086,"TLJ was far too derivative of episodes five, six and even four, despite trying so hard to trick the audience it isn't.  This movie was plagued with an incoherent storyline, poorly explained or utterly neglected crucial plot fillers, discontinuity from the original characters (even the last movie), underdeveloped/uninteresting characters (save Kylo Ren), forced agenda, and the same expected forced humor we all expect from Disney now days.  I wouldn't recommend anyone see this in the theatre.  Wait for it to be shown for free at a birthday party or something.",0
1087,"Im not a bot and ive followed and watched every Star Wars film there is and i have to say that this is the worse ive seen (Clone Wars is number 2) the story is inconsistent with holes, character development issues, unentertained fillers.

1088,I waited almost my entire life to see what became of Luke Skywalker and this is what I get? Unbelievable. What a huge slap in the face! This movie basically took a huge dump on the Skywalker Legacy that was built in two trilogies. Impressive to be able to do that in just one film.,0

It may truly be the worst movie I have seen in the cinema this year, and definitely the worst Star Wars movie by a long shot. If you want to see the legacy of Star Wars, and the characters and stories that made is loved by people all over the world, spat on, this is the movie for you. The only reason I give it a one, is because some shots in the movie were great. Mark Hamill's initial reaction to this movie's script, and the review embargo by Disney truly says it all.",0

1093,"What a mess this turned out to be for me. This one I feel was actually pretty awesome until the last hour (maybe hour and 1/2..?). First thing, there was too much humor, the trailers made it look a lot more serious, with a dark tone.The biggest complaint right now for me is the ending gave us nothing to really look forward to in Ep 9. It was like it was building a damn good story then they just were like ""Oh you think this is going to happen now? Noooope.. sorry, oh you also wanted this to happen? Not that either.. Sorry."" Then they just obliterated stuff they shouldn't of and made a messy film.Snoke is looking like a wasted character now if he's really dead (the battle with Rey and Finn, and his whole room setting was dope), either way dead or alive they should've teased us with something more on his background especially if hes alive. I wanted him to be Plagueis like many others I've spoken to on here and at Cons, but I was fine if he wasn't if they just gave us some badass story with him. I understand if they want to wait on a reveal until Ep9, but give us a few nice teases in this. Even when Luke was telling Rey about how Snoke got to Ben in the flashback scenes, why not dive into a few sentences on who he is there? Missed opportunities I just kept finding throughout the movie. The Yoda scene especially.Smaller things that irritated me, you make Poe look like an idiot for an awesome attempt at mutiny, just cause the Admiral couldn't properly communicate to you her actual plan? Would've rather him, Finn and Rose actually pulled off the deactivation of the tracker and Finn fought Phasma maybe to deactivate it. Leia and Poe meanwhile evacuate to whatever planet they went to. I cannot spell it, sorry. The Vulptex (Crystal Foxes) did nothing cool like other indigenous SW creatures. Was hoping for more there, but again that is something I would've let slide. Also, where was an epic lightsaber duel? I loved Rey and and Kylo fighting the Praetorian Guards, but I wanted to see an epic one with Luke and Kylo or even Kylo and Rey. Come on! I still would've let this one slide.I agree with many others I did not like that Admiral Holdo got the kamikaze light speed scene, should've went to Ackbar damnit! Very little character development with anyone really, those subplots with Finn and Rose were just a waste of time I felt like, way way to long. Took time away from Luke/Kylo/Rey story arc. Rose I also felt like just deviated away from the story progression they had with Rey and Finn from EP7.WTF was with Leia floating like some space witch? No explanation.. I can let it slide cause it was sort of cool. I look at it as she had unused reserved force ability to save herself. A big ""oh **** button.Also, How are they going to deal with Leia's story now that Carrie Fisher (RIP) has past? The one character I thought would get killed off didn't. (I thought it would've been cool if Snoke or even Kylo had kidnapped her leaving Luke and Rey to rescue her in Ep9.)Reys parents.. If it is true what Kylo said about Rey's parents and they leave it at that for ep9, then that is just completely lame. wtf is her last name?! give us that even. If so what is the point of saving that until Ep8 then? Lamest cliffhanger ever. Could've told us that in the last one.Luke's ending was also very disappointing. Especially if he doesn't return as a Force Ghost in Ep9 (If he does I am guessing its small little scenes) The Force Projection and the Force Connect was really cool, but right when we get him actually back you just kill him off after 10-15 mins? I also wanted a real epic lightsaber battle between him and Kylo. No real training for Rey? Especially after what Yoda told him? No Anakin Force Ghost? He also didn't even really stop Kylo like he told Leia he would. He just made a temporary fix to let his sister get away, accepted he failed Ben, and then vanished into the sun? Come on..As you can tell, I just am not happy. That's just the stuff I can name off the top of my head for now. All the hype for this disappointment. I wanted to like it, but just didn't.I highly doubt they can make all this resolve in episode 9. Sorry if you enjoyed it and I am bringing you down. I seriously am a huge Star Wars fan, I've seen it twice now and little has changed, in fact I've found only more little flaws in the dialogue.",0
1094,"It takes serious effort to create even more of a divisive mess than The Force Awakens. Disney could've rebooted Episode V again and everyone would've hated it enough, but they went the extra mile and screwed it up in a different way.""Disney Star Wars was a mistake"" - George Lucas",0

1096,Star Wars the Last Jedi Script and story was just awful! Made no sense for them to have different people making whatever they want up with different directors who have no passion or history when it's a Trilogy. Star Wars ended with George Lucas who created this and this new Fake Disney Star Wars is Pathetic! About the only way possible to salvage this is to try and get George Lucas to come back and take command of the next movie and fix it. Other than that I'm out on anything from Disney's Fake imposter Star Wars for now on.,0
1097,"It isn't a terrible movie just isnt very good.Cringy dialogue, plot holes, no continuation of lore! Snoke's backstory is excluded from the story, Rey's parents are irrelevant, and where are the knights of ren, huh? And that one scene at the start (i think you all know the one) is just so weird and unnecessary. It trivialises the 'force' and is just so awkward. Without spoiling anything, it just makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film if they come back, and its worse for episode 9 because now they can't solve that problem either which would have been conveniently solved had the scene been followed-through with, its a mess. Its near the same level as batman v superman martha scene. There is zero depth in this film, sure the action sequences were perfect but its without substance, all flash. Humour was alright, but even that felt a little too obvious and unnatural compared to harrison ford and ewan mcgregor days. And it stems from a typical disney problem where characters are too superficially fantastical (i think only Poe and Rey had adequate character development).Honestly can't believe they're getting rian jhonson to direct a new trilogy this film is so bad. Rotten tomato user reviews already dropped 30% and IMDB is hammering it now - can't believe critics are still holding at 90%+ when this film is a failure to fans.Even if you suspend reasonable disbelief at certain points, the story is such a mess that every significant plot point is of no significance to the overall story - In situations where there are two paths to the story being developed, neither path is followed through with and you get half-assed compromises that are indeed suprisingly bad. What you're left with is a big mess that JJ Abrhams has to clean up in episode 9. If they had followed through with even some of the themes being touched upon like politics, morality, greed, and power then this film would at least have some substance and value to literature but none of those themes get shown in a way that makes you think about it, rather they are artificially injected in typical Disney fashion and not a integral part of the central story - like most things in this film, such themes are disposable rather than deeply ingrained in the story. Which is not the good marks of any valuable film. It would probably take Christopher Nolan to save the next installment, i'm not sure that JJ Abhrams can do it. This review gives 1 point for continuing the star wars story. And another 1 point for marketing intrigue across mainstream culture; even if it's for worse than better.",0
1098,"Awful dialogue, mediocre to bad wrongly timed humor, plot inconsistencies, cheap surprices, forgetable music, pointless scenes, non develped characters.

Good performances and SFX, that's about it. Tons of missed oportunities.",0
1099,"While we watch the movie it was fun and entertaining but there were wtf moments that constantly ruin the mood. Then afterwards we silently ate our dinner processing what we just saw and reflecting on the various twists in the movie and realizing just how disappointing they were. The Force Awakens brought a new universe full of intrigue and excitement, then this movie crushed and ruined that same intrigue and excitement. Although not as bad as the prequel trilogy, it is as good and bad as the specialized editions. Much like the prequel trilogy the over abundance of silly creature and characters are unwanted and out of place, that combined with the out of character decisions and actions by the cast of this film make it one I do not look forward to watching again.",0
1100,Went through much to see this. Waited a long time for a conclusion of everything that started in The Force Awakens. I could not have seen a worse Episode 8. How will they even go on in episode 9 after this accident. I feel tricked by the trailers. They looked like at least a regular movie. This made me feel really bad. Change the writers.kbw,0
1101,"I want to score this movie more than a 0 because if it wasn't for the fact that it is a Star Wars movie it would deserve something, even if it is full of plot holes and comedy moments which just don't land.However because it is a Star Wars movie, it must at least try and live up to the past movies and not throw pretty much every moment in Star Wars history out of the window.  I feel the director was more focused on creating his own legacy and forgot that he was part of the Star Wars legacy.  It genuinely does not feel like he has even seen Star Wars, never mind even been a fan of it.If you have not seen it yet and consider yourself a fan of the franchise, avoid it.  There is a far higher chance you will dislike or even hate it than enjoy it.  I don't consider myself as a fanboy, read the extended universe etc.  I enjoyed the Force Awakens even if it was a bit like A new hope.  I don't even hate the prequels, I don't love them but there is a story there which I can appreciate.  Really enjoyed Rogue One, feels like a real Star Wars movie.  The Last Jedi throws the franchise under the bus though.  More Space Balls than Star Wars.",0
1102,"A bad movie. One of the most anticipated movies of the year, and is a political infused soap opera with star wars cliches.

No point to have trench runs, dog fights, asteroid field chases... just get a droid to pilot a ship at light speed into another and boom, we don't need to watch any Star Wars space battle again.

1109,"Just watched Star Wars the Last Jedi and would like to share some thoughts. First, although I truly appreciated some of the stunning visuals and felt that women were rightly given prominent positions in the story, it was the problems relating to the story itself that leads me to conclude this a lackluster outing in the Star Wars cinematic universe. Some of the greatest moments of joy while watching Star Wars The Force Awakens was the challenge to viewers that there were undoubtedly mysteries and plots to be had in the follow ups. I absolutely agree that no viewer should be upset if their favored theory does not come to fruition in a sequel like The Last Jedi but this was not even the case in this situation. Instead, Rian Johnson, the director decided that it would be best to simply throw out any potential twists or plot developments altogether in  critical points in the movie numerous times. This ordinarily would be fine, if the previous film had not essentially promised and marketed the potential for exhilarating and thought provoking twists and plot developments. Admittedly it has only been a few days since the release of TLJ and more official reaction may come out, but the response by RJ and Disney so far has been to either ignore that there may be issues with the product they have produced, or paint it as a more vocal minority of viewers causing the shift toward negative reviews. Quite frankly it just comes off as Disney shouting Fake News in order to discredit real issues with this product. They will undoubtedly make money off of this film and there is nothing wrong with that. But hopefully Disney and Rian Johnson can realize it costs them nothing to admit they may not have produced as solid a cinematic film as they are currently portraying it to be.",0
1110,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was terrible. I can't believe I wasted money to see this garbage film. There is no need for me to reveal spoilers, because every other negative review on metacritic is 100% correct in its critique of this film. Disney has destroyed the Star Wars series and its obvious the movie is geared towards selling more merchandise than it is for building an actual storyline.If James Franco ever wants to make a sequal for The Disaster Artist, he should make it about Disney and Rian Johnsons piss poor attempt at making a Star Wars film. Best way to summarize my feelings ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."" Only way Disney could get me to see this next one is to let Christopher Nolan direct it, even then I'd still be hesitant.",0
1111,"I don't consider the new trilogy canon. That is how much Disney messed this up. The Mary Sue solution wasn't fixed, Snoke is a waste, Kylo is still a wimp, they character assassinated Luke, don't get me started on Leia, etc. More forced diversity and SJW bs. No thanks.",0
1112,"Just a movie that insults true star wars fans. Done with directors and video game developers alike for abusing this franchise and treating it as a cash grab along with their inability to stay true to the Star Wars universe because of their pride I understand there are creative differences but when your ""creative difference"" shows total disregard for what has been established means you have none because you cannot even add more to it so you take away what has been established throw it away or just butcher it shows you have no creativity whatsoever . So sad to see this but expect more accept it boy's the star wars we know, love,and grew up with is dead.",0

1115,"I enjoyed The Force Awakens and loved Rogue One, but this is really poor, I seriously have no idea what film the critics have been watching. It's an incredibly poor story, filled with cheap laughs and cringy moments that are so jarring so that had to look away at times.",0
1116,"Well, The Farce Awakens might have been just a bad remake of a New Hope with plot holes the size of Star destroyers, a lame Mary Sue of a main character, unmemorable secondary characters and no creativity or artistic vision whatsoever but at it least wasn't a snooze fest. The Last Jedi tries to remake The Empire Strikes back but only achieves in remaking that film's bad pacing and filler scenes, without any of the world building and character depth.This movie seems to have been made by someone who trully hates Star Wars, its world, lore and characters. It's the only way I can explain why all these things are butchered here. Hobo Luke is probably the worst thing. I can understand them wanting to make him a fallen hero but there is a difference between making him a flawed character haunted by his failure and making him a psychopath that wants to murder his nephew in his sleep. Yoda also shows up looking like a cheap puppet(because it's all about mu practical effects) and burns down the tree that had all the knowledge and history of the Jedi Order. Apparently, MaRey Sue doen't need all that wisdom and training, she is perfect just the way she is, she even manages to overpower Luke in a brief duel, you go, Girl! Oh, yeah, and the mysterious Dark Lord Snoke is killed without being given any backstory and replaced as the main antagonist by the Emo Manchild Kylo Ren. Best movie in the series, amirighte guyz?But of course, these are just my criticism as a SW fanboy. However, now that this movie has a lower fan rating than Attack of the Clones, Disney Drones will try to convince you that, even though it's not a great Star Wars movie, it's still a very good movie on its own. Nothing further from the truth: this is the worst movie I saw in the year that gave us Justice League. From abysmal dialogue, to scenes that could have easilly been cut and nothing would have been lost to characters that have no development. Finn doesn't evolve beyong his funny black man role and now he is partnered with a chubby Asian chick because Kathleen Kennedy forgot to add yellow to the Diversity Rainbow in the Farce Awakens. Poe is just as useless as before, his only role in this movie is having his priviledge checked by older women. Oh, yeah, and as per Disney tradition there is a ""witty"" millenial joke every 30 seconds, even in scenes that are supposed to have tension, yet the only time I laughted at this movie is when Leia started flying through space Superman style.There are so many other things I could go on about, like the terrible aliens that are shoved in your face every 2 minutes to sell merchandise or the SJW pandering, but it's really not worth it. Watching these Disney Star Wars movies get worse and worse every years and enjoying the tears of fanboys that made fun of Lucas for over a decade bacame some sort of Christmas tradition. Star Wars is now the iPhone or Call of Duty or whatever souless corporate cashcow you want to name that tricks idiots into buying it only to forget about it the next months.",0

1118,"I'll start off by saying I never write reviews for movies. This is the first time I've bothered, because this movie is just THAT bad.I went in with such high hopes. I've always admired RJ for his work, Looper and Brick in particular. Sadly, after watching The Last Jedi, that admiration has been tossed in the trash.I found myself asking time after time, ""did he even watch The Force Awakens?"" Because it seems that he went out of his way to burn every bridge JJ built in TFA, without leaving any new ones behind. Mysteries are left unanswered or given shoddy, unsatisfying resolutions. Relationships and character quirks are completely ignored or ruined. The characters and their respective characterizations are just awful. They might as well have just renamed them all and made them new characters entirely. Rey, who I enjoyed in Force Awakens, spends the whole movie trying to reach through to a person who has done nothing but hurt her because, I don't know, she has some delusion of grandeur about being the Luke to his Vader, even though there's no realistic reason for her to believe this is possible. Her actions are naive, stupid and make no logical sense. And ultimately, it all just lands her back where she was in VII. The same can be said for nearly every other character, as none of them truly grow or develop. What a waste of potential. Don't even get me started on the brutal butchering of Luke Skywalker.The plot, if you can even call it that, is rife with holes and inconsistencies. There's an entire subplot that has no bearing on the story and ultimately accomplishes nothing except taking up too much time and wasting Boyega's acting talents.The humor is awkward and inappropriately timed. Did we really need a yo mama joke, or Luke milking a bizarre space creature, or shirtless Kylo Ren? RJ tries so hard to mimic Taika Waititi's comedic style, but lacks Waititi's wit and finesse, so it falls flat.I wasn't completely thrilled with The Force Awakens, but I enjoyed it well enough. I walked away excited to see where these characters and this story were headed. I felt none of that leaving The Last Jedi. My investment in these characters and their story dissipated. I don't care what happens next. To paraphrase one of this movie's most disappointing characters, ""for the sequel trilogy, all is lost.""I can only hope JJ turns things around in IX, but I'm not optimistic. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I'm immeasurably disappointed. What a mess of a film. Only adding the two points because it's visually stunning. If only that were enough to redeem the whole movie...",0

You need to enact Order 66 at the Disney Corporation and wipe the slate clean of all the incompetent morons you pay way too much money to let this POS loose. Shame! *ding ding* Shame!",0

Die for no reason ( He basically dies by having his own illusion killed by Kilo, WTF...) Finn and rose arc are uninteresting and she dies at the end in a ridiculous fake love scene. The whole movie is about a rebel ship that runs away from new order army ( look like a stupid cat/mouse race ). Visually it has his moments but definitely doesn't worth the money. Let's end the slaughter. STOP WATCH DISNEY MOVIES !!!!",0

""This is the only Star Wars movie that left me leaving the theater emotionless, unattached to the characters and without the need to see ""what happens next"".I am normally an easy to please movie goer, so the fact that I felt like that leaving this one really speaks volumes.",0
1125,"I went to theatre full of hope and walked out without caring about episode 9 or the desire to watch anything Star Wars again...I hated that feeling.  The media is trying to spin this as just a few fans and the backlash is mostly political hacks bombing the review websites. The reality is, this is one of the only ways average fans can voice their opinions. Countless articles are being written daily that pop up if you Google Star wars that basically say ""If you don't like the movie it's because you don't like diversity ect""...Nonsense.  Almost everyone wanted this movie to be great! But it's painfully obvious for not for the same reasons.  Fans wanted to see a movie that them built on the plotlines from the Force Awakens and see Luke Freaking Skywalker.  The filmmakers wanted this movie to be great because of the ""groundbreaking message of diversity it was going to send"". And it's painfully obvious that more effort was put into pushing this political narrative than building a compelling story that gives us reason to care about anything. The twists and turns will surprise you but not because they are brilliant or earth shattering, but because they simply make no sense or were done for cheap shock value. There is no chemistry between characters because well... they are never together to even see if there is any. I feel bad for these young actors because it's not their fault.  This movie smugly disrespects everything done before it and that is just not cool.  Bob Iger is a smart guy, I'm sure he is behind the backlash against the backlash we are seeing.  He knows they need to right this ship ASAP because their next movie up to bat features a millennial playing Han Solo.",1
1126,"I am not a DIE-HARD Star Wars fan but I have seen all the movies, played both KOTORs, read some literature etc. You can say I'm just an avarage fan. And maybe it was because of high expectations, fueled by rave revievs, but after the screening I was very dissapointed with The Last Jedi. Few ""interesting"" twists, like 3 (genuinely) funny moments, beautiful visuals. Apart from that - uneven story, parody of the SW universe, facepalm after a facepalm. Maybe it is a movie for 7 year olds? I guess I am not the target audience anymore. It is painful to say but I am not invested in these characters and almost don't look forward to their future adventures at all. I wish it wasn't this way, it is Star Wars after all... Oh well, I am sad.",0

1128,"I left the movie empty. That was a big surprise for a Star Wars movie, and I've realized this was not a Star Wars film!  The feel was Disney or Marvel. You could miss this movie in the series and that wouldn't be bad. Ohh, and it had some pretty scenes. ***Spoilers***The opening was the same as Thor. Comedy was way over the top and almost speaking directly to the audience(can you hear me now?) Not the comedic tone you will get from the first 6 films. The plot was so full of holes it was painful. Terrible writing. Every character, decision, and plot point is written in for convenience with no thought to how or why. This could be described as a writers attempt to make a world war 2 story about a fleeing ship trying to escape a massive fleet. How do you keep them from getting killed, make them fast. How do you keep them from getting away, add new tech that the top guy doesn't even know is on his own ship. Need to spice up the plot, add a completely avoidable mutiny. Need to get on to the aggressor fleet, pointless painful side plot that doesn't fit at all. Need to save the people in little ships(that in empire strikes back were hyperspace capable), ram the enemy fleet. Need someone to sacrifice for emotional investment, use a brand new character we don't like. Dark side master dies pointlessly, light side master has to do the same. Need your main character back from the bad guy ship, umm let's just not try to explain that one. I think I saw this movie in the 60's. The characters weren't developed, and nothing gets explained. This felt like a collection of Star Wars scenes from earlier movies layered on top of a 60's plot. If you are going to make a Star Wars movie, make a Star Wars movie. Don't make a fan picture begging for money with laughs. Keep the same Star Wars style and feel, take it serious with situational humor on the side. Don't slap us in the face with it. Left the theater empty and unmoved, writing this disappointed. Give us Jar Jar back if that's what it takes to return the rest of the film to quality.",0

1131,"Such a disappointment.This director had zero respect for what Episode 7 had set up, or what Star Wars means. Why did none of the actors tell him NO when they read this illogically and insulting script? (Insulting to the characters and the lore.)",0

1134,"I really wanted to like this film, it had great moments with amazing special effects BUT with that said there is serious issues with the storyline. Let's start with Yoda, I love Yoda but why is he ""old"" and barely moving around when Anakin was made young again at the end of Ep6. Also he's solid not a ghost. Why was Admiral Akbar killed off with no fanfare and who the hell is the second in command with Leia? Why should I care about here???Speaking of caring, what's up with Finn & Rose and their pointless adventure that was painstakingly slow. Not a fan of Rose's acting ability just not good...I'll end with Luke's ending (but I could go on). For a powerful Jedi, they never let him go full Jedi. I mean when he faced off against Emo, sorry I mean Kylo, I was so ready for him to raise arms and knock down AT-AT's like dominos, I have played games with Jedi's who brought down Star Destroyers. Hologram Luke was a fail!",0
1135,"We all know about the rebirth of our lord and savior, Star Wars, two years ago with 'The Force Awakens' (TFA) and with the old characters reintroduced and new, youthful characters in place to take over the Sequel Trilogy, we were left with a promise of an unsure, but exciting future. 1 out of 2 ain't bad I guess.Despite the twists and turns in the narrative that make the movie feel more refreshing than the previous entry, 'The Last Jedi' (TLJ) feels slapped together and doesn't really know what it wants to be. It just knows it wants to be 'different', which actually wouldn't be too bad if this was a spinoff Star Wars movie ala Rogue One or the upcoming Han Solo solo film. I'm all for seeing experimental Star Wars films, but I also firmly believe that the Saga films are meant primarily to enrich and build upon the legends and mythology surrounding the Skywalker lineage.But even when I try to embrace the changes that are being made to the aesthetics, narrative approach and character behavior,  TLJ still has a lot of issues unfortunately. There's a lot of cheap and forced humor that kills the mood and pulls people out of the experience. The plot wields flimsy character arcs and the cast has no chemistry with one another. There's lots of clunky and awkward exposition. New characters are introduced that either distract or complicate the overall narrative and are mostly forgettable or unlikable. Many of the effects could've used a few more passes. And it has so many 'gotcha' twists that it jumps at light speed beyond the boundaries of excessive. It makes subverting expectations a priority at the cost of good storytelling and it values unpredictability and excessive, cheap trickery over good setup and execution. They tried so hard make TLJ so different from traditional Star Wars that they forgot to simply...make a good movie.But the real atrocity happens when the mythology and lore from the previous films are taken into consideration. The Last Jedi feels like it hates everything about Luke Skywalker and The Force Awakens. That last scene from TFA was built up to be a magical moment in the eyes of so many fans and in TLJ it's treated like a Pee Wee Herman joke. It's sidesteps so hard that it almost literally discards itself and makes a mockery of a beautifully executed ball pass. Finn and Poe's individual personalities and side stories are so bland and uninteresting that it grinds the momentum of the movie to a halt. Rey ends up feeling more like a supporting character. And veteran characters are treated as gimmicky rather than respected and beloved.That's not to say there are no redeemable qualities. SOME of the humor works, Porgs are surprisingly delightful, there are several stunning money shots, Adam Driver brings his A-game as Kylo, everyone else does a good job acting with the material they were given, and there's a pivotal moment given to an unnamed character that felt genuinely inspired. Unfortunately, what little there is to commend gets pulled into the dark side by all of the issues caused by sloppy and adolescent storytelling. The Last Jedi is proving to be a very divisive film and with good reason. It's not a very good film on it's own merits, but once you factor in the mythology and lore of Star Wars it becomes a strong contender for the worst of the Saga films. It's a  flavor of the month movie that will age horribly among a line of films that are virtually timeless. It will be the black sheep of the Saga as it lowers the standards of what passes for a Saga film. It taints the legacy and the mythos in favor of fleeting meta narrative and Tweets. And it's a real shame considering this is both Mark Hammill and Carrie Fisher's last hurrah. If Episode 7 awakened the force, then The Last Jedi put it in a coma.***SLIGHT SPOILERS***Other random issues with TLJ include: the entire 2nd act is basically the bad guys with their superior vessels chasing the good guys through space at matched speeds until the good guys run out of fuel (basically a non-chase) and it feels slooowww...in EVERY sense of the word. The Leia scene (you know what I'm talking about). The only lightsaber battle is forgettable after a few hours. The entire sequence on the casino planet felt like a deleted scene from the prequels. Supporting characters would rather free captive animals than free slave children. Snoke and Captain Phasma were very underwhelming. Cheap nostalgiac references that pose as intelligent metanarrative. Not enough crazy alien space monsters, not enough planetary exploration, not enough droid and alien sidekick action...and DEUS EX MACHINACEPTION!!!***END***",0
1136,"Liberal media outlets are trying to dismiss the backlash against The Last Jedi as ""alt-right"" anger over a female lead and a diverse cast.  This is dishonest; it isn't the diversity and (more specifically) the female empowerment, but the in-your-face preaching about it, that is so off-putting.It's all very calculated.  A purple-haired female admiral, looking like the last thing the audience would expect, comes onto the scene from out of nowhere.  Poe even says, ""That's not what I was expecting.""  And in so doing, he is supposed to represent us, the audience.  Then, when he is schooled for thinking wrongly, in actuality it's us being schooled.But we're not sexist, are we?  We accept Leia Organa as the leader of the Resistance.  But they deliberately present us with this new character, speaking condescendingly and dismissively to the most heroic member of the Resistance, just so they can bait us into being annoyed with her...so that they can then preach at us for feeling that way.It's the ultimate Mary Sue moment: Come from out of nowhere, teach us an in-your-face lesson, be 100% right, and go down in a blaze of glory.",0

1138,"Entretiene, es verdad, pero es mala por donde se le mire. Los personajes no solo carecen de motivaciones concretas o realistas, además son torpes y muy bufones. Es como si Starwas se mezclara con Guardianas de la Galaxia, lo que produce confusión y hace muy ridículas muchas partes. Disney ha llevado el film a una exposición de múltiples personajes y naves para vender. (Spoilers de aquí en adelante) La fuerza y lo que la fuerza puede ser sigue distorsionada y no pretende ser canónica. La trama NO responde ninguna de las preguntas sobre Rey, ni sobre Snoke, ni sobre la fuerza como energía en este nuevo escenario, o el Rol político del Nuevo Orden. Incluso la aparición de Yoda es tonta e innecesaria!!.  Luke está distorsionado como personaje (lo dijo Mark Hamill en entrevistas) aquí hay un buena interpretación pero el problema esta en la trama. Los agujeros en la trama son EVIDENTES, suenan a recortes de montaje, pero aun así, no están a la altura de lo que yo espero de un film como este. puntos a su favor es que debe ser el episodio más bello, visualmente hablando, de toda la saga... Pero la capacidad del director  no logra dar en el tono para sacar adelante un guión débil como este.Lo único correcto para mi es el título ""El último Jedi"" ya que es el último que veré en el cine, Disney mató la franquicia, el resto de los episodios por venir los veré  en el TV cable.

1140,"For the first time in my life, I've left a Star Wars movie disappointed. Yes, I even found some enjoyment in episode 1, 2 & 3 (nobody can deny the action scenes were epic!), but The Last Jedi was a complete disappointment from top to bottom. The action was lame, the story was lame, the jokes were lame, the pacing was off, and of course the acting was atrocious. I believe the only reason the critics and some audience members are giving this a glowing review is primarily due to Carrie Fisher's passing. The film virtually has no redeeming qualities. Thankfully, this is a one and done effort from this director. Hopefully, Star Wars can get back on track with the next episode.",0
1141,"The Last Jedi curiously indulges in some of the worst traits of the Star Wars saga (awkward sub plots, undeveloped characters, unearned dramatic queues) at the same time it conscientiously - almost spitefully - labors to discredit some of the best (brave but unpolished heroes, the mythos of the Jedi, the hard-earned nobility of Luke).Part of the problem is that this latest entry in the Star Wars realm is so preoccupied with subverting expectations and wiping the slate clean that it doesn't appear to have any other purpose. Compelling development for the new cast is scarce, a small number of noteworthy characters are unceremoniously dismissed with almost no dramatic weight and the handling of presumed 'Last Jedi' Luke Skywalker is so inconsistent with his established character and legacy that what should have been the return of a hero ends up being a bitterly disappointing farce.At best, The Last Jedi is a missed opportunity. To long time Star Wars fans, however, it may feel more like a cruel joke.",0
1143,"Abysmal, barely felt like a Star Wars film. So disappointing! Left me not caring what will happen in episode 9 now. Plus the plot holes are unforgivable!",0
1144,"The good things first, maybe. I laughed about three times during the movie. I even got all misty-eyed when Rose's sister managed to drop the bombs onto the Dreadnaught with grim determination... then my wife wondered, ""they're in space without gravity, how can they *drop* bombs?"" She's not big on physics so I suggested that maybe the Dreadnaught was big enough to provide sufficient gravity, but this anecdote is symptomatic of my problems with the movie. It does have some beautiful set pieces, some striking visuals, it just doesn't really have a story to tell and the narrative strings which exist are full of holes. Like when Holdo actually manages to destroy or cripple the entire fleet chasing them. Sure, it was a lovely scene, breathtaking even. And when it's over you think, 'Wait, they can do that? Why wasn't this part of their original plan? Why didn't they do that with the other three ships they gave up. If they were going to be destroyed anyway, their pilots dying pointlessly, they could have done so. Or they could have used the transport Finn and Rose used to embark on their adventure.' And that was just the most glaring problem I saw without even having to think about it.Characters don't develop or have arcs, they just twist in the wind, the exceptions being Kylo Ren and Rey who pretty much resist any form of development. Ren is a crappy Sith and Rey is a crappy Jedi, but that bit at least I trust is in there so they can finally meet in the middle and get rid of these harebrained pseudo-philosophies cooked up by Lucas. Luke has an arc of sorts but it's woefully unsatisfying, his one moment of realization marred by the fact that he gets helped out by Yoda again rather than achieving said realization under his own power.The entire side-plot with Finn and Rose adds nothing to the story at the end of the day other than giving Finn something to do and adding in a character to encourage Chinese investors. Also, Rose is essentially a janitor on the cruiser, right? She says she spends all day behind vents or pipes or something. Where does she get off piloting an attack craft? I'm not even saying she shouldn't, but just like the possible gravity of the Dreadnaught, the movie might have done well acknowledging that this isn't just done for effect or to placate a certain audience but that there is an internal logic at play here. They could have cut things like cows stampeding through a casino to make room for things that actually make the plot seem less threadbare. But look! We have a dozen new cute CGI aliens in this movie!The Force Awakens didn't grip me but it was a solidly-made movie with a developing plot. Rogue One was actually excellent, doing a lot of things right. So I did try to be optimistic about this one, but there was just no story here. This felt like a random episode of a Sci-Fi TV show, right down to the technobabble.",0
1145,"What was once a galaxy far far away has become a galaxy lost in space. While we can all agree that the original Star Wars is a sci-fi fantasy, it still managed to maintained a sense of humanness and structure that took viewers there and connected us with the characters. I understand that it was challenging to blend the old with the new, but Episode XII was a tremendous start! Conversely, it requires no skill or creativity to take Star Wars in a completely different direction and undermine everything that has made Star Wars special all these years. However, it takes a lot of guts to ruin something like Star Wars, so I do give them credit for having the strength to do that. Revenues are strong this year because XII was great, and I believe a lot of disappointed viewers went to see the movie a second time to try and gain a better understanding. Unfortunately, it still makes absolutely no sense to me.",0
1146,"TLJ was the first Star Wars movie that I couldn't get immersed in. Most of the characters acted like children, out of character, and their actions made little sense. Awkward humor every minute, and the whole movie is based around the First Orders elite star destroyers puttering after a single rebel space bus waiting 18 hours for it to run out of gas. And yet Finn and crybaby Rose can take a small ship on a side quest to a planet light years away and come back to the puttering chase. Absolutely ridiculous logical fallacy. I left the theater very frustrated.",0
1147,"What a truly awful return to the Star Wars universe.  I had been looking forward to discovering at least SOME of the secrets from the Force Awakens.  But alas, it wasn't to be.  Rian Johnson just brushed away everything that had come before so he could do what he wanted, rather than what the fans wanted and expected.  He was completely the wrong choice for this movie.  It seems he's tried to create art-house Star Wars and filled the movie with a few flashy colour schemes, some nonsensical and pointless plots (half the film was spent not advancing the story at all).  I never thought I would utter these words, but honestly - ""The Prequels"" were better.  Yeah, The Last Jedi is that bad.  At least the Prequels kept some feeling of Star Wars in them.  The Last Jedi is devoid of that life, it is dark and dreary and dull.  I hope Abrams can pull the series back with Episode IX.",0

1150,"Ok, my rant back then was awful. I complained about the film, but then I went off about users needing their voices to be heard, and while that would fit for Rotten Tomatoes, it wouldn't fit here exactly. Let me redo this.The movie is filled with awful comedy. The jokes get in the way, are awkward, and just drag on. The Porgs are also annoying and unnecessary.Finn, Poe, BB-8, Phasma, Hux, and the other side characters are mistreated and don't really do anything. And because they barely interact with Rey and Kylo, they come off as unnecessary filler. The Canto Bight part was irritating and long, and Holdo's stupidity was painful to sit through.I also hated how main plots from TFA were concluded, like the character of Snoke, Finn and Phasma's rivalry, Rey's parents being nobodies, Rey possibly joining the dark side, Kylo posibly joining the light side, etc. With all of those being finished, this trilogy basically became a rip off of the original trilogy. TFA was already so similar to A New Hope, and this just became Empire Strikes Back. A character trains to be a Jedi and learns more about themselves, people need help fighting the bad guys so some of them go to a fancy planet for help, main characters have a personal feud and try to convince the other one to join their side, etc.I did like the story between Rey, Luke, and Kylo. That kept me interested in what was going to happen next. But this film is bogged down by the new direction and writing.""EPISODE IX WILL PROBABLY KILL CHEWBACCA, HAVE BAD JOKES, AND WILL BE A RIPOFF OF RETURN OF THE JEDI!""Me from the future: I got 2 out of 3 of those right. Chewbacca was nearly killed, but Leia took his place instead.So, 3/10.",0

1152,"I don't understand the positive reviews for this at all. Like others, I feel all but certain the critics are getting bought off.First, the good. This'll be quick. Kylo Ren isn't bad (he's not very scary and is rather whiny for a villain, but honestly that's pretty tame criticism compared to the rest of the movie). I like Rey, and I'm still looking forward to her maturing into a true badass in Episode IX. IMO, that'll be the only possible way to save it. Thanks to VIII, IX cannot possibly be terribly thought-provoking or deep. That's the reality of it. But it could still be fun to see Rey wantonly tearing through the Imperial ranks. Finn could also be good, if the universe around him starts making some sense again.That's it though. Luke was cut down from an aspirational hero into a crotchety, world-weary hermit too cowardly to risk anything to save the lives of his family or friends, or to help the cause he believed in. To the bitter end, he was barely willing to lift a finger. And what did this to him? Losing a nephew to the dark side? His father was lost to the dark side before he knew who he even was, and he fought to bring him back to the light; even succeeded in the end. THIS is the guy who was utterly destroyed by the knowledge that his nephew wasn't all that great? Come on now.Superleia? How can one not lol watching that?The physics were unbelievably bad even by Star Wars standards. Bomber runs in outer space? I can't even suspension-of-disbelief that one. A ""chase scene"" where the giant mega-destroyer can't just catch up to the rebels for some reason? Using hyperspace to kamikaze a ship? Not only does it defy the very definition of the word ""hyperspace,"" if it really worked that way they would have weaponized it immediately after it was invented. The entire SW universe would be a different place.The side-story with Finn and Rose is nonsensical, boring, and totally unnecessary. Actually, that's a lot of this movie: unnecessary. Seriously, it's a chase scene. In better Star Wars movies, this would have been an action-packed 20 minutes followed by whatever's next.Who the hell is Snoke? Here's there, then he's gone, and I never give a damn about him on e way or another. I actually thought he was kind of hilarious when he was using the force to toy with Rey and Kylo.Anyway, the scene where Snoke dies is pretty badass. Give me a reason to care about who they're killing, and do that for 2 hours, and there's a successful episode IX in my book. But this... this...  so awful.",0

Im not going deep because many professional reviewer did before me, i just wanna throw my voice somewhere for the hope of change...The story and the scripts are so stupid, i just dont understand how this is being allowed. I feel the whole movie created just because to sell more retard porg toy for the kids... a two and a half commercial basically.. and i dont wanna be that ""salty"" guy but the people who say this is the best star wars movie of all time are blind or !!PAID!! so hard. OFC the visuals on the top, cool, YAY!... But its so empty... just empty.. Overall 1/10 just because Mark Hamill.. Mark Hamill is awesome.",0

On a related note: Something extremely strange has happened with the professional critics' reviews.  Are they simply out of touch with the moviegoing public?  Afraid they will lose their jobs if they give a Star Wars film a bad review?  Or bought and paid for by the powers-that-be?  It's troubling.",0

The Force is definitely not with this one. I call on considering it non-canon.",0
1166,"I've never seen a franchise completely misunderstand its main protagonist like the way Luke was treated in The Last Jedi. Sure, I get that failure is the big theme here and even legends can fail, but they did in a way that was astronomically out of character. Luke doesn't turn his back on people. Even if he goes emo because of his failure with Kylo, is that supposed to be traumatic enough to let the whole universe suffer as he tries to go into hiding forever? Nonsense. His 'conversion' scene is also dumb. Rey says I believe in you, and all of a sudden Luke has his conviction again. Completely unearned. But even when he does come back, it's another example of misdirection as he literally does nothing the audience hopes he will do. Rogue One had the Vader scene that blew the roof off the house. We want to cheer for our Star Wars characters!! This movie refused to portray Luke as anything other than an old man ready to die. So infuriating.",0
1167,"I've registered here just to leave my feedback to this movie.I was thinking that the Force Awaken was just a bad start and it won't get any worser...

Complete disappointment... :(P.S.Thank you Metacritic for opportunity to see real ratings and feedbacks",0
1168,Star Wars: Episode VII is a deus ex machina festival with a lot of jokes. That movie makes the prequel trilogy good! Phantom manace at least have good lightsaber fights and podracers.,0
1169,"Spoiler Free Review:The movie is visually stunning, including some beautiful shots of several of the landscapes, wide shots of big space battles and lightsaber duels. The CGI was great everywhere, and the sound design for a particular beautiful scene was extremely effective. However, the plot is lazy and boring. The dialogue is probably the corniest Star Wars has been since Episode 3. There's a whole 35 minute side-adventure that a few characters went on that adds nothing to the movie, distracts the viewers from the tension of the main story, and was just a generally boring sequence. The movie suffers from the problem of ""if only the characters had just talked to each other, this wouldn't have happened"", and to me, that's just very lazy writing. The acting overall is mediocre. Adam Driver knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of his internal conflicts, but the other actors and actresses did not impress. I've heard some reviewers complain about some new aspects/capabilities of the Force that haven't ever been shown in the Star Wars movies before, but I personally have no problems with it. The Star Wars universe needs to expand somehow, and that's fine by me. Three out of ten stars, one for the visuals, one for the Porgs & BB-8, and one for Adam Driver.",0

1173,"Yes I'm a Star Wars nerd and I was so disappointed in The Last Jedi that I had to share my Rotten Tomatoes review...which I've never written before:SPOILER ALERT:A VERY DISAPPOINTED DIEHARD FAN. I haven’t been able to get rid of this knot in my stomach of disappointment and feeling upset since watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I don’t blame Disney because they got it right with The Force Awakens and Rogue One, but I do most certainly blame Rian Johnson. He has single handedly ruined, if nothing else, the story of Luke Skywalker. Remember, the very last time that we saw Luke was as a wise, strong, teachable, and good natured young man that had just faced his Father and the Emperor. He had very humbly burned the suit of Darth Vader after having a heart wrenching first and last conversation with his real Father.Jump to now, The Last Jedi, we meet a resentful, selfish, and angry Luke who is only worried about himself as he says “I came here to die”. And why? Because Kylo Ren turned on you to the darkside? So that’s how this once wise, strong, teachable, and good natured Luke deals with challenges, to isolate and think only of his failure? Not to mention the fact that he has ‘lost his faith’ in the Jedi and his once perfect understanding and humble use of the force? Just because it would appear Mark Hamill is a little resentful and overly sarcastic at times doesn’t mean that’s who we knew Luke Skywalker to be. How can anyone really watch the original trilogy now with the same feelings towards Luke knowing what a loser he ends up becoming? Why care about Luke at all anymore? He doesn’t even care for Yoda it would appear. How contrasting was that compared to the last time we saw them together?The movie felt like constant projection of Rian Johnson, projecting his own person opinions and resentments and humor (that he personally finds funny) in nearly every single scene. There were times I felt like I was watching The Hunger Games and no longer Star Wars. Purple hair, come on. Why do we have to modernize, and in turn ruin the greatest movie series ever made? The planet of gamblers and casinos also felt like Hunger Games and the police looked like they belonged on The Incredibles. My son adores Star Wars at age 6. But he won’t be able to watch this film for years to come with all the overly intense and dark nature with Snoke, far too much compared to what we’re used to which is saying something. And when did Star Wars decide to swear constantly? Talk about trying to ‘get with the times’ in a world where swearing isn’t nearly as offensive or uncommon as it now is.I could go on and on about flying Princess Leia’s and how pathetic those AT-AT’s now look compared to those pointless other machines next to them that are far larger and apparently supposed to be cooler. I want Episode 8 back with a clean slate and pray that someday, someone will remake it and retain the sanctity of what it once was. But how? Mark Hamill will be gone soon and we’ll be left with the memory of how we once viewed him in his role of Luke Skywalker before Rian Johnson destroyed it all with his own projection and agenda.Any movie can entertain you, but Star Wars has always been about more than that.",0
1174,"Napoleon Dynamite makes a great villain. I love preachy, condescending social justice themes in my sci fi (whether I agree with them or not). You really don’t have enough girl power in this movie - More cowbell! Laura Dern’s character is such a pivotal historical figure in the series and deserved such a large climatic role unlike Admiral Akbar who you rightfully unceremoniously killed off and literally gave his seat to someone no one cared about. I love how you developed a new character - Rose but completely ignored any development of prior main characters. I love how righteous and powerful every female character is in the movie and all male characters are impulsive and/or bumbling broken idiots. More cowbell!/sarcasmSeriously you could have saved this movie if you put any of the franchise actor in the Laura Dern role.  What is her name again? Admiral Mary Sue?",0
1175,"It might be a fun movie on its own, but a part as saga its a completle disaster. It destroys the characters, the lore, the story, everything. It felt like a marvel movie, which was not what I was looking for.",0
1176,"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie in the 40-year-old franchise, and it's a rolling dumpster fire of a film to boot. Many seasoned fans like me absolutely detest this movie, but not because it ""takes bold risks"" and ""wants to be different,"" as if we're too immature and selfish to accept ""change."" Just stop using those weak straw men arguments.We all know there are thoughtful, clever ways to make a unique and beloved movie by building upon an established universe and its characters. While The Empire Strikes Back succeeds in this -- being a completely different movie in tone and plot than A New Hope -- The Last Jedi strives to trash opportunities, insult fans, destroy legacies, and waste screen time, especially with respect to Kylo, Rey, Snoke, Luke, and Leia. Why? If you thought prequel elements like a 50's diner, fart jokes, midichlorians, Jar Jar, baby Boba Fett, space taxes, and ""Noooo!"" ruined Star Wars, then be prepared for numerous shocking and/or cringe-worthy surprises: The Last Jedi literally begins with a space-faring prank call, a bit that could have passed for a Verizon Super Bowl half-time commercial. Wow, how...creative! There is also a nauseating scene involving milking a green alien teat into a sports bottle. Again, why? Would post-divorce George Lucas even have the stones to storyboard an alien nipple? There is much more crap to say about The Last Jedi, but it was very difficult to pay attention after I wanted to walk out of the theater with my pretzel bites within the first hour. The wagon-train plot and its ""epic casino mount"" side-quest are boring, illogical, and unfulfilling. Most characters don't make any sense. For example, BB8 goes full-on Titanfall to save some idiots, and he becomes an actual weaponized coin bank! (I wish he'd spit some refunds back to the audience.) I think the worst thing about this movie is that it gleefully destroys Star Wars and its legacy -- things that make the movies amazing, memorable, and timeless. It treats viewers, young and old, like tools who need to be lectured or pitched a shady sale. Remember, kids: ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" The mild twists, forced humor, and unexpected character deviations just aren't worth the costs to the culture. It'll still sell some sympathy toys, though...maybe some green alien milk.Compared with the Disney safety squad who produced The Force Awakens, it seems like The Last Jedi was created in a pretentious vacuum of the most eccentric yes-men (or yes-women) with TNT-fueled chainsaws. Seriously, is this The Hateful Eight or Episode VIII? Why would film makers -- in the midst of a new, successful franchise -- flee from the potential of solved mysteries and blossoming intrigue developed by its predecessor? Why excitingly tease the audience (most of which were willing to forgive The Force Awakens for its flaws) but then crush their hopes, not even acknowledging the many abandoned questions? How far does the line have to move until Star Wars is just another Marvel or DC movie and the force becomes a slapstick mutant superpower?Yes, there are many questions and dirty deeds. I'm too shocked to list them all. I've realized this whole Disney Star Wars thing is not only baffling but it's bordering on treacherous. So, I'd like to protect my good memories and watch the old movies, which are far better than this travesty. Disney has lost a life-long fan; I will not be investing any more time, energy, or money in any new Star Wars movies. That is a promise.",0
1177,"I don't even know where to begin, this is not the Star Wars universe I remember, and I can't believe critics raved about this movie. The epic characters and story told in episodes 1-6 just isn't here, everything feels off, and pointless. I miss George.",0
1178,"One of the worst star wars films made. Rian Johnson clearly didint understand the saga and made a good action film with a marvel vibe, but a shallow star wars films. He even manage with destroying the best things that Force Awakening let us wondering. Now we feel a little empty and hopeless waiting for Episode 9. I really hope J.J will fix this mess.",0
1179,"Just terribly disappointed. I feel like the creators really didn't have a good grasp on the characters. They took one of the most iconic characters and turned him into a coward that would kill someone in their sleep instead of confronting them in open battle. They kept luke in hiding instead of again confronting the first sith/evil that arose after he beat the emperor. I feel alot of outlets are just carrying the water for this movie. Superman Leia? Really? Come on guys. I think many actually didnt like it but arw afraid to say it. Our hero characters of theart 40 years were just openly trashed and replaced with Mary she's. Even directly spoke to us and said let the past die. The new characters aren't deep enough and since no one created any backstory for most of the characters they can't be. Snoke could have been the most notorious villian in SW history yet, he was killed without even dipping toe into it. Even if a new franchise is created to explain it, the damage was done to this story. Basically this is a movie where everything that was created before it is discarded and made mute and pointless. So many wasted opportunities and mistreated characters. Thanks again hollywood.",0
1180,Boycott this movie. It's not Star Wars. Main problem with this new trilogy is not that it's bad in itself but that it also destroys all previous films making them futile.,0
1181,"This is quite possibly the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Yes, even worse than Attack of the Clones. Rian Johnson took everything set up in The Force Awakens and threw it away for cheap shock and plot twists. The plot itself is absolutely pointless and two scenes actually manage to introduce massive plot holes in the entire series.The characters are flat and one-dimensional. Rey becomes even more of a Mary Sue, Finn is wasted and is involved in a boring plotline that doesn't go anywhere, Poe has become comedian, and Luke gets the worst of it all. Only ""character assassination"" can describe what has happened to him.The tone of the movie is all over the place. It's ""dark"", but it has so much Marvel-style quips that it feels like a parody of itself. The pacing is non-existant. Scenes are juxtaposed all the time.In summary, I can't believe I want George Lucas back.",0
1182,"I still can't believe that the movie ended up being like this. This is just a disgrace to the Star Wars series.Regarding main characters:Rey is just a rehash of previously shown jedi, she has no development whatsoever. It was even worse than in Episode 7 with her force and jedi combat skills appearing out of nowhere, she is able to stay on par with Kylo Ren in his normal state after 3 (!!!) days of training.Luke was turned into a complete moron and weakling, the plot was so badly written that they had to bring up Yoda out of nowhere to add some motivation for Luke's actions.Snoke turned out to be...a plot device, nothing more.Kylo Ren was exactly the same as in the 7th movie, nothing new.Finn and Rose Fantastic Beasts-style adventure was a cringefest, it added absolutely NOTHING to the story. Trying to make drama out of Rose’ retarded actions at the end of the film was absolutely disgusting, the same can be said about classic self-sacrificial attempt out of nowhere by Finn (motivation problems?).On top of that, half of the cast was turned into clowns with classic Disney humor. Seemed like they tried to apply MCU formula to SW universe.Regarding everything else:From the beginning to the end, the movie is a complete mess. Too many coincidences, too many illogical actions by the characters, abnormally high amount of explosions and cringey moments, which are supposed to be funny. None of the answers from the part 7 were answered, they were just outright ignored. The only lightsaber combat scene is devoid of any emotions or even decent choreography and looks like an overhyped stage performance. They could’ve done so much with all the material they had, but they’ve decided not to.Part 8 shares nothing in common with either the original trilogy or even the prequels. Aspects of the universe, in which these movies exceled, are absent here altogether. However, there is nothing to compensate for that. The movie is a massive letdown, a generic blockbuster. This is by no means a Star Wars movie.",0
1183,"Spoilers:This was hands down the worst SW movie of all time. I normally don't review movies.I Am a lifelong star wars fan, I grew up with the ot and liked the prequels. Never got on the hate train for those. Hated TFA for obvious reasons, liked rogue one even though it has flaws, but holy **** tlj made aotc look like citizen Kane. Bad script, pacing, dialogue, delivery, rationale, plot justification, character building, ending and don't get me started on the humor.nothing gets ezplained. NOTHING! Laura Dern annoyed the **** out of me. Worst line of the movie ""god speed rebels"", wtf, there is no god in star wars, ""may the force be with you"" would have been more appropriate. Rey is also proven to be a Mary Sue. Luke was a wasted character. Mark Hamil was the only bright spot. And why the **** was bb8 driving a chicken walker? I'm also for gender equality, but why aren't there any men in charge of the resistance? Not one of them is. Star wars is dead. It's a political propoghanda film with alot of Kathleen Kennedy's meddling involved. I am fan of Rian Johnson's work but you can tell he was nudged in a direction cause his past films are excellent. People like me helped build this franchise especially through the years especially when nobody gave a **** pre 2000's, well not anymore. I am done.bring George back. Please.....fire Kathleen Kennedy.i am angry and want my money back.",0
1184,"As much as it hurts to say this movie was a train wreck from start to finish. Poor editing,pacing,dialogue,effects and completely appalling story decisions that take a huge dump on beloved characters and established lore. Saw it with a group of huge SW fans and none of us liked it, did I watch a different movie than the critics? A 94% on RT, many critics saying it is the best SW movie since Empire. It is easily the worst, the prequels despite all of their flaws are more entertaining than this heap. I loved episode 7 and I was ecstatic for the direction of this new trilogy, but not I am just left hurt and confused.",0
1185,"Extremely unhappy with the characterization of Luke and the mistreatment of important plot points carefully set up in The Force Awakens, which are unceremoniously discarded here.

And as Mark Hamill said in an interview talking about Rian Johnson's choices for TLJ, ""I fundamentally disagree with everything you've written"".",0
1186,A complete trainwreck.  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie the critics are gushing over because the version I saw was a 5 minute sugar rush coating a 2.5 hour steaming turd.With all the resources Rian Johnson had available to him he comes up with this? You can find better fan fiction on Reddit.,0
1188,"There are some very real issues with this film that people should not simply ignore by writing it off as ""a kid's movie"" or ""just something different."" They need to try to understand where the haters are coming from and realize that there is some logic at play there, not just butthurt fanboys who are not ""true fans."" The film is too long, relies on a terrible chase through space sequence that makes no logical sense. If the first order outnumbers them a thousand to one, they could easily have other ships jump in ahead of their position and end it instantly. The fact that they do not do this makes the first order AGAIN look inept. The Canto Bite segment was unnecessary and BB8 constantly rescuing them through slapstick hijinx got old really quick. Like VII, just constantly too many plot holes to avoid. How did Rey get back on the Falcon after Snoke? How did Finn drag Rose 2 miles back to the entrance without getting shot in less than a few minutes? How did Rey know to look for them escaping through the back tunnel? That is just the tip of the iceberg. It is not us fans being salty- it is us expecting better when there IS some amazing SW fiction out there right now that is wonderful. The Comics, Rebels tv show-- feel more like the SW universe that we grew up with and know. This is something else. Something that is just not well thought out. VII was a step in the wrong direction, this is the second step in that same direction. Let's not even talk about the fact that the questions they have been baiting us with for years in regards to Snoke and her parents, do not even matter at all. Done with with soap opera that used to be a space opera.",0
1189,"I really disliked this movie. What should have been incredibly tense action is undermined by a tone straight out of an animated Disney film (save the cute animals!). Characters that started out fairly interesting or at least with potential in ep.7, like Finn, fall completely flat in this one. Plot lines, imagery and even dialogue are copied/pasted straight out of the original trilogy. Everything feels forced, and imbued with a corporate blandness. There are constant, pointless ""plot twists"", and as a bonus, everything you knew and loved from Star Wars gets thrown out the window.",0
1190,"A legendary missed opportunity and supremely frustrating experience.  While some shots are beautiful and a few scenes even compelling, the overall movie is a contrived mess that takes an ax to the story of the previous films and providing only some tensionless action schlock in return.  Many character decisions are utterly baffling or groan-worthy, and one even provides a new Worst Line in the Saga - yes, below even not liking sand.Ultimately, the movie weighs on you like some Dark Side user is trying to choke you from a system away.  It deserves recognition for its quality cinematography and a few well-executed scenes, but the overall product is not worth spending money on.Yes, I would personally consider this movie worse than any of the prequels.",0

1192,"This movie is an insult to Star Wars and it's fans.  I know Lucas made mistakes but this poorly told story goes out of its way to undermine everything special George created.  Shame on Johnson, the story group and whoever did not stop this slop from getting on the screen.  The lack of SW feel, sincerity, and genuine characters is disturbing.   Then there is the inability to give quality answers to the questions posed in its predecessor.  It seems that there was never a story plan at all and this is just action set pieces to wow the audience.  That garbage might work with Transformers fans but this is SW.  For most of us, George Lucas taught us to appreciate story and the heroes journey, that Joseph Campbell preached into relevancy.  SW fans are not stupid and should not be treated that way. This is how i felt leaving the theater.I am not entertained or amused by milking alien creatures, characters acting out of character, and subplot characters who have no relevancy on the universe.  When you see the movie you will know my meaning  I am also not interested in shirtless bad guys or thin plot points with flat back door answers.  The worst crime this movie commits is a blatant slap in Lucas's face by denouncing the very essence of the Force.  Treating our prior characters like morons and completely missing the points that the prequels established.  Ep's 1-3 may have faults but they did explain the universe.  George is a smart storyteller and this movie obviously wants nothing to do with his theories.  It's shameful and disturbing. I feel there is no way to save the third installment of this trash, so it must play out.  But a house cleaning should be done immediately and a person who loves and knows SW should be put in charge of story development.  There have been many aside from Lucas who get it over the years: Zahn, Filoni, and whoever should be complimented on Rogue One.  This atrocity should not go unnoticed and if you are a fan who bashed the prequels you should be even more enraged than Anakin cutting pears with the force.  This Last Jedi should be the LAST bad SW movie.",0
1193,"Spoilers.....Who was Snoke? Why did he die in the middle of a speech about how what was about to happen could never happen? Who was the man on the Island pretending to be Luke Skywalker? How can Snoke bend time and space with the force, to allow Rey and Kylo Ren to speak, but die so easily?  Why didn't Snoke **** slap Fake Luke Skywalker into the sea with his mind, given that he must know where Fake Luke Skywalker is at this point, and can attack people by telepathy remotely? How come Princess Leya can survive a hard vacuum, and fly in space?  Why did the bombs fall on the dreadnought even though there was no planet to create the gravity?  Why is the Dark-side of the force represented by a dodgy mirror in a blowhole cave?  Why did Fake Luke Skywalker do such a bad job of pretending to be Real Luke Skywalker? Does Fake Luke Skywalker not know that Real Luke Skywalker is a hero and would never set out to kill Kylo Ren, his nephew? Why did Fake Luke Skywalker force hologram himself into a secret rebel mountain fortress to lightsaber duel Kylo Ren, thus avoid being killed, only to die of exhaustion? When the First Order were chasing the rebel fleet at slower than light speeds, why didn't they send 10,000 tie fighters after the rebels rather than slowly following them in their main ships? Why didn't  Leia Poppins just blast a hole out of the mountain to leave by? Why didn't they auto-pilot the rebel ships they were going to loose at light-speed into the massive enemy ships, given that they flew the last one in manually and wiped out half the FO fleet? Why did Fasma just show up and then die? Who the hell was Fasma? Why aren't all storm troopers in armour like hers?  Why did Fasma specifically find the longest method of killing her captives possible? How come Snoke has the galaxy's largest space ship?  Why didn't the vice admiral tell anyone what her plan was, but instead appear to lead everyone to their deaths, and then act surprised when someone mutinied to try and do something.  Where were the Knights of Ren? Why have they made Rey ""force God"" (the dark-side of the force shows her that she is the embodiment of the Light side of the force)? Why did Luke Skywalker travel to the first Jedi Temple in order to be replaced by Fake Luke Skywalker who jokes about never having read the half a dozen books in the temple because meh? Why was Fake Luke Skywalker surprised that people turned up to elicit the help or Real Luke Skywalker, given that Real Luke Skywalker left a cryptic map to the planet with the 'rebels'?  Why are the rebels/resistance called the rebels/resistance, given that the First Order are the remnants of the Empire; surely the rebels are just the Navy/Army of the legitimate government?  If not then what are the actual legitimate governments doing about the first Order?  How come the Force ghost of Yoda has the power of Thor for no reason, and uses it to destroy the first Jedi Temple?In no particular order those were some of the many questions the film left me with.  Visually nice, good special effects, a couple of half decent fight scenes, OK music.  Worthless plot, stupid characters. Luke Skywalker was a completely different character, Leia has sporadic super powers, Snoke gets cut in half comically, and Admiral Aqbar died.  Oh and all of the white men are 'toxic masculine' figures who are bumbling idiots who need to shut the **** up and get out of the way and let Women (who are superior) do the job.

The plot was horrible, character development was minimal and some of the special effects were terribly rendered.  Since when can Princess Leia fly through space???  Come on, I know we have to suspend disbelief sometimes but WTF.  I would rank this tied with Episode 1 for last or maybe even dead last in the series.  Total garbage, I cant take any more bad Star Wars movies.",0
1197,"A Wasted Opportunity! - New pointless characters that add little to the story. - Finn and Poe doing so little in this movie. - Luke and Leia exiting the trilogy with a whimper. - Snork dead without any character development. - Phasma just being a 2 dimensional character aka punching bag again. - Lousy directing, with scenes shifting back and forth constantly between the various characters. Also ripped off so many scenes from Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back.- Ridiculous plot holes so large that you can drive a Star Destroyer through. Disney has truly ruined Star Wars.",0
1198,"Wow where do I begin? This movie felt like a huge middle finger to Episodes I - VII.  All world building and character development was thrown out the window in favor of nonsensical ""plot twists"" since apparently the writer couldn't come up with curve balls that actually made sense within the larger context of the saga.  To me it felt as if Rian Johnson treated this film as a reboot and did as he pleased as opposed to what made sense to the series as a whole.  You don't take creative liberties with established characters in the EIGHT FILM in a series.  Surprise us but organically not in some wtf ways.  How is Rey so powerful? Who are her parents?  Who and what is Snoke? Where did he come from?  What about the Knights of Ren?  Why has Luke suddenly become a completely different character?  Nah none of this apparently matters anymore.  Finn also gets completed shafted in this film as does Captain Phasma.  At the same time they cram in even more new characters while OT characters and even characters from The Force Awakens get thrown to the sideline.  Hopefully JJ can fix this with Episode IX because although Episode VII The Force Awakens was safe it at least worked within the larger context of the saga.",0
1199,"The enormous gulf between writer/director JJ Abrams for the Force Awakens and Rian Johnson for The Last Jedi is painfully obvious - as a Star Wars movie this fails on almost every level. The Last Jedi doesn't understand the source material, ignores many of the plot threads from its predecessor, misuses and disposes of major characters, is brimming with internal inconsistencies and tries to use cheap laughs to cover for its total lack of story structure.",0
1200,Star Wars: The Last Chance I give Disney. This movie is a giant turd. Why even hire Andy serkis? He is in the film for 10 min and he's sitting for 9.4 of those minutes. Critics must be sucking mickeys tit juice to give this nonsensical boring piece of trash an 86 avg.,0

1204,Rian Johnson should never be allowed near another Star Wars movie again!  I really dislike the way he handled Luke. In one movie he took everything we have come to know about a character and erased it. If you take a step back and just think of all the plot holes in this movie it’s ridiculous.,0
1205,"Thoroughly disappointing movie. Characters felt flat, plot was flawed and boring, the pacing couldn't be worse... The secondary arc, or side quest, is completely pointless, not adding anything to the end of the film and being a complete failure. A lot of bad humour, cheesy and cringeworthy dialogue, lots of weird alien animals getting in the way of the scenes... it reminded me of Attack of the Clones, but with a worse plot. Oh and don't get me started with Snoke... what a waste of a character, what a waste of a villain. As generic and boring as they get. Overall, I'm putting this at the bottom of the star wars films ranking. Can't understand how did it got so many good reviews from critics...",0
1206,"Can't believe all the positive reviews for this strictly kids stuff Star Wars.  Easily the worst of the new (disney) star wars movies.  Great visually, I still love the cast, and I even appreciate the ""message""; but the plot and dialog feels like it was written by a 10 year old. (I guess that's the target audience).  Really so much is just bad and doesn't make sense.  It's stupid at a Transformers or Pirates of the Caribbean level.  If you liked those you'd probably enjoy this along with your lobotomy.  Worst thing about it is Disney signed this guy to make three more star wars movies.  Barf.",0
1207,"Well, I didn't want to watch any trailers or reviews to spoil this movie, which I thought could not be as bad as The Force Awakens; but I was wrong, so wrong, again. You don't need to see any trailers to spoil this movie, you just have to be an avid fan of real Star Wars, and know Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (scene with Snoke) by heart and The Last Jedi is spoiled. Why? Beacuse it's a soft, shallow remake, reboot and mishmash of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi best scenes, but ruined with CGI, EXTREME over-the-top political correctness and weak, uncharismatic main characters, be it villains or heroes or yet undecided/unturned. Compared to this movie and Episode 7, prequel trilogy is a masterpiece (I thought I would never say that!).I will give this movie a score of 1, just because of the scene in which Luke uses a blade of grass to show Rey how ""strong"" and what ""Force"" is?! At least The Last Jedi XXX Parody makers will have easier job of writing ""complex"" sceneplay; they can just use the ""original"" script!",0
1208,Is really bad. Like it tries to put jokes that are not funny and ruined the characters. Every single expectiation about the past of some characters is vanished because no one takes the risk to go on a new way. Hated it. Star Wars is dead,0

They ditched the old EU that could've given us awesome movies for this?So, luke does nothing and actually never leaves the porg planet.The hero we grew up with is now a coward that tried to kill a kid asleep?

AND he still dies?Snoke is a nobody and dies just like that.What do we have left to look forward for episode IX?What the hell did I just watch?",0
1213,"A strange experience as a moderate Star Wars fan who loved and obsessed over the initial trilogy, became slightly disinterested in the prequel trilogy, and renewed after Episode 7. When I left the theatre after Episode 8, I had gripes but overall was satisfied with the sequel. The more I think of it however, the less charitable I become:- No focus on chemistry and romance. Let me guess - Finn and Rey will not get together, and we won't see even an actual love triangle as the ending of 8 implies. Just an all-white final kiss to cap off what has generally been an impressive egalitarian showing for the cast and crew. Unfortunate.- Destroying genuinely interesting stories. Snoke is dead. Rey's lineage answer: dead. Kylo Ren having a genuine, lasting internal struggle. Dead. Same for Rey. Dead. - Biting off more than it can chew. Rey's exploration in the first half of the film - genuinely moving. The sideshow with Finn and Poe on a ship running out of fuel? Boring, full of plot holes, and what the hell is Benicio del Toro doing here? - Destroying the legacy of Luke Skywalker: the user reviews speak for themselves here, and I think there is something about how his character is portrayed that simply doesn't jive with the character from Episode 4-6. It does tarnish his legacy.I didn't think it was a horrible film, but in some ways I'm more disappointed in it than I was for Episodes 1 and 2. I felt Episode 7 - a flawed but thrilling re-introduction with just a pinch too much nostalgia and copycatting -  was really setting up a dramatic home-run much like Batman Begins did for The Dark Knight. What we have here is a huge missed opportunity in the service of trying to do too many things at one. This should've been a focused film about budding romance, war, and an exploration of the force. Instead we got...DJ",0
1214,"Less than the sum of its parts.  There are very few horrible parts to this movie, aside from the plethora of plot-holes, the inconsistent tone, and that horrible Leia in space scene.  In fact, there are some very good scenes (Rey and Kylo Ren vs the guards, one of the best melee fights in the series).  However, at almost every turn, the movie seems to take the underwhelming option, almost getting things right, but missing almost every single time.  A movie can do that many times, but when it does that, start to finish, it really falls apart.  I came out of the theater thinking that too many consider 'subverting expectations' to be the same as 'making a good movie.'First, the plot that the movie is built around is the Rebel fleet fleeing the First Order fleet, which can track them through hyperspace.  They don't have enough fuel to outrun the FO fleet (pretty sure this is the first time that anyone has mentioned fuel constraints in Star Wars, that bugged me) for long.  There's so many plot holes here that have been rehashed over and over and over by others (mainly, why didn't the FO just call in reinforcements ahead of the rebels), so I'll just offer what I hope is something unique: This plot has already been done before in scifi, and one of the best examples is the 2000s Battlestar Galactica's very first episode, '33.'  RJ would have done well to draw inspiration from that.Second, the subplot of Rose and Finn crashing the set of the Fifth Element... I honestly have nothing new to say about this that I haven't read in a hundred other reviews (including that joke, which I could not resist rehashing).  Also, apparently, horse racing is evil.Third, the plot of Rey's training was so bare bones, when it could have been the centerpiece of the whole movie.  I challenge you to find me anyone that would not have watched two and a half hours of Luke training Rey.  When he finally agrees to give her some training, he tells her he'll give three lessons.  Movie, why say there are three lessons when we only get to see two?  And, of the two, one of them was him talking about how horrible the Jedi are (thats not a lesson, thats just venting).  She gets no training, other than how to reach out and touch the Force.  In other words, she gets to take the easy, quick way, to Force mastery, also known as the Dark Side (which the movie starts to set us up for, with Luke amazed at her innate connection to the Dark Side, and then abandons, just like his third lesson).Mark Hamill's best performance as Luke was wasted here, which is a complete shame.  They could have done the 'Luke in exile' plot so much better, rather than him being jaded and wanting to die.  Why not have him have a crisis of confidence in himself, rather than the Jedi, after his failure with Kylo Ren?  He feels guilt for letting his students down, thinking that he shouldn't have tried to train the new generation of Jedi, since his own training was rushed and incomplete.  He goes into exile to study most ancient of Jedi texts so that he can rise to the occasion and properly redeem himself, but, in his exile, he's so cut off from everyone else that he doesn't recognize what progress he's made as a teacher.  Rey's arrival snaps him out of his funk, and he realizes that his failures as a teacher were part of his own education, and he properly trains her.  See what I mean about the movie constantly almost getting it right?  What I wrote right there?  That makes so much more sense and feels more right than what we got, and it really isn't all that different from what we got on screen.Finally, the decision to kill Snoke was bold, and could have worked... if Kylo Ren were more frightening.  But, he's too easy to outfox - he's like a rabid dog, attacking whatever is in front of him (remember the scene in TFA where the Storm troopers just turn around when they see he's pissed off? There's the rebel strategy, from here on out).I could go on, but then, I'd be writing my own version of The Last Jedi, instead of a critical review, so I'll end with things I liked about it (I can still like parts even while giving it a 0): Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, and Benicio Del Toro gave very compelling performances.  The porgs were perfectly balanced between cute funny and annoying funny.  The humor was not terrible, though the visual gags were better than the actual jokes.  The visuals were very cool; my favorite (though the movie does almost nothing with it; again, with the 'almost getting it right') was Rey in the Dark Side mirror cave.  I'd rate Holdo's hyperspace kamikaze maneuver higher if it weren't for the fact that it raises the twin questions of 'why isn't that a common strategy?' (with automated ships, of course) and 'why don't ships have counters to that?'Anyway, I'd like to think that my objections to the film are based on its artistic merits, rather than its failure to adhere to some sense of 'what Star Wars is/is not.'",0
1215,"This movie was, in a word, bad. Like many, I created an account just to review this movie. I'm not here to scream about my butt-hurt, and I will not jump on the bandwagon of people claiming the movie sucked because of out of control SJWs and Political Correctness. I have no idea what those have to do with this movie. This movie suffers from far more fundamental issues: bad script, bad pacing, bad dialog, jarringly bad and out of place jokes, and plot holes big enough to, literally, drive a star-destroyer through. Worst of all though, it was really, really, boring. This is not the Star Wars movie we were looking for.",0
1216,"3/10 for the overall amazing visuals. Unfortunately there was nothing else to the movie. Very pointless plot with no cohesion. Subplots that go no where. Focus on characters that serve no purpose. No sense of world building. Corny moments and tone deaf humor. I could go on but I'd rather forget I ever watched this ""Star Wars"" film. Play KOTOR 1 and 2, much better plot, characters, world building, and story telling.",0
1217,"this movie is awful, doesnt respect starwars in any way, bad humors that shouldnt have been in the film at all and stupid script full of plot holes that makes ep 7 irrelevant and feel like a movie that never happened.",0
1218,"Spoiler alert... I don't think it's really that much SJW fault, that this movie's story and treatment of the original characters is so bad. As Mark Hamill said, ""It's all about money"". They just made the movie so they can sell toys and to appeal to fake geeks who don't care about Luke or Leia. Those people spend the most money... and to kids too, hence those annoying penguin like creatures. The authors just wanted to get rid of the ""inconvenient"" things, so they scrapped Snoke, Luke, Knights of Ren, etc. And the story is also really stupid. Rebels are incompetent and dim-witted, First Order is cringy and not menacing at all, so many plot-holes were made here, a huge amount of characters kept coming and going just like that, before they could do anything important, half of the movie was completely unnecessary and pointless, just because of a lack of communication and because, damn, those rebels were so stupid, that I have to write it twice. And also, the utter disrespect to 2 of the most beloved fictional characters. It's only Luke Skywalker, probably the most known movie character ever, but **** him anyway, let's make him a coward and completely change his personality. And Leia, she was acting so strange in this movie, she wasn't cool at all. It all shows that the authors of this movie didn't care about the universe, they just made some calculative decisions. The movie's script totally destroys the soul of this universe. This is why I like the expanded universe much better. At least those people cared about the characters and the lore.",0
1219,"It's like Rian Johnson has never seen the entire star wars saga. What we got was disrespectful to to the series as a whole and the fans that have supported it. Star wars is supposed to be written in a way that it has a certain rhythm to it and it connects itself to the other films. This movie couldn't even follow the one that came directly before, let alone have any sort of semblance to the rest of the series as a whole.",0
1220,"This piece of **** is a spit in the face to the fans of the beloved franchise. I have never seen so many plot holes in one movie. Let's start from the beginning - If Luke wanted no one to find him, WHY DID HE LEAVE A **** MAP INSIDE R2???!! Where did Luke's lightsaber come from? (Still a plot hole) Why is Leia superman and can now survive an explosion and air sucked out of her lungs? Why didn't the Leia replacement tell Poe that they were just trying to get to a planet? Poe almost killed everyone and the whole thing could've been stopped with 2 sentences. Why doesn't Kylo Ren realize that Luke was a Force projection if HE JUST BROKE THE LIGHTSABER LUKE WAS HOLDING??!! Why did the AT-AT's not shoot Finn and Rose if they were right in front of them speaking? Why can Yoda use the force if he is **** DEAD?! And if Force Ghosts can now use the Force, why didn't Obi-Wan and Yoda just blow up the Death Star in the original trilogy? It would've saved many lives and resources. How can one X-Wing pilot destroy an entire First Order carrier? There are many more, but the last one i noticed is a completely incompetent plot hole, that made me feel like an infant wrote this movie. If Snoke is so strong with the Force that he can literally connect two minds together just by the power of thought, HOW DID HE NOT NOTICE A MOTHER**** RUSTY-ASS LIGHTSABER MOVING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM????!!!! I hate this movie, **** you Rian Johnson, you **** **** for ruining one of my favorite franchises of all time.",0
1221,"The movie ruins every intriguing plot line from the previous movie and obliterates the heart and soul of the original trilogy. We aren't even treated to amazing looking saber duels as for some reason the fight choreography looks awful in the 2 main scenes.

1222,"I feel I need to take antidepressants after watching The cinematic catastrophe that is rian johnsons ""last jedi"". It is an insult to everything the originals were, everything that made those movies great. Instead what we get is a vanity piece from an egotistical director with oppositional defiance disorder. I had a bad feeling as soon as poe Made a joke about huxes mother that this was not going to go the way any true star wars, or quality movie lover for that matter, desired.    When i walked out of the theater i felt like my childhood was raped, far worse than any of the prequel movies, because it lacked any kind of reverence for what came before it, the legacy of star wars. In fact rian johnsons actions seem malicious and i find myself wishing the worst kinds of things to happen to this talentless  buffoon. His script seemed malicious. We waited this long, only for him to completely destroy one of the greatest charcters in cinematic history , Luke Skywalker, with a nonchalance and hubris that i find deeply insulting. And say what you want about jj abbrahms but at least he was a lover of star wars and respected the foundations george lucas had built. When luke just tosses his fathers lightsaber over his shoulder, this director is trolling an audience just for the sake of shock value. All this movie attempts is shock, with one middle finger after another to the franchises fanbase. But it isnt just the constant disrespect that makes this movie one of the worst of all times , in any genre. Its just piss poor directing and writing, plain and simple. The editing is a mess, and the plot is asinine. Rian introduces things into the star wars universe that make no sense, those giant slow moving bombers, lightspeeding kamikaz cruisers? rebel fleet is running out of gas, who the f is hodo and why do we care? Why do we care about any of these new characters, there was absolutely no develpment. But we did care about learning more about snoke. No sorry the director needs to be edgy and shock you, plus he needs to give a finger to abbrhams. Thats more important than making a good movie.  Rey no longer needs any training to become a jedi, lets just wave a stick around a rock.   Thats all the training she needs, because the idiotic disney casino scene is far more important. Lets bring in those heavy handed social political statements into an escapist film. Better yet, lets just do it in probably the most highly anticipated film of all time.disney has now bought up and ruined every major franchise that i once loved from my childhood. Shame on you all.I felt like crying when i left the theater and im a young adult male, tears of frustration and anger for what rian johnson has done. He should be homeless and in the gutter for this i put a curse upon his whole life and i hope something really bad happens to him for thisThe way he handled luke was a travesty, i feel so sorry for poor mark hamil, who was contractually obligated by disney to complete the movie and keep his mouth shut as the millions of hardcore fans walking into a nightmare unsuspectingly.  Luke skywalker, who threw down his saber in front of the emperor willing to accept death instead of kill his own father makes a decision to strike down unarmed sleeping ben on the hunch that he might turn to the darkside? luke was never a grumpy silly coward, sipping alien milk from the teet? and yet that is exactly how rian chooses to portray him in his woeful ignorance. Add in some cheesy matrix style lightsaber dodges, two in a row, and thats all we see of lightsaber weilding luke, a moment all of us were imagining in our minds for over ten years. And disney thinks its fine, to let rian do this, who the hell is this rian hack anyways, he did three episodes of breaking bad??? What a poor choice, to give the film to this talentless usc graduate. I am so deeply dissapointed in what disney has done here i want them to hurt but i know there are many idiots who will still buy the merchandise play the games and love the shallow trashy dvds. One thing i know for sure is the star wars legacy is dead. Rian has seen to thAt by burning any possible way of recovery, unless you just start over with a brand new episode  8. And leia is dead, and rian had the chance to give her the perfect send off let her float away dead in space, but instead she comes back to life in some bizarre mary poppins act and apparently she is powerful enough in the force to float herself back to the cruiser from space.  Its all too much, and some of you might think im overracting but this movie hurt me so badly i had to make a metacritic account just to try and hurt back this director who i hate so much. Its all so sad, tragic, the only ones who won are corporate disneys goons, the rest of us, the true star wars fans and movie lovers, have lost grievously. The galaxy will never be the same, and i wish i could forget i ever saw this movie but i cant. You have been warned avoid this like the plague",0
1223,"Between the antics of both EA and Disney I am now done with Star Wars. Terrible movie which ruined one of the best movie heros of all time. Shocking the fight did not happen at the end. Surely everyone was gutted with that. Finn and Rey are poor, especially Finn. At least the prequels had epic lighsabre duels. All lightsabre battles in 7 and 8 are terrible.",0
1224,"This should have been called the ""coward Luke"" episode. He is now a coward for not trying to help Kylo stay in the light (instead contemplating killing him), then he cowards out of killing him, cowards out of chasing him down and getting some of his students back, then cowards out to a planet to hide, tries his best NOT to teach Rey the force to deal with a problem he helped create, then when he does face Kylo, it is in the form of a hologram, in which, he dies anyways?Why are Jedi so prone to ""suicide by sith""??Johnson absolutely RUINED his character. Now everytime I watch the classics, I will always be reminded of how pathetic he turned out. I was aggravated with how TFA raised so many questions, but then this movie completely ignores all of the mystery the previous movie created and gives trash answers to some of these questions (Rey's parents were drunk scrappers?? come on, that could have been revealed in TFA).If the Rear Admiral was going to stay with the ship until it was destroyed, why not hyper-drive it into snoke's ship right away? why not use all of the other ships running out of fuel, like this instead? This movie was just busywork for the audience,and Johnson managed to ruin the legacy of the original characters in the process. A slow motion chase scene is really the plot???? The rebellion will be reborn with a handful of people left on the Millinium F at the end?BTW, as much as we now know about space and how liquids in the body become vapor when exposed to space, Leia somehow wakes up and floats herself to recovery? GTFOHHEY DISNEY, KEEP THE SAME DIRECTOR THRU ALL 3 episodes! This is comparable to building a house using 3 different builders, and nobody is accountable for how disjoined the outcome is.",0

Even the prequels didn't wreck the Star Wars universe as much as this did, and at least they weren't just a totally cynical excuse to stuff money down Mickey Mouse's pants. Crabby old hobo Luke throwing his beloved father's lightsaber away like a piece of trash? Superman Leia flying through the vacuum of space? It was cringey and totally disrespectful of the original trilogy. Would give it a negative vote if I could.",0
1227,"Ugh. Way too much flippant humor. Way too self-aware. It's mildly amusing in the moment, but these movies are going to be dated as heck and totally unwatchable within a couple years (unlike the originals, which are timeless). Basically Disney has turned Star Wars into Marvel, where the real point is watching the characters banter with each other and tease us with will-he/won't-he soap opera shenanigans. If this had been a new series I'd be more forgiving, but since they are trying to pass this tripe off as STAR WARS I have no choice but to call it out for being the cheap, phony, cynical cash-in it clearly is.Also: people were laughing their butts off when Carrie Poppins when zooming through space without a space suit!",0
1228,"The reason Star Wars because the gigantic franchise that it was today was because it mastered the art of creating a completely new world for people to get lost in. The Star Wars we grew up with had so many systems, civilisations, ways of life and rich characters to love. The Last Jedi does not do any of this.Instead, what Disney is doing with the series is replacing the world-building with endless montages of cheap climaxes. Mind you that they are fun to watch at first, but they leave you empty and bitter afterwards because they were just cheap thrills that actually destroy the world Star Wars is built upon. The Last Jedi resembles more of a cheesy soap opera than the science fiction epic that was the pre-Disney Star Wars. That is why fans absolutely hate this movie and what Disney is doing with the Star Wars franchise.",0

I now see what Mark Hamill meant when he said that he disagrees with this vision of Luke Skywalker. His legacy is officially destroyed. Now let's add to this sooooo many plot holes and this out of place humor and you got yourself a recipe for something that i am sure fans will forever remember as THE WORST EPISODE OF STAR WARS SAGA EVER. 0/10",0

TLJ manage to waste the Force Awakens and original trilogy legacy alike, leaving you emotionless and disappointed. Is not only a bad STAR WARS movie, it’s an awfully bad movie. Kind of fishy how all the critics are praising this: Disney tentacles are long indeed!The good? Well, visually stunning at times. The acting in general is far superior to TFA. Actors do a good job with the poor material they’ve been given to work with.Other than that, just boring.",0
1238,"Possibly the worst Star Wars movie ever made. From the beginning to the end is a big letdown. Almost no answers to any of the questions raised in TFA. No connection with any of the characters. The attempt at humor was terrible. This is NOT a Star Wars movie folks. For the first time in my life I'm not excited about what comes next. If you love the original trilogy, do not watch this movie, it will ruin it for you.",0
1239,"To the lucky ones who haven't seen this movie yet - don't! Just watch Rogue One again. On the bright side, it's a politically correct experience, not-too-heavy on the dialogue, with teenage romance throughout - a multicultural love triangle even. I imagine the recipe for such ""brilliance"" was to pack a room with progressive liberals and focus-group them until death do us part. This resulted in a final product empowering all the right groups (think Hillary and Angela Merkel as rebel commanders) and dishing out justice to dumb-ass, testosterone-filled dirt bags (Luke Skywalker included). Me? I should've watched Thor Ragnarok for the fifth time instead.",0
1240,"Rey meets with Luke. Nothing of significance happens.Leia is actually superman.Finn and the asian woman destroy a casino and kill everyone in it, because all rich people are bad m'kayHux follows Leia's ship for two hours firing a shot every couple seconds only to have it deflected.Snoke is nothing of importance (he dies btw, gets killed by Kylo)Yoda burns the jedi tree (filled with ancient jedi knowledge) because those books were ""no page turners"" and Rey doesn't need it anyway (she's THAT great, you go girl!)Luke pulls the biggest Jedi Mind Prank ever (he dies too).A kid uses the force to sweep the floor.roll credits",0
1241,"Last Jedi IMO sits (barely) above Phantom as the worst Star Wars. Apparently this director is who is going to be ongoing. Argh.  Too much comedy, too much cgi, stupid subplot, FLOATING IN SPACE LEIA!!!! A ludicrous  middle story for the CODE BREAKER, Snoke is just a plot device with no back story, dumb bird things, shirtless EMO conflicted villians, modern superhero karate style saber fight scenes, a lame Luke death.I suspect the scene with Leia will be the 'nuke the fridge' 'jump the shark' moment on the internet once the hype dies",0
1242,"The scenario for this movie is a pure trainwreck, filled with so many plotholes. All the main characters are doing stupid things one after another. There is no tension and adversity, since most of the problems the characters face is because they were too stupid to think 5minutes before acting. Like Finn and Rey parking their ship right in front of the big casino. What were they expecting, that no one would see it ? Rey going inside a dark side nexus to ask it who were her parents ? What kind of moron would ask that kind of question in that place ???As for the plotholes, what about the Maz communication ? If they can send a long-range communication to Maz, why can't they send one to ask for reinforcements ? Why do they have to wait until they're on the rebel base ? How can Maz know what the cracker will wear that day ? No answers, those plots are just a**pulls.",0
1243,"A giant, dull, unenthusiastic meh. Disney PR is pushing this new, risky, divisive meme like they tried something fresh. They did not. The master was reluctant to train again. The pupil ran off early again. The good guys flee again. The At At assault on the white planet happens at the end of the movie instead of the beginning to really shake things up.We are in the some spot as the end of the last movie. Rey is the all powerful good guy who we already know can easily beat the bad guy Kylo. They have no answer for Snoke or why the empire off shoot has overthrown the new republic. When people talk about trying different things, being weird, and the outlier for Star Wars films, they are talking about story teases and set ups they didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on. Nothing new, weird, or fundamentally different lasts more than 10 minutes, and the film always quickly returns to safety. It is derrivative of Empire and Battlestar Galactica with no new novel ideas for it's time and had none of the plot turns those stories had.",0
1244,"A sequel to the 2 hour-long teaser TFA, TLJ was an outcome of the producers who only have cliche smashing in their mind. A lot of plot progressions and subplots were just there for the sake of advancing the plot. Many characters and scenes were wasted to advance this plot. Yet the plot somewhat ends up being hypocritical and not creative, rather than being entertaining. On one side, we have characters who are portrayed as bumbling, war-crazed idiots. On the other side, there are characters who oppose the 'traditional resistance movement' because it perpetuate hate, etc. Yet these same characters perform hyperspace kamikaze on the enemies, perpetuating hate. What is the message? First Order's atrocities were well-portrayed on the first movie and there was a reason, albeit being stale and unoriginal, for resistance. Now, there is some random side-character who preaches this 'both sides are dumb puppets to the weapons industry, get out of war,' 80's hippie philosophy. Yet at the end, our characters again promises to fight for tomorrow to undo the First Order. Again, what is the message? A lot of twists and cliche breaking were done for the sake of just having such. If the producers wanted to create something new and revolutionary, that is not a Star Wars, they should have done so by not abusing the franchise name and nostalgia value of the IP. When you were raking gold with this IP and promptly attempt to create this edgy, 'modern' twists on the IP through a lot of plot-holes and conflicting messages, don't expect the audience to take it so kindly. At the end of the movie, when almost all the old casts are wiped away, we have these bland characters with near to none character development over two new movies. We have a main antagonist who is still this man-child who has anger-management issue and teenage emo angst. I am not sure what should I be expecting for the last movie. What is the message and what am I supposed to expect out of all this?",0
1245,"You are tearing me apart, Disney!I'm surprised Disney spent 165 million dollars to film this puerile script. Oh, wait, I forgot they only care about making money with uninspired, soulless, and derivative cash-grabs. Now, with this film, the Marvelization of Star Wars is readily apparent.",0
1246,"This is more a Disney movie than a Star Wars movie.While had some good action moments, it feels so empty when the plot doesn't make any sense.All the new cute creatures you've seen on the trailers are absolutly meaningless to the plot and are only there to sell more toys.",0
1247,"Garbage, utter garbage. Well done Disney and Rian johnson for effing up - this is by far and away the worst film i've seen in years - not just a star wars film but any film. It threw out all of the previous films. Take your cash cow disney, i'm done.",0
1248,"Created MC account just so I could vote ""HORRIBLE"" movieLuke is portrayed as a coward through the whole movie and is reluctant and never actually showed up to fight Kylo and this is weak writing. How can that become a cause by fighting via virtual reality..lol? It's better if Luke actually showed up, kicked some First Order butt and then became a sacrifice, ergo uniting everyone and doing the right thing. Man, that would have been such a powerful scene and all could be forgiven (maybe).Comedy scenes included are absurd (comedy is good to have but not this way) and take away the sense of urgency and importance of the fight too much, characters are shallow and cliche, enough plot holes to fill every hole on a golf course, and severe deus ex machina (the Force mostly) used for convenience and lazy/bad writing.Men in this movie are portrayed as idiots or macho. Women are not well represented or respected either and does them a disservice. The people who funded (Disney), wrote and directed this movie must have no morality or clue, therefore the movie had none.  I was giving it a 6/10 (probably from shock) but more I dwell on these things, it's more like a 1/10. Bad movie but terrible Star Wars.﻿",0
1249,The worst Star wars movie... I cant believe it.... it is really bad... the history it doesn't make any sense and I was waiting for luck shows his skills but that never happened,0
1250,"What the hell was that? Disney bought reviews? This was a disaster. Not only because it ruins star wars legacy... but because it is just so bad movie. Boring, emotionless, shallow characters, lack of star wars vibe, goofy and... no lightsabers duel for God sake.",0
1251,"This is, without a doubt, the worst movie in the Star Wars series (and one of the worst movies I have seen in a while, period). So how much did Disney pay these critics for these rankings? The writing was absolutely atrocious. It reminded me more of a mix of Star Trek and Hunger Games, more than Star Wars. I am now so happy to hear JJ Abrams will be returning for the last movie, but appalled that Rian Johnson is getting his own trilogy. Wait for this move to come out on Netflix. Even then, I wouldn't ever recommend it if it wasn't a Star Wars movie and necessary to watch to understand what happens in the final movie (which hopefully, but i've lost nearly all hope, redeems this trilogy).",0
1252,"This is not going to go the way you think, Mr.Johnson This is the only Star Wars movie that left me leaving the theater emotionless,the story reminded me of the fanfiction I used to read by other young teenagers",0
1253,"This slopplily written, poorly paced film doubles down on the directions of the force awakens, fully reverts the galaxy back to the state of the Original Trilogy, negates the legacy of Episode 1-6; and what's worse, completely ruins Luke Skywalker as a character. Two films deep into the trilogy, the film is yet to establish a single new character that has any similar impact as that in the last two sagas. Those characters that were promised to play big roles in the last instalment were discarded in the most unsatisfying manner. It still relies on the OT characters for emotional impact, while at the same time stomps all over what happened in the OT. With some spectacular set pieces and amazing cinematography in places, those who were not that invested in Star Wars previously may find it an enjoyable ride. But a portion of Star Wars fans would find themselves in the same position as Mark Hamill when he first read the script: 'fundamentally disagreeing'.",0
1254,"Just like TFA, Disney has kid-ified this franchise. Everything's a big joke now, even to the characters in the movie. They toss little quips around even in dangerous scenes, and it's all very postmodern and self-aware. Needless to say, that is 100% the opposite of what Star Wars always was and is supposed to be. The OT had plenty of funny moments, but it was also earnest and authentic. These movies are not going to stand the test of time like those ones did.",0
1255,This films suceeds in one thing.Making Disney change the old guard into the new. Sadly it doesn't do it in a smart way. It uses jokes instead of sarcasm. It trades the push for a real world feel for pushing ridculous sight gags and plot lines that go nowhere and characters that have no pay off. This is no longer Star Wars but instead a nostalgia machine....but I hope it can be learned from and improved upon to get back on track.Rouge One is a good example of pushing in a positive direction.,0
1256,"Whomever green lighted this incoherence disaster, should be fired. Twice. The bloody prequel trilogy has more Star Wars magic than this mess. But hey, gotta sell those cute animals right. Star Wars has become a parody on itself.",0
1257,"Rian Johnson directed the worst Star Wars movie, for me.I saw it again tonight. When the movie was over still I felt terrible in the theater.- First of all, the opening. Poe Dameron vs The First Order ships was completely bad writing. As Poe Dameron destroyed the weapons one by one, we saw General Hux watching the events from the his window. And only three Tie-Fighter chases him. Maybe the others watched like a movie.- The First Order and Resistance's hole chase is completely bad writing, again. We've seen the Star Destroyers moves fast like other ships before. There are dozens of Star Destroyers on the same screen in TLJ and none of them catch the ship.- While chasing, they said the resistance ship had 13 hours of fuel left. And... At the same time Rey staying two days in the island. So, where is that writers mind?- The whole Casino scene is destroyes the movie, no doubt. The big pile of the writers. The scene on horseback also horrible, this film is not some Narnia. It's Star Wars.- Rose... This girl was the worst character of Star Wars, for me. Even the Jar Jar Binks was not so empty and unnecessary, for me.- Finn is my second favorite in the Force Awakens. For the first time they gave Stormtrooper a meaning. In this film... Every scene Finn with Rose has is bad.- Leia flying in space... Is the worst scene of Star Wars history. There is not even a word to say.- Snoke. I have no problem with Snoke's death. Cause, he was cheap copy of the Emperor. They didn't even write a backstory. But, they ruined that Red Room fight. The set and cinematography of this scene was awesome. But again, that writing are bad.- Rey's Jedi Fight training is only 1. She knows only a few fighting moves. She used the Lightsaber only twice. First of all against Kylo in the Force Awakens. Then against Luke in The Last Jedi. And after all, she can easily beat The Elite Praetorian Guard's of the Snoke. That was one of the most worst and absurd Star Wars fights.- Daisy Ridley is absolutely fit for Rey role, no doubt. I don't care about Rey's family, does not have to be special or a chosen thing. But I do not accept such a cheap characterization. This character does not have to know everything about Force so easily. This was one of JJ.Abrams's mistakes and I thought it would be fixed in the second movie. And... They more ruined.- And the biggest thing that mads me, what throws the film in the big hole. They absolutely ruined Luke Skywalker. I will never accept that. He didn't even have his own solo lightsaber fight scene. They've ruined his role with force projection thing. They wrote a absolutely bad scenario that never fits his characterization. Even Mark Hamill suffered while reading. And the scene where he died. Saddest thing ever for a legendary character.All this and more is making this movie a worst Star Wars.",0
1259,The biggest disappointment I've ever felt in my life at the end of a movie. I can't get over it. The best thing to do now is to pretend that this film never existed.,0
1260,"Im so sad after tonight. I loved star wars for years, now to see our beloved characters and lore, the whole narrative done to pieces, for no purpose at all.",0
1261,"NOT Star Wars.  Worst movie of the anthology. Bad character usage/development, cringe-worthy dialogue, forced humor, hilarious premises, bad story, and un-necessary product placement for toy sales.My list of worst now starts with this film, followed by AOTC, and then Menace.",0
1262,"By comparison the Prequel trilogy was pretty good. I'm sorry George Lucas!You don't need to be a top movie critic to realise that this just isn't a very good film, nor is it very memorable either.",0
1263,"Worst movie of all. Read other reviews I've just here to put 0. Don't read those bought 1010 reviews. Seriously, I am honest AF and nobody paid me anything.",0
1264,"I wanted to like it. The film has no pacing at all. A main character is literally missing for 45 minutes. There are literally only three characters to care anything about. Villains who do die go out in the worst possible ways. The tone is uneven and it is not only a bad film, it is a horrible Star Wars film. It's actually the worst. The only bright spots are Luke, Rey, and Ben. Half the film is filler. I wanted to like it but it's atrocious. Rian Johnson doesn't understand what Star Wars is and tried to make a Rian Johnson film, not a Star Wars film. And it's even worse than his previous films. The forced humor and gags ruin emotional moments. Star Wars is visual storytelling with music and as little dialogue as possible. Johnson doesn't understand this. No silent montage with music at the end. Ending shot was the worst way possible to end the film.",0
1265,"There might be a good ninety minute movie somewhere in this over bloated film but definitely not a great one. Too many characters. No clear protagonist. A real lack of narrative drive. Still zero explanation as to how this whole world became what it is.My biggest revelation walking out of the theater was: ""Wow. They don't actually have a story to tell."" There are some great MOMENTS sprinkled throughout but there's an entire subplot that nearly sinks the film and the story just doesn't work as a cohesive whole. Way too many recycled ideas from the original trilogy and not enough understanding of the characters from those films.What they've done to the original Heroes of the Rebellion is just plain sad and, frankly, unbelievable to anyone intimate with the characters and story arcs from the original trilogy.The Empire Strikes Back is defined by Luke's refusal to give up on or abandon his friends. Return of the Jedi is defined by Luke's refusal to give up on his father. Put simply, the Luke in the Last Jedi is not the same character. And I don't mean a changed Luke. He's a different person.Put simply, I fundamentally disagree with the interpretation of these characters and the story course these new movies have set. How I miss the days when most Star Wars movies ended with a flourish triumphant and a definitive victory for the forces of light.",0
1266,I came out of the force awakens feeling numb and empty. No admiration or respect was given to the original characters in that movie and I was pretty much done with it at that point. I haven’t seen episode 8 but I know the main plot points and as far as I’m concerned Star Wars ended with episode 6.I loved rogue one (saw it 7 times) and yes it had its flaws but it wasn’t detrimental to the originals. I didn’t want to see a copy and paste of the originals and I would have welcomed a bold new story as long as the original characters were portrayed in the way they deserved to be. So disappointed.,0
1267,"Here's what I think of SW8 without spoiling any of the movie for those who want to see it anyway.Why does this movie exist?  What's that you say?  To further develop and play out characters and situations that started in the previous episode while carefully handling beloved characters that have been used throughout the entire series?  Don't expect to see too much of that.I don't think this director has ever watched all the Star Wars movies. This movie has little and desperately needs soul, heart, and drama. If you can get past the slapstick humor(why is that in here?), characters behaving completely un-characteristically, and plot devices that have no business being in this movie, there are some absolutely beautiful cinematic imagery on display here.  Most of the moments that should have been very dramatic, sentimental, and emotional were completely mishandled and shallow.  All the care that Abrams(SW7) and Edwards(R1) put into continuing this story arc is completely wasted here on comedic devices.Where does the series go from this one?  I can't even imagine.  Still not the worst part of this series.  Episode 2 takes that crown for me.",0
1268,"Intolerable, inept and above all boring, the Last Jedi is bad fan-fiction at-best. Written and Directed by Rian Johnson by a clueless writer/director who has a tendency to f*ck up his own films namely 2012's Looper, one would be entirely forgiven for having reservations about the film before seeing it. With great trailers made by a marketing team who clearly isn't paid enough, The Last Jedi promoted itself as being the next Empire Strikes Back. Yet we managed to get something more sloppy than Attack of the Clones, with uneven pacing, incomplete arcs, and an all-round lack of appreciation for continuity or the force itself. While the Froce awakens wasn't a great film it is not doubt to me a serviceable entry, sure most of the plot had been duplicated from A New Hope, but it built foundations which would serve as the bed-rock for episode 8 & 9 to carry on from. Those foundations are now gone. Now one can only wonder how JJ Abrahams will salvage the saga to create a fitting conclusion for a trilogy that still is still yet to prove or find what it wants to be.",0
1269,"This movie should of been called"" asian girl who no one cares about runs around with a black dude + all bad guys are white and good guys are ""diverse"" and woman."" - the end",0
1270,Movies that destroys the entire OT good job Disney hope your happy (sigh)just go give your money to disney so they can make some more of this poop feed the disney machine now or else,0
1271,The Last Jedi executes one of the most ruthless character assassinations in the history of cinema. It ignores all character development from the original trilogy. Luke Skywalker deserved better.,0
1272,"Id say there are spoilers, but there isnt anything to spoil...You could skip this Steampunk-Anime-Star Wars movie and miss nothing. Star Wars seems to be creeping into comicbook super hero franchise territory. I don't see all of those anymore, and if I do get tricked into one and dont like it, well then I don't go to see that film multiple times. Because thats what i enjoy, a film that makes me feel good, interested,or anything, something. I wont be seeing Last Jedi again. My least favorite Star Wars movie. The comedy worked, but was just the same joke the entire film done over-and-over. Nothing resonated very well for me, just a total disconnect. All that firepower and tech and I feel like no characters, plot, or anything at all moved forward, nor looked back well enough, no added mythos, no questions answered. A meme gif reel of a film. Saw on IMAX RPX, but the cinematography was disappointing, even if it was purposefully vintage. Adam driver was apt with a poor script. Finn is screaming to be better written, Boyega could give so much more. Leia could be added to a blog about another potential hidden sith lord in the star wars cinematic universe. So many evil Jar Jars in Last Jedi if you look at these characters decision making. I felt that the ending was like watching a tv show that I decide half way was a poor choice and I just shut if off, click, over, so what. The movie should have ended directly after Lukes reaction to being handed the lightsaber from Rey. Luke, atleast, knew wtf was going on here. Yoga-Luke phoning in his wisdom. I had high demands, but still, least favorite, which is a long list at this point, that will never stop growing. The origin of blue-milk is not the fan service I was looking for. Animals are cuddly and our friends, thanks Walt Disney. We know.",0
1273,Disgraceful. Pointless. Terrible story. Terrible editing. Terrible Marvel style humour constantly throughout. If it wasn't Star Wars I would have walked out. Can't believe this guy has been given his own trilogy,0
1274,"How to ruin a proper saga with just one movie. I'll try to stay spoiler free but the way they've managed to destroy the Star Wars lore is impressive. Not only legendary characters from the past were treated like garbage, but also the new ones. Star Wars is dead to me after watching this.",0
1275,"Awful and pointless. When confronted with a character or a 'plot twist,' take a moment to ask yourself ""why?"" let alone ""why do I care?"" You will come up wanting, as did the film. The disconnect between critical and user reactions is damning and worrisome. Disney can buy our cultural elites, but (until I receive a large check) it has not bought me.",0
1276,"Was für eine herbe Enttäuschung.  Sind die noch ganz dicht?!Sinnloser Tod für Snoke, Yoda & Luke,schrecklich unsympatische neue Figuren (Rose und die Frau mit den lila Haaren), alles was hätte sein können ist jetzt fürn Ar%$#.Nix macht Sinn, ständig dumme Witze die net lustig sind und niedliche Kindersch&#sse, WAS - FÜR - EIN - DRECK.Walt Disney hat Star Wars gekillt.Nur die größten Hauptschulversager im Kino haben bei diesem Film gelacht und Applaudiert.

1278,"I would have rather been in a sewer smelling **** for 3 hours if I knew I was going to watch something that was more **** They were given the ingredients to succeed in this film such as the original cast, Awesome lightsaber battles on youtube as a guide and fan/George Lucas’s opinions but instead you chose to throw it all out like garbage which is probably how Disney feels about the franchise because to them it’s an easy check from die hard fans but I think most people probably sending letters like me to those money hungry murders are done with the franchise.",0
1279,"Do not see this movie, do not give them your money, it is absolutely dreadful. The movie was like bad star wars fan fiction written by a 14 year old with no understanding of story structure, consistency in tone, or the governing rules of the universe in which the story is set. I was dumbstruck.",0
1280,"Non-""Star Wars Universe"" feel throughout (there's actually a scene in this movie with people walking around in futuristic TUXEDOS for crying out loud). Rian Johnson has made a cheesy stock Avengers formula movie with no respect for the lore and history of Star Wars. It's one thing to make a bad Star Wars movie. It's another altogether to ruin the universe itself. An abomination.",0
1281,"I don't hide the fact that I hate Disney and what they've done to Star Wars. With Episode 7 and Rogue One they sucked all the life and heart out of the franchise and drained any excitement I had for future installments. But despite that, I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. And that was the saddest part of it all. Underneath all the filth, there is a great movie in the Last Jedi, but everything leading up to the movie killed any chance for this movie.The film is visually stunning, with beautiful environments and brilliant set-pieces. It looked and sounded like Star Wars, but it didn't feel like Star Wars.For me, the only two new characters worth caring about in this trilogy are Rey and Kylo Ren, and fortunately, their relationship is the strongest part of the story. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley have chemistry together that no one in the cast can come close to. Scenes with them are indeed heartfelt and sincere and I genuinely want them to be together, whether they are family or soulfates. And the fight with the Royal Guard gave me goosebumps, bringing back memories of Jacen and Jaina Solo battling members of the Sith Order in the Jedi Academy series.And one final positive goes to the final scene with Luke. While Luke's death was something that angered me to no end, his sendoff was near-perfect. From the binary Sunset to the music, it was respectful farewell to such an icon, which is more than I can say for Han Solo's death in Episode 7.However, that's where the positives end. The plot is flat out bad. It's just the Empire Strikes Back in reverse where the Rebels flee to the base rather than from the base, with bits of Return of the Jedi for good measure.While Kylo Ren and Rey are compelling when they're together, when they're apart, they don't have much to offer. Without Kylo Ren, Rey is just a bland Mary Sue, while without Rey, Kylo Ren is just a winy little **** that makes Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin seem Oscar worthy. And the rest of the cast are beyond boring. Finn and Rose's story is completely unnecessary and is just there to fill Disney's political quota of animal abuse (something that is completely out of place in a Star Wars movie). While all the political drama in the copycats for both the Empire and Rebellion carry so little weight, they might as well flout. But the biggest offense of the Last Jedi, is how meaningless everything feels by the end. The biggest example being Snoke, who is killed by Kylo Ren with no fanfare or mind-blowing reveal, making all of the theorizing about Snoke completely pointless. In addition, we still don't know who Rey's parents are, and considering how much of a big deal they are making of it, she now has to be a Skywalker or a Solo. Otherwise, Disney will straight up be admitting that they don't care about the story, only the money.  In 2015, Episode 7 released, and I gave into the hype, because I just love Star Wars so much. But after watching it again, the movie got worse and worse. Star Wars has almost become an addiction for me. I keep anticipating what the future holds for the franchise only to be disappointed. Episode 7 is a bad movie. Episode 8 on the other hand, is disappointing. I want Star Wars to be great, but JJ Abrams booked Rian Johnson into a corner, which has caused irreversible damage to this new trilogy. And with countless upcoming spinoff movies coming up, the fatigue is starting to really get to me.The worst part, this all could have been avoided. If the Expanded Universe had remained as the sole canon, and Kathleen Kennedy was able to keep her ego in check by allowing George Lucas to be a part of the creative process, this whole next chapter of Star Wars could have turned out so much better. But we'll never know for sure. My suggestion. Keep your expectation low, or just don't see this movie in theater. If you really want to see this, wait until it's at your local redbox. Much like EA, Disney only speaks with what's in your wallet. If you want Star Wars to return to its former glory, speak their language. I will always love the original trilogy along with the prequels and all the EU that filled all the gaps before, between, and after. But I just can't accept what Disney is doing with the saga as MY canon. I'm not being a sexist, a racist, or just a Disney hater. I just want a good Star Wars movie, and this is not one.We're not the manbabies Disney. You are. You say failure is the greatest teacher, then explain to me why you can't accept your own failure.",0
1282,"This movie is so bad that it will ruin the original trilogy for you.  I'll have to pretend that this doesn't exist now to be able to enjoy those.  Not only does it drop every major plot point that TFA teased us with, it turns one of the most optimistic characters in cinema history into a ginormous weenie.  I hated it.  Don't take your kids.  They'll cry.",0
1283,"After the last Disney Wars fiasco, the Force Awakens, I had no interest in seeing how they would further humiliate the last great epic of my childhood. But there were some thin plot threads that might have saved the series so I kept an open mind. No such luck!! This abomination is a deliberate insult to George Lucas and his millions of fans who came to identify with the larger than self issues and heroic sacrifices of his characters. It is a sign of the times, this movie is bad because our modern culture is bad. Shaming and destroying beloved characters, hollowing out the whole concept of the force and inappropriate humor all are designed to mask the thousand pound gorilla in the room- THERE IS NO STORY!!!! Shock and dismay is somehow supposed to replace plot and substance, and of course the kids will eat it up. Many of them have a fetish to cut down the previous generation and appropriate what was ours. The one overriding message of Disney Wars: The Snuff Film is that story doesn't matter, only theme park rides, toys and SJW agitprop. I blame the Lucas and Prequel haters. They couldn't handle an in depth story and wet their pj's over it. Now there is nothing left but a joke of a franchise lampooning itself while grinning like they won a Nobel prize. At least we get to see Kylo Ren on a bag of salad and a can of soup.......",0

Why buy a franchise only to insult and mock it? Star Wars is dead, killed by its own makers. No doubt that Disney payola accounts for the positive reviews. A giant middle finger to all of us. I won't give you another dime.",0
1288,"You know what? Its just terrible. Its a terrible film for so many reasons that I shouldn't have to explain. That being said, TLJ could easily be used as a litmus test for an individuals emotional and intellectual maturity. I think what is most shocking to me is that this film should have been a bit of a lay up for Writer/Director Rian Johnson. TFA was not an incredible film by any stretch of the imagination but it did succeed in setting up loose ends. Loose ends that needed tying up in this film. The movie had no balls. Instead of giving us definitive answers, it often told us that the questions were stupid. I'm just upset that we have to accept that THIS is how Luke Skywalker goes out.",0

1291,"Cool moments, but the narrative was terrible. Everything with Finn was filler. Unanswered questions from VII were answered but not in a good way. They were essentially written off as irrelevant. Luke milking some random creature then doing a half-assed pole vault to catch a fish? What? The acting was abysmal. The humor was out of place and just insulting to the spirit of Star Wars. A Jay-Z dirty shoulder brush? Really? REALLY? Star Wars practically raised me. It's in my blood. This was just a slap in the face. I'm all for opening Star Wars up and pushing the limits of what we've seen before, but turning it into a Marvel MCU slapstick-fest is not the way to go. It completely sucked any will I had to see how things wrap up. It just doesn't matter.",0
1292,"George Lucas Star Wars created a world in a galaxy far away and you could imagine Luke and everyone still being alive somewhere after their adventure had been told.

Vader, Luke, Han, Leia, R2D2, Lando...these characters haunt the hallways of Disney.The only way forward is to literally cut away the umbilical cord of the original trilogy and forge ahead with something new, while balancing what made this franchise so precious to so many.----SPOILER----The Movie's entire third act is about running out of Gas....and that one scene where Luke is drinking green milk. I don't know if Rian Johnson was trying to making an in-joke. If he was, he should have left it to more talented directors like Taika Waititi.",0

The Last Jedi is really much worse than any of the prequels; at least the prequels didn't break the 4th barrier (many scenes in The LAst Jedi where the actors break character and truly poke fun at the material)!! Further, The Last Jedi is utterly disrespectful of previous characterization and even uses very important themes as springboards for cheap slapstick comedy. It is simply not a good film. It is so shallow, how can the writers actually think that we are going to buy it's poorly conceived and related nihilistic philosophy? I mean honestly Kung Fu Panda has much much more internal cohesion and real philosophy/mysticism than The Last Jedi. Sad.

The crystal foxes were about the only new thing in this last film. Walt Disney are being very lazy and really just milking the brand.I.e. ‘we are losing all our ships’. What. Useless bit of narrative that is. I can see you are losing all the ships. This telling what was going on happened over, and over, and over again. Film is a visual medium ‘SHOW DONT TELL.

1308,"This movie is pure garbage. The only way they wont keep making this garbage is if people don't spend their money on it. Spoilers below.Three separate times woman slap men in this movie. Every single woman in this movie is in a position of power over the men, even Rey who is brand new to the Force basically shows Luke he is worthless.This is complete and utter feminist agenda being shoved down our throats star wars style. Male leads-Luke commits Suicide. Poe is a hothead who is slapped twice by woman told he only thinks with his dick and has horrible dialogue and told everything he has done in the movie is wrong.....but hey don't worry the two old woman are such believable generals he smiles and walks it off. Finn is a coward who needs a tiny chunky chick to show him what courage is? Really? Kylo is a emotional wreck. Good bad, spaz......just not a great character.All the basic foot soldier men are just shot and killed and worthless.Female Characters. Rey most powerful Jedi we have yet to see and she has had.....zero training! Ruins the whole idea of the whole damn universe. Leia...Superman much. Rose, really this is a war movie. Soldier do not look like that, or are that out of shape some training Rose please.....and then really she is preaching to Finn and out doing him in everything the whole movie....Admiral Hudo are you kidding me its war and you show up in a skin tight gown.....This movie breaks Cannon, it has more plot holes then you can count, it forgets its audience in a bold attempt to make it seem like men are idiots and woman the real power. I was in the theater with 95% males all of who came out of the movie feeling like what was this **** I just watched. The one redeeming quality of the movie is its pretty and shot well. Other then that it is clearly trying to take a super liberal agenda and force it down our throats. I have three daughters, none of whom want to see these movies. And my one daughter asked why the woman in the movie didnt look like they could fight if they where supposed to be in a war?The scroll should have read like this....Chapter 8: the feminist Jedi In a galaxy far far away men no longer have any intelligence, character, or back bone...the coward Luke has run from all of his responsibilities and tried to kill his apprentices in their sleep. Meanwhile the last of the Republiucs fleets powered by old woman in stunning gowns and make up despite going to battle lead the last of their forces to annihilation.But Dont worry, our Betty Sue....oh I mean Rey is the most powerful Jedi of all time and didn't even need training......",0

1310,"This movie ruined the few good things this new trilogy had going for it. The only bright spots of the film were the acting on the part of Daisy Ridley and Mark Hammill. Everyone else was pretty awful. Overused clichés again, out of place dialogue, and lack of appreciation for the Star Wars universe. Its like they tried to make this a marvel movie. They didn't stay true to what the force means and is in the star wars universe. And they decided to throw the plot into total chaos for the last film. Its hard to give thorough criticisms of this film without spoilers, but the biggest problems were in the writing and the plot. It was not well done at all. I thought the prequel movies were well written but suffered from bad acting, effects, and setting art. This film cant even hang its hat on being well written. Most disappointing movie I've seen in recent memory. I would tell you don't go see it but I know you will because its star wars. Just don't go in with high expectations.",0
1311,"This movie was utter **** and shat on the face of previously established characters and lore. Millions of plot holes and unanswered questions, in fact this movie will retroactively make TFA worse.",0
1312,"This movie was SO BAD! I cant believe it. I have always liked Star Wars movies, even the episodes 1-3 even though I recognize that they are not very good. Episode 7 was a disappointment but at least it had it moments. This, on the other hand, was terrible. Honestly if I wasn't sitting in the middle of the row in the theater I would have left after half way though the movie. The movie is full of totally unbelievable stuff, half of the scenes try to be artistic when rest feel glued on. The story is plain stupid, dialog is terrible and especially humor is so forced it was physically painful to watch. There was no meaningful character development excluding one that was in any way interesting or plausible. The threat of the Imperium/First Oder is totally non existent when they are totally incompetent and depicted as complete morons. I don't care if you have a scifi or fantasy movie but if you have established some rules in that universe you cannot just ignore them in every scene. I also hate that is seems that the heroes can go anywhere they want at any time.I don't want to even start with the actor performance but still I must say that only good performance was from Mark Hamill. For all the rest I was just hopping that the characters would be killed off at some point. I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters in any level. And whats up with all the cute animals everywhere that have nothing to do with anything?-Beyond disappointed Star Wars fan",0
1313,"We saw this in a group of 9 people.As the credit's rolled, we looked at each other, and without any word spoken, our facial expressions all displayed the same thing:Shock, disappointment, disbelieve and anger.I'm still pretty down all day because of this movie.It's like I witnessed a car crash or something.I lie in bed at night and can't stop thinking about how terrible this movie was.I can't accept that they have done this to Star Wars.The must have known that they used to most incapable and incompetent creators to work on this new Star Wars series, and they just didn't care.They didn't care.People will buy tickets, no matter what, so why care about making a dignified sequel? Why write a good story or pay some respect to the characters? Why give Carry Fisher's Leia a good ending?Star Wars is dead to me now.I will not watch episode 9 until it's on Netflix.",0
1314,"I've never written a metacritic review before but I'm just so angry at this movie that I have to. What to say about it? The whole movie is atrocious. The plot literally is this: Rebels (Resistance, whatever) are running away in a small ship from a big ship in the slowest space-chase ever. Then they go to a planet and run away some more. Iconic characters die in anti-climactic ways. No new lore is introduced, old lore - even from TFA - gets effectively nuked. Don't spend your hard earned cash on this.",0
1315,"The worst Star Wars movie imaginable, a truly appalling effort.Makes The Phantom Menace look like Citizen Kane.

1316,"Awkward humor, forced or bad answers to commonly asked questions after Force Awakens. The conflict, pain and suffering never felt real.  So many things wrong with this film and it could have been salvaged a little by simply making Luke do something truly bad ass.  I left feeling empty and unexcited for episode IX, JJ Abrams has a tall task ahead of him to take this steaming pile that Rian Johnson left him.  There needs to be a new villain introduced in Episode IX 100% more bad ass, feared and scarier than what Kylo Ren is.  So bad.  Critics raving about this movie are idiots.",0
1317,Rian Johnson hate Luke Skywalker because what he do to that character it’s a disgusting.Luke tried to kill a kid while he was sleeping. WTF???I understand why Mark Hamill hate everything about his character.Leya flying like superman. such a stupid scene.This movie is horrible. a comedy for kids and a cash cow for Disney.,0
1318,"As an avid fan of Star Wars since 1999, when my father carried me into the cinema to watch Episode I with just 1 year, I can't express how difficult is for me to dislike an Star Wars film. I really went to see it with high expectations for what I saw at the trailers, but the film was nothing like it... As good as the movie looks, they wasted Mark Hamill's time and that should be punished.I've already seen it and can guarantee that I wont be rewatching this one. Doesn't have the same rewatch value as The Force Awakens (TFA).As a movie, this rating should be at about 0.5 - 1 because it completely takes a dump on everything the Original Trilogy (and to some extent the Prequels) set up. While TFA introduced the fact that the ending of Return of the Jedi meant nothing of consequence because the Rebels and the Empire are still around with the same power dynamics (pretty much), this movie further solidifies that nothing that came before it matters. Luke's scene at the end of TFA is essentially the start of a strip-tease and The Last Jedi is a continuation of that strip-tease with absolutely no payoff. His role in the movie starts with him taking Anakin's lightsaber from Rey and casually throwing it behind him like a can of soda or litter... His father's lightsaber, the lightsaber he first used, the lightsaber he lost his hand with in his first lightsaber duel with his father the moment he learned his true heritage, the first lightsaber ever seen on screen is tossed aside with little thought. It seemed to me, a metaphor for Disney throwing away what came before in favor of new-ness they can completely control and tailor to the focus-group formulas, and this scene should set your expectations for this movie.Snoke's character amounts to little more than a bait-and-switch and is killed perhaps just past the midpoint of the movie. He narrates his own death foolishly, and I've seen some people calling it poetic but I think it's lazy. We get no back story for the character that was often described as ""more powerful than Palpatine"" and ""ancient"" and then he is killed. How they could have made it better is by NOT showing Kylo moving the lightsaber next to Snoke with the Force. The audience isn't stupid, we would be able to piece together that betrayal and it would make it more shocking. We learn Rey's backstory. She is a nobody from Jakku, her parents sold her for drinking money and, if I remember correctly, they are said to be dead. So for the last two years hundreds of YouTube channels, blogs and articles and thousands upon thousands of fans, new and old alike, have been speculating about the two biggest mysteries of the new Star Wars films, Rey and Snoke, only to have the rug pulled out from under them in pretty weak reveals that Rey is a nobody and Snoke is also, a nobody.Disney broke the Force as we knew it by having Rey completely know how to use random Force powers as the plot demanded such as Jedi mind trick and Kylo Ren's mind reading trick (and for those that defended this as maybe she was one of Luke's students, The Last Jedi all but confirms she is literally just a nobody who never had any sort of training in her youth)Leia's ship's bridge is blown to smithereens by TIE fighters. This is what kills Admiral Ackbar in the background and Leia is flung into the cold embrace of space. This honestly would have been a good death for the character. It respects her as a frontline fighter, general and leader to the end willing to sacrifice her life for her cause just as quickly as anyone else. But, nope! Instead we get a terrible scene of her FLYING back to the ruined bridge. If you haven't noticed the lack of Finn, Poe and Rose in this review, then you're doing fine. Everything they do is pretty lackluster. Probably the biggest spoiler is that Luke goes out like a punk. He does very little other than play the unwilling and hard-headed mentor. The movie depicts him as a crotchety old man who was willing to murder a child (Ben) because of the potential evil in the child (I guess child-murder runs in the family). When he finally gets his will to fight and you think that he will be the bamf we expect him to be, it turns out he couldn't even bother to show up. For the whole movie, he does not leave the island.  His death scene is honestly really well shot with the sunsets but it's so undeserved. Fans have been waiting since 1980s, over 30 years to see Luke again on the big screen and there's a certain expectation for what Luke should be able to do. For Luke to go out like this means we will (probably) never see Mark Hamill go all out. What was shown here was not even a fraction of how powerful he was. Because he fades away, Disney easily has an out to say ""Oh, we didn't actually kill him! Star Wars isn't for the people it used to be for. This transition from passion Star Wars to a more ""general audience"" friendly. I'm so sorry for writing this down, but it's the truth. Come back, George...",0
1319,"Worst movie in all SW saga.Story is absolute crap - all interesting plot lines abandoned, but instead we see a parody on Rebel movement from original movies.",0
1320,"I thought Force Awakens was decent if obnoxiously derivative, but now they went and did it AGAIN. So the Rebellion is fleeing the Empire after a devastating attack, while their one Jedi trainee has flown off to train with a wise old master. Where have I seen that before? Meanwhile some of the heroes go to a fancy installation to find someone to help them, who winds up betraying them? Then there's a throne room confrontation almost just like the one from RotJ except it's got some stiff and awkward lightsaber chop socky (trust me, I watch a ton of action movies, this scene will not hold up to repeat viewing, there are fan-made lightsaber fights that are way more intense and dramatic)?Disney clearly has ZERO ideas of what to do here except completely rehash the original movies while stuffing affirmative action roles down everyone's throats. They have officially made a trilogy EVEN WORSE than the prequels.",0
1321,"The worse Star Wars movie of all time, now i understand why Mark Hamill hate everything about his character. The movie is empty, Full of goofy humor and a lot of disney teenager trash.

It will be better this way.",0
1324,"If you watch star wars for space-splosions and lightsaber fights, there was a lot to enjoy here. That fight scene in Snoke's chambers is the best lightsaber fight scene in any of the movies. It's raw and primal, without relying on laughable choreography to carry a scene.But if you like your space opera's to have a real story with flow, TLJ is easily the worst in the franchise. It's pandering to a social-justicey type crowd, and it's not even good at doing it. There's an open sore of an overtone that every male in this story is either evil or grossly incompetent. Or both. And every female in this story has lead-plated plot-armor or unimpeachable character. Or both.Holdo is supposed to be this stotic War Admiral who Poe immediately dismisses for being a female (""That's Holdo? Huh, not what I expected...""). Holdo's rebuking of Poe causes him to believe her marching them out of fuel and to certain death. Multiple times she is asked what their plans are, and multiple times her answer is a falsely stoic: ""Steady Ahead"".""She's a stronk independent space womyn who don't need no flyboi.""This leads Poe to ultimately hatch a plan that dooms the few survivors of the Resistance he didn't sacrifice for a Pyrrhic victory over a Dreadnought. The remaining survivors (of the initial 400) are wittled down to a size which very comfortably fit on the Millenium Falcon. 20-40 people? So a 90-95% casualty rate. If you include the fighters/bombers from the first scene it's definitely over 90%.While Finn and Rose are responsible too, Poe is a Commanding Officer who's ultimately to blame in virtually erasing the Resistance. Leia's smug smirk at the end because Poe has finally learned his lesson and is a NOW a good leader? Oh now he is? After killing 90% of the last bastion of hope in the galaxy, NOW Poe is ready.Jesus yoda-muppet christ. Poe was a GOOD character in TFA. He was a spy/pilot that was cool and collected in the face of impossible odds. In TLJ? He's Maverick in Top Gun; A hot-head misogynist who shoulda just listened to his Instructor Purple-Hair. Pfft, typical man.I walked away from this movie thinking, ""No **** wonder the Resistance is in such dire straights, with these objectively retarded leaders.""Rey and Kylo are the only two who salvage this trainwreck of a movie, and Kylo is a whipping boy for the first half of it. Rey's character is the only constant good thing from start to finish in this movie. There's so much more wrong with this movie than I've listed here, but I've only scratched the surface of this abomination and it's 9 paragraphs long.The only redeeming part of TLJ is that it's going to be a warning against letting SJW's sink their mandibles into any of your favorite IPs, because that's the core reason this movie stunk to high heaven.",0

It is well acted, well directed and beautifully filmed.However, as a STAR WARS film and everything it entails ... this movie destroys everything the original films stood for. There is no point in destroying the Empire and killing the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi. It destroys Luke's legacy and completely kills any reason to watch future films in the franchise.In this regard, it is worse than the Prequel trilogy since while those were terrible films, they did not destroy the franchise. Disney has killed the golden egg laying goose for me, and I will not spend a cent on Episode IX or Han Solo or whatever else Disney wants to serve up anymore.",0
1328,"It had a few good moments and scenes, yet the writing is terrible. The film is full of plot holes. While i was watching i never had the feeling, that im watching a star wars movie. It felt like a **** Marvel film. Its being disrespectful with Luke and the force itself.",0
1329,"This isn’t Rian Johnson’s fault, nor the strong cast’s fault. It’s clear Disney is rushing these new movies out and it shows. Lucas for all his flaws at least planned his trilogies out. For the Disney Star Wars movies it feels like they are being made up on the fly. As if these talented directors are just passing a hot potato to the next guy just trying to make the best movie they can. Two years is not enough to time to make movies of this scale, especially when they need to write the source material simultaneously...When you look past the gorgeous technical achievements  of the film, all that left is a problematic cop out. There is nothing mind blowing about this movie. It’s a rehash of ESB and ROJ with a few good under developed ideas that could have had a lasting impact if they took their time to flesh it out...I guess a positive is that they are out of movies to rehash. Between Episode 7 and 8 they already covered ANH, ESB and ROJ. I get why though. When you are rushed you play it safe. However, maybe now they can truly make their own thing in episode 9. Although, the fact they had to rewrite the movie after firing Trevarow , and aren’t delaying the release tells me share holders are the number one priority here, as opposed to putting quality first.",0
1330,"Heavy SPOILERS ahead, proceed with caution.If you require one reason (and boy are there plenty) to consider this movie a complete and utter disaster, picture the following. Luke Skywalker, the one who kept his cool and was not turned to the dark side by the emperor, throwing his lightsaber away to demonstrate his allegiance to the light, the one who never lost faith in his belief that there is still good in his father, Darth Vader, would actually contemplate murdering a young man, much less his nephew, in his sleep, simply because he sensed the conflict in him.The film meticulously seeks to deconstruct the very basis on which the star wars mythos has been grounded upon; and replace it with a version of Leia which can gracefully glide through space Mary Poppins-style, boring chase sequences of Finn and Rose riding space horses to avoid capture (imagine something taken out of Jurassic World or Jumanji) and an exhausting emotional ping pong between seriousness and silliness. Not to mention the endless ludicrous use of bad, outdated (seriously, ""can you hear me?""), adolescent humor even in scenes where even inexperienced directors would know better than to mix in humor. And no, the humor does not even come close to that in the marvel movies. It is rather on par with the tasteless humor one ""enjoys"" in the Transformers movies. And have I mentioned how horrible Yoda is being rendered on the screen? Gareth Edwards did an amazing job on Rogue One and JJ Abrams successfully managed to set the tone for the new main trilogy, striking a balance between respecting the existing mythos and introducing new characters, even if he did so somewhat conservatively. Rian Johnson tosses everything out the window and delivers a technically sound but otherwise tasteless, soulless monstrosity perfectly aligned with the goals set by the film execs.I have a bad feeling about this...",0
1331,"Disney , the company that **** on its franchises.it killed of all good stories, gave ea the keys to the games and now only makes terrible movies. this movie is full of plot holes, luke is an **** and a coward, leia is super jesus, lots of jokes. force sensitive jedi is as bad as an angry teenage girl. snoke just dies and pahsma too.what i wanted is, a decent sci fi movie, what we get, is disney cleaning house to have a clean slate for the future of the franchise. ironically thats one of the things the empire is doing in the galaxy, go figure.luke should have had a honorable death, but he just **** everything up and acted like 16 year old. he should have been the one to face snoke and his guards, he should have had a very heroice fight against the frist order in snokes ship and save the galaxy and also become a martyr and become a character to be looked up on pop culture, but no, he was cucked and only made terrible decisions, and he made sure that Kylo would hate him but antagonizing him and just accepting that he was the actual villain . Kylo is alone, cucked and left by his family. he was put there by disney as the new villain. he is not even a good character to become the new villain in the next movie, he is just some angry teen. theres no sith or no jedi, just him. and an untrained super powerful girl.the force also has been destroyed, everyone is so powerful now its kinda ridiculous.the good things: the movie had good plot points and character development. oh wait, no it didnt, the only thing that made sense was kylo ren, the rest of the characters felt kinda dumb but still better than the 7th sw.for the sequel: less jokes, less force usage, more interesting lightsaber fights, a better plot and writer, and less petty characters. oh, and have other force users, the ones we have are not very interesting. and please develop better the character of kylo, he is still lame, and now he is alone to develop the dark side sotry",0
1332,I am giving this movie a 2 purely because there were some scenes that were entertaining however this movie was a disaster. For instance when Mark Hamill read the script he said Luke would never do what's in the script. After episode 7 and 8 I have lost hope for disney to handle star wars properly. I mean 7 and 8 make episodes 1 and 2 seem like masterpieces. The last jedi is filled with such ridiculous plot holes and scenes were the audience was laughing for all the wrong reasons. I mean I really believe that a group of 12 year old star wars fans could have made a better script then the episode 8. For shame disney. SHAME (rings bell) SHAME (rings bell).,0
1333,Worst Star Wars Movie! Have ruined all fun for episode 9. The Force Awakens was not perfect but still I liked it! Worst Star Wars film ever. :-( Im so disappointed!,0
1334,"Way to go Rian Johnson not only have you divided a loyal fanbase with this boring crapfest that's by far the worst movie in the series. You've also robbed the fans of any future Luke Skywalker spin off movie, due to how this ends.",0
1335,"Ruined everything good about, Luke and effectively ruined my childhood. If you want 2 hours of boredom, and nothing climatic happening go ahead. Just going to try and pretend this sequel didn't happen.",0
1336,"Total disapoinment: The story is contrived, disjointed, disapointing and we learn nothing about the big mysteries that we have been speculating about for the last 2 years. The movie leaves you on empty. A lot of things were put together to offer fan service but in an awful way. Some plot points to move the story forward were far too convenient. The main vilain gets disposed off in a shocking but also very stupid way. It is a good pop corn film but not worthy of being a Star Wars film. It could have been a good tv film but it is not the quality of a full feature for sure.",0
1337,"Disney is the First Order / Empire. Massive disappointment and mismanagement of franchise with forced subplots to sell movies in Asia and sell new stuffed animals in stores. This movie was unfocused, sloppy, and utterly disregards plot leads from Episode VII. It was downright disrespectful of the Star Wars saga and established characters. Most of the jokes fell flat and were either strange (e.g. milk incident) or oddly placed in dialogues that undermined the film's legitimacy. There were GAPING PLOT HOLES throughout the film and truly cringeworthy moments - specifically, a moment were a main character flew through space. The fact that this movie is receiving positive reviews is baffling to me.  Perhaps it is just a reflection of how beloved the franchise is or how badly we wanted this to be a good movie.  We have to call this movie what it is so that Disney doesn't do this again.  They are a money-making machine and they need feedback to know what to make.  They need to hear , loud and clear, that this movie sucked. It's a damn shame and I hope J.J. Abrams can redeem this in Episode IX.  In the past, screenwriters 'jumped the shark' or 'nuked the fridge,' but I am suggesting that Rian Johnson 'milked the space-anteater' on this one.",0
1338,"Very slow plot development, some predictable situations, even they dare to recycle events like heroic sacrifice two and a possible third time with Finn in the same movie, very dissapointed.",0
1339,"First of all, everyone's grade is subjective. But what people who throw perfect scores at this movie need to understand, is that this amount of negative feedback is not just a matter of hate. The movie gets a lot of criticism, because it deserves a lot of criticism. If FOR YOU this is the best Star Wars movie and you love it, you have nothing to feel bad for, you are not wrong for loving it. You are wrong however, if you claim the criticism the movie receives is completely wrong. Now, to actually go into some details.I do not hate this movie, but this is the first Star Wars movie I came out of from the cinema thinking: I did not like this movie. Even Episodes 1 and 2, when I came out of the cinema, I had a smile on my face. True, upon further reflection, they are not exactly the best movies, but this movie, first time view and I was not pumped, I was not smiling. I was just... I did not like this movie. I think they made some bad decisions. And I think Mark Hamill agrees too.FROM THIS POINT ON SPOILERS APPLYI think the movie starts off well, with an awesome space battle, and a pretty deep moment with Leia and Poe where she wants him to be a leader, but he's not there yet. For me the problems start when Leia enters a coma or whatever that is, and Admiral Holdo takes over. Admiral Holdo is a character that did not need to be in the film. I wholeheartedly believe that if they just kept Leia conscious for the entire film, and had that Holdo - Poe conflict actually be a big opinion difference between Leia and Poe, where Leia wants to grow him in the next big leader, her successor and actually treats him like a son (u know, the son she lost to the Dark Side), that would have been a much more rewarding evolution. I am sorry, the scene where Holdo sacrifices herself, looked amazing. But I felt nothing. If that would have been Leia, I would have been crying.Next up is the big stinker for this movie. The ""Run - get code breaker - come back to destroyer - stop tracking"" plot, that is followed up by Finn and Rose. That thing is just stupid. But that is not even the biggest problem. Even with this convoluted mess of a plot, why did they need to make it such a boring, long, drag? That takes up 1/3 of the film, and it is absolutely dragged out and terrible. It touches on 3 very nice and smart themes: animal cruelty is bad, war makes good business and arms dealers sell to rebels as well, aaand the whole impressing the kids secures you tomorrow's Jedi. The themes are nice, but unfortunately most it is just those horses running through the track, through a field, through a building, through a street, through another building, through some corn. And then... oh here is a neat smart scene on how this arms dealer deals TIEs to the 1st Order and Xwings to the Resistance. 20 seconds of smart vs 6 minutes of BS CGI horse chase that does not add anything to the movie.Last major point I did not like about this movie is what they did with Luke. First of all, I did not want to see Luke die this episode. Even if his death is actually becoming one with the Force willingly, I don't think this was the best thing to do. And if they really wanted to do it, I think the way they did it not doing the character justice. In A New Hope, Obi Wan goes out in a similar way... but not really. In Ep. 4, Obi Wan is not actually in a situation he can easily get himself out of. So he knows what he needs to do to go out like a boss. Luke does not do that. If they really wanted to kill Skywalker, they should have actually brought him there. They should have made him wreck some AT ATs, give Luke's fans a scene of him being a total bad-ass, have him fight Kylo and then have the scene where he sais... if you strike me down I will be with you forever. And then, the mind game with Kylo REALLY begins. Have Luke put a huge display of power only to LET Kylo ""win"", and ""kill him"" just so he can prove a point.This movie, is a huge waste of potential. But the 3 points I mentioned above, are not a question of missed potential, there are plenty of those in the movie, but not these 3. They are a question of poor decisions, and ultimately why I did not like this Star Wars movie.",0
1340,"Complete blasphemy and degradation of the whole idea behind Star Wars. Poor character development, bad sense of humor, disney-like lines and scenes that just dont fit Star Wars universe at all.They literally destroyed everything that the original Star Wars trilogy represented. Luke's character in these movies is turned into a douchebag and all male characters are represented as **** or morons in contrast of female cast that were empowered and **** Lack of epic scenes,seriousness and depth of story. Ridiculous scenes with Leia floating in space and disney casino. Only good thing about the movie is that it looks visually good. Nothing else",0
1342,"Poorly written, full of unecessary jokes, and far far away from Star Wars Galaxy.Being innovative it's not just trying to push the story trough unseen paths, it's playing with unwritten rules (and anthropological codes) to tell the same story in a different, maybe peculiar, way. This is Star Wars. Anyway, plot and subplot are completetely a disaster in terms of screenwriting. So It's not anymore a matter of how much FANS are attached to the franchise, it's that Hollywood it's not able, anymore, to distiguish between a bad or a good script, while they're focused (more than ever before) in a greedy, and really pathetic, search of gold. Could have we expected something different from Disney? Certantly not.Have I hoped something better from Star Wars? Certantly yes. May the force be with all of you, this is a really sad era.",0
1343,"I'm just disappointed. I really don't want to, but I can't really understand where all the great critics from the press and some of my friends come from. Episode 7 was great in my opinion.Of course, it copied episode 4  in many moments and some scenes didn't really make sense, but that was ok for me, because it made you feel nostalgic.I just had a good feeling when I came out of the theatre.But now to Episode 8:Leia's ""coming back from death"" scene was actually the **** moment in any movie I've seen. It would have been ok to me, if she just died (RIP Carry Fisher). I mean you could not know before, that the actor will die, but the role itself didn't have any relevance in the story anymore. The movie was always about ""let the past die"", so why Leia cannot?The movie was too long. The whole story around Kantobyte was just irrelevant for the plot and also quite ****. I mean they got arrested for wrong parking... WRONG PARKING!?!?!?! Really Disney??? WTF is wrong with you?!? Some criticism on society isn't bad... ok... but I felt pretty bored about this action strand.Furthermore, I couldn't have felt more indifferently about Rose. Everything episode 7 just built up, is now **** up!Snoke, who came out of nowhere, able to teach the ""mighty"" Kylo Ren and strong enough to built up the first order...dead now.Nobody knows who he is and where he's coming from. Palpatin must have heard of him... he just had to. You could have write a awesome background story of his character, but Disney seemed  to have no ideas, so they just said:"" ok, let him die,cause we aren't creative today!""And for everyone who's saying:""They will make a movie just about snoke maybe!"" It won't change anything! An interesting and mysterious character died in a ridiculous way.The whole scene about Rey trying to convert Kylo... I felt like I sat in Episode 6. Just the same old thing. What really worked in episode 7 in my opinion, just feels uninspired now.Luke Skywalker, most unsympathetic character of the year!Ok, we understand, you hate yourself, but why you have to pity yourself for 2 f*cking hours???Everyone just wanted to watch epic practicing scenes. I saw actually one wich made me feel disappointed.But I have to say: The last fight against Kylo was damn awesome and for everybody who's crying that he died... The movie is called:""The Last Jedi!""The Humor just killed it all!I liked it in episode 7, but those cute BB8 moments in episode 7, just came all 3 minutes.F*CK PORGS! Nobody liked Jar Jar, so why are you doing something even 1000 times more stupidly???Just for making merch? Shame on you!I mean, of course there have been scenes I even liked, but the decisions about the story, how they threw away interesting characters like Phasma and Snoke and the humor just disappointed me. All in all, Im not a big fan of the movie.",0
1344,"Despite glimpses of top tier Star Wars, this movie felt wrecked by too many characters, too many ""learning moments"", forced conflict often not backed up by the characters' back stories, drastic character shifts with no precedence, an emphasis on cheap laughs and cute merchandise setups, ... it really doesn't relent. By the end my whole theater stood up and left. No clapping like Rogue One. And by the time people made it to the restroom, they were arguing about which elements were worse. I can't say I didn't laugh at times, or that it was 100% bad, but this feels like a disservice and a money grab.",0
1345,"Rian Johnson took everything great about Star Wars (even the cool stuff that JJ Abrams setup in TFA)and completely **** on it all. I left the theater wondering what I had just watched and why I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life on some pandering, marvel-ized bull**** that used to be Star Wars. I now have zero hype for episode IX or the supposed Rian Johnson trilogy after this dumpster fire of a **** show.",0
1346,"Movie is definitely better than Episode 7 but boy oh boy that's not a big improvement. Yes, film looks great, special effects are awesome but uh... That's it. There is no depth in characters nor planets, lore even story itself seems... lacking. It feels like a cheap money grab similar to what's been happening to gaming industry. More and more content but less and less quality. Me, personaly I was hoping for engaging story, some answers and lore that would expand this universe. It's not there.I'm sorry but I'd rather watch Rouge One (with all it's plot holes and other issues) for 6th time than this again.",0
1347,"This is not star wars. All the bad thing at Forcen Awekens was brought to another level in the Last Jedi. It is the end of Skywalkers, is the end of Jedi and others force user that have to train, learn and dedicate to become skilled with the force. Now powerful force users are all over the galaxy, and I'm not talking about the Mary Sue, that still unexplainable super overpower. But the worst was see how bad they treat Luke, the main plot that creates the villian and the spinning wheel of this movie was a action that contratidcs EVERYTHING about Luke.",0
1348,"Sloppy would be my one-word summary. Honestly unsure what film the critics were watching; not the one I saw, apparently. So much effort to show so little happening. I've a feeling I just watched a really long commercial for Battlefront 2 and Disney's only real regret is that they couldn't find a way to charge me halfway through the movie.Plot development? Virtually none. Plot holes? Many. Character development: Well, Rey did some interesting hiking with Luke, at least. Massive barely-strung-together visual spectacles: Plenty. Some people died along the way, but they got about 30 seconds screen time, so it was hard to tell who they were. I feel sorry for the actors and actresses as they clearly gave their all and in several cases produced stellar performances, but the director and editor threw their hard work into a trash can of mediocrity.Little in the way of internal consistency, hand-waved deus-ex-machina, topped by practically no explanation - this apparently is what Star Wars is today. Remember how in Empire Strikes Back, the Rebels and the Empire both seemed like functioning militaries with legitimate technology (albeit with different scales of equipment)? Apparently decades later both sides are completely and utterly incompetent. Remember how we had loads of questions in The Force Awakens? Prepare to have none of them answered, along with key characters getting bridges dropped on them to avoid having to answer some of those awkward questions. The posturing men-children of the First Order (complete with orange hair) are back to make us cringe again, and the commanding women of the Rebellion are back to tell us to keep calm and trust them without any explanation whatsoever. This seems oddly familiar ground... The heroes and villains are done huge disservices by being shoehorned into outcomes that make no sense. Sprinkle some forced humour and a couple of bits of Force 'magic' that trample all that made the original films great, and that about wraps it up.The excellent showing by Hamill and Ridley as retired Jedi master and aspiring Jedi trainee is intermixed with set piece silliness after set piece silliness in the wider movie. Almost every aspect of the battles make no sense and are just there to provide convenient holes for the paper-thin plot to run into. As an aside, Rogue One did a far better job here; the combat in that movie seemed seriously grounded compared to this outing. From hundreds of stormtroopers vanishing to scenes that go nowhere (I honestly lost track of the number of times the film introduced concepts & characters then promptly forgot about them) to strange attention-seeking moments where the film pauses as if to say 'here, we're making a point here' - the pacing and editing are remarkably poor.Throw in a good bit of political commentary, because where would Hollywood be without lecturing us poor plebeians, and really, I found TLJ thoroughly disappointing. Fun if you have a short attention span and want to go 'oohh ahh' at all the pretty stuff, but the central and fairly cerebral theme of Star Wars that Lucas built, of Light and Dark and the points of view between, appears to have been force-pushed out the nearest airlock.",0
1349,"Very, very disappointed. Can not explain how a company like Disney, having unlimited resources and great material to work with, can make such a stupid and soulless film. No respect for the characters, stupid story, many many plot wholes...",0
1350,"This was another soulless debacle thrown up on screen. It is heartbreaking that Disney has treated Star Wars with such disdain, and treats revered and beloved characters like disposable garbage.

Once again, the critics fail the people in their rush to fawn over the latest offering from their masters.",0

1353,I love how in the bad ratings you see people listing what's wrong with the movie.And good ratings are just a bunch of people insulting others for not gobbling this garbage up like they did.This says everything you need to know about this movie.,0
1354,"Left the cinema incredibly disappointed. So many things wrong with this movie which makes me worried for the future of the franchise with the countless spin offs and yet another trilogy on the way.Cons: -CGI in some places was terrible, they managed to make this film look worse than TFA and RO. Some very dodgy looking scenes and the animals on the casino planet looked shoddy. -Acting was less than impressive (although Adam Driver and Mark Hamill were great).-Luke, who faced both Vader and Palpatine and managed to sway Vader back into the light side, was scared of Kylo Ren, who had not even gone to the dark side yet, and, for a brief moment, tried to kill him. Completely out of character. -Princess Leia flying through space (no explanation needed).-The whole Finn and Rose sub plot was not needed, boring and bad. It slowed the film down considerably, was completely pointless in the end, introduced DJ (who was incredibly irritating IMO), 5 minutes talking about how cruel the animals were treated (why is this needed) and were conveniently thrown into prison with a hacker. -Snoke, who in TFA was made out to be this all powerful Sith Master, is killed off halfway through. No explanation to his backstory, who he was, how he came to power. -Poe stalling Hux at the start. Again, no explanation needed. -Captian Phasma, like in TFA, literally does nothing in this film and, even worse, is killed. Probably had about 10 minutes screen time in both movies combined. -Comic relief/cringey 'jokes' every 5 minutes.-Unanswered questions from TFA. How was Anakin's/Luke's lightsaber found? What's happened to the Knights of Ren?-Poe and Finn, although my favourite characters from TFA, fell flat in this movie.-Luke dying.-BB8-Pogrs.(I would mention Rey's parents basically being nobodies, but I don't think we've got the actual answer to that yet).Pros:-Kylo Ren was the most interesting character by far. Adam Driver was excellent.-Some cool visuals - e.g when the Supremacy gets blown up. -Luke vs Kylo scene.-Yoda.-Enjoyed the training of Rey and Luke.-Thought Daisy Ridley was good, still think Rey is a good and interesting character.-Kylo Ren + Rey v Snoke's bodyguards.",0
1355,Jeesus what a snooze-fest. Possibly the second worst Star Wars film ever made after the clone wars. Extremely disappointing!..........................,0
1356,"Spoilers to follow.....Ok, I'll be brief.  General Hux is reduced to being comic relief.  Snoke (probably the most interesting character in the prior movie) is killed off.  No explanation of who he is or where he came from, just wasted in the middle of the movie. Rey still manages to become a powerful Jedi with no training (?).  Yoda appears, well just because.  The slapstick is just gut wrenchingly bad.  The ""your on hold"" scene (near the beginning) elicited audible groans.  Finn is still completely uninteresting.  The only bright spot was Mark Hamill's performance.  For the first time in my life, I can honestly say I'm really not interested in what the next film has to say, and that's saying a lot.",0
1357,"TLJ feels like it was directed and written by people who have never even watched the PT/OT.The Last Jedi was terrible. I would rather watch Attack of the Clones a hundred times over than watch this disaster of a movie again. Between the hatchet job on Luke's character and his arc in the OT, the forced comedy and tonal issues, Rey's force abilities being completely unexplained (I think they are changing the force into a superpower that requires literally no training now based on the scene with the kid at the end), the heavy handed shoehorning-in of the ""next generation"" characters who I find to be completely underdeveloped, unlikable, and annoying, offing Snoke without any backstory or answers. And the biggest WTF moment which was Leia flying through space and turning what at first I thought would have been an acceptable sendoff for Carrie into one of the most weirdest and distracting scenes in the entire franchise. Even Laura Dern was disappointing, there was something about the way she acted her character that was off-putting and didn't really work for me. This movie was an absolute trainwreck. It felt like TFA and TLJ had completely different tones to the point that it was distracting. The way TLJ handled force powers and Rey's unbelievably fast transition into force-god makes me feel like this universe is cannibalizing its own rules and the dissonance between the 3 trilogies is reaching ridiculous levels.My issues with Luke's character in TLJ is that he faced down Palpatine and Vader in the OT, always believing there was good in Vader and successfully redeeming his father. Seeing the good in others is central to Luke's character. Kylo Ren has done absolutely nothing to earn the same level of respect story-wise and from the audience as Palpatine and Vader. He's a nothing, a poser. That has been established by TFA. So Luke's conflict with Ren feels so...wrong. It doesn't make sense. He was being manipulated as a teen by Snoke, and Jedi Master Luke couldn't do anything about it and actually considered murdering him in his sleep before Ben even attempted anything? After everything he accomplished in the OT? Are you kidding me? TLJ not only retroactively makes TFA worse, but also makes the character journeys of both Luke and Anakin less meaningful.I can't be the only one extremely annoyed that they never bothered to flesh out the New Republic AT ALL? Or at least explain how Snoke was able to create such a strong military in the shadows to be able to overthrow the government? Now that the writers established that Snoke was a joke deserving no background or context in lore with his anticlimactic death, we're supposed to believe that the New Republic was just that weak and incompetent?Positives: Benecio Del Toro, the creatures, seeing Mark Hamill again even if his character was butchered. I'm glad Rey's parents ended up being a nonfactor, I was holding my breath thinking the movie was going to disappoint me further with an awful reveal.I miss George. The Sequel Trilogy is severely lacking in the coherent vision and themes present in both the Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy.",0
1358,"Within a single movie they have completely destroyed the magic that was Star Wars. Not even the prequels did this much damage to the franchise as this single movie has done. I understand that the newer generation had to take over at some point. However, the way Rian Johnson has gone about accomplishing this task just desecrates the entire legacy of Star Wars. This movie is nothing but a massive back slap and complete disrespect to every Star Wars movie and character that has come before it.",0
1359,Pretty sad really.It wasn't 'walk out of the theatre' bad but close. The biggest thing was that so much stuff happened in the film that could have been cut out that you'd leave 1 scene and go away for half an hr with 2 other characters on a little adventure and lose track of what you'd been watching before. 2 1/2 hours of people running around and shooting at each other and at the end really nothing much had changed. As well they were always talking about how powerful these jedi and order sith guys were but really nobody did much force stuff at all. The light sabre fights were poorly choreographed None of the characters communicated with each other which made friction for no reason.Daisy is not a great actress and pretty much just played this by the book with 1 or 2 facial expressions .This film has no replay value.,0

What an achievement!There are no satisfying conclusions to anything. Every question you had is swept aside. Who's Snoke? Who cares say Disney. Who are Rey's parents? Who cares What happened to Phasma after giving up the death star codes to Finn, resulting in its destruction? Who cares. How did Kylo escape the death star?

In order to escape they decide to hack the star destroyer. In order to do this Finn travels to a casino on a distant planet to find a hacker. Wait? Doesn't that mean they have a way of escaping? AAAAAGGGHHH! Why is it all so stupid! Hardly anything makes sense under even the most minimal of scrutiny. Did you think we wouldn't notice the idiocy Disney?The nail in the coffin for this film was turning our beloved Luke into a doosh. All that magic and hope at the end of ROTJ. Dead.We keep being told about a story about Luke and the Knights of Ren - A much more interesting story than the one we're watching. How about making that film? At least it might make me believe Luke could become such a spanner. Luke's ending was sad, and not in a good way. It felt pointless. This could have been made a million times better with a few very simple changes.The more I think about The Plot-hole Awakens, the worse it gets. Oh, and no, it's not funny despite thinking it is.",0
1362,"Completely underwhelemed by this. This only goes on to prove how critics are disconnected with the actual audience, just as in case of DC where most people love the movies and critics pen it as worst movies possible.

I hated force awakens with a passion and have had at least 20 conversations over the past 2 years trying to explain why to morons who thought it was a good movie. This was more of the same, more weak plot, more weak acting riding the coatails of a strong franchise. They added a chinese woman specifically so that this movie would hopefully do better in China than the last one(force awakens was made with chinese market in mind and it got stomped by a chinese animated movie about bears). At this point all disney cares about is selling action figures, selling little plush stuffed animals of cute birds, and the secondary movie markets since they want to sell 1.3 billion tickets to the all their movies in China. I think my biggest issue with this is that they used the pirateds of the Carribean formula for star wars because who gives a crap. Its a good formula but does not belong in this franchise. Bascially they crapped on all the things that made the originals great trying to cash in as much as possible. Also Finn is the new JarJar except JarJar was funny once or twice. My fav part was when I though Finn was going to die, because i was like thank god they are writing him out of the movie but then Chinese girl saves Finns life and says she loves him which is hilarious because she had literally known him for less that 24 hours(when they first meet they say the ships will run out of fuel in like 18 hours), all as an excuse for her to give him a passionate kiss, the people behind me laughed out loud and said what the hell and I was like ""my thoughts exactly"". The third movie could be the greatest movie ever made and it still would not redeem these first two steaming turds.  I did like Rogue One so I guess that is something, too bad the new trilogy is such garbage. Also Star wars battle front 2 is complete cash grab garbage.",0

I couldn't believe what I was witnessing:You want a continuation of the story-line from episode 7? F- yourself.You want to see Luke Skywalker go on another swashbuckling adventure?

The mysteries are stupid and it all doesn't mean anything and go F-yourself.I have never been so insulted, humiliated, and embarrassed, from watching a major film from a beloved franchise. The message seems to be loud and clear: if your an older fan of Star Wars, you don't matter anymore and you shouldn't love Star Wars because it all doesn't mean anything... Well, it means something to me! I love Star Wars, and I cannot fathom how this movie got made. It's a travesty. Poor Mark Hamil. He deserved much better than this hot pile of garbage called The Last Jedi.",0
1368,The whole point of SW was its ability to transport viewers to a galaxy far far away. With all the stupid modern jokes we are taken out of that time and time again. Never going to a theatre to see SW again. Disney-fication. For kids only and they are missing out.,0

Peter cushing must be rolling on his grave again, after the performance he gave in episode 4, and this thing.This show us, that there is something fishy going on with the critics...",0
1371,"Over at ScreenRant there is a column about the dichotomy emerging between the professional critics and the audiences over The Last Jedi. The author (Chris Agar) concludes that ""Lucasfilm is constantly in a lose-lose situation"" and will never be able to please everyone because they will be accused of copying the original SW films, or else they will incur the wrath of fans by departing from tradition. I'm not sure I agree - in fact, this ""lose-lose"" business feels a lame excuse that gets Disney off the hook for making bad films. Furthermore, it is a false choice fallacy to suggest that the studio must choose between copying the OT or doing something new. If Disney would simply give the world a good story that is true to the original spirit of the originals, they would win the adoration of the fans forever.Look at how enthusiastically fans embraced The Force Awakens and Rogue One, both of which were decidedly mediocre. In other words, it ain't that hard. Yet somehow Disney messed this up. Big Time.Sadly, there is already a veritable circling of the media wagons in defense of this film. The narrative that many in the media are embracing is that audience critics of TLJ are either disaffected fanboys unwilling to broaden their palate, or perhaps they are simply bigots who cannot tolerate a more diverse approach to the franchise.But what if - WHAT IF - audiences hate The Last Jedi because it is a bad film? Surely we can admit that possibility?The fact that we can't speaks to both the inherent confirmation biases in the media (anyone who doesn't think TLJ was graded on an extremely generous curve may be a touch naive) and Disney's shrewd exploitation of these biases. Surely a property like Star Wars gets the corporate treatment...these are not ""autuer"" films, no matter what the Disney marketing machine would have us believe. In short, Disney knew what they were doing when they decided to make a social statement with casting and story decisions. Like the Ghostbusters reboot, the Disney Star Wars films were always going to be embraced by the critics. Clearly, virtue Signaling is a temptation that very few people in that milieu can resist.As for the film, others have underlined it's staggering weaknesses better than I can (poor pacing, lack of character development, nonsensical plotting, highfalutin social commentary, weak dialogue, punishingly stupid jokes, and unidiomatic tone) - simply put this is a 40 lbs turkey served cold. Remember that fans embraced The Force Awakens and Rogue One, neither of which is anywhere near as good as even the worst of the originals. All Disney needed to do here was make a halfway competent film. The backlash is because with all their vast resources, they couldn't even manage that.When I was a senior in high school we had a math teacher who was extremely generous with granting opportunities for extra credit, and even went so far as to allow us to approach her with questions ask during tests. She knew that a lot of us had gotten acceptance letters from colleges and didn't want anyone to catch such a bad case of Senioritis that it would screw-up our future...she used to remind us that it wasn't hard to get a passing grade in her class - but you had to put in the effort, or she would have no mercy on you. Really, all you had to do was care.",0
1372,"The Last Jedi was more Space Balls than Star Wars. Acting and imagery were great. But the story was a weak transport ride of an arch, and the forced humor was lame (Luke brushing his shoulder off?). So disappointed!",0
1373,"If you are a casual fan, you will love this. If you're a true star wars fan and adhere to previously established Lucas canon, you will feel insulted by this nonsense. This was a SJW's wet dream. Nothing says ""new generation"" like focusing mainly on diversity of characters rather than the story. What they did to Luke has to be the worst thing done to a movie character in history. What they did to snoke was completely idiotic and such a missed opportunity. Now your main antagonist is an emo dark side user. Wow I'm scared. What this boils down to is Disney's new Star Wars universe is an appeal to the lowest common denominator. Lucas canon is thrown out the window, and these new movies make the entire existence of the OT and the Rebellion completely pointless/irrelevant. These will movies will make a fortune as usual because Disney is a cash cow, but Disney is apparently incapable of making good movies. They won't even consult Lucas on anything anymore to attempt to make a quality Star Wars movie. To reiterate, this was an appeal to the lowest common denominator SJW, plain and simple. Embarrassing.",0
1374,"The movie is visually great, but the film is really disappointing.  However, this movie feels like a recycled story from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi combined.  Story has a lot of plotholes, and some scenes felt like they were forced onto us. I don't want to spoil this film, but as you can see the majority of users are agreeing that Disney is turning Star Wars into ****  Save your money, and wait till this movie goes on T.V for free.",0
1375,"Something leads me to believe that critics might have been paid off. That or they went into the movie thinking ""I like when things go boom, it would be cool if they made Star Wars like Transformers and had big explosions and pretty lights"" the plot was horrible. No questions were answered from the last movie. So many new questions came to mind. Complete waste of Mark Hamill. To be honest I enjoyed The Phantom Menace more than this movie. Can't believe after watching this movie I miss George Lucas as a story teller/ director... that should tell you how bad this movie is.",0
1376,"Just saw it...I don't know what to think.I really like the character development between Kylo and Rey.However, the rest of the movie was bad!!!The worst part of it was how they portrayed Luke. They made him into an elderly loser!The story was very poor, and explained nothing...",0

1378,"TLJ was scared to be Star Wars for the first 90 minutes, feeling more like an inane comedy, so disrespectful towards the previous Star Wars films. The galaxy of TLJ is barren and empty, and all actions by the main characters feel devoid of meaning without the movie really addressing the context of their actions. It's the same old set-up where the audience is forced to accept that 'those are the good guys' and 'those are the bad guys' and it's 'good vs evil'. Even The Force Unleashed on Wii had a better story arc than this movie.",0

Don't send characters on meaningless huge waste of time trips so you can have an SJW commentary on rich people. 5.

When the highlight of the film was the cute little owl-looking creatures, there really is nothing that’s left to say. Plot holes, cheesy-ness through the roof, underdeveloped character arcs, horrendous overly acted sludge - I mean, what exactly, if anything, did this film get right? I am absolutely shocked by the critics’ reviews. This might have been the worst Star Wars movie to date. Wow.",0
1382,"I just wanted this to be so much more.  Like many I think there were definitive plot holes, but I was more disappointed because this could have been overcome, given the excellent acting, with just a few tweaks of the story, and at least one decent lightsaber battle.  I also felt the ending was horribly anticlimactic for a 2nd in line star wars movie, and there were so many ways they could have added 1 or 2 in to make things actually interesting and anticipatory for the final movie.  I just don’t know where they go from here, other than the painfully obvious final battle b/w a certain young Jedi and Sith.  But what was probably most frustrating for me was how the Finn character was treated.  After a great character set-up/arc in Force Awakens, he had absolutely zero development/build, including going nowhere with what appeared to be the makings of another Jedi as a counter to Rey.  I mean Jesus they opened this series in Force Awakens, with HIS awakening in the force, then went nowhere with it in Last Jedi.  His exploits with Rose ultimately and frustratingly prove completely pointless.  I’m just frustrated that what appeared to be a co-lead in the series with Rey, and thus a first diverse lead in Star Wars, was turned into a bit part character.  Don’t know if this is part of the Hollywood diversity problem in general, as directors (writers notwithstanding) who have these controls, have been the ones to push the White characters into position to ultimately save the day, with the diverse characters playing the joking/helper side-kick type parts.  Even Poe was given hero status in a few different ways, as opposed to Finn who failed twice to do what he attempted in trying to save the “resistance”.  Given the change in directors I wonder if that was the issue, and if maybe Abrams can bring some of the magic back to this once promising character, and overall series arc.",0
1383,"D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E.  Shame on you, Disney.  I seriously do not understand how the vast majority of professional critics are giving his movie such high marks.  Especially when the general audience are so mixed.  Disney, how much did you have to pay your PR machine to make this happen?  You now have two Star Wars duds on your hands over the 2017 Christmas season. EA's Battlefront II and now this.",0
1384,"They brought Star Wars back. Only to spit on its name.Wow. Just wow. The Last Jedi was the worst piece of garbage masquerading as a Star Wars movie. I genuinely feel bad for paying the ticket fee. This movie doesn't deserve that.See, I hate it when my favourite things are being destroyed. It's like a phantom dagger piercing my heart.Why exactly is TLJ such a horrendous farce of a movie? Spoilers, beware. Let's see...1. No character development. At all. The only thing we learned is that Kylo Ren has conflicts of conscience. Everyone else remains as forgettable, boring PC main characters. Finn is still a black dude who sometimes gets excited. Rey still beat Kylo Ren with her girl powers without actual training. There's a new short, plump, socially awkward girl. Need I say more.2. The romance between Finn and Rose felt forced. They had zero chemistry at all. The kiss-scene felt like it came out of nowhere. I get that romance is a reoccurring theme in Star Wars, but... just because you can do it, doesn't mean you should. Did they write this on their lunch breaks? Jesus Christ.3. No tension. You know one ingredient that makes a good movie? Emotions. I may just be cold, but I felt almost ZERO emotions while watching TLJ. There wasn't a single scene that made me excited, hyped, joyous, sorrowful, or angry. The only emotion I felt... was disappointment. I didn't even chuckle once. Speaking of chuckling...4. Misplaced comedy. Really. I'm not the kind of person to laugh out loud often, but not a single 'comedic' or 'funny' scene even made me smile.5. What happened with Snoke? He was both a severely underused and cliche villain. It's almost like they tried to recreate the ending of Return of the Jedi when Rey entered Snoke's throne room and was briefly force-tortured by him. Then he dies. Awesome. Honestly, I didn't like him that much either way, but... You have three movies to make a compelling villain. Three movies. Of the most popular fictional saga in the entire world. And THIS is what you come up with?6. What happened with Captain Phasma? No. I refuse. I REFUSE to believe that was her fate. She'll come back, right? That was just a ruse to make us think that she's dead. There's no **** way that you kill off one of the most underused villains of all time like that. SHE HAD LESS TOTAL SCREEN TIME IN 2 MOVIES THAN GENERAL GRIEVOUS DID IN REVENGE OF THE SITH FOR **** SAKE.7. Random ass-pulls. Things that make you go ""Oh, come oooon!"". Princess Leia's 'death' is a shining, prime example of this. Curses, our fair princess was vacuumed into space! Oh wait. She can just use her space wizard powers to move herself back to safety. The movie was full of these mini-deus-ex-machinas, but it would take forever to list them all.8. Awkward directing and mini-plot holes. So... when Finn and whatshername were captured and prepared for execution by Captain Phasma, there were stormtroopers all around them. An explosion. Everyone except our gracious main characters is dead. What happened to the troops surrounding Finn and Rose? At the end after the crash, how did Finn carry whatsherface back to rebel lines without AT-AT's obliterating them? My god. I admit I was tired, so maybe I missed some key elements. Could someone explain in detail how the main characters survived in some scenes for reasons other than their extraordinarily thick plot armour?And since this is the 8th 'episode', I think the 8th reason why The Last Jedi is a heap of garbage is a good place to stop. There are, of course, many more things, like Kylo Ren's betrayal of Snoke, Luke's death and Admiral Holdo's hyperspace-suicide which were completely intellect dampening from a logical perspective.One thing I liked were the Force scenes between Kylo and Rey. Them sensing each other and the camera angles being placed accordingly. Those were pretty sweet. The visual and auditory presentation of Holdo's suicide by hyperspacing through the imperial fleet was really cool. Otherwise, it made no sense lore-wise. Couldn't the rebels just have destroyed all of the Death Stars in the previous movies the same way?Rogue One was good. Fantastic, even. The Force Awakens was bad. The Last Jedi somehow manages to be even worse. I'd rather watch the prequels three times in a row that have a go at these Disney Wars movies befouling the Star Wars name. I have no hope for Episode 9. Hire better **** writers and directors and maybe we'll see.Hell, if Disney contacted me, I'd write a compelling, unforgettable script for Episode IX for FREE. I'm dead **** serious.",0
1385,"SPOILERS HERE!!: No training for Rey. In the new canon, you don´t need to be a padawan. You might be a **** Jedi from nothing. Training, effort, learning is for newbies....Snoke, oh man, who was ???? Why so powefull??His intentions? ...Who cares!!!!! SPLIT in 2. Thats all. Maybe Snoke is Hugh Hefner. The history behind Why Kylo Ren is Kylo ren is bad too, and simplist.",0
1386,"Obviously, I was going to watch this movie expecting the worst. It exceeded my expectations in that regard, of course. A formulaic, boring, insulting - those are the words that come to mind. In this world of heroes, or, as movie puts it, 'legends', none of the characters of the episodes 6 and 7 feel like they earned their place, power or recognition. This is now the world of Mary Sues and fan fiction level of writing.The movie is all over the place - from cast, in which I can only remember Mark Hamill for his outstanding work (as ever), to character development, to forced jokes almost every five minutes and petty attempts at pathos, to story delivery, which, I must note, feels disjointed, weak and sometimes not fit for a feature-length movie. Speaking of which, it was obvious for me and my friend sitting beside me from very early on that the story, with the ammount of characters and sub-plots going on, would look far better if it was series - it was that hard to follow all these characters and their irrelevant struggles, which, by the way, weren't able to convience me to empathise with them.I said above that this is now the world of Mary Sues. Nothing characters achieve is earned. It is all given to them by the all-powerful will of writers that seem onlyto be bothered by pleasing the lowest possible common denominator, which, of course, will repay their, ahem, hard work a thousand times over. The only meaningful sacrifice in the whole movie, and fatal at that, was made by, you guessed it, Luke. Of course, as with the rest of the movie and it's contrived plot twists, this sacrifice wasn't without a 'that was not expected, in a bad way' moment. But to understand what I mean by that, you'll have to watch the movie, which I absolutely can not recomend if you have any respect to the universe of Star Wars. I can hardly find a few good words to say about this movie, but there some to be said. Except I won't - so bitter is the aftertaste. Okay, okay, the effects were nice, however, that's all I can say about them - there were a plenty of hiccups. But is it enough to give this movie more than, say, 5 (as it is the average user rating at the moment of writing this)?To sum it up, it's not a movie for a Star Wars fan, as you might have guessed already. It's a cash grab, and I regret every penny I paid for a ticket. Sadly, these was no refund.",0
1387,"Its hard to admit it, but it was terrible movie. Its ironic that Disney managed to bribe most of the critics (or critics just want to be more popular with youth... poor moustache petes) but didnt managed to make a decent movie. Plot doesnt have holes, whole plot is a giant hole. Its sad to see all these characters who had such promising start in force wakens just got so wasted. Its a movie tht imbraces what is worst in our postmodernist culture, its ode to mediocricy. If John Galt would start rebelion now it should be against companies like disney. Still there were few moments of joy in this movie, but dont be decieved. Legacy of originals, even legacy of force awakens were just wipd out with single hand. Greedy mouse shot perfectly healthy horse and started beating it and it wont stop untill there will be any profit.....",0
1388,"Before I get into The Last Jedi, I would like to provide some background of where I am coming from. I am twenty-one years old and I have been a fan of Star Wars for as long as I remember. I grew up in the age of the prequels, and while I have gotten new perspective on them in time, I still have a fond attachment to the Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith (Clone Wars is a different story). But like many fans, nothing really tops the original trilogy for me. While The Force Awakens had clear reused material, I still walked out of the theater two years ago as excited about Star Wars as ever. They had introduced a new cast and set up for what I though could be a strong trilogy. They intruded the Big Baddy Snoke and teased there might finally be answers behind the old Palpatine's master questions. ----------------------------------------------------Then there was the Rogue One, a gritty and darker Star Wars film that toke me by surprise. An isolated cast of characters that did not need to rely of all the big names of the other movies that would fill in a series long question about the Death Star and the Empire. This film quickly rose to become one of my favorites, perhaps just behind Empire Strikes Back. Plus the ending scene with Vader... you know what I'm talking about. Never before had I felt legitimate fear of a Star Wars Villain. This movie gave me hope. ----------------------------------------------------Now, the Last Jedi was marketed as a darker film. ""Time for the Jedi to End"" This quote caught my attention. Would they finally be moving back from the singular story of the good guy Jedi and the bad guy Sith? Could this be the story where they explore the duality and balance of the force? No. I saw this film on opening night and I cannot recall a deeper sense of disappointment in a film about a series I love. ----------------------------------------------------You will see many viewers claiming that they finally told a new story and that Star Wars fans just can't handle that, or that if you liked Force Awakens and not this film then you are not a true fan. This is the biggest punch in the gut for me. I cannot see how the film told a new story as it reused old tropes from Star Wars and other films relentlessly, and failed to commit to truly daring developments at every opportunity. Instead they give you flashy, Fast and the Furious style, action scenes and shallow character developments. There must be three or four different times where a main character is saved from death at the last minute. Sure, there is no Death Star, but that does not make this story new. ----------------------------------------------------Inspiration from Empire is clear. There is a remake of the Dagobah scene, a student learning very little about the force from their master before rushing off to do something stupid against their master's will. There is a “join me and we will rule the galaxy scene”, and even a poor rendition of the Hoth battle scene on an all white salt planet this time. A Salty Hoth battle if you will. ----------------------------------------------------But, it was the forced humor that got to me the most. Every couple of minutes there had to be a forced gag. The opening scene amounts to a T-Mobile ""Can you hear me now"" skit with a your mom joke. Comedy was used to cover substance. I certainly laughed at a joke or two, but that is the number of jokes that felt in context during the film.----------------------------------------------------The ending digs it home and disposes of one of the series long best characters in a way I can only think the writers must have thought would be a meaningful send off.  But their death seems so out of place that I felt no emotional impact whatsoever which seems like a plot driven waste.  ----------------------------------------------------The soundtrack was well certainly well done, but is misused often. Every mention of Vader  required they play 8 notes of the Vader theme song just in case you don’t know who Vader is. Visually the film is spectacular and the team did excellent work with the sets, costumes and design.----------------------------------------------------Unfortunately those pros over overshadowed for me as the film amounted to not much more than cheap payouts. The director and writers seem to have misunderstood everything that Star Wars fans loved. Meaningful character development, slower and more impactful moments with humor when it actually fits, and plots with logical twists and turns and not just for the sake of throwing people off. To those that enjoyed this film, I am happy that you found peace and prosperity in your new empire. To the rest of us, let's hope they make the next Star Wars with actual passion and our beloved series isn’t left to die with thunderous applause.(Sorry for the poor format and dashed lines, my site kept grouping my paragraphs together when I would submit. I did my best to force organize it.)",0

1390,Suck it Disney. You ruined the franchise with this trash.This movie was the chosen one. This movie had potential to be amazing after the previous story told by Abrams and gang. You just took a dump and threw it against a movie screen and made all of us pay to watch it slide down the screen for a few hours.Massively disappointed.,0

1393,"Overall, it's still better than any film in the prequel trilogy, but not by much and that isn't exactly high praise. The humour is too much, too often and too forced. It just isn't fitting in a Star wars film. The plot is shallow and leaves you wondering what was the point in all of those hints in The Force awakens, were they just leading us down the garden path to cash in on that sweet sweet nostalgia? Classic characters are killed off seemingly for no reason and new characters are killed off leaving you thinking, what was the point in episode 7? Kylo Ren flip-flops more than a fish out of water, making him possibly the least likeable character since Hayden Christensen played Anakin. The final result is a film that spends 60% of it's time on a side quest that would have been totally avoided if the rebellion leader had just said 'here's the plan' and another 30% on pretty poor character development. Leaving the fans with about 10% of the film which is actually worth watching. The reality is that if this is a sign of what's to come for Star Wars then the franchise is in serious trouble. Thanks Disney /s.",0
1394,"- The Last Jedi is Rian Johnson losing a Senate seat in Alabama. Riding llamas through Las Vegas???- Why is there a Hunger Games/Fantastic Beasts subplot AT ALL?? Does NOTHING for the story—the codebreaking sequence is literally totally ditched. Wasted, BORING 30 min. In the middle of a Star Wars movie.- Rose is a terrible, useless, annoying character.- Why do Finn and Rose go all the way across the galaxy for THE MASTER CODEBREAKER and then randomly get put in a cell with a perfectly good codebreaker who just happens to be waiting to escape when they need him? - Halfway through the movie I actually thought “I wonder if I’m going to watch this again.” I should *never* think that in a Star Wars film. I still can’t believe it crossed my mind. I LOVE Star Wars. I saw the Phantom Menace and the Force Awakens four times *each* in theaters. I am NOT a hard Star Wars critic.- SO. MANY. BAD. JOKES.- Bill Weasley is so freaking annoying.- We both know the two characters with fake-out death scenes should have died or not had those fake-out death scenes.- NO backstory on Snoke???? NOTHING on Rey’s parents?? These were major questions from TFA! Rey’s lineage was a MAJOR theme in TFA. No continuity with Abrams. Hopefully J.J. saves these in Episode IX.- Also, I initially thought The Last Jedi was original. Upon further reflection, I’ve realized that he freaking copied and pasted almost every major plot point from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. No idea what they’re going to do in Episode IX because The Force Awakens already stole everything from A New Hope.",0
1395,"I waited 2 days after watching the movie to write this as I didn't want to do it while I was so angry as I was back then. And that's why I give a 3 and not just a plain 0.I will resume easily here what was the movie for me: a Star Wars fan since I came out from the cinema from seeing The Return of the Jedi:What I liked from the film:- Ren and Rey relationship- Laser sable fight against the Red Shy Guys- Luke, in general (Except the parts of milking the alien and similar forgettable ones)- The unexpected twists (like killing Snoke or Luke not being there)- In general, the last half an hour of the filmWhat I didn't like:- All the restThe best thing to say about the movie:- Benicio del ToroI mean, there was a moment while watching the movie when I realized that I wanted to see more about Benicio del Toro's character but not about Rose & Finn and their little running lambs, or Leia, or Poe, or the woman with Purple hair, not even about anything of what was happening to the rebels, a moment in which I realized that actually I just didn't care if Finn was going to kill itself to save the Rebellion.It was on that moment when I was sure that something was very wrong with this movie, a feeling that I didn't have with episode VII, even when there were also some embarrassing moments in that movie like those with Han Solo, Chewie and the Alien Squids from Outer Space.In The Force Awakens I found some things I didn't like, but the global result was more than OK.Here, I found some things I like, but the global result is boredom and embarrassment (Look, an Unidentified Flying Leia !!)Now I understand why JJ Abrahams ran away from this, Disney had taken over everything.",0
1396,"Star Wars movies always involve hundreds of creative people who churn out masterpieces for the little details. Often though, the guy at the top can't match their enthusiasm and skill. This movie really epitomizes that. Some of the things I liked about the previous movie were some of the questions it raised, so I was very disappointed to see those questions all thrown out in the sequel.I get the feeling that the main outline for the plot was thrown together in a weekend, with no serious consideration of what had come before or what might come after. I feel I learned nothing about the past and wasn't given any reason to care about the future.In politics or movies or anything else, don't step up for leadership if you don't have a vision. The director let his team down.",0
1397,"This movie makes very little sense considered both as a single film and also part of an ongoing saga of films with established canon and characters. It's main strenghts are having some really good performances (Adam Driver & Mark Hamill) and a nice OST but it's very weak in every other department and only superior to Phantom Menace in acting and special effects. Some people that like the movie and cannot accept a different opinion rely on the very poor argument of fans not embracing a fresh take on the SW universe and hating change. First of all, that's false when we think of beloved works like KOTOR or the smashing success of TFA & Rogue One. But even if you disregard questionable writing like Luke's backstory with Kylo Ren, Leia's use of the force and other qualms about continuity, the story is still a mess. The pacing is off and scenes seem padded out, the humor is often weak and doesn't land and ultimately very little of what happens feels earned:*Snoke can do a skype call video chat between Kylo & Rey and perceive every bit of the former's inner struggles yet he fails to notice his murderous intent and a freaking lightsaber moving next to him. His death is also anticlimatic and nullifies any chance of ever seeing how The First Order came to be and what his connection to the Sith was, making the whole background of the conflict very sketchy.*The praetorian red guards that are supposed to protect Snoke and hilariously adopt fighting stances at the drop of a coin fail to realize what's going on and do their work the ONE time that very thing is required from them.*Finn's story ultimately does nothing for the overall plot and even what it does for HIM was already established in TFA. Rose's romance with him feels contrived and underdeveloped. This is the one point that even positive and negative reviews agree upon and it's a considerable chunk of the movie.*Poe's arc is all over the place and unnecessary. Vice Admiral Holdo is a character that is written and performed in a very ambiguous manner just for the sake of a later plot-twist. *Rey and  Kylo Ren's relationship over the course of the movie makes little sense considering what she already knows about him (having witnessed Han Solo's demise) and is only possible because of contrivances with the force and a flashback that does its best in writing Luke as an ****. Some of it even feels like it came right out of a Young Adult movie adaptation but with better actors.*Benicio del Toro's DJ is protagonist of some of the most implausible sequences and outcomes.*Anything I could say about Phasma would require more effort than what the writers actually did with her.As stated in the beginning of this review, the movie not only barely works as a standalone but it also knowingly decides not to further develop many threads The Force Awakens started, making the previous chapter almost skippable (one example being the main plot of Luke going into exile but leaving a map to his location...but granted, that is a flaw that TLJ carries over from TFA). I could go on but at the end of the day anyone that loved the movie will fail to acknowledge most of its flaws as a big deal and those that thought it was horrible are already speaking their minds. Overall a HUGE disappointment.",0
1398,"Yawn, just another big-budget fanservice movie meant to pad Disney's quarterly EPS by ripping off superficial details from the original trilogy (this time it's mostly ESB and RotJ) while injecting Millennial snarky humor and cheap sight gags that will make people laugh once but be embarrassing forever after.Meanwhile most of the huge unanswered questions (and frankly, plot holes) from SW7 are either still left unanswered, or given cheap explanations that frankly were not worth the wait.Bottom line: no one who is really a fan of SW could possibly like where this new trilogy is going. But I think a lot of these people upvoting it are just escapism addicts looking for a fresh hit, they don't care if it's Star Wars or Marvel or what have you.",0
1399,"I'm willing to give this abomination a few points purely for Mark Hamill working hard to try and make what he was given work, Adam Driver's role as Kylo Ren who is one of the few redeeming parts of this movie, and production values that are expected with a budget and resources of the likes used in creating a (supposed) Star Wars movie.However, this movie in not a continuation of the Star Wars saga. It's expensive fanfiction, and has made it clear that while you can buy a license, you can't buy the spirit or soul.Luke Skywalker deserved far better treatment than he received in this movie, and my greatest sympathies to my fellow fans who wanted to see him as more than a bitter old man. A twisted old hermit who went from the brigh young Jedi whose unwavering faith in his fathers salvation and throwing his lightsaber aside saved the day to igniting his lightsaber while even contemplating killing his sleeping nephew and then retiring (and not lifting a finger to mend the mess he effectively created), still needing Yoda to guide him, and then dying of 'exhaustion' after a terrible 'Matrix-like' fight and death fakeout. It doesn't matter whether he comes back as a force-spirit, or whether they backpedal hard and have his death be another fake-out, because they have essentially ruined a character almost as (and more so in some circles) beloved as characters like Indiana Jones, Superman, James Bond, and so on. They have tarnished an icon. An inspiration to generations.Carrie isn't treated much better, seen as giving up hope in her son (and thus, sending Han to his death when she should have come to that conclusion sooner) in a way Luke never did with Vader, and not even to mention a goofy scene more at home in a cape film than befitting and aging General/Princess.The fight choreography is a mix of good, bland, to outright terrible (the guards in the throne room spend half their time dancing around and taking turns to fight). Snoke turned out to be a joke and 'decoy' main villian, which is the least interesting choice they could have made.Rey, whom I actually like in TFA and considered the accusations of being a mary sue a stretch, it turns out is really the greatest force prodigy ever whom with even less training than Luke on Degobah can crack cliffs in meditation, duel as though defending yourself with a junk staff directly translates to being a swordsman of the highest skill, and lifting massive rocks with as much ease as Yoda and Palpatine (the peaks of force ability) did with the senate podiums. Finn seemed to be barely present. Poe had some interesting moments, but overall, didn't live up to the interest he generated in TFA.   Really, the sole 'redeeming' (in that it stopped me from actively walking out) element of this trainwreck was Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. Revealed to basically be an abandoned abuse victim (who believes his uncle, the great and legendary Luke Skywalker, intended to murder him in his bed after being sent to him for help. Tell me THAT isn't a formative experience that makes becoming a darksider understandable.) who feels alone and abandoned (and projects HARD onto Rey), and whom they are clearly and blatantly signalling the redemption of. By the end of the movie he is effectively what dark Anakin Skywalker aspired to, leading 'his new Empire', intending to bring peace and security to the galaxy. With Adam Driver's performance and presence, this would have been an amazing capstone to a film... set long after the original cast have passed into legend as their great-great grandchild or something. Instead, everything (and all our beloved heroes) are destroyed morally and physically to service his character. Even Rey seems to spend the majority of the movie motivated by him. Kylo Ren is at this point basically the main character, and while that should be a questionable thing, it turns out to see the only thing that kept me in my seat til the end.This movie is an utter betrayal of the soul of Star Wars. It destroys the legacies of heroes we grew up with in an attempt to service new ones, and ruins all of them by doing so. Nothing is sacred. I would have preferred bland and predicable over this mess. It's 'new and exciting' in the same way as going on a date with a depressive and violent alcoholic whom you knew back when they were a wholesome family man.",0
1400,"God, had to make an account just to review this movie. Simply put, sometimes things being straightforward is good. I felt like every moment in this movie was some sort of dumb twist, but dumb in the fact that it never changed anything. Oh look the bad guy is the good guy, just kidding theyre still the bad guy!! Not to mention all the extra fluff characters that didn't need to be introduced, like purple hair girl, and Asian girl who had a hard life and doesnt like rich things. 99% of the drama was created just by the main characters **** up, so when things get resolved, you don't feel like they accomplished anything.The only interesting character was Luke with Rey and Kylo kind of being okay.But they just **** all over Lukes story with the piss poor resolution.Not to mention that this movie hardly progresses the story in anyway. You could just go from the end of episode 7 directly to the end of episode 8, and the main characters are pretty much in the same position they started.God. There were some really good moments in the movie to, but they were just eclipsed by how anticlimatic the story felt.",0
1401,"Something is up with this movie, the reviews from professional critics are not lining up, leaving me highly suspect of their authenticity.  Rian Johnson gave me hope after hearing said critic's remarks, but wow was this a mess.  This movie jumped all over the place, had no real plot, many of the random tasks of the movie were dumb and made no sense, unemotional, it was all just incredibly disappointing.  I put this down with Clones as the bottom two movies.  This movie also hurts ""The Force Awakens"" for me as well.",0
1403,"A long long time agoI can still remember howThese movies used to make me smileAnd I knew if I pushed the playThat everything would be OKAnd maybe I'd be happy for a whileBut the Last Jedi made me shiverWith every single frame deliveredI can't believe what they've doneDon't think I'll watch the next oneAnd I remember how I sighedWhen they made good old Leia flySomething just broke deep insideThe day the Star Wars diedSo bye, bye things I loved as a childI've seen Chewie in the movie but the movie was dryAnd them strange new fans were typing tweets on the fly:That’s the porg that I’m gonna buy!That’s the porg that I’m gonna buy…",0
1404,"This movie had so many flaws it was impossible to enjoy it. The pacing of the film was garbage, expecting audiences to just process all the different emotions in such a short time span.For example, In one scene, Rose is grieving her dead sister, to praising Finn as a hero, to a comedic skit between her and Finn and a taser. This was all in a span of a minute or even less. How am I suppose to feel sympathy and sadness and laugh at that stupid slapstick out of place humor at the same time? Other scenes, the fluidity of the scenes and the emotions are so scrambled and abruptly stopped with the stupid sudden comedic relief that are so out of place and overdone. It's like when a character dies, and instead of grieving or feeling sympathy, they place some stupid slapstick joke to forget it even happened.Before I watched the movie, Battlefront 2's DLC Resurrection hints at the Dreadnaught ship as being a terrifying legend. But it was taken down instantly in the beginning of the movie by a single fleet. It had built up to nothing, which was a massive disappointment to anyone who was excited to see the dreadnaught in the movie.MY MAIN ISSUE. The random irrelevant killing sprees that occurred throughout the movie that had no emotional scenes or interesting story arcs. They killed off General Ackbar and acted like nothing happened. The beginning of the movie introduced Tallie Lintra who could potentially be a good addition to the story, seeing that she is an official hero in Battlefront 2, and she literally dies in the beginning of the movie, and no one cares. Snoke is killed in an instant, yet his guards showed more of a threat to Rey and Kylo. This entire movie was so inconsistent with its emotion, plot, and overall pacing, it was like it was written by children.I understand the theme, where they search for something new and they need to get rid of the old. But my god, that doesn't mean you have to kill everything and everyone and replace them with bland boring characters. So many plot holes as well. Didn't explain:C3PO's Red ArmKnights of RenWho the hell is Snoke (Who cares cause he died smh)Why did Luke turn into a force ghost, he didn't seem like he was about to perish?Tallie Lintra, if they were just going to kill her, why make her a hero with only TWO lines?I can't believe I wasted my time with this. And to make matters worse, this is all canon. They literally threw the franchise into the garbage.",0
1405,"The opening scene with its Spaceballs attempt at humor immediately took me out of the movie. Then throughout the movie it constantly feels forced, and interrupts any good time I may have been having by making it deliberately goofy. I won't waste any words, on the plot holes, those have been extensively covered. I left the movie theater feeling perplexed at what I just watched. No sense of satisfaction, no joy. I left feeling like it was such a waste. TFA, while repeated the originals formula, at least created new characters that we were excited to find out more about and gave us new characters to love and hate. This movie treats all the characters in the film, including our most beloved, as completely expendable with zero emotion. I look forward to someone from the internet doing a ""Phantom Edit"" version of the movie. There were some scenes that I really enjoyed. However, overall it makes me feel like the story is ruined and leaves me with no interest in seeing how end up. I just don't care about whats left of the characters or plot.",0
1406,"I come away from ""The Last Jedi"" feeling much the same way I felt about ""The Force Awakens,"" but a little more. These movies aren't for me, anymore. The spectacle is great, the special effects are great, the performances are mostly great, but the written material doesn't work for me. The humour, the use of characters, even basic narrative structure. Every single creative decision, big and small, felt wrong, to me. Every part of this film is the opposite of what I find dramatically satisfying. It left me feeling somehow empty. Without hope for the future.",0
1407,"A shallow, pandering cash-grab.The first scene in the Last Jedi is a completely failed attempt at humour; an exchange between Po and Hux that is clearly intended for comic effect, but falls completely flat. Unfortunately, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie as the film is absolutely brimming with poor one-liners, quips and Marvel-style eye-rollers.Characters from the Force Awakens and original trilogy have all been equally wasted here. The Last Jedi offers a plot that goes practically nowhere, with more holes in it than swiss cheese. Each character arch is more uninspired than the last - especially that of Finn. Finn was perfectly set up after the end of Force Awakens, with the potential to become an incredible character within the Star Wars universe - so what do we get? I can only describe it as a circus act, a dreadful scene on the planet of Kantobyte, with his new-found crybaby companion (Who is so completely forgettable, I can't even remember her name).Luke felt slightly out of character, and definitely did not live up to his potential as an all-powerful Jedi Master. Snoke was possibly one of the most 'WTF' moments in the film, he came and went like a fart in the wind. Where did he come from? How did he rise to the top of the First Order? Did he create the First Order? Who is he? Who trained him? Are there other Sith? Where are the Knights of Ren? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we will ever have answers to these questions, since Rian Johnson doesn't feel any of it is worth explaining.With all that being said, there are some great scenes on offer; Kylo and Rey fighting side-by-side is superb, but the few enjoyable scenes just aren't enough to overcome the sheer atrocities that make up the rest of the experience.This is not a movie for the fans. This a movie made to bolster a new generation of Star Wars films that will ultimately make a **** of cash for Disney.",0
1408,"Overall a big disappointment. The Director was given freedom to craft the story he wanted. Lucas Film didn't guide his decisions. Big mistake. He chose to throw away much of the Force Awakens potential. That's what we've all been hyped about for 2 years. Finally seeing Luke, after all this time should have been epic. It wasn't. 2 words, nipple milk. Snoke demonstrates tons of force power but dies with no explanation of how he learned his skills, where he came from, how he turned Kylo...I've already rewritten 25% of the movie and my friends think it could have been best star wars yet. But it's not. Sadly a huge potential wasted. Hope Abrams brings us back a proper ending in the 3rd film.",0
1409,"The pacing of this film is all over the place.  Comedy elements thrown in for no reason other than ""Marvel did it"". Plot holes the size of an unfinished Death Star keep your brain constantly asking, ""wait... what?"" When it worked it was entertaining, but unfortunately most 70% of the time it seemed to just fall flat.  I'm not sure about giving Johnson 3 more movies... seems like maybe not a good idea at all.  I think it's time to face the facts that Star Wars burnt out A LONG TIME AGO.",0
1410,"This was a terrible movie, and I'll tell you why:1) Lousy designs - Everything that wasn't lifted out of the OT and repainted is boring, unmemorable, and hamstrung by a lack of internal logic. Take the bombers from the opening scene; how can you even have a bomb bay on a spaceship? Do the bombs all have tiny rockets on them to make them ""fall?"" Snoke looks terrible; he looks like one of the monsters from  I am Legend stole a bathrobe from Caesar's Palace. Star Wars has traditionally given birth to some of the most iconic designs in all of cinema. The only new element which works on any level is the porg. These little guys seem to have had a clear vision behind their design and execution, and the result is both adorable and memorable. Granted, that vision was merchandise, but I'll give credit where credit is due.2) No Story - I can't even fathom trying to write a 4th grade book report on this script. So The Resistance is trying to destroy the First Order, a massive death cult with seemingly inexhaustible resources and manpower led by a mysterious and powerful figure whose personal motivations are never explained and who is now dead. His apprentice who killed him either wants to team up with Rey to rule the galaxy or murder her. Rey, who until very recently was deeply interested in learning the identity of her parents and the source of her connection with the Force, now has to decide if her love triangle with Finn and Kylo has become a love square with Rose, a rebel security guard/saboteur/pilot/social commentator with strong views about arms manufacturing. Rey also retains her title as Ultra-Mary-Sue by failing to grow, change, or develop in any way and receiving the official stamp of approval from Yoda himself, who confirms that she is indeed too cool for school. Luke is a bitter old man who establishes no meaningful relationship with any of our new characters and serves as a brief but useful decoy during the nth escape scene before literally vanishing into thin air. Bottom line: this is not a story told through the medium of film; it's a series of things that happen on film.3) The Score - This really requires no explanation. If you've seen the movie, you understand.Overall, I give this film a 3, as there is in fact a smattering of strong visuals and good performances throughout the overly-long 152 minute run-time. That said, I would not recommend this film to anyone. Were it not for the irresistible gravity well of the Star Wars IP, this movie would surely fail on its own merits.",0
1411,"There were a couple of touching scenes with Carrie Fisher and a cool fight scene with the Pratoriean gaurds.  That is where the good ends.  This movie was so profoundly disappointing, I don't think I can continue to support Star Wars. So many weird plot holes, but most problematic was the tragic way Luke's character was treated.  It is just vile that this is what the series has become, but hey at least I'll save money on no longer buying SW merchandise.  I have plenty of other things I can spend time and money on instead and I hope Disney takes note of that.",0
1412,"This is the worst Star Wars movie that I have ever seen. Attack of the Clones is better than the garbage that this film is. This film seems to be designed to clear the Star Wars franchise of any remnants of the old storylines or mythology that Lucas built. It seems that Disney and Rian Johnson only want to keep light sabers, untrained force users, and small scale imperial and rebel forces for future films. Far from feeling like a continuation of the Star Wars saga this film seems to be some kind of transition story to set up the rules for the future Star Wars films. As a fan of the original trilogy growing up and a fan of most of the prequel trilogy as an adult I left the theater feeling something that I have never felt after seeing a Star Wars movie. I was disappointed.The Force is not with this film.",0
1413,"Movie plot revolves around a ship that has run out of fuel. Finn's subplot has no relevance in the story, might as well not have happened. We learn nothing more about Snoke, he's just some evil dude, I guess. Leia does that stupid force fly thing in space.

1416,"I went in to this film with no hype towards it, I have kept away from reviews and spoilers and theories. I came out and was openly saying ""I did not like it."" This was the first time I have seen a Star Wars film in the cinema and came out saying that. With TFA second viewing I thought it was rubbish and a CGI copy of a New Hope.This one takes place a few hours or days after TFA. The resistance are continuing the fight against the First Order. Rey is trying to get Luke to train her. Kylo Ren is still a whiny emo kid. 2 Characters go on an ""away mission"" which is boring and rather forced on to give them something to do. Like I said Kylo Ren is just a whiny emo kid, but he gets that from his Grandfather. Wasn't impressed by the acting of the actress who played Rey, again. The plan the First Order has is dumb, Ade Edmondson is on the bridge of the main ship, which I can not take serious in a serious role, due to his face and facial expressions due to his comedy tv programs. This wastes no end of talent as well like Andy Serkis,Gwendoline Christie, Benicio del Toro and Laura Dern just to name a few. Not only are the actors wasted but the characters are wasted as well in some cases.It feels like some characters have done a full 180 in a matter of hours as well, there is a scene where a character is looking at screen with sadness because of the amount of lives have just been lost. Then in a few scenes later, that character is ""communicating with a bad guy"" who is targeting the area the other character and a bunch of other characters are. Now instead of that character telling them to clear the area, the character just continues to ""stare."" Well done for saving lives or at least trying. There are elements of ""comedy"" in the film, at one point I thought Jar Jar might appear just add more ""comedy."" They did not go down well in the cinema I saw it in. I will say one or two did make me smile, not laugh though.I did learn something from this film, you can become a jedi in a weekend course. The story is dull and slow. The writing isnt much better, the acting is overall meh, the 2 new leads, good comes off as wooden, bad comes off whiny. I did like Mark Hamil's performance, even though I did not think Luke would be like that and neither did Mark Hamill ""I fundamentally disagree with every choice for Luke in the Last Jedi.""Can the director be blamed for this? yes, but, it is not 100% his fault, its J.J. Abrams fault, he created all these new characters that have some sort of mystery around them and he knew he could not come up with a satisfying reveal for them, so backed away....Where did we see that before??? Cough - Lost. So not only has he ruined 1 franchise beginning with Star he has ruined 2. Disney should've come up with a solid story that makes sense and is fun, they have a heck of a lot of great (NOW) NON-CANON stuff ti take ""inspiration"" from. But no. They should've decide how to use the old and new characters better and integrate them together better instead it feels like the new characters are forced at you and going "" these are good like them"" instead you don't get invested in them as characters and dont care about them. The old characters you do care about because you know them from BETTER MOVIES. So Disney have currently made 3 Star Wars films. I liked 1 which is ROGUE ONE! The other 2 SUCK!!! I am so glad I did not go to the multiplex cinema and went and supported my local indie cinema which cost over half the price less than the multiplex.Did Disney pay critics? This Trilogy is worse than the prequels",0
1417,"Safe, uninspired plot. Cheesy tone; more akin to Space Balls than Star Wars. Disney ramming modern moral messages down your throat (PETA messages, post-modern evil/good ambiguity). A movie made by bean counters and marketing executives. Less SW than even the awful prequels.",0

1419,"Plainly put, ""The Last Jedi"" just does not feel like a Star Wars movie to me. I know many have said that it is supposed to be moving in an ""exciting"" and ""new"" direction, but I fail to see what that direction is with a half-hearted script, terribly designed secondary characters, enemies that use zero logic, and very little main character growth. Additionally, I enjoy the occasional humorous point in many of the previous Star Wars movies, but The Last Jedi is oversaturated with forced humor. Much of the humor is terribly placed inside scenes that should be keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat, not lulling them into a sense of light-heartedness and security. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, The Last Jedi is a flat, fairly bland Star Wars movie that only has a few moments many Star Wars fans will truly appreciate.",0
1420,"When searching for a descriptor for this film, pedestrian comes to mind. If you are looking for a patchwork quilt of nostalgia that blatantly grabs entire scenes from Episodes 4, 5, and 6, this is the movie for you. It seems like its creators were not interested in doing anything other than tugging at the strings of nostalgia with the hopes of selling tickets to the masses. For a long awaited movie like TFA, it worked, for TLJ, it becomes cumbersome and tiring. Every scene, and I mean EVERY scene and narrative element is taken directly from its predecessors. Master Jedi training scene with reluctant Jedi Master (ESB) it's in there; throne room confrontation with a powerful leader who pushes for the ""dark side"" (ROTJ), it's in there too; cheesy bar scene, got it; Journeying to the other side in the form of the cave of reflection while being trained(ESB), got that too. And the list goes on. When the movie attempts to be original, it only provides non-sequitur moments and characters that only confound the narrative and confuse the viewer. The movie is like a bad cover band who hopes to get you dancing by playing the tunes from your youth, but winds up failing miserably because they are horribly out of sync and out of tune. It becomes ever clear that this movie will be a jumping off point for SEVERAL franchise knock offs looking to do nothing but take our time and money with the hopes of capturing nostalgia and providing unnecessary back stories that only further confuse the audience.  Like Luke and his gratuitous milking of the beast on Jedi Island, and choking it down in one gluttonous gulp, Disney will continue to force the magic of that ""green milk"" Galaxy of nostalgia down the throats of fans who are asking, no begging, for something of substance on which they can chew.",0
1421,"This movie brought with it a lot of hype and questions that the force awakens didn´t answer. They didn´t respond to our demands. Cinematographically speaking it was good and it was a good story but the focus too much on innecesary things and humor that was good but from my point of view they had put most of the film around it. The act of luke was the mostremarkable thing of the film, but at the end because his attitude in the beginning doesn´t match with the luke we used to know. To conclude i think it was a good story but not well made.",0
1422,"This Disney failure has killed Star Wars. Not a single question was answered and everything built before this episode was not crushed, but ignored. Rian Johnson has either never seen a Star Wars movie or willfully decided to disappoint as many people as he could simultaneously. Snoke is nothing. Luke is nothing. Leia is Mary Poppins. Han died for nothing. I believe that Disney wants to eliminate the idea of heroes and villains and instead champion an idea that anyone can save the day even if you are not trained or skilled (example: Rose is a mechanic who works on pipes, but can also fly a fighter or Rey has trained for 2 days with a lightsaber and now she can defeat Snoke's elite guards) Overall terrible and yes I am salty.",0
1423,"Very, VERY disappointing. I'm not sure what the positive reviewers are thinking, especially if you compare this film with anything from the original trilogy - for example, where in the originals was there a side-plot that took up so much of the running time and ended so inconsequentially (i'm talking about Finn and Rose, in case that's not obvious, but I realise I could be talking about any one of a number of plot points)? That's just bad film-making.In any case, that's not the real issue. The real issue for many established fans (or should be) is the shockingly disrespectful treatment of the original trilogy characters and the stories in which they participated in the original films.  I doubt many people wanted to see Han, Leia and Luke portrayed as broken shadows of their former selves and their struggles and achievements rendered null and void. That's the path that The Force Awakens started this new trilogy down and The Last Jedi sets the seal on it.These are not decisions representing a 'bold new vision'.These are decisions cynically taken for commercial reasons to make the new characters seem more impressive by comparison. It's a cheap narrative device. It didn't have to be this way. There were ways to introduce new characters that would have built up their character legends without disrespecting the pre-existing fan favourites and storylines. That would have required better writing though, so maybe Lucasfilm and Disney didn't want to make that effort. The Last Jedi is, even on its own merits or as a follow-up to The Force Awakens, not a great or even good film. It's fairly bad, full of plot holes, misplaced comedy and more plot-point retreads from previous films than it seems people care to admit. As a Star Wars film and an extension of the saga to which it owes its existence, it is an unmitigated disaster.",0
1424,"The new films are making me miss Jar Jar Binks. If you want to enjoy star wars just watch the original three, don't subject yourself to this garbage.  I'd be sadder if someone else hadn't paid for me to go see it.",0
1425,"I've made a 30 minute video on the topic, but in a nutshell? The movie is full of plot holes, inconsistencies, wild leaps of logic and many instances of ""out of character"" behaviour. There's few action scenes that are both well made and serve a purpose in the overall plot. In particular, there's one action scene in the second half of the movie featuring multiple combatants engaged in melee, that is literally and figuratively, a toy commercial that serves no purpose in the plot whatsoever. Very disappointing movie. Good special effects and music and passable acting are the only positives.",0
1426,"I'm honestly heart-broken at the outcome of the movie. I was truly trying to love the movie as I was watching it, I wanted to like it, I really did. But Its not a traditional Star Wars film and it was honestly the strangest Star Wars movie I've ever seen in terms of pace, story telling and overall feel. It seemed like too many stories were trying to be told at once, and left a hot mess of a movie. Some of the best parts and reveals of the movie were snuffed out by over saturation of a side story with minor characters, or unnecessary plot twists that lead to more unnecessary plot twists. They really let us down on some of the reveals and some characters were gravely disrespected. Among it all there's a visible effort to tell a great story, with terrible, awful, over saturated execution. It really feels like additional setup for the last movie, Episode IX, instead of a standalone triumph like every other Star Wars film. The Force Awakens was a much better film, and that breaks my heart the most. I thinks we all wanted this movie to delve deep into these new characters, and all we got were more questions.",0
1427,Another uninspired copy and paste script. Some absolutely stupid character abilities. No respect for the characters/legacy. A bunch of crappy effortless CGI. Cheap humour. 3 stars for the percentage of the movie I wasn't bored. It's just another dumb movie now - the legacy is dead.,0

1430,"Wow...That was one of the worst writing in star wars franchise. -plot holes upon plot holes;-everyone act like idiots;-0 logic;-0 chemestry between heroes of the story;-obscene amount of cringy comedy;-character of Phasma absolutely wasted;-Snoke is a joke;-mary sue strikes again.I can't believe I'm saying that, but prequels don't look so bad now.",0
1431,I was disappointed with The Last Jedi. I feel they really dropped the ball. We all expected with a big confrontation between Luke and Snoke and got nothing. Snoke was the most undeveloped villain since the Wicked Witch of the East in the Oz prequel with James Franco. The space casino could have worked better if the code breaker and owner was Lando Calrissian. If this was a passing the torch to the next generation of heroes and villains they greatly missed the mark.,0
1432,"The guy with the flower symbol thing on his jacket, they just leave him behind because they find this other guy who they somehow trust to do the job eventhough they were told the guy with the flower symbol thing (which let's just realize how stupid that plot was to begin with) was the only one who could do it. The kid at the end has control of the force if you didn't catch it. He pulled the broom to him. Phasma toys sold by the thousands before the force awakens. She was HUGELY advertised and now we are to accept that she died (though it's possible that she lives despite the mass explosions). The escape ships get massacred while purple hair women sits and watches. She waits until there are like 5 left (remember, she is already on a suicide mission, just waiting for fuel to run out) before she turns to ram Snoke's ship. Luke dies why? How? He had that nice x-wing in the water to raise so he could leave the planet. If Rian wanted Luke dead, what the **** was the point of having him do that **** force projection? Why not have him die like Obi Wan? I mean, i get that dying while watching the rising sun kind of goes back to the franchise's Japanese roots, but it's like going around your elbow to get to your **** So force protects an individual from the extreme cold of space. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. Someone prescribe me with Zoloft. This movie left me more depressed than The Mist and The Road combined.",0
1433,"""Force..."", ""balance..."" - repeats Luke to his new apprentice with all of this Star Wars pathos. Are you serious?I can see Disney's devilish smile while taking money from this enormously overestimated series, turned into a bland soap-opera without any philosophy and emotional connections. It's a shame that Princess Leia got such messy and lukewarm goodbye which ""The Last Jedi"" is. It seems that no one really cared about origins of force, just trying to get rid of all the old characters instead (while still making money mostly for having the actors from original trilogy). But the most irritating thing is that the new ground and all the new characters have nothing new to add or explain.",0
1434,"Worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen! I just cannot get past how bad this movie was for the Star Wars franchise. I have watched them all and own them too and this is the first time I have ever thought about giving up on Star Wars. The only positive I can come up with is that there are some stunning beautiful scenes as far as visuals, but the rest of the movie is really bad. I just do not unspderstand these positive reviews. If you are a Star Wars fan and know anything about the characters and universe I don't see how you would like or enjoy this movie. What they have done to Luke and his character is a travesty!",0
1435,"This iteration of Star Wars isn’t even good science fiction let along a good Star Wars movie.  You can tell than RJ wanted to go I’m a completely different direction than JJA and the story suffered because of it.  I was a fan of JJA’s version as well as it was way too linear and almost no story telling. This one, I will give credit that they actually tried to tell a story but meandered so much and didn’t really either make sense or completely tie end the 3 different settings.  For as much as people chastised GL for his script writing both films were completely horribly written and directed.  Disney raped another franchise and left nothing left to be desired.",0

1439,"SadnessI'm a big fan of star wars. I have been following the franchise since 1977 and it has always brought me a lot of happiness, even in JarJarBinks times. When I heard about The Force Awakens announcement I was very happy. The film has brought me great expectations of what every fan wants to see: our heroes doing what we expect them to do. The Force Awakens brought me this great expectation. But unfortunately, what I least expected happened and I was very sad and disappointed. I wonder what logic goes on in the mind of a director like that. Why do that? Disappoint people and make them sad.",0
1440,"An overlong disappointment of a film with major narrative and structural flaws that, while priding itself on ""letting the past die, embracing the new"" actually brings very little of the new, opting instead for more superficial alterations for sheer shock-value. These failed attempts to generate an emotional response from the audience rely mostly on nostalgia rather than the film's own merits, and ultimately feel wasted since they bring no actual, deep or meaningful modifications to the core structure of the saga.A wasted opportunity.",0
1441,"For me this movie is not necessary. This thin story can be told in opening roll of Ep.IX in a few line. The direction is too comical and have destroyed the meanings of force itself. If this hadn't serial number eight, I would never pay for it. Directors have already fallen into ""D""ark side. Trash.",0

So many plot holes, **** ups with character story and direction. It's like the people who made this movie have no idea what Star wars is, or the history behind the characters they're playing with. Throw in the **** and stupid humour that didn't work in most, not all, as well as a subplot that is based on a plot hole and wastes 30min of the movie and you got a **** ass 2.5 hour waste of your evening.",0
1443,"This isn't Star Wars its more like emo Harry Potter , Twilight crap to make more merchandise to sell and use elements from previous movies and Disney-Marvel humor and continue to make as much movies as they can.

1444,"What a bad acting! What a bad screenwriting full of holes and non sense! What a lack of creativity and rhythm (the exact opposite of the very first Star Wars). What the heck?! It seems like a dummy algorithm wrote the plot of this movie. Princess Leia's floating half-death in the deep space is one of the most outrageous scene in the entire history of cinema: so ridiculous. Luke Skywalker's dyed hair and brand new cut just in occasion of his last lightsaber duel could be the second one. Rose is one of the most unnecessary and annoying character in entire galaxy after the creation of Jar Jar Binks (God saves his soul) . More than than a Star Wars sequel, it looks like a (bad) Mell Brooks' Space Balls sequel.",0

It's like that borrow the fame/fandom from OT's character, then get rid of them one by one in new trilogy and displace them with new disneyism creature",0
1448,"Horrible Star Wars film. So many bad writing and directing decisions. A huge disappointment from start to finish. This movie destroyes classic, legendary charecters, wastes the new charecters and takes everything that was moderately interesting from the previous movie and just casually throws it away. The plot relies heavily on poor or ridiculous decision making by charecters, there are no meaningful or interesting answers to any questions set up in The Force Awakens and the characterization of many of both the new and old charecters is hugely flawed. Second worst Star Wars film after The Phantom Menace.",0
1449,"this movie says a big ‘Fu** You’ to the lore and the past 40 years of Star Wars, destroy the character of Luke Skywalker and make characters like Snoke, Hux and Phasma a joke also the movie is plagued with a bunch of pathetic jokes",0

Rey doesn't get an explanation for why she is a mary sue but instead gets above and beyond mary sue status, the entry should be renamed MaRey Sue. The First Order is an AI opponent on a video game set on very easy. They apparently are a bunch of bots waiting for the order to do basic stuff. Terrible movie, and the 86% critic rating is because Disney has money, not because the movie is any good. If you cared just a little bit about the characters in the original trilogy, don't watch this garbage.",0
1452,"This was the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.  You'd have to go back to Martin Lawrence's A Thin Line Between Love and Hate to do worse.  The plot was a jumbled and pointless mess.  90% of the movie could have been cut just by making the supposed ""leader"" Holdo do leaderly things and inform her crew at least of an idea of her plan.The good:Very little.  Yoda was ok.The ships looked good.The bad:The dreadnought is getting beat down by a single X-Wing for several minutes and nobody thinks ""Hey, we have all these other ships, let's go help it since it is a defenseless cannon platform.""  The entire story ends right there with Poe's death if the First Order is more intelligent than Elmer Fudd.Look at the men in the resistance.  They look mostly ragged, worn down, and desperate:  Exactly as they should when they've been running for their lives for days straight.  Now look at the women:  perfect hair done up, make up, not even a blemish.  They were incredibly unbelievable as always.  Hollywood only sees women as decorations and plays up their parts much more than they really are.  The best female actresses in this film get 1.  put in a coma or 2.  very little screen time and then killed at the end in the most idiotic and unfulfilling fashion ever.Going back to the women, they are apparently the only good people left in the Galaxy.  Even Poe Dameron gets shown to be an overly cocky glory-whore for most of the film.  Luke Skywalker is a cowardly failure.  Finn can't do anything really and is just a guide for Rose throughout the film.  The bridge of the resistance cruiser, filled with the officers, is almost nothing but women, again with perfect hair, makeup, etc.  We get it, Disney.  You think you have the male market share wrapped around your finger so you're abandoning us to try and entice women to see your films more because the potential for more money lies in that demographic.  You're abandoning your base, though, and it'll be to your own injury.Kylo Ren had 1 bad scene in the entire first movie but was otherwise great.  In that scene, he throws a temper tantrum and looks like a 12 year old that didn't get his PS4 for Christmas.  That Kylo Ren is all we see in TLJ.  He's completely nihilistic, angsty, and craving for attention.  Adam Driver was almost perfect in the first film and almost perfectly awful in the second.  The common thread in all of this filth isn't him though, it is a movie made by a Marketing Department.Hey, Phasma is right here about to execute Finn and Rose...BOOM, big explosion, the room filled with hundreds of stormtroopers should be littered with bodies but instead there are maybe a dozen at most and...magic stormtrooper powers have now placed Phasma and 10 or so of her soldiers a football field away and in formation.  Oh, and the guy shooting at Rose never thinks to fire a single shot at Finn, even after Rose sought cover and Finn stood there as a big beautiful target.Absolutely nothing from the first movie is ever answered.  Even the question of Rey's parentage is up in the air as Ren could have been lying to her to manipulate her.  Who knows?  I don't think that's the case, but with all of the annoying diversionary writing and inverse Star Wars tropes in this film, you have no idea what is real and what isn't.  Snoke, the absolute best part of the entire film, dies while narrating his death in a Three Stooges Skit.  Good job, Disney.  You killed an amazing villain too early just like Lucas did with Darth Maul. Every single animal in the movie is designed to be as cute and marketable as possible.  PETA helped craft the Rose character and even got to write a line.  Horrible acting by several of the cast:  Daisy Ridley is just bad.  She again has a hard time keeping a straight face in many scenes and appears to be just still giddy to be in a Star Wars movie.  That shouldn't show, Daisy.  Rose was a pointless character with an awful actress.  They wasted the talents of Benicio del Toro on the most cringeworthy Deus ex Machina moment in movie history.  Laura Dern is junk.  She's never been good, but with a bad character with only 1 motivation (I'm pretty sure Rian Johnson told her ""Ok, here is how deep your character is:  You're a smug b**** the entire film.  GO!"") she's even worse.  I didn't think that was possible.The movie was just bad, folks.  The reviewers were paid off, plain and simple.  The user score is much more accurate, and that 5.3 is going to drop a LOT more as people spend more time away from the film thinking about it.  Attack of the Clones was much better, and that's an absolutely awful film that I have a hard time rewatching.  Rian Johnson showed so much talent in films like Looper, but he has no spine to stand up to the executives at Disney and that comes through every second of this 2 hour and 30 minute commercial for toys.  There is a reason directors keep getting fired from Star Wars productions.",0
1453,"I can't even clearly express how much I hate this movie. I made this account just so I can vent my hatred. This was a joke! It felt like a huge **** you, we know your gonna see it.It was an insult to the fans intelligence. I literally can not think of a worse movie in terms of failing to deliver. This was incoherent garbage. The story was cut and paste of 5 and 6 scenes with new characters that suck ass and have not been developed at all and I could care less if they all died. The only thing that could have made this movie worth watching is if every single new character was killed off. I ****ing hate Rey, Finn, Poe, The Random Chrome Trooper(that serves no point whatsoever), Kylo(a big baby **** that I feel no reason to fear as a dark figure) the General for the First Order(a joke of a character) and can we please stop with the whole women are unstoppable and men are idiots feminist tripe. Sometimes people are dumb and sometimes they are smart it isn't restricted to sex and race. This was total **** I wish I could get my money back. Also, Finn and random janitor girls entire story was useless. It did nothing but to serve some sort of PETA/evil 1% rich people talking point for the virtue signalling Hollywood left crowd. Propaganda isn't art. It doesn't make it through the test of time because it isn't honest with its story. God this was trash and it will be forgotten.",0
1454,What I expected: Star WarsWhat I saw: SJW material with lots of CGI and interracial relations. Nothing that happened on VII matters now and this is just a reset to the upcoming episode IX,0
1455,"what a waste of time weak plot, lazy acting, terrible jokes every 30s, at least the phantom menace was only 136 minutes. My head will hurt tomorow from all the facepalming",0
1456,"The whole story is just cheaply written. It uses the name of ""Star Wars"", the old classic sci-fi movie, and totally ruins the name of the classic. Starting from the beginning: 1) Luke refuses the train Rey, saying that the Jedi are arrogant and they must go extinct since they are the reason the Empire exists (there is a balance in the world: love creates hate, good creates bad etc.). Which is a rational response for me. Moments later he sees some archive footage from the 80s movie and accepts the train her. Good decision!2) In the training Luke says that the Force is not some kind of power for Jedi to play with peoples minds and throw rocks. Instead, the force is the energy that keeps the balance of the world and connects everything. In the end of the movie the force is used to throw rocks.3) The movie is mainly about the chase between the Rebel fleet and the Empire. The Rebels try to reach the planet Crait which consists an old Rebel base and send a distress signal from there. When they reach the planet, their plan is to send the Cruiser as a decoy and go to the planet with small escape ships. However, when the Captain asks ""what is the plan?"", they don't tell him for absolutely no logical reason. Because, they didn't tell anything to the captain for no reason, the captain thinks the commander has no plan and waits to die. So, he attempts to take over the ship in the last minute. The rebels fight with each other for no logical rational sensible reason.4) While the Rebels are escaping to the planet, the Hacker guy tells the Empire that they are escaping and the Cruiser is a decoy. There is a major plot hole here since the Hacker guy had absolutely no chance of knowing the Rebels' plan. From the Rebels he only talked with Finn and Rose. Finn and Rose came to his planet because they were not avare of the Commander's genius plan.5) After this major plot hole the Empire starts shooting the escape ships. THIS WAS THE PART WHERE I TOTALLY LOST IT! The Commander with the empty fueled Cruiser, calmly turns to the Snoke's giant-ass ship and does the most dumbest, unrealistic, cheaply-written thing ever in the Star Wars history. She light-speeds through the enemy ship. Yeah, she literally goes through the giant enemy ship with light speed. And voila! The giant, terrifying enemy ship is destroyed. No guns, ammo, even no fuel was used. Why use such stuff like lasers or bombs when you can light-speed through your enemies.6) Anyway, while these are happening Rey is captured by Kylo Ren and Snoke because she telephatically connected with Kylo Ren and believed that Kylo could come to the Light Side. However, later we learn that Kylo Ren similarly thought that Rey could come to the Dark Side. However, before that we learn that neither of them used Force or such power since it was Snoke who connected them via Bluetooth from the beginning. But, this information becomes unimportant since he was just cut into half by Kylo Ren. He is an evil Mastermind who caught the Last Jedi but he let Kylo Ren to kill Rey and never thought Kylo could just betray him and kill him with the light saber right next to him. So he wasn't such a bad guy after all. Who was he anyway?The other half of the movie also has it's moments but these are the things I write for now.",0
1457,"While The Force Awakens may have been derivative and had it's flaws, it was an enjoyable movie that established new characters who were fun and easy to root for. After a plodding 2 and a half hour run-time, The Last Jedi leaves those characters at nearly an identical spot to which they started, only now with a sense of apathy from the audience.This is not a good movie. This will be kept spoiler free, which will keep things shorter, as there is no need to get into specifics (which could be literally every scene), but this movie suffers from awful writing and structure. Few scenes are established, most characters/actions don't matter, and throughout the entire film for nearly every Rebel action you could ask, ""Why are they doing this again? What's the point"", and each time The First Order is on the screen you could ask, ""Why don't they just...?"". It's a shame because there are some worthwhile scenes in the films final act, but by that point all the flaws have added up to a point where it's tough to care about anything or anyone on the screen.It really feels like the Rey/Kylo/Luke story was the only idea for the movie and every other scene was pieced together around it, each created by a different person, the day before production began.The Last Jedi is not a good movie. It's frustrating to think that anyone that watches it from a critical standpoint could possibly argue otherwise. It fails as a captivating and coherent story on the most basic of levels (Writing 101 level stuff). It's not simply a story decision, or one issue people are nitpicking, there are over a dozen major plot/structure/tone issues, etc and if you want to delve further into those I would suggest reading the more lengthy spoiler reviews. Full Disclosure - I was planning on rating the movie a 4, but for some reason 4 = Yellow. I think this movie deserves a negative review, so i bumped it down to 3 to adhere to metacritic's rankings system.",0
1458,"Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney have dropped the ball... no missed the ball that JJ Abrams had lofted to them to easily hit a grand slam. Worst SW movie ever and yes worse than prequels. I expect Rian is done at Disney and Kennedy should be looked at for allowing this to be made. I feel bad for Mark who waited over 30 years just to see his character in Luke Skywalker destroyed. Hamill even said to Johnson after he read the script that he fundamentally disagreed with everything he wrote! Ummmmmmm red flag anyone!",0
1459,"If you're a Star Wars fan you should pass on this movie. The force goes from a mystical energy that guides the Jedi to plot armor and silly tricks. If you're not a Star Wars fan you still may want to pass. The story is bloated and many sequences add nothing to the plot. Kylo Ren is the only character with any development. Despite Adam Driver's great performance, it is overshadowed by all the comical missteps. A joke is forced into every 60 seconds of dialog and most miss the mark . If you thought Jar Jar humor detracted from the Phantom Menace just wait till you see this movie. Not a single scene is allowed to be serious in a movie that was supposed to the darkest entry yet. This movie is a hard pass for me and the biggest let down ever in the Star Wars series.",0
1460,"Horrendous stretched out plot. Exaggerated character arcs that don't go anywhere. Indecisive and non-sequitur subplots... Luke is a completely different character. A defeated, half-baked, wise kenobi archetype that hardly was what kenobi was to luke. Rey's dialogue with luke felt forced, repetitive, and non creative. Snoke's back story ignored.  Rey's backstory throwing into the trash. Kylo is the same jerkw ad with the same temperment that has hardly grown AT ALL from the first movie. SO much missed opportunity for back story growth, canon progression, and creative story telling.... but it completely flopped and again fed on nostalgic moments from the original.... There are redditors out there with story writing capablities 100x that of the team behind this movie... all in all 3/10... another overhyped, nostalgic, and overproduced underwritten film. damn shame :(.",0

In the end I didn’t really care much. The characters were mostly just shells to spit out lines and you could tell that the actors weren't believing their lines. The two best performances were by Adam Driver, although I get sick of his temper tantrums, and Mark Hamill, whose Luke Skywalker is just chewed up and spit out with a heavy dose of cynicism and misery. I was ready to leave when it was over. The jokes got old and the Porgs were silly.",0

Families and average movie goers might enjoy the good visuals and bad cheesy humor.",0
1471,So many bad choices and lost opportunities from the writer and director. Force Awakens left everything at a great point and bridge to this movie and they seemed to dropped the ball on everything that was expected of it. They tried to avoid what was obvious to make it unexpected they threw away all the chances to deliver on what should have been great moments. Good news is JJ will be back for part 3 and I think they knew this was going to be a let down for most fans. The director shouldn't be expecting his next 3 films to be made I don't think this will be highly regarded by fans of Star Wars. Out of 100 great moments they could have had they had about 5 or 6? Not a good average.,0

1473,"A wise guy once said that he pretty much fundamentally disagreed with every choice Ryan had made for Luke's character. And I cannot agree more to that. Same with most other major characters. Actor performances were not bad at all (even some ones were really good), but they had to work with a terribad script, full of holes and inexplicable decisions. Some sparks of genius here and there in TLJ, amazing photography for sure, and the humor does not feel out of place, but overall the plot and the film itself as a whole feels worse than even EpI. The film takes the script of a pretty good film as was The Force Awakens and throws most of it through the sinkhole. Much as the Matrix sequels did with the first film. Had great expectations, found a silly film. Biggest disappointment of the year, after the great job Disney did with TFA and Rogue One.",0
1474,"Subtle racism; unnecessary themes/subplots; a discredit to longtime fans and past Star Wars movies.  I'm not going to repeat all the obvious pros and cons from other reviews, but just summarize a few:Cons:- Subtle racism. The minorities (Black, Asian, Latino) have the most meaningless roles via a boring subplot that had no purpose other than to apparently show that another white female character had a ""better"" plan that a white male. White females are mostly elevated in this film. This continues in the tradition of TFA where Finn was teased as a Jedi to sell tickets to millions of black Americans, only to later be revealed as a ""sanitation"" worker; the white female ended up being the Jedi. Finn is still portrayed as a ""coward"" in this film. Totally disagree with white ""critics"" who say this movie is ""inclusive"". Their idea of inclusivity is merely tossing in minorities just to ""appear"" tolerant and progressive (to me, another form of racism).- The movie largely discredits many key themes & characters from previous Star Wars movies (including Episode VII). The result is that Star Wars can now be anything it wants to be, i.e. your average sci-fi movie, of which there are plenty. Instead of referring to this entry as ""Episode VIII"" it could have been called ""Star Wars 2017"".- Unnecessary politically-motivated themes. These did not ruin the movie, but hints that developing a proper story was not the number one priority.Many reviewers who praise The Last Jedi, tend to criticize ""fanboys"" for having high expectations. It's not unreasonable for fans to have certain expectations. By nature, sequential movies based on an extensive canon compels one to do so. The core fans who have invested in and sustained the franchise over the years, are the reason why Star Wars is a multi-billion-dollar business. It's reasonable for these same fans to desire to have some of their expectations met. It seems like Disney opted for cheap thrills and twists, instead of a cohesive storyline. Disney/Lucasfilm could easily have created a movie that pleased most fan types, while still having a few plot twists. Instead, they chose the latter ONLY. Any Gungan can create plot twists or unexpected character portrayals for the sake of getting cheap thrills. IMO, critics are overrating Rian Johnson as if he is another Christopher Nolan. I couldn't help but feel that Rian Johnson wanted to intentionally nullify everything that J.J. Abrams setup (almost like an ego battle between directors).",0
1475,"If you’re a SW fan, you will hate yourself for hating the prequels. Have you been disappointed when it turned out (in “Attack of the Clones”) that R2D2 has boosters and can actually fly? All of “The Last Jedi” is like that. And I d mean – all of it. Worst writing in SW canon: too lazy to build upon established mythos, it changes tone and rules to the point of self-parody. There are some good (even great) ideas… poorly executed. Meaningless dialogues go forever. Every time you think film will make a bold, interesting turn, it hits you in the face with childish humor (there are tension-breaking burps, people!), out-of-character gesture, forced and/or predictable twist… Lacks charm, heart and thoughtful message. It’s just a desperate attempt to push the saga towards easily merchandised pulp. They threw a twist after twist and all the comes out of it is that you get screwed.",0
1476,They Ruined Luke Skywalker. They Ruined complete star wars saga.I can't believe their decistion. Don't believe trailer. The Movie SUCKS. Disney needs to stop making star wars.,0
1477,"I have never been this disappointed in a movie. Star Wars had everything going for it, a solid entry with The Force Awakens, even though that movie had weaknesses, nothing to the extreme of The Last Jedi.The Dialogue banks entirely on slapstick humor, that most of the time doesn´t fit the tone of the movie. This is reminding of other Marvel movies, but is insulting for a franchise of Star Wars magnitude.The whole subplot from Finn and Rose seemed forced, because they have no on screen chemistry. The planet Canto Bight looked like it was ripped straight out of the Harry Potter franchise. It was not fitting to Star Wars at all and is easily the worst subplot of the movie.Apparently you can also drop bombs in zero gravity, but Leia manages to fly trhough zero gravity in her best Mary Poppins imitation, by what can only be described as the worst single scene of the whole Star Wars franchise.The whole plot about the escape of the Resistance from the First Order could have been resolved with simple communication between General Holdo and Poe Dameron.Luke, the most powerful Jedi that brought balance to the force is going against Jedi Codex to murder the child of his Sister Lea and his best Friend Han Solo...The much teased Supreme Leader Snoke gets no further background information, we do not get to know who he is or how he seized power. In the end he simply gets tricked by his own hubris.There are other flaws, such as the force ghost Yoda, that summons lightning and hitting Luke, it seems like the established ground rules from the last trilogies do not apply anymore. BB-8 basically gets to be a one man army, that helps to fix glaring plot holes. Captain Phasma gets send off without ever accomplishing anything. Many of these small issues can be found over the course of the 153 minutes of runtime.The movie does have positive parts, it is visually stunning and has some very visually pleasing scenes. The sound and soundtrack are again on point and the battle scenes are spectacular. Kylo Ren and Reys bond is an interesting choice and can be called the strongpoint of this movie.Overall, visually stunning action is not enough for a beloved franchise that mesmerized generatioins. The story is very weak and unplausbible, some characters do not get explored enough and new ones are simply uninteresting. Rian Johnson managed to split the fanbase with a movie that is objectivly bad at times, but also has strong points now and again.I left the cinema excited for the future movies, i left this one heartbroken and scared, what the future holds. Rian Johnson is already confirmed to lead a new trilogy. I want to remember Star Wars, my childhood, in a positive light and the direction it is threatening the franchise.This movie was a disaster and i am not sure if they can manage to turn it around.",0
1478,"The movie is a garbage. Kylo says that ""let the past die, kill it if you have to"". In fact Disney wants to do that.  Do they have to? Not really, the story does not wish that, but business does.",0
1479,"I don't get it. Why are people championing this movie? It falls short in every way. They've sprinkled marvel dust into the sacred formula. Have you seen the hobbit trilogy? Have you seen the 8 Pirates of the Caribbean films? this is just like that, full of cheesy one liners, forgettable characters and plot holes. I was very satisfied with The Force Awakens and I was so excied to see more but Disney Disneyfied the whole thing.",0
1480,"There was one sentence in the trailer,“It's Time For The Jedi To End”, that what came out at the end of movie literally by huge plot holes, hollow characters and a lost religion.",0
1481,"Somehow both lazily written and overly complicated, this movie throws away so much of the potential established by its predecessor.  The glaring lapses within its internal logic and its wild tonal swings ruin any immersion in the vibrant Star Wars universe.",0
1482,"I could spend a great length of time outlining the (many) faults of this installment, but it wouldn't be worth the time as was apparently the approach of Disney in terms of rushing the new trilogy. Left me disgusted with a terrible taste in my mouth that has completely destroyed all respect I previously had for Disney and any optimism for the future of this beloved, cherished franchise. This installment just didn't feel right and certainly lacked respect for what made the originals great and what Star Wars is/represents. I wish that I wouldn't have seen it. As a lifelong Star Wars fan who truly cherishes this franchise for the beauty and wonder that it represents (or used to), I feel betrayed and broken hearted.",0
1483,"Just a slap in the face... over and over again. Almost every story question, curiosity, or interesting character was just reduced to an insulting two and a half hour middle finger. I don't know what movie the critics were watching... I will list only a few of the many problems I have with this movie. SPOILERS AHEAD:1) Leia just randomly having force powers, being able to survive the vacuum of space, and just pulling herself back into the ship. No. No, no, no, no, no. This just seems like a writer that was too uneducated to know which Skywalker had training in the force, and then just rolled with it. It wasn't awe-inspiring. It wasn't creative. It wasn't a ""risk"". It was just bad. 2) Rey is now a character that many, including myself, just do not care about anymore, or at the very least find less interesting. WHY would you make her a nobody? The entire Star Wars story (movies) has been based around the Skywalker family. You have other powerful force-sensitive families that she could have come from. You have characters from games/novelizations... ANYTHING! But now we have no background... no interesting lineage... just this random person that is now able to compete with a Skywalker. 3) The comedy. Why are you trying to make Star Wars into some Marvel-esque superhero comedy? You set this film up to be a battle of light and darkness. The stage was set for battle, tension, intrigue, and war. Instead... we got forced, out of place comedy, random shirtless Kylo Ren, and some awkward milking scene... 4) I have no desire to see the next episode. And I don't mean this in a ""I'm boycotting the franchise because my fan theory didn't come true"" way. What I mean is, this is the first time in the entirety of my love of Star Wars that I have no desire to see the next film, because every character progression or fate that I would normally care about, I just don't. That care, that wonder, that curiosity... it is just gone. I have no interest to see where these characters go, because to me they are insultingly ruined through poor writing, and destructive regression. That is how badly the writer/director has mutilated this film. I hope that this film hits Disney where it hurts, their bank accounts. Of course, it is Star Wars, people will want to see it. But, I have already started warning friends to just wait to see it when it becomes free to stream from a service like Amazon Prime. Paying to see this trash is the only further insult that can be done to many Star Wars fans. A disappointment, to be sure.",0
1484,"The main emotion I felt after watching this movie was disappointment. To be clear, I don't usually invest my time on the internet complaining or hating on other peoples creative efforts just be cause I don't agree with their choices.The last Jedi is an exception. I'm driven by the rave reviews by professional critics to provide a counter point, and it seems many many other fans are too. This movie isn't just bad because it doesn't fit the Star Wars ""formula"", it is bad because it doesn't  fit the ""interesting and engaging cinema"" convention.The pacing and plot are flat out bad. This is not simply a matter of this movie ""Dancing to its' own beat"". The flow of the story creates a jarring viewing experience and the plot doesn't movie along with any real purpose. The story itself is strange at best, terrible writing at worst. New characters are introduced with confused motivation and no sense of purpose. (Rose, Holdo, Del Toro) Others that were introduced in the previous iteration are cut down before they contribute anything solid to the story. (Phasma, Snoke). Our new heroes seem to stagnate, especially Finn and Poe.The one exception is possibly Kylo, who is faced with some of the few moments of interesting emotional tension and is well acted by Driver. Rey, a new character I loved in TFA, is in limbo. She doesn't end up having journeyed anywhere as a character through this story. Sure she is put in some challenging situations and faces conflict, but where does it all leave her now? How has she changed or grown?Our old heroes, Luke and Leia seem stuck in a bizarre parody of their former struggles and achievements, Mary Poppins-ing through space and milking alien sea cows. Add to this a drawn out casino sub-plot replete with alien horse race getaway and a few ""wow that looked cool"" moments. I'm willing to admit, given some time this might be passable for an afternoon's distraction, maybe on the level of Attack of the Clones, but it is certainly not great cinema and far from a great Star Wars movie. The adoration slathered all over this thing by the mainstream press is beyond bizarre. Sure, much loved franchises like Star Wars are prone to be divisive, but the overwhelming sentiment of disappointment is mounting and people will question how these glaring issues have gone almost completely unnoticed by the pros.",0
1485,"Subtly bad on many levels, The Last Jedi attempts to reuse many ideas from prequels and original trilogy, but fails a most of the time. Most of the humor is not funny, terrible with timing and just distracting. The movie in general try to go in all different directions at the same time, all the time, and of course fails. It's just a lack of focus. Acting is mostly bad, writing is bad to ok, lots of inconsistencies and plot holes (like why general Lora Dern won't hyperjump into First Order capital ship as soon as she realize that rebels plan is **** up? She just watch her comrades die, ""hang there, buddies!"". Makes no sense.Luke. Ok, it's so much a real-life, old bored man, mid-life crysis, I won't use Force again thing. I don't think writers realize how much anti-star wars this kind of stuff is, but think about it - you don't watch star wars to be fed this **** you already have this **** in real life! This supposed to be flashy fights, jedi knights vs sith warriors, epic space battles, edgy adventure kind of thing.Princess Leia space swimming: makes literally no sense. Looks weird in a bad way. Quite ****-up.**** SPACE BOMBERS?!?!! **** YOU DISNEY THAT IS ****. ""Hey, we'll very slowly float above you in **** SPACE to **** DROP BOMBS on you! IT IS SPACE, THERE IS NO GRAVITY HERE, THEY WON'T FALL.There is reason we lived for 6 episodes without space bombers - cause it's retarded and won't work, got it? Just fly some Y-wings over, fire cool fast torpedoes into critical structural points of big enemy ship, finish 'em with big lances or whatever.This movie is too long, this movie falls apart, most of the characters are not interesting. Boba's Fett awkward death in the Return of the Jedi is nothing compared to how Snoke is tossed into the window, or Finn's ex. commander, or about dozen of other characters whom I can't really remember - not only their names, but also their looks.It's star wars soup opera, not star wars movie.Not enough action to be episode 5, not enough redemption to be episode 6, but enough Jar-Jar to be episode 1. or 2.",0
1487,"Ok, I have to start by saying I’m a HUGE SW fan, I grew up with this franchise and I’m happy to reboot it all. But what have Disney done. SW always had some darkness mixed in with a little humour, but this film is all laughs and sunshine. It’s a Disney movie with he Star Wars logo on it. With TFA and Rouge One I went and saw them multiple times. But after seeing this film I have no intention of seeing it again. Luke, well wasn’t Luke at all. The stupid waste of half a movie Ray and Kylo with their FaceTime conversations just added nothing to the movie. Phasma was meant to be something, instead just killed off with no character development.Leia and her Superman, I literally threw my popcorn up in the air and said WTF. The whole casino trip felt wrong and delivered badly. It all just failed. I didn’t expect perfection, but I didn’t want the typical Disney laughs a minute. I can only imagine the next film will have singing and dancing as they seemed to have missed it from this one by mistake.",0
1488,"I've never said anything bad about any Star Wars movie. I've never complained about anything, not even, not the dialogue, not the plot, not George Lucas and his special editions, not even Jar Jar Binks because I understood why these things were the way they were. I expect change, and at least every movie has tied in well with 'Return of the Jedi', until the last two. I avoided everything I could in the run up to this movie. I didn't watch one trailer, I didn't follow any news at all, bar the sad news of Carrie Fisher which was unavoidable. I had no expectations, I had no preconceived opinions or doubts or fears for the first time since I was a child. Yet, for the first time in my life, I left the theatre feeling nothing about what I just saw. I facepalmed in the cinema and I felt the discomfort of those around me. Everyone left the theatre in silence for the first time I've ever known.It appears to have an underlying message built in with the film. Which is to end everything, everything that the fans love, the Jedi, the Sith, the Skywalkers. It takes a huge dump on everything George Lucas built. It's a message not only to the fans, but to George Lucas too. It's Disney announcing their presence, casting aside and alienating the fans from before in favour of a new generation of fans. One needs only to look at how the reboot to Star Trek was handled, to make the link to this kind of handling of a franchise is JJ Abrams, the script for this movie had to get past him, it was made with his advice and input. Just like how Vulcan went up in flames in Star Trek and he started a clean slate and alienated the original fans of Star Trek there, he has done the same with Star Wars. These movies are meant to be about the Skywalker's, hence why they are all connected. With Rey, we get someone whose parents were nobody but she is somehow so strong in the force she can do all kinds with minimal training from Luke, and even defeats him in a duel. If Kylo Ren dies in the next movie, then the Skywalker lineage is wiped out, rather than being redeemed. Hopefully they won't make that mistake. Snoke's scenes are far too similar to the Emperor in ROTJ to take seriously, the dialogue is pretty much the same and then he is simply killed in an instance, so all the time people invested into his character and all the talk about how powerful he is, is simply nullified in one simple ignition of a lightsaber. Uninteresting characters come out of nowhere, like Rose, a clear marketing ploy for China which I don't mind as long as the character is relevant, but her whole storyline seems thrown in and so out of place. It's like a Sitcom with a side plot that bares barely any relevance to the main plot. Nothing seems to really tie into place. If they wanted to start fresh, why not create a whole new saga in a different time frame? Why build a new story off the backs of the movies that came before, only to make the stories irrelevant. The sacrifices characters made irrelevant. The time and energy fans invested into them are now irrelevant. It's time to move on and leave Star Wars to the next generation.",0
1489,Horrible.  Just a rehash of the original Stars Wars with little added. No plot or character development.  Basically a meaningless Jerry Bruckheimer film with explosions and not much anything else.,0
1490,"As many before me, I think this really is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. However, I don't want to hate this without explaining at least some of the things that I thought ruined this movie:1. Slapstick - This is terrible. Jar-Jar was bad, no doubt, but Jar-Jar was one single character. In this movie it seems, the whole cast and even some of the surroundings serve the sole purpose of slapstick. The worst thing, however, is that:2. Atmosphere is intentionally destroyed to fit in more slapstick. There are moments with epic J.W. - music building f.e. up to a climax that suddenly get muted or at least muffled to fit in one more slapsticky joke. wtf.3. The Empire - OFC, the empire and their understanding of warfare has never been great by any means, however, this time around it feels like the empire doesn't only make their beloved mistake of building a DS-like super weapon. It seems they deliberately try to waste as many resources as possible. Never before has an opposing force in a SW - movie acted so freaking stupid.4. Snoke is wasted - Snoke was the only villain left that got at least some potential. With this movie Disney effectively ruined their franchise. Anyhow, what about Snoke's death? WTF - he's build up to be the most powerful sith left in this universe and gets killed in such a meaningless way... How can't he notice Ren turning against him?5. Ren turning against Snoke - There are what? 3? 4? Establishing shots, showing Ren's fighting his inner chaos, making a decision between dark and light side ... sadly at least 3 out of 4 are in the force awakens not in this movie. I don't say that Ren turning against Snoke wasn't obvious, all I'm saying is it wasn't established by any means in this terrible mess of a movie.I could go on but this quite literally hurts ... I hope you get the idea.",0
1491,"I loved The Force Awakens but I just can't bring myself to like The Last Jedi. What baffled me the most is the high rating from the so called ""critics"". I mean, 93%, RT? Really?",0
1492,"As I prepared myself to be in awe of this movie, I came to a profound realization. I had built this idea in my head that The Last Jedi would be so amazing, that I almost didn't realize I hadn't seen the movie yet. Well, upon exiting the theatre, I felt crushed. Star Wars has been a part of my life for so long that I honestly feel that saying I DIDN'T like it was almost like saying I no longer love my children. I felt conflicted. It was, for lack of a better description, a mess. Non-sensical, silly where it needed to be serious, and basically everything that was once sacred was tossed to the street. The actors are amazing. The visuals are stunning. But the plot... well, what plot?I don't want to provide spoilers, so I'll summarize by saying that instead of writing a review, I feel like I'm writing a eulogy. Star Wars had a brilliant life. I believe that this was a final, gasping breath by a franchise that has lost the force. RIP.",0
1493,"The first half is a cheap copy of ESB, almost copying some aspects of it line-for-line. It begins with an evacuation. Rey, a young person from a remote desert planet, is about to learn from the last existing Jedi Master who's in exile on a hidden, watery, misty planet with rough terrain, and every second of this makes you hope that some aspect of it will be fresh. Meanwhile, Finn and his not-a-princess girlfriend goes and meets a swindler/gambler type person who sets him up with an imperial ambush while Leia is being frozen. The silver-armored bounty hunter gets the credit and reward for the imperial setup. The subordinate lord (Kylo Ren) of a dark lord (Snoke) sets a trap for the protagonist (Rey) and she goes to him and falls right into it. Sound familiar? It's exactly what happens in ESB.The second half is a cheap copy of ROTJ, almost copying some aspects of it line-for-line. Rey hands herself in and is taken to a throne room in binders with Emperor Sid-I mean Snoke and Lord V-I mean Kylo Ren. She witnesses the near-final destruction of the Reb-I mean Resistance through a patterned window. She sees the conflict within Kylo Ren and turns him onto her side and he defeats Snoke during a period of overconfidence. Meanwhile, Poe thinks that Finn will have that tracking device down, he just needs to give him more time. The millenium falcon comes down to the planet the rebels escaped to and drives ties through a trench area that just happens to look dark-reddish and mechanical and the thinking is the narrow route might destroy them. Sound famiiar? It's exactly what happens in ROTJ.What little remains of the film is unique. Luke dies due to an aneurism from using the force so much that he effectively had transformed into a force ghost and left his current existance, resulting in his vessel's aneurism and death. When he realised this he completed the transition into a force ghost. His death felt bizzare, pointless and unexplained, frankly, since nobody even killed him.There is no proper lightsaber battle in this film. Finn fights with a vibroblade. Rey fights Luke with a stick, a bit. Kylo and Rey sort of clash their lightsabers a tiny bit, but not properly. Kylo and Rey team up to defeat the Royal Guards and their vibroblades in a lengthy fight. Luke's force duplicate clashes his ghostly lightsaber with Kylo Ren, a bit, sort of. There's no proper lightsaber battle at all, yet the untraditional fighting scenes, mostly involving vibroblades, oddly leave you more satisfied than the films which had full blown lightsaber battles. How this is I do not know.The ending leaves the story in the same place it is at the start of EP4, with a strong (albeit less strong) empire and a weak rebellion. Since it's hard to follow what happens in these new films, the Republic had their home planet and government destroyed in EP7 paving the way for the First Order to win over star systems and once again become the dominant government of the galaxy with the good guys being rebels again.Perplexingly, although Leia appeared to die, she managed to survive because of her force power. It appeared to be an excellent way to kill her off given her real life death, but instead she appears to survive in the film and continues to be the overarching general of the Resistance (or Rebellion again now, I guess). And Disney have vowed not to reuse recent footage or use CGI. How they will explain that away in a way that isn't lame, without any footage of her, is as perplexing to me as it is to you, given how her son Kylo will want to interact with her. Had her actor lived though, I would not have a problem with the way in which she survived, unlike many other reviewers.To be fair, there is original stuff weaved into everything that's been redone and I'm sure there is a long list of personal achievements for the cast and crew in this film, but as a viewer watching the final product you just cannot ignore how it did a cheap copy of not one, but two previous films to the point the lines were almost identical or deliberately cringey.To be fair to Rian Johnson, he almost had no choice but to rehash EP5 and EP6 after JJ Abrams' previous film rehashed EP4. Furthermore, there is little you can do other than to repeatedly train up a new apprentice every 3 episodes and build them up the same way Luke was, while there is only one other Jedi left. In order to create original storylines, they need to re-establish the Jedi Order and the Sith Empire so there is the same capacity for originality that KOTOR and SWTOR have had.In spite of this negative review, the film was better than The Force Awakens because of the originality that was weaved in, the feeling of it being longer and the fact it didn't feel like we were rushing through it so much. Unfortunately, it was still worse than the original 6 due to the sheer fact that it is a rehash of them.",0
1494,"I'm not entirely convinced that the public version of this movie wasn't some sort of prank, or Russian-hacked re-edit of the movie the critics saw. I find there to be no way that the critics could have watched the same movie the viewing public did and come away with the reaction they had.Heading into the movie, I was excited (as I am any time I see a Star Wars movie or show, but in this case reviews were saying it was the best Star Wars movie ever). It started poorly, with the first scene feeling straight out of a sci-fi B-movie: walk toward camera, react as an amateur to something in the distance. Not promising. Between that point and the bridge being flushed out into space, all was well. Then...it started to go off the rails.In a gut wrenching moment, Kylo Ren decides not to destroy his mother. He and two other tie fighters PENETRATE THE SHIELDS (emphasis added as I feel this is REALLY important) and do damage to the frigate. Kylo backs off, his emotions intervening. His wingmen do not, and they fire their torpedoes. In what seemed to be a masterful moment, Leia looks at the audience, almost as to say ""you know what's happening. I know what's happening. Goodbye."" She is then flushed into space with other heros, but the screen was centered on her. My stomach turned in a beautiful moment shared with the audience. She was lost standing up for the rebellion. My mind would always capture her in defiance, stoic, a hero.Moments later, the force flutters around her. With no explanation, she is able to extend her hand and guide herself back to an airlock. Where others saw Mary Poppins, I saw what looked to me to be a witch riding a broom. This was horribly insulting. How can she have the wear-with-all to be basically dead and force-force herself back to life and then pull into an airlock? She couldn't have summoned the force to help prevent the entire bridge from being blown into space? I just don't understand how this was a good story decision, a good aesthetic decision, or just plain a decision. The actress DIED. The audience who loves her knows she's dead in real life. But you decided to do what doctors in real life couldn't and bring her back to life in the single cheesiest way possible? How was this a thing? How could the multitude of critics who saw this not cringe?Lets move past that. The pursuit sequence is what really kills the pace and the narrative for me. It seems clear that a narrative platform was necessary to draw the length of the movie out to allow for the more epic and enjoyable aspects of this movie, which is a shame. There was no need for this, nor the explication involved.I didn't count exactly how many there were, but there were at least 5 star destroyers with the main ship. They were doing nothing. The pursuit of two rebel support ships and the main frigate hinges on three things: lack of fuel on the part of the rebels, lack of speed on the part of the First Order due to the size of their ships, and the point of diminishing return on the power of the First Order weapons. Those three facts alone are fine. But the 5+ star destroyers doing nothing? They can't jump to light speed and come out in front of the rebel retreat, establish a blockade, and allow the main ship to go in for the kill? Were they running out of fuel too? The rebels were, so what was the plan to get to Crait? They had to limp along until they were JUST in range? But this wasn't shared with high-level staff members? So no one but Leia and the admiral knew the plan? If they had just SHARED that plan, we wouldn't have to sit through the agonizing sequences at Canto Bight. Which, from a narrative perspective, could have been saved by placing a code breaker on one of the rebel ships - a more plausible sub-plot, which wouldn't have squandered Finn - one of the best recent Star Wars characters - on a mission which had a zero-sum impact on the overall story. Canto-Bight itself was just a dull waste of time to extend this to the longest Star Wars movie ever, for poor, poor reasons. The arc caused Finn, Rose, BB-8, and Phasma into scenarios which felt like they were intentional but irrelevant fan services and did nothing for the story.Canto-Bight and flying-space-Leia unfortunately detract from excellent action and interesting storylines of Rey, Luke, Chewie, and Snoke. If time spent on Canto-Bight removed time from Snoke's backstory or explaining how Rey was retrieved by Chewie and the Falcon, then I'll be especially angry.There are additional plot holes. There are additional disappointments. But these are the best I can do in 5000 characters. I wanted to love this movie and I've been in a funk since seeing it. The Force Awakens, for all of its comparable motions toward the original trilogy, was tight, dark, added to the Star Wars universe, and left us wanting and wondering. The Last Jedi taints what was started there. I'd allow a mulligan on this movie if they could recut it into something consistent.",0

After this movie, I don't really understand what is ""the force"", I guess it can be super strong or suck...as long as the story needs it...4. ...5. ... I don't know... Well the CGI, battle stuffs are good, but mixing them together...hmmm",0
1505,"Worst Star Wars movie in the franchise.The story sucks is full of plot holes,ray is too powerfull with no Jedi training and is a very long and a very boring movie.Don't waste your money on this one,trust me I am a big star wars fan and honestly this movie sucks.",0

Why is everyone in the resistance just fine with a mutiny?)I wish I could give this movie negative points.",0
1508,"This was one of the most disappointing movies that I have ever seen. The plot was bland, the characters were poorly developed, and the humor cringe worthy to the point that it made the movie seem like it was intended to be a spoof of Star Wars. Every possible redeeming quality was promptly set on fire and left to burn. This movie literally ruined the Star Wars franchise, if you happen to be a fan avoid it like the plague.",0

This is the first SW movie i am not gonna watch again.How leia survived in space? please don't say force! it doesn't work like that. who is snoke? he is so powerfull controls ren and rey's mind but doesn't understand ren supposed to kill him. How luke projected himself across the galaxy and made a saber fight!!!! why did he killed himself? No point. he projected himself and also dice!! Unreal. SW is not like soap opera movies like marvel movies. people watch marvel movies and forget. SW is not like that, you remember it decades later. you can not put stupid jokes in it. worst jokes i've ever seen in a movie. whyyyy!!!! Also i want to say another stupid plot hole. almost in every episode good guys want to explode things like death stars etc. I didn't understand why didn't they just drive a ship to this things and crash through.. We see in this movie it is very easy to explode a huge ship just jump to light speed through it. stupidddd!!!!! i dont want to explain SW mentality but where is the shields!!!! is it that much easy to kill a super super super star destroyer? I believe now, Disney is the worst thing happens to SW franchise. Very big dissapointment.",0
1512,This movie was all over the place in terms of pacing. Nothing stood out from the tapestry of mediocrity. This is the first Star Wars movie I have ever wanted to simply walk away from. Really not worth your money or time.,0
1513,A rubbish film with a plot so full of holes it might as well be Swiss cheese.  Most of the characters are portrayed terribly and often their actions serve no purpose.  The depiction of Luke in this film is just an insult to everything he was in the original films.  They seemed more interested in pushing their feminist propaganda than they were creating a good film.,0
1514,"My opinion about the Last Jedi is that Disney Wars is no longer the epic space opera that created a generation long fan base. Cheesy ways to kill bad guys, pointless jokes and comedy, no more epic scenes involving the Force. Simple explanations to galactic forces.. If we change the name of the movie, we could say it is a good movie but this is not Star Wars, this is some space movie about ships and weak characters killing powerful characters in a retarded way.",0

1518,"DISSAPOINTING. This was prequel territory with more than abundant slapstick and shallow characters.   Much of the “new direction” did not feel fresh, inventive or satisfying.  There were a handful of good scenes but most of it felt cheap and deeply disrespectful to the original source.  TFA was a mediocre remake of ANH - but it still FELT like Star Wars.  TLJ feels more like a parody.  Like one of the main plot points, the series may have just run out of gas with no momentum into Episode 9.",0
1519,NO SPOILERS !This Disney flick is a WASTE OF EVERYTHING !RT audience score 56% !metacritic user score 5.0 !﻿The makers are such losers.Boring no emotional engagement with any of the none characters,0
1520,"As a lifetime Star Wars Fan, I never felt such depressed after seeing a Star Wars Movie. What has started really promising with TFA has been crushed completely within 152 min. Not just TFA was thrown into the garbage bin, but also the entire Star Wars legacy... What really makes me angry is that despite of the prequels, which weren't surely a highlight, it seems Rian Johnson did this with full intention. When George Lucas did the prequels he didn't knew better, but he tried as best a possible. Sure he failed in the end, but I cannot blame someone that really gave his best. Rian and surely Disney instead pissed on everything that has been created before. Just remember this magic moment at the end of TFA, when Ray meets Luke for the first time. If you have seen TLJ already you know what Mr. Johnson did with this wonderful scene ... Absolutely no respect for the work J.J. did with TFA. Also Rian continues to hype the question about Ray's parents in one scene of TLJ to the max. just to give the most unsatisfying answer later on. I could continue how Rian treated the Character of Luke, but I think it's all been said. For me personally the worst and disrespectful Star Wars ever made and the worst Movie experience so far. A complete letdown ... Please help us Mr. Abrams you are our only hope !!!",0
1521,"Utterly horrific.  Disney homonegization at its worst.  I understand how Disney audiences and critics rated it highly - one because of programming and the other because of fear of Disney retaliation.  But Star Wars fans?  Really?  Let’s literally throw away the Force Awakens climax by throwing the lightsaber over Luke shoulder.  Green milk dribbling, horrifically pointless side stories (for two hours), two of the worst EVER Star Wars characters (Laura Dern and Rose) - I can go on and on.  I don’t care that the film went in new directions.  I don’t mind change.  I like real writing.  Bring back Jar Jar (gulp).",0
1522,these critics are a F**king joke do not read into it and don't go in thinking this is a 10/10 movie.  this is 2/10.  not one second do I feel any emotional tie to any of these characters.  this was written and directed by a total... amateur and I'm not for one second embellishing.  I'm so disappointed and just plane shocked that this is what they came out with... completely lost me.,0

1524,"Bad story structure. Too long. Full of product placement. It's time for Star Wars to end.I liked The Force Awakens. Even though it was not a perfect movie, it set up story arcs that I was excited about. TLJ took a massive dump on those arcs. The movie was a mess. It not only destroyed what the previous movie created, it ruined the character of Luke Skywalker. It's pointless, inconsistent, and awkwardly tries to recreate the original trilogy by artificially resetting the universe to the same state.Don't bother.",0

1526,"I'll admit, I came for one thing: to see Luke do some awesome stuff now that he's a 9th-level Jedi Grandmaster. Instead he acts like a grumpy old hobo for almost the whole runtime. We learn that the Jedi Academy failed for unbelievably stupid and non-character-appropriate reasons. Then when the big moment comes for Luke to finally show off some high-level powers, I won't spoil it but it was... underwhelming in the extreme. And it looks like that's all we're going to get from him too.Needless to say, I was not happy walking out of the theater.",0
1527,"Just came out of the cinema and wow... I'm profoundly sad to say that I was right from the very beginning. This movie is complete garbage.SPOILERS BELOW- Luke dies by running out of chakra after using galactic kage bunshin no jutsu.- Snoke dies like a dumbass for not paying attention to his surroundings. Pelvis injury complications.- Leia flies through space like Superman using the Force.- Captain Phasma dies like Wile E Coyote.- Rey is still a ""powerful womyn"" Mary Sue who can do no wrong and needs no man.- Hand sex.- Finn and Rose got the shortest possible end of the stick.- Excessive humour in the most improper scenes.- Knights of Ren? What Knights of Ren?- Lightsaber duels? Never heard of them.- Star Wars: The Force Awakens? Never seen it, but i'll make a sequel anyway.- Plot? Pfffft. Just have some special effects and go home kid.- Broom boi.SPOILERS ENDThis is the worst Star Wars movie since The Christmas Special. I would rank it below every other main Star Wars movie. Even Attack of the Clones.﻿",0
1528,"This is NOT Star Wars. Remember when Star Wars was about the ultimate battle between Good and Evil? The mystical elements of the Force, Jedi and Sith? The heroes journey? Well, you can forget about all of that, because this movie trades all those wonderful things for Disney sitcom-tier humour and quips, boring meaningless space battles, no heart and soul, total disrespect of the lore and characters that George Lucas had created, uninteresting villains, plot holes galore, and a chase plot reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica.In short, this movie was a MESS. I can't believe I'm typing this, but it's worse than Force Awakens. At least JJ stayed true to the tone of Star Wars. I don't know what Rian Johnson and Disney were trying to accomplish with this absolute train wreck of a movie. It's time to accept Star Wars died when George Lucas sold the franchise to Disney.",0
1529,Star Wars was average and big come down from force awakens. The charm of force awakens and thrill of rouge one was missing. Some scenes were too far fetched. That’s what we got for luke???????  At best it’s one time view with no awe moments. Mostly long and dull....,0
1530,"have never felt bored sitting through a Star Wars film until tonight. Don't get me wrong, there were some up ticks in this film, but you have to suffer to get to the good stuff. The tone was silly at times and the plot devices were very convoluted. In some scenes, characters are explaining things in gruesome detail that you should know from simply watching the scene. This complete lack of subtlety makes these scenes feel forced.",0
1531,"The Last Jedi plot is trash don't believe the hype. Still haven't forgiven Disney for disregarding almost everything from the EU as ""Legends"" just so they could make room for their own **** story and characters. The prequels may have had bad acting (mainly anakin) but at least they were ambitious and built upon the Star Wars Mythos instead of whatever the **** the The Last Jedi is working towards story wise. Also you had a perfect setup from the EU with Darth Plagueis that would have connected all 3 trilogy with the Skywalkers together but nope no backstory at all....",0
1532,Sucked this movie did...lost their damn minds the critics have...ruined Star Wars Rion Johnson has...Ive never left a theatre more pissed off and disappointed in my life. This felt like being diddled by your favorite uncle for three hours then offered ice cream afterward. Every single major plot point and mystery from Awakens is wasted in the worst of ways. Star Wars has always bordered on hokey and corny but it had just the right tone to keep it dramatic and serious. Rion Johnson didn’t understand that and went full on Lucas (ep I-III) with the tone. I was waiting for a laugh track to kick in during the very first scene it was so bad. F this movie and Rion Johnson! Do not support this trash. A waste of some of the best characters of all time...the people raving about how great this pile was would probably be just as entertained watching dogs hump for three hours...,0
1533,Disney made a bold choice by using NO Legos in this Lego Star Wars movie.You came to see Star Wars? Star Wars doesn't live here anymore.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,0

Complete and utter destruction of the Luke Skywalker character, all male character stupid and useless,story/plot a complete mess, light saber duels very very bad......Save your money and see something else don't help the disney monopoly.",0
1536,"""Let the past die, and do stupid stuff."" should be the tagline. This movie deserves a zero just for what they do with Luke, or rather the missed opportunities with one of cinema greatest heroes. Watch the bland new characters participate in pointless plots while Luke and Leia are mere props for a non-existent story. The humor at first is refreshing, but soon becomes tiresome and makes everything a joke. Rian Johnson wrote a third tier fan-fiction that doesn't make any sense. Uninspired, it feels a times like a botched remix of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi without understanding what made those movies great. There is so many cringy moments, like this random kid force-grabbing a broom followed by a close up of his face watching the stars. It's long, we don't care about the characters and just keep watching for this moment we think it's going to happen that's going to make it worth it, but it just gets worse.",0
1537,"Disney just destroyed the entire star wars saga and the plot of the new characters with this film, a completely disrespect to the fans and to Luke, the most beloved character in the entire franchise.Some characters like snoke or phasma where there just to sell action figures. Star wars ended in episode 6 for me.",0

I wanted to love this as a Star Wars film so much that I was actually trying to convince myself during the movie that I was enjoying myself. Listen, this isn't about the story going in a different direction than I had anticipated. I'm fine with them doing something different, but I do expect a well-crafted, engaging story that at least respects what came before. This was just the last proof I needed that the people behind these movies only care about the money they can bring in.",0
1544,"The director is in their right to do whatever they want.  But through music themes, motifs, and other symbolism the narrative of the previous movie made a promise of some type of explanation to the audience.  That means when we watch a Star Wars movie their is no guarantee that a creator will commit to any of the promises they imply.  No implying in the previous movie then I wouldn't care, but I feel like the director had only contempt for what JJ created and promised us.  And the running teaser for her parentage?  That's 4th wall 4th grade teasing.  Just pathetic.  If they won't commit to promises, I will never promise my money to a single star wars franchise product ever.",0
1545,"In basic summation- a horrible waste of potential that not only has 0 pay off from the last film+ the two year wait, but fails at actually progressing a story. Sure stuff happened in between but nothing was answered and the situation at the very start is the same as at the end. The longest film to date literally has the smallest amount of story progression and character development.The fact that all the good parts from TFA including its mysteries and unanswered questions (snoke and rey, knights of ren? ) are thrown away after 2 minutes of screen time is disgracefulThis film has far too much time wasted on scenes with no use, the whole finn and rose storyline is shocking and it is clear there was no plan for the finn character other than to hide the fact rey was the jedi in TFA.Other than the absolutely terrible story aspects the parts of the film meant to be entertaining were ruined by the *terrible* humour that was cringeworthy and far too frequent. It sounds like im saying this for the sake of it- but this was literally an MCU movie. guardians of the galaxy set in the star wars universe. The fact that audiences love this **** makes me quite annoyed. There are 0 stakes for the characters and in this no attachment to the characters. They are so poorly developed anyway but imagine you cared for some of them--> any time they are in danger or in harms way they just make a joke and slip away. audiences love it? its ****There is literally more time devoted to the token asian girl saving horses than there is rey training with luke or snokei had this movie rated a two but have reduced it to a one thinking of the heinous leia scene.rose is literally worse than jar jar binks.I wanted to love this movie and i told off my friend for saying it was **** before i saw it. Wow I was wrong, rian johnson and all the critics raving about it cause it was ""fun"" hang your head in shame.",0
1546,I only saw it because it was free but this was even worse than the force awakens. Star Wars is now dead to me. It's just trash. There was nothing about this movie that I liked and I certainly wouldn't recommend it.,0
1547,"I have just came back from the cinema and now I know that ""Star Wars"" has ended for me.For 25 years I was watching them over and over again. I've seen original trylogy countless times.And now I know it's gone. The magic has ended...After VII, which dissapointed me a lot, I didn't have much hope.""Do or do not. There is not try"" They tried... And failed...",0
1549,"Wow. Unwatchable does not begin to cover it. I don't have anything to say about this joke of a film except that this time around, Disney must have not only paid the critics but bought them all their own private islands to have garnered such reviews. To true Star Wars fans: avoid at all costs, and Mr. Lucas, you have my deepest apologies and sympathy. Very expensive trash, and it worries me that Disney will now own 21st Century Fox, too. Will people even remember what a good film that has depth of story rather than pushes a weak and manipulative agenda is anymore in ten or fifteen years? This is junk, plain and simple. Disney has thus far tanked Marvel (compare the first X-Men film to the latest Spider-Man), Pixar (compare Ratatouille or Up to anything from the past five years), and Star Wars (the prequels were genius compared to this). Is Star Trek next on the chopping block? Doctor Who? Will they only be content after they have bought and destroyed every beloved property that has ever existed and twisted it into something crass in the name of their bottom line? Not only will I no longer shell out for Star Wars, but for any Disney-owned property. This is a disgrace. Full disclosure: Love the OT, liked in my own way the prequels (at least they had narrative and drama), didn't like TFA, not at all, but this is beyond the pale. Puerile, predictable, and clearly designed by committee or algorithm to generate the most possible profit from the least common denominator. If you must see it, wait for streaming, and make sure you don't pay extra for it.",0

1551,"What was this ? Really, what was all of this ? Did Rian Johnson even cared what questions & key plots TFA bring ? This movie is Awful. They have betrayed the character of Luke to an extend that even Mark Hamill wasn't impressed with the way the character was written.The Future of SW with this direction is now in jeopardy. Not sure how they're going to do it, but i have not liked what i saw.Kylo/Rey were great though, Poe too. Hamill played very well despite the material he given.",0
1552,"This is not a good film. The dialogue is clunky, the humour never lands and the heroes feel as though they are ludicrously invincible (Mary Poppins in space comes to mind in one of the early examples of this). The 'answers' to all the questions posed in Force Awakens arive dead on impact, suggesting that Disney/Lucasfilm had no idea what the answers were anyway when they thought them up. I liked Force Awakens and Rogue One, I went to see them more than once in the cinema and have bought them on download since. This, however, feels like a step in a wrong, missguided direction.",0
1553,"To sum up this steaming pile of horsesh*t in three words: Chaotic, inconsistent and frustrating. These wankers of pseudo cineasts had 10 years to cook something of value for the fans, they have all the money, they had countless descent materials to inspire from... and, that's all they can come up with?? this is absolutely UNFORGIVABLE, this is a middle finger to the legacy, a childhood rape of a cosmic magnitude. Disney, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson should be sued for this abomination. This movie is a force feed sh*t unconvincing propaganda, poisoned with the current Western political trends and virtue-signalling. Men are portrayed as reckless, impulsive, dumb animals and women as compassionate, rational, noetic beings; ""wooo! yaaay! masculinity is toxic, GO MATRIARCHY!"". George Lucas should've never sold the franchise to Disney, and I wish there could be some kind of petition for claiming back Star Wars to the fans or Mr Lucas and finally stop this atrocity, enough is enough. To me, the SW movies ends with The Return Of The Jedi and goes on with the Timothy Zahn Novels, the rest can royally f*ck off. This is a movie made for a specific crowd, for the Marvel audience, the fatherless generation, the low of the low, the vulgar monkeys without pre-fontal cortex trapped in unrestrained consumerism, and hopeless victims of the economic pressure, drones without sense of what is artistically valid and what is not, selfish betrayers of mankind.",0

Not attachment with characters and OMG so many innecesary moments trying to be funny. I put only a 1 because of Yoda, was the only nice moment. The rest of the movie HONESTLY I DONT RECOMMENDED.",0

1564,"Logical plot fallacies always have an 'opposite side of the coin' and you can typically accept some form of explanation. However, I get 'mentally taken out' of a movie when there are too many unnecessary 'jokes' and 'slapstick moments' within a story that is largely designed to be taken more seriously than not (OT had slapstick moments, but mostly with the characters meant for these moments and they were carefully placed). This is especially true for scenes that are supposed to highlight the lore that makes SW so great. It's fine to have comedy, but if scenes clearly designed for gravitas and emotion get their bubble popped by unnecessary, and in many cases strangely placed, comedy you start to lose your emotional investment in both film and characters. Disney and Rian take this to new heights here and it's just not for me unfortunately. This movie is for kids and teens not a 35 year old fan of the OT. I'm afraid Disney SW movies wont be the revival I'd hoped and I'll just have to re-watch the originals from time to time (although Rogue One was pretty darn good).",0
1565,"Weak structure really makes this film fall apart. At 152 minutes, the film could have packed an immense story, but decided to cram three different plots with no connection to the other. The flow ended up feeling like flying through an asteroid belt. A diversion onto Kanto Brine and meeting Benicio del Toro served no purpose than to introduce new commercial toys. It functioned no purpose on the plot, and worst of all, all new characters did nothing. In all, this film lacked any theme. It had an inconsistent tone, inserting jokes in the most serious intended scenes. Did Marvel writers stumble on the wrong project?This film felt like an insult to anyone who enjoyed Star Wars. It destroys purpose of the Jedi; the purpose of training; any sense of consistency; and worst of all, any purpose of a story in a franchise. The film literally tells the audience dressing in masks and costumes is stupid, not to look up to heroes, there is no bad or good, and most stinging of all, there is no need for reading texts or back stories. Burn all copies of this movie and refer anyone asking for Episode VII or VII to play Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.",0
1566,"Great visuals and score mixed with questionable edgelord humor, terrible writing, character assassination, and much more. This writer/director, in his obsession to subvert fans' expectations, has delivered the worst Star Wars film of all time.

1568,"What The Force awakens set up with the story and characters, The Last Jedi managed to nullify that. Everything that TFA teased was basically zeroed out by TLJ. They went a totally different direction believing that it would feel unique and different from the rest of the movies but that attempt resulted in a really problematic outcome. It didn't even feel like a star wars movie, at least not for me. They totally ruined the character arcs and the star wars myth. I mean Luke projecting himself halfway across the galaxy just to serve the plot and then just dying from Force exhaustion was just plain stupid...Not to mention Leia surviving in the vacuum of space and then force pulling herself to safety...more like a generic sci fi than a Star Wars movie. Yes the entire movie didn't feel like its Star Wars but a generic sci fi movie with unnecessary subplots and forced humor.   I really tried to like this movie because i'm a big star wars fan but they just went too far with everything in this movie.",0

I'm also wondering which film the critics have watched because it cannot be the same one I have just watched. It does not desearve the high scores. I realise that there will be new ideas, but the whole things just falls flat. The Force Awakens gave us some new interesting characters and the job of the middle film is to build on these ideas and move the story on and leave everything on a cliff hanger.The Last Jedi does none of that, it does not go onto to build the characters any further and misses the great oputunity to set up the cliff hanger for the next film. Most of the ideas from the Force Awakens are thrown away as are some of the characters. The worst Star Wars film ever?

1572,"What a perfect endcap to Year-1 B.W.(Bizarro World). This is a decent sci-fi flick...if it had nothing to do with Star Wars and instead opted to run its own franchise into the ground.""Your Snoke theory is wrong""Yup, it was really Rian Johnson all along (take out Snoke's scarring and they even look alike). Somehow worming his way into the Disney roundtable, he convinced a bunch of suits that throwing out a competent script and replacing it with his Looper style (boring character arcs and a wandering plot with no true purpose) would be the best thing to do. Well, this could've been directed by Uwe Boll and it would still pay off in sales and reviews, because Star Wars makes money no matter what (too big to fail) and reviewers always praise it no matter what. Things that The Mummy or Valerian got trashed for, is celebrated here.Anyway, here's why it didn't work for me:Plotting, character progression, continuity.--The plot is a mess, leaning heavily on what I'm sure was the main plot of a Clone Wars episode (out of fuel and running from a tech-advanced enemy), except in that episode the characters are smart enough to think their gameplan through til the end....unlike the characters in this movie.--The characters betray themselves, not only in-between movies but even in-between scenes. They only set-up the scene that their currently in, rather than feeling like living characters across the span of 2 (or 6) movies.--Continuity was completely dropped. Which is fine if this were a spin-off, but it isn't. I love the concept of ""kill the past"" especially considering the universe these people live in....but that concept shouldn't take place in the middle of a trilogy.So I find myself much less interested in the continuing story of SW, and more interested in seeing how Abrams will try to pick up the mess. For the folks harping that at least it isn't a re-tread like TFA: Crait is Hoth, Canto Bight is Jabba's Palace, Phasma is Boba, Super Saiyan Leia is Frozen Han.",0
1573,"I never thought I'd boo at the end credits of a Star Wars movie, but this was it.Because this isn't a Star Wars movie, it's some generic popcorn flick that doesn't give a rat's behind about Star Wars, the people in it's universe or the the new 3 movies.While this director clearly made a mistake of taking on a movie that was out of his league, it is Disney's fault for letting this disappointing and stupidly written movie harm Star Wars as much as it did.",0
1574,"Several days later, and I'm still in shock about what Disney has done to Star Wars with this movie. They started so well with Episode 7, but now they have destroyed everything that movie did.It's just written so horribly. I start to think Rian Johnson is just M night Shyamalan in disguise.Not anger has joined my disappointment.",0
1575,"This movie Should have been called...Gender WarsThe Last Alpha MaleThis movie was nothing but liberal propaganda. The audacity of this movie goes beyond words. We have reached a seminal moment in culture where a ideological movement has all but eviscerated a classic Sci-Fi franchise.Problems? There are many.It seems that every effort was made to destroy the base tenets the Star Wars universe was built on. The Force was silenced! Luke Skywalker, the hero of the galaxy, reappears after a 40 year hiatus- only to toss his lightsaber into the drink. He then proceeds to lock himself in a hut, only to appear to gather a drink from a four-teeted monster.This is your Jedi Knight!Now, on the other side of the galaxy you have Poe Dameron going up against a fleet of Star Destroyers, with a man named ""Hannity"" at the helm of the fleet.Hannity?Where did I hear that name before?Meanwhile, Poe's squadron is completely destroyed, with the exception of an Asian woman who heroically drops a bomb payload on one of the capital ships.You go girl!That really was the theme of the movie. You go girl! At every place you looked there were women characters in positions of power. Males were portrayed as cowardly and weak. Speaking of weak, the young black man, Finn, makes an appearance and tries to run away- again. He is thwarted from leaving the ship from a Starbucks barista, er, Choo, Annie, er... whatever!The young, corpulent Asian lady turns out to hold a pivotal role in the movie. She will ultimately prevent Finn from committing suicide to save the Republic base.Sadly, there was no heroic male to save Laura Dern, who played a startship commander, from going suicidal with a Mon Calamari cruiser.Admiral Ackbar ended up fish bait as his bridge was blown up! However!Princess Leia somehow discovered her Force powers at the most opportune time, as she floated through space after being ejected from the bridge after the explosion.She ultimately survives!And what about Rey? Who the hell is she? Apparently, just being a woman gives her enough power to master the Jedi arts. She can masterfully wield a light saber, and learn how to telepathically speak to her future revealed brother.Yep, calling it... Rey really is the sister of Kylo Ren.Speaking of Parker Schnabel, er Kylo Ren... He must have ran out of gold to mine on Kessel because he now is the strongest bad guy in the universe. It only took a quick mind trick to get rid of the great and powerful Snoke. Nice to know you Snoke!So, you off Han Solo and now you off Snoke. What does that make you? Maybe we should ask Yoda? Yoda! Yoda!Yoda appears!And says... The Force means nothing! Let me blow up the ancestral tree and books of lore! Bamn!Meanwhile, Chewbacca is relegated to eating a Porg or a pog! Wow! What a role!I do have to say the cinematography was great! That is why this gets a 1 rating.
Not to mention Luke apparently dies... The most anti-climatic ending in the history of cinema. A man who was a mighty Jedi Knight dies due to four-teeted milk overdose! That is all you need to know about this trainwreck!",0
1576,"If you think that George Lucas destroyed Star Wars and everything that made it special with his prequel movies, then the Disney-produced sequels will make you change your mind about Jar-Jar Binks, the midichlorians, and the love story of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala.The fact that The Last Jedi has made thousands of Star Wars fans sign an online petition so that this movie is removed from Star Wars canon, is telling. Even the prequels avoided this dishonor. Mark Hammill himself has complained publicly about the newest version of Luke Skywalker, saying he completely disagrees with everything written for his character, but he was forced via contract to do the movie despite his disagreement.The Force Awakens was a rip-off of A New Hope story- and plot-wise, but at least it was a true Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi however is an abomination, even though it has some great battle/fight scenes and a few interesting character dynamics (Luke vs Rey, Rey vs Kylo, and Luke vs Kylo).The main story is all about a whole fleet chasing but not catching a single big ship which can't warp its way out with its warp engines, and it includes a really stupid sub-plot (the ""code breaker in the casino"" one with Benicio del Toro) in the middle.Other than Luke Skywalker, the old heroes get limited screentime. We still got no answers about many questions raised from The Force Awakens movie, like who's this Snoke guy, and who are these Knights of Ren? We will likely never know, especially since Snoke has been killed off in the most anti-climactic way ever.What I can tell for sure is that Episode 9 will have Rey and Kylo face each other in a final showdown, but I am not sure it will even be a Star Wars movie (if only in name). I really hoped to like The Last Jedi after the controversy of The Force Awakens, but it unfortunately disappointed me.Good job dear Kathleen Kennedy, I am pretty sure next time Disney will produce an even worse movie than The Last Jedi.",0
1577,Mark Hamill was magnificent. Everything & everyone else was as expected bland or uninteresting. Carrie Fisher even managed to have the most ridiculous scene of flying like a witch with a broomstick through space!! The way they killed Luke though for no reason in such a stupid fashion means I am done with SW forever. KK & RJ can keep this trash its not SW its really bad fan faction. Sorry day for Star Wars killing the OT hero after he gave everything & the actor gave the best performance of his career to date.,0
1578,"It's difficult to know where to start.Much of the movie can be traced to nearly identical scenes from prior movies.  The Emperor's throne room scene, the Hoth battle, the flying over the deathstar while turrets shoot at them, etc.  It all feels like a huge effort to play it safe and work from a pallet of known Star Wars scenes and moments.  Think of it as Lego Star Wars.  Plug and play the same known shapes together in a different order.The humor, seemingly forcibly injected into the movie would be more at home with Starlord's crew.  It didn't sit well in the Star Wars universe.So much seems pointless.  There's a side adventure that they engage in that serves no point.  If they had never gone, nothing in the movie would change.  You could easily edit out 30 minutes of footage and the movie still reaches the same conclusion.  Which gets us to the gratuitous, bogged down middle section, with the part where Obi Wan rides a lizard through the streets and over some cliffs, I nearly fell asleep. Seriously, I was shaking my head trying to stay awake. The other side plot could have and would have been resolved by the General simply taking 10 seconds and explaining to the officers what the plan is.  I'm no fan of complicating storylines through the assumption that people are too stupid to talk to each other.There's a lot of talk in some circles about shocking moments that left them stunned.  I didn't see any.  Of all of the characters, where's the character growth? Ask yourself if Rey is any different at the end than when we found her?  Is Kylo really different??  Poe showed a smidge of advancement at the end.  Ultimately Finn is the only character going through a transformation in these movies. He has a solid arc and progression as a character.  But ask yourself...  if they edited out Finn and everything he did in this movie, would it change anything? At all?",0
1579,"It makes me sick to my stomach knowing what they have done to the franchise. It's not about disagreeing with the direction, I am sick because of the film dismantling the franchise's plot, and leaving us with nothing. No character development, story that goes nowhere, and killing off characters we never got the chance to know. The film really has no purpose. So sad Rian Johnson damaged Star Wars so deeply.",0
1580,"There is not a single character that wasn't ruined by Rian Johnson's script.Not a single scene that wasn't ruined by forced humor.Not a single death that was cheap and too early. (Except for the one death that should have happened, but was a fake out.)There are giant plot holes, the logic and dignity of the Star Wars universe was ruined, the new trilogy is totally f-ed now, and everything that was care- and sensefully set up in Episode 7 got flushed down the toilet.Disney, never let this man near Star Wars again. Otherwise please stop doing Star Wars movies.",0
1581,"just pointless really, all buildups in FTA were let downs/diffused. Canto Blight was a distraction that could have been better served fleshing out rest of story and building more tension, I was bored for most of it. Disney is trying to cram more places/characters/things in it at expense of STORY. Dont even get me started on Luke... Makes the prequels look even better now!",0
1582,"The reviews of the critics are a scam. They most likely got paid by Disney. This movie is a **** of plotholes, horrible pacing and useless subplots. This was appalling. I'm flabbergasted and mortified. Rian Johnson is a fraud. Who is Snoke? Why is Rey so strong? How did Snoke influenced Kylo exactly? Leia Poppins??? The marvel-like humour in star wars??? This is a prequel level movie. Star Wars is dead.",0
1583,"Whyyyyyy? Why we have to watch bad jokes in an unpropriete scenes? Why good character dies in no reason? Why we have to watch story about a first order cruiser chasing a rebel fleet? Why deus ex machina and cliche everywhere? J.J.Abrams, can you fix it?",0
1584,"How on earth can you make a worse star wars film then The Phantom menace? They have managed to do it. The movie is a bad sitcom comedy, the only thing missing was the fake audio laughter after a bad joke. I mean im still in shock at how bad this movie was! When looking at a movie you pay attention to the fan reviews not Hollywood. When looking at a video game review you pay attention to the critics not the fans. I wonder if the power of Disney has forced some reviewers hands as I cannot believe the positive reviews I've seen. Awful, truly awful. Worst SW film by a country mile.",0
1585,"This is the first Star Wars film to not only disappoint me, but leave me feeling deeply troubled for the future of the series. Everything feels shallow and calculated to generate headlines, from Laura Dern's token LGBT hero (who has zero personality, replaces Leia for a good chunk of the film for no good reason, and has obnoxiously dyed purple hair--a lesbian stereotype that has no place in a galaxy far, far away), to Snoke and Luke's premature deaths. If Rian Johnson wanted to divide fans, he succeeded, but at the cost of every woman and man who grew up hoping to see the day that the Luke Skywalker they knew and loved would return to the silver screen. Not even Rey comes out of this film unscathed; for all the flashy action scenes she and her adversary Kylo Ren get, there's no real character development. She's still very much the flawless Mary Sue that detractors of the previous film accused her of being: a natural-born Jedi who doesn't need training, doesn't even need to be taught the ways of the Force. A so-called feminist icon who isn't on track to be half the hero Luke ever was and there's only one film left to tell her story.Bottom line: I'm not going to see the Solo movie. I may not even see Episode IX. George Lucas made the mistake of his life selling Star Wars to Disney, and I sincerely hope that they take the sheer number of bad moviegoer reviews this movie is getting to heart.",0
1586,"A really sad attempt to bring the slapstick jokes of the ""Avengers""-Marvel Movies into the StarWars genre. As expected this fails miserably.The movie itself doesn't present any clear storyline to follow and the ""unexpected moments"" in the movie don't create a ""oh wow""-moment but rather an eyerolling ""what??"".It is incredible how much you can f*ck up a StarWars movie with  Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker... after Rogue One I was really hopefull for the future of StarWars, but for the third trilogy of the Saga the only question that remains is ""is it even worse than episode 1-3?"".+1 point for good special effects.",0
1588,"The worst episode! :( Patchwork!- Billowy act- Without actors- Awkward situations- Forced, embarrassing poems- Story telling:there are no answersSorry, but true, my opinion!",0
1589,"Decepcionado. Muchas historias con un jugo muy interesante, el cual han exprimido muy poco. Escenas pasadas de humor e ironía... Se han cargado a Luke Skywalker, y si JJ Abrams no lo remedia también a Rey y Kylo Ren (el cual no ha ganado una sola pelea siendo supuestamente tan poderoso)",0
1590,"This is not a continuation of the Original Trilogy. This is a reimagining, putting our favorite characters in utter disgrace just to make way for the new characters and egalitarianism.",0
1591,"Had gorgeous effects, some okay slapstick humor, and I didn't even hate the puff balls. I did however nearly walk out of the theater when Rian killed off the greatest villain since Vader in an anticlimactic ridiculous manner. Leia dying in space would have made for an emotional experience, but every time Rian had the chance to make the audience feel something, something ridiculous comes along and saves the day. Terrible terrible script.",0
1592,"This movie is worse than TFA; it is an example of the shabby state of the modern film industry.No character development, emotionally sterile, plotholes, terrible Avengers-style jokes and CGI action, terrible script, bad acting (Hux and Phasma).This is so disappointing and my expectations were already very low.Having been in despair after the movie, I decided to rewatch at home the original trilogy which is still 1000x better nowadays than this corporate garbage.Disney is the new EA!!!",0
1593,"Director Rian Johnson was in over his head with The Last Jedi. I didn't connect with a single character due to the lack of development. The Force Awakens was far from perfect but I found myself invested in Rey and Finn, but this time around I just didn't care for them. Rose was a laughably poor casting decision, and there was nothing interesting about Rose and Finn's plot line. Disney definitely stressed having a ""diverse"" cast, and while the cast was talented for the most part, the dialog was mediocre to bad, which should be blamed on the director. For the record, I'm a fan of Rian Johnson's previous films, but he just wasn't the right fit for this film. The Last Jedi relied on cheap gimmicks as a crutch rather than building the story on emotion and suspense.With the run time of 2 hours and 33 minutes, this movie dragged for far too long, and overstayed it's welcome. The Last Jedi is a definite black eye to the Star Wars franchise and is as bad(if not worse) than the prequels. Personally I found Episode 3 to be more enjoyable than this mess. There was just too much missed potential here.",0
1594,"What a disappointing movie.The directing was just terrible.This movie is way to silly. Remember those cute BB-8 moments from Episode 7? You have one of those every 30 seconds.And dozens of ""cute"" animals with big eyes going ""weee"" to make casual theater goers go ""Ohhhh!"".Also this movie had way to much CGI. The amount of creatures/monsters/races in this movie that are so clearly just CGI is far bigger than in Episode 1.And the action also has a lot of meaningless Micheal Bay ""Shoot! Shoot! Boom!"", like in the mindless Rouge One. Barely any action scene was built up to, so you could be invested.They just happened to have stuff blow up and people shoot.And they are flawed by making little to no sense in the events happening during them.But the worst part was the story.Not the core elements that are supposed to build a bridge between Episode 7 and 9, but what this director has done to the characters.Several characters are wasted with meaningless deaths, that had no real buid-up.So much potential was wasted, just for some quick and cheap shock moments.So many developments, situations and solutions make no sense and are the cheapest of plot devices. The actors were made to say the stupidest things, while receiving the worst directing.There are so many cheesy, generic and cringy moments and lines, it makes Episode 1 look like a very serious and dark movie.Thank god that J.J. Abrams will return for Episode 9, hopefully he can still salvage this trilogy.But I can't believe that Disney wants THIS director to make them a completely new trilogy. I hope they change their mind, if not, Star Wars ends for me after Episode 9.The overall tone and style of ""The Last Jedi"" was nothing less than the Ghostbusters 2016 of Star Wars.It's the worst of the main 8 Star Wars movies, it's not written or directed like a Star Wars movie, it wasted characters, it wasted potential, it made a mind- and senseless summer blockbuster giggle-movie out of this, it destroyed all the things that were built up in Episode 7, and it pretty much doomed this trilogy.Everything that people were afraid of when they first heard that Disney bought the Star Wars license: This movie made it become reality.",0
1596,"This is not a Star Wars movie, this a chick flick.Luke was written like an idiot, and he was thrown away like an idiot,Snoke was wasted before they could harvest anything he was building up to be,those annoying, cute penguin things were ruining half the movie,whenever the director didn't know what to do, he wrote that BB8 would have some new, unexplained super-powers that would save the day, the purple hair commander was a worse performance than anything in the prequels, Chewbacca was the worst he's ever been, the space battles were just stupidly written.And the main plot point was that this giant futuristic space ship was ... RUNNING OUT OF FUEL? Since when do then need to visit a gas station after every hyper drive jump?And how could Snoke not know about that giant tracking machine that was on it's own ship?This director destroyed the new trilogy, he took a p&$% on everything Abrams worked so hard for, and I hope that Disney will fire him.I can't believe I wasted 2 years for this. While some were applauding, I think there actually was more booing in the audience as the credits rolled.Some people try to convince themselves they like this movie, like they did when they first saw The Phantom Menace, but this will go into history books as the worst Star Wars [ever]!!",0
1597,"After seeing this film and reading all these negative reviews, the nays have it.  All of these poor reviews are justified.  Without rehashing the many things that were wrong with this film or the few things that were satisfying, let me just say there are ""A"" students and ""C"" students.  JJ Abrams is uber-talented, Rian Johnson, not so much.",0
1598,"Rian Johnson failed in character's development, in narrative's tempo, in overall logic. Rey and Kylo Ren try to bring each other on their sides about a half of the film, but in the end in a moment they just turn back. Princess Leia's fake death is hilariuos. Finn and Poe are useless. Kylo Ren's and Hux's constant hysterics are annoying. The more the newest trilogy continues, the more i appreciate the new trilogy (1999-2005).",0
1600,"It's a good movie, just a terrible Star Wars movie. It doesn't have the Star Wars feeling every movie (Even the Force Awakens) has, at all. It also lacks a lot of things people have come to expect from Star Wars movie.You have one more try to fix this, Disney. Make Episode IX great!",0
1601,"December 15, 2017 has truly become a dark day for Star Wars fans and a tragedy for movie making! The Last Jedi contains zero character development, zero story, and is by far the worst Star Wars movie of all the Star Wars movies so far - except of course for the diabolical Star Wars Holiday Special! It is truly sad to see Disney turn a film for the family into a children's movie and to render the movie history of the Star Wars Universe effectively meaningless! In essence, with every step of this movie Disney seems to be telling fans, ""this is NOT for the fans,"" while its previous installment was clearly an ode to the fans! Perhaps every member of every audience that will watch “The Last Jedi” will hope for, or be able to envision better plot routes than any of those taken by director Rian Johnson - the youngest of the children in the audience included!  The one silver lining in “The Last Jedi” is that perhaps finally George Lucas' second Trilogy, might now be seen in a far brighter light than ever before! For characters such as Mace Windu, Obi Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn and the ever popular Darth Maul and of course its amazing lightsaber duels, Star Wars Episodes 1-3 are increasingly looking to be a far superior body of work to Disneys simple kiddy flicks! Replace Jar-Jar Binks and its terrible CGI - which are gladly missing form Last Jedi - and Episodes 1-3 would have been a success! For Episode 8 there is no such simple saving solution!Star Wars has now undoubtedly lost its core fans and it awaits to see if the box office receipts follow! Surely China will have little more interest in this movie than the last one! And without the return receipts of Star Wars fans the children’s market may not be enough to save Episode 8 from a shocking underperformance!",0
1602,"So let's see here:- One of the big questions of TFA was ""who is Snoke?"" Turns out he's basically nobody and we'll never know. His only purpose was to be a Palpatine stand-in so Kylo could kill him in a redux of the RotJ throne room scene- Another question was ""Who is Rey and why does she have Jedi powers despite no training?"" Turns out she is no one special at all, and she received instantaneous superpowers because she's just a huge Mary Sue after all.- Another question is ""why did Luke go hide?"" Turns out he hid because he made a complete mess of trying to train new Jedi (in a way that totally wrecks his character) and went to go sulk by himself even though his friends needed him.- Another question was ""why is the New Republic's army called The Resistance, and how did the scraps of the Empire build a massive super-weapon?"" Well that's not really answered, but now by the end of this movie the Resistance has been whittled down to a handful of people and the FO is ascendant, so Disney has finally finished wrecking the end of RotJ and reset things to the start of ANH.I am utterly shocked with how cynical and hateful Disney's treatment of this franchise has been. They could have just made a new story with a new conflict and a few references to the old stuff, but instead they're doing everything possible to ruin the plot and characters of the original trilogy. I will never forgive them for this. As far as I'm concerned the Thrawn books are the true canon, not this pandering, cynical junk.",0
1603,Terrible character development. Disney seems to have ruined the franchise. I am not even a millenial (gen Z) here and love my star wars movies to death but lately they're not at all watchable. So much incoherent story plot. Its like they tried to fit in all the available cliches. Not to mention the absolutely horrid CGI. Why would anyone watch any new Star Wars movie is beyond me! I demand a refund.,0
1604,"First of all, I do not understand the huge difference in the score by Critics and users. Were they bribed by Disney? Did they watch Empire Strikes Back on a 4K TV and thought this was The Last Jedi they were watching? Unbelievable. They make reviewing a joke, not to be taken seriously.I am very disappointed in how Disney is treating the potentially greatest franchise there is. I admit there were a few good things in this movie, like the Visuals and special effects but Disney seems to forget the audience is going to the cinema for a good story, first of all. That is what this movie lacked. I like humor but this was so poorly done in this movie. Do you know a movie where the villains made a laughing stock of themselves like General Hugs (Hux) and Kylo Ren? The villains in this movie do not instill fear like Vader and Palpetine. God, I miss them and I hope they rise from their graves to rescue episode 9. And then Snoke, a Sith Lord! Palpetine would have felt what Kylo Ren was doing and wouldn't have been killed so easily. Who was Snoke? We will never know and please don't bother bringing him back, Disney. He never did make an impression.Then the space battles. Didn't have the Dreadnaught have shields? Such a massive ship destroyed by a tiny bomber. I don't believe it. The chase of the Rebel fleet. For Vader this would have been easy pickings, but not for Hux and Ren. I know they can't fill the shoes of Vader, but these guys are just pathetic. Then Luke. I have read all the books from the Expanded Universe (pre Disney era) where he became an interesting character and Jedi Master. What a great read that was. The Luke in this film, utterly boring, a disappointment, a lame excuse of a Jedi with lots of selfdoubt. Glad he is out of the picture.I could go on and on raving and ranting about this movie. I hope my message is clear. Disney, please sell the franchise back to uncle George. Only he can save Star Wars. Through this movie I even appreciate the second trilogy more and more. I even miss Jarr Jarr Binks.I won't be looking forward to Episode IX. I don't bother anymore to watch that movie in the Cinema unless it gets a User Score on average of 8.0.",0
1605,"That's it, I'm out, I'm done. I will NEVER forgive Disney for what they've done to this series. Even the prequels didn't wreck the Star Wars universe as much as this did, and at least they weren't just a totally cynical excuse to stuff money down Mickey Mouse's pants. Crabby old hobo Luke throwing his beloved father's lightsaber away like a piece of trash? Superman Leia flying through the vacuum of space? It was cringey and totally disrespectful of the original trilogy. Would give it a negative vote if I could.",0
1607,"I walked out. Sorry, but whilst I begrudgingly tolerated TFA's butchery of Han by turning him into an old, hobbling loser (not to mention destroying the Leia-Han relationship) what they did with Luke here was just beyond all potential fears, and totally unbelievable too. I've 2 kids, one 3 months, the other has just turned 2 y/o, and I plan on having more. None of them will ever be allowed near anything which carries the Disney brand.",0
1608,"Thoroughly meh for me. Maybe I'm just sick of Star Wars? I just don't care anymore, about the characters or the story, tbh I only watched it so that the inevitable month long RLM cash in material makes sense.Talking of making sense, spoilers... But why did the baddies spend the entire middle of the film milling about waiting for the goodies to go on adventures (which lead no where) rather than just blowing them all away? We're the goodies too far away? Couldn't they warp speed in front of them?! Also if the goodies can man an entire battleship with one person and fly it into the baddies main ship, why didn't they do that to begin with? They wait til the entire fleet is destroyed before evacuating and kamakazing their big one?! And if Luke was going to push up some flora why didn't he come along in person and do it it would have been the same result and not looked like a weird force illusion thing which was stretching the mumbo jumbo a little far already with the vision chit chats earlier in the film? Also if you're going to knock off an old member of the cast as a sacrifice why not do that with the character who's real life counterpoint has passed? Was that too distasteful? More distasteful than replacing actors with CGI zombies?Oh I don't care, I don't even want to know the answers, I don't care about the remaining characters enough to come along for 9. I'm out.",0
1610,"As a fan of SW, I can't see this movie as real canon, this is pure fan fiction with very bad decisions. I'm really disappointed, the story is a joke, it seems almost a parody of the main characters from the Original Trilogy of SW. If you're a fan of the first 6 movies made by G.Lucas, stay away from this new trilogy.",0
1611,"I couldn't wait for the movie to end after the first hour. Luke dies fighting han solos boy with fake psychic connection after he destroys jedi academy with the help of Yoda, Capt Phasma dies by falling down fighting the idoit Finn, crazy annoying ugly Asian chick like Margaret Chao (Rose) that should have been killed off immediately & then sticks around the entire movie and falls in love with Finn (lame) good actress horrible writing, luke squeezes the tit of a cartoon animal and drinks its milk (I almost walked out of the theater), Rey's parents were nothing more than drunks that sold her for alcohol says Kylo during their fight(lame) -should have been Luke & Leigh's daughter 'accident' xD Princess Leia dosent die (surprising) since she actually did die and took her real life mother with her (Debbie Reynolds). We learn absolutely nothing about Snoke when Kylo Ren kills him to save Rey by cutting Snoke in half with light saber in the middle of the movie. Really good fight scene with Rey and Kylo against the elite force (red guys) in Snokes chamber afterwards. The movie had some good parts but overall it was a train wreck of different stories jerking you back and forth. The ending was Leia escaping with Chewy and a small group of the rebels and her calling for a new beginning of the Rebels effectively ending the original star wars story, and creating a new one for children with fuzzy animals that can be sold at retailers. Star Wars is officiallly dead.",0
1612,A completely average movie in almost every way.  You could almost literally not watch this movie and not miss much going into the next movie.  So many of the characters they introduced in The Force Awakens are simply thrown away for no reason.,0
1613,"Let me start off by saying this review pains me to write. I'm 20 years old and have grown up with Star Wars. My Dad was a huge fan and took me to see episode 3 on release day. I wanted nothing more than for this new era of Star Wars to inspire and bring generations together once again. Unfortunately, my worst fears about Disney acquiring the franchise have been realized with Episode 8.    My worst fear was that Disney wouldn't understand what made the original trilogy so great. At least the prequels made an attempt to capture the essence of Star Wars. Sadly, Disney has made it clear they only care about the marketability and financial gains of their new IP. While ep. 7 was a spiritual successor to ep. 4, The Last Jedi was essentially a tone deaf, half-hearted attempt at episode 5. I've never felt the need to create an account and write a review before but I cannot let people feel the utter disappointment I felt after this movie. But on to the specifics.    - The Movie is incredibly jumpy. The movie starts where ep. 7 left off, but this time as soon as characters are reintroduced they split off. There are 4/5 separate story lines going on at any one time. There simply isn't enough screen time to fully develop nearly any of the story arcs and it shows. Luke and Rey are the only ones with any sort of meaningful character progression.    - The development of most characters is nonexistent. Fin loses any intrigue and interest gained in the first movie. They attempt to touch on the Fin/Rey dynamic but its horribly misplaced. The movie adds several completely unnecessary characters that serve almost no purpose other than to pad the run time. Fin's entire side story is useless. It doesn't progress his character, the new characters added through his story are bland and just flat out unlikable.    - The little character progression written in is flat out bad. Kylo Ren is even more of a cry baby. They try to dive deeper into his motivations but falls flat. The movie makes its obligatory 2-3 C3PO/R2D2 lines only to leave them out. The one character with any intrigue is killed off so unceremoniously its insulting.    - This is more of the Star Wars nuts like myself, but the lore is horrendously just shrugged off. Nothing is continuous from the past established lore. The introduction of B-52 like space bombers are incredibly insulting when Y wings exist. The First Order is the most incompetent, shadow of the empire you can imagine. Watered down versions of Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader ruin any sort of intimidation factor. The main criticisms of the prequel trilogy centered around how Anakin was just seemingly a whiny baby. Well bad news is that EVERYONE in the First Order is much, much worse. The Rule of 2 is just completely disregarded along with much of the other Star Wars lore in favor of pushing a more marketable and shallow line of reasoning.    - The worst thing in my opinion though is how much you can sense the ""Disney Influence"". The humor is so forced I winced several times. Rather than having several comic relief characters they needlessly force it upon everyone. From Luke to Fin to the stupid side characters they jam it down people's throats. The movie also avoids ANY meaningful hard topics or themes. It's easily the most predictable movie this year. It's a very child focused movie and that's what sets it so far apart. We begged the director to make some bold choices but I guess his idea was COPY AND PASTE shot for shot Matrix and Independence Day scenes. The movie is just so focused on selling as many tickets as possible and forcing child like themes and writings. Everything that made ep. 5 the best of the original 6 was attempted to be more kid friendly. The themes of loss, and hopelessness, and the enemies actually on the offensive is dismantled.Im sorry if this review ran on or I rambled. This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write one. I can't give this movie a 0 or 1 because there is one scene between Luke and Yoda that actually captured the essence of Star Wars. BY FAR AND AWAY the best writing, screenplay, etc. of any scene of the 3 most recent movies.",0
1614,"Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have preferred the lifeless prequels to this. At least the prequels had imagination. There are so many problems with this movie that I'll just say this entire movie is a problem. The entire movie. I mean, who **** wrote this ****",0
1615,"The film that killed Star Wars, an absolute travesty. I sat in disbelief throughout the entire film. Sure episode 7 was predictable and bland, and Rouge One had a slow first half, but both were decent, and enjoyable. Episode 8 is awful, as a lifelong star-wars fan, it's like a punch to the gut, I'm not someone with any particular agenda here, it's just a straight up horrible movie. The casting is bad, the new characters are bad, the acting is not great, the script is utter garbage and the pacing/editing doesn't help things. I wanted to like this movie, I expected to like it, but man, was it just awful. I don't think I can consider myself a star wars fan anymore, the director is an absolute dult I was concerned after hearing him moderate a panel on Blade Runner 2049 where he acted like a nervous 12 year old, but I would have never suspected he would produce a disgrace of this caliber. Disney is truly the evil empire, they have sucked out everything that made star wars special and meaningful and replaced it with cheap, stupid, pointless comic book movie style drivel. Not only is this a bad movie, its my least favorite film I've ever seen, because it is a death blow to my favorite fictional universe of all time. I cannot fathom why the critics are giving this good reviews, its episode 5 but worse in every possible way and completely pointless. Without spoiling anything, 2 characters are completely wasted with stupid deaths that leave tons unresolved, and a new character, I will spoil this, Rose, is so awful and force in it's in full cringe territory. There is no art in this movie, star wars has been reduced to an annual toy-spewing blob of low-grade action movies. An absolute travesty that truly deserves a 0/10 rating.Additionally I am convinced that there is a large group of mouth breathing zealots that will defend anything with the star wars label on it regardless of how much it sucks. The fact that this film is getting positive reviews makes me even more determined to distance myself from this brand and pop-culture in general, this is just bad, bad movie, from a bad director and a horrible studio.",0

1617,"Extremely disappointing. Lifelong Star Wars fan here. Another reviewer said that watching this made her long for the prequels, and I was amazed to find that I totally agree; (extremely) flawed though those films may have been, at least Lucas had a grand vision. Here there are only fleeting glimpses of the old Star Wars magic, drowned in a stupefying story whose central crisis makes little sense and which sends the interesting characters from Force Awakens off in bizarre and pointless directions or doesn't meaningfully send them in any new direction at all. Questions raised in Force Awakens are blithely cut up and laughed at in this movie. And god, don't get me started on the downright insultingly lowbrow Marvel-esque attempts at humor. The most difficult thing to see was what was done with Luke. In an interview, Mark Hamill said his first response on reading the script was that he ""fundamentally disagreed with every single choice Rian Johnson made as to Luke Skywalker."" On seeing this film fans of the original trilogy will sadly learn that that wasn't just Mark making fun chit chat with the interviewer.",0
1618,"This movie was an embarrassment to the franchise, can we pretend it didn’t happen and try again?  They got EVERYTHING wrong.  We need a script that’s more concerned about a riveting story and less about social justice and diversity.",0
1619,"Not a review, but honest opinion: This movie is overall really, really disappointing.+1 for the visual effects and +1 for good character acting. That`s it basically. Everything else more or less stupid and disappainting.",0
1620,"Where to start? The amount of plot holes? The uselessness of 70% of the plot? The lines? The length? They need JJ Abrams.  Production and the actors were great, but that was it.",0
1621,"The only true reference to Star Wars is found in the title. Simply put, this movie is pure garbage, disguised under the popular moniker. This film clearly wanted to separate its story from its predecessor (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), and in doing so eliminated what made Star Wars great in the first place; good vs. evil. The plot twisted through a number of storylines that varied in tone from one another, all the while refusing to give any screen weight to a defined villain. You could argue the mysterious Snoke is the main antagonist, but he remains too mysterious. There is no explanation of who he is and his demise is about as predictable as they come. And who is the real hero of the story? Your guess will be as good as mine. There is no defined hero, unless you consider the lazy storyline of Luke Skywalker to be the main draw. But the protagonists from the previous film, Rey, Finn, and Poe are all separated through most of the story, and their individual journeys couldn’t be more different or tonally busting from on another. Intermixed you will find miscellaneous characters who are given more weight than necessary, including Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), & DJ (Benicio Del Toro). All three of these characters could have easily been scrapped from the story and the audience would have been none the wiser. And sadly, if you came to see a wll crafted film, you’ll be tacking on another disappointment. Disney handed the reigns to director Rian Johnson, who is clearly caught up in his own story and personal nostalgic feel, rather than even trying to understand how to direct a film of this caliber. A Star Wars film is ripe for technical achievments, and this movie is void of most of it. And don’t even get me started on the “lightsaber battles.” The only sound decision Rian Johnson makes this entire film involves a green puppet. At least Johnson won’t be around for the next installment and we can only hope it’s anything but this mess.",0
1622,"Rian Johnson doesn't get that SW is about the trio. He cared so much about redeeming a man who killed his father on his redemption #1 that he destroyed Luke's character. Poe and Rey were horribly out of character, too. Finn, the male lead of the movie, was sidelined to hell and back. I love SW more than anything but I won't be paying for another SW movie directed by Rian Johnson. I had been counting down the days to TLJ for months but watching it was depressing. I watched it again today to be sure about how I really felt about it and it just drained me. Rian doesn't get what SW is about and has no respect for characters who aren't space fascists.",0
1623,"Doesn't follow EU canon. I've read almost all Star Wars expanded-universe books, comics, play tons of games. From my perspective this is nothing more than childish Disney fan fic that doesn't fit Star Wars Universe I used to know.",0
1625,"The worst Star Wars movie by far. Childish, awful plot and characters, terrible jokes every 5 min, poorly paced and, as expected, another movie used to shamelessly disseminate the leftist political agenda.",0
1626,"The Worst star wars movie to date. Some scenes were absolutely pointless and slowed the pace of the movie. Cringe worthy, forced comedy. Honestly, this movie sucked all the passion, wide eyed excitement of the trilogy. There were also extremely preachy moments. This is not a BOLD direction. An example of Bold direction would be Thor Ragnarok. This is not Bold. It's just pure, unadulterated, disrespectful sh**t.",0
1627,"Not sure what anyone expected with this. JJ Abrams left the continuity of the Star Wars timeline in complete shambles with his slap-dash Episode 7 two years ago. He didn't take a single bit of time to develop characters. In a trilogy, we should have already established primary characters like Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren. But they were just thrown at us in a typical JJ Abrams Generic Sci-Fi Action Flick. Rian Johnson was handed this collection of shattered pieces and was expected to make it all work.Honestly, despite some of the user reviews here, I have no problems with Johnson's work. He did the best with what he was handed. Johnson didn't destroy any original characters' legacies, that was already done back in Episode 7. Luke's legacy and the entire events of the Original Trilogy were summarily tossed aside to give us Empire and Rebels 2.0. Because so many new characters were introduced in Episode 7 (and 8), and so many plot threads left completely unanswered, it would have been impossible for ANY writer/director to manage them. The portrayal of the Finn and Poe as bumbling idiots works in the structure of a trilogy IF their characters are fleshed out in the prior installment. Again, because no real effort was made in the previous movie, the structure for these characters in this movie comes across as hackneyed.Johnson made a very admirable attempt to salvage something from the mess. Without going into spoilers, there were some genuine moments of fun and some good nostalgic feels. But there were a lot more ""What?"", ""Wait, but didn't they just... nevermind."", and ""What purpose does Laura Dern's character even serve?"" moments. It's clear that, with exception to Rogue One, Star Wars died with Episode 7. Since Episode 7 serves as the foundation for the rest of the trilogy and that foundation is flawed, nothing will save this trainwreck of a trilogy. ""Star Wars"" has become little more than a Disney cash cow. The movie equivalent of pumping out awful annual Call of Duty video game installments. I predicted two years ago that people would, by Episode 8, be looking back at Episode 7 and realizing they'd rather have the Lucas prequels again. Lo and behold! Looking at these reviews, looks like I was right.",0
1628,"I had to create an account just to review this movie. I really wanted to like this movie. I loved both The Force Awakens and Rogue One, but The Last Jedi (more like the Last Jest) left me more disappointed and upset leaving the theater than any other movie. This film is a MESS that is full of plot holes, a poor script and colossal failures. It does have some good moments but they are too few and far between the bad. How this film is being universally praised by critics is beyond my comprehension.Within the first 5 minutes of watching this film I had a bad feeling about it. Starting with the prank phone call between Poe and General Hux. This moment was what really set the tone of the movie for me, not in a good way. This is a scene with tension and stakes, but it's ruined with tedious humor and one liners. This is one of the major issues the film is plagued with. There is simply too much cheesy humor peppered into many scenes throughout the movie. Every time something emotional happens its cut off with a throwaway joke. It's overkill. I understand Star Wars is supposed to have moments of levity and humor, the original films had many moments of humor. The only difference is that it was subtler and allowed the film to breath in between these moments. The film doesn't need “DID YOU GET THE JOKE, DID YOU GET IT?” type of humor. Emotional scenes had impact, they weren’t the butt end of a joke. Another issue I had was next to nothing is answered from the Force Awakens. What’s Luke been doing for the last 30+ years? Who are the Knights of Ren? Who is Snoke? Who are Reys parents? How did the First Order Rise to power? Why ask these questions at all in Ep. 7 only to throw everything out? What is the payoff for the final scene in the Force Awakens? Not a thing. Just Luke casually throwing his old blue light saber over his shoulder like it meant nothing at all.The plot is a disaster. The major premise of this film is a chase between the First Order and the Resistance, which lasts almost 2 hrs. Apparently, spacecraft can manage light speed travel, but are still dependent on a consumable fuel source? This was never an issue an any previous installment. You’re telling me that the First Order in no way could catch up to the rebel fleet? Their ships were much larger, powerful and they had more small craft at their disposal. Abysmal writing if you ask me. Disney has all of the money and resources at their disposal and this is the best they could come up with? This reads like Spaceballs more than Star Wars.So, we are left with a heavily flawed film that literally goes nowhere. The pacing was off as the film zig-zagged from scene to scene so often I felt it was made for the ADHD generation. It introduces useless new characters (Rose, DJ, Holdo), gives little screen time to fan favorites (R2, Chewbacca) or just outright butchers them (Luke, Leia). Rian Johnson wastes any potential from previous installments and leaves J.J. Abrams to clean up the mess.The only redeeming qualities this film has are the visuals, the score and some of the performances. I did enjoy the scenes between Luke, Rey and Kylo. I felt the film should have focused more on these relationships.Other dislikes:- Luke milks a Cow-Giraffe Alien and drinks the milk like a caveman in front of Rey.- Luke doesn’t really train Rey at all. She seems to grasp every aspect of being a Jedi on her own. Her scene investigating the cavern within the dark side hole with the mirror was pointless and went nowhere.- Leia becomes master of the force in space and becomes… Superleia?- The entire section with Finn and Rose on Cano Bight was a pointless subplot that never goes anywhere. The filmmaker’s care more about having scenes riding giant donkey rabbits than developing previously established characters and plot lines.- Phasma is wasted in 5 minutes.- Snoke, apparently the main villain, is pathetic. We learn nothing about who he is or what his motivations are. Somehow, he is the all powerful dark side master but can’t foresee what’s happening. Even with Kylo manipulating a light saber inches away from him.We learn nothing, he just dies halfway through.- The character of Luke Skywalker is butchered. That’s all I’ll say on this.",0

1630,"One out of Ten (iv just watched it again and its worst a second time around), and that's only for actors Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (they were heartbroken with the portrayal of their characters that Johnson - supported by Kennedy -wrote for them, they were completely the opposite to there characterization established in the previous films - and currently running Canonical Marval comics - being essentially Anti-Luke and Anti-Leia, same for Yoda that any Star Wars fan can see) the completely wrong tone - and its not hidden through out the story - for a Star Wars movie (due to the injecting of Left Wing Marxist Socialist ideology and Contemporary SJW left wing feminism into any film is awful, this is aimed a kids, their is something rotten at the core of Disney-Lucasfilms, using Star Wars - and the present run of Marval Superhero comics IE Captain America, Captain Marval and Ms Marval for examples) as vehicles to give voice to and try to normalize such fascist ideology's.

You Cannot Make A Starwars Movie Like a Avengers Movie.Yes Maybe İt is profitable in short term but in the long term it is turning a disaster for your company.",0
1632,"Stars Wars: The Last Jedi is the worst movie to come out of the franchise. There is an overabundance of cheap laughs uncharacteristic of a Star Wars movie. These take up an exceedingly large amount of time that could have been used developing an underwhelming plot. On the topic of plot, no plot lines from The Force Awakens are promisingly fulfilled, many of them outright ignored; most if not all of the ones that were addressed are just blankly cut off in the most mundane ways possible. Instead of a fulfilling continuation (of a trilogy admittedly off to a bad start), we get even more random plot lines, plot holes, and blatant ""Screw You's"" from Rian Johnson and the writing staff.No character comes out of this movie looking better, besides somewhat Kylo Ren. In no surprising fashion, Rey has been confirmed to be the greatest Mary Sue possible. Luke has completely regressed as a character. Every character's actions and decisions throw away consistency, and many of them just don't make any logical sense. There are some blatant throw-in's for identity politics as well.It's honestly just astonishing at how much screen time was wasted; how many plot holes were introduced; how mundanely plot lines were wrapped up (or outright ignored), and how awful the characterization was. Acting was great, as was visuals and music; all expected of a Star Wars movie.",0
1633,"What the hell did I just watch? This is the beginning of the end for Star Wars. They are trying to milk this cow instead of focusing on what makes Star Wars, Star Wars.",0
1634,Ultimate letdown was my immediate reaction to the film.  It is more irredeemable than Darth Vader.  Incredibly poor character development with little to no plot development.  The film focuses on forced humor and sight gags at the expense of advancing the story or developing the backgrounds of the characters.  I have not been this disappointed since the Matrix sequel.  It will take a lot to save this trilogy in Episode IX and my expectations will be very low for that film.,0
1635,"The movie was poorly written with so much potential for the characters thrown away for no reason. Overloaded with slapstick comedy and pushing Disney's agenda down our throats every 15 mins (example: some dumb alien penguins appearing all the time, that were there for a sole reason of selling toys). I don't know what had all the critics watched, but this movie sure doesn't deserve the praise it is getting.",0
1636,"The plot doesn't make sense. It seems like a hodgepodge of scenes with no integrity. It's as if the plot is there not to tell a good story, but to plug in some ""cool"" scenes. It all feels forced and jagged. Poe Dameron comes out as a retard, and so does Luke. Not to mention that the attempt to blur lines between good and evil is opposed to the very essence of Star Wars. Suggesting that only weapon dealers get something out of war? No! The entire Galaxy gets a great value from fighting for liberty! But in this movie nobody wants to help the Resistance and fight for freedom. On the other hand, everybody in the movie acts irrationally and sacrifices his or her life without any real need. This is a disgusting film reveling in nihilism, destroying heroes and all that is good, not to be replaced with some better, but for the sake of destruction itself. This movie reflects the sad state of the West today.﻿",0

1638,"Made an account just to review this. Big spoilers ahead. A total, unmitigated disaster. If TFA was an adaption of A New Hope, then TLJ is the cheap Chinese knockoff version of Empire, with some ROTJ sprinkled in. Hard to believe they followed up Rogue One with this pile. I am struggling to figure out how a 2.5 hour-long film could have so little story, character development, or purpose. TFA was never going to win an Oscar, but at least it left you wanting more, and with some pretty intriguing questions to be answered. Instead we learn nothing about Rey other than that she apparently already knows everything she needs to be a Jedi with zero training. We learn nothing about Snoke except that he is disposable, and his lame death feels more like Rian didn't know what to do with the character rather than a serious attempt at a decent twist. Luke Skywalker has been butchered, and has more in common with the angsty Anakin of the prequels than the learned Jedi we saw at the end of the original trilogy. The film is littered with cringe-inducing attempts at humor and cuddly CGI critters (including crystal dues ex foxes). The entire casino scene should have never made it to the final cut, and del Toro's much-hyped DJ had maybe 5 minutes total screen time. Leia miraculously survives a huge explosions and force-jets around space, surviving the movie in order to presumably make a creepy all-CGI appearance in the next film, supposing they even have a next film thought out. Instead of well-fleshed out characters and interesting subplots, we are treated to a very rushed and very forced love story between Finn and Rose (not to mention that their entire quest is completely unnecessary, adding nothing to the story other than the ""revelation"" that arms dealers supply both sides, I guess). Plot armor everywhere, Leia has it, Finn has it (his attempt at a heroic sacrifice towards the end would have at least added depth to his character and given some weight to the film, but not in Rian's world). Meanwhile Snoke is wasted, I'm not even sure what the point of Phasma was other than to sell action figures, CGI Yoda looked better in the prequels, etc... Just a massive, all-around disappointment. One further note, on the widening discrepancy between the critic reviews and the user reviews... The Disney-Fox merger gave the company control of 40% of the box office. If you are a professional film critic, are you really going to risk access to 40% of the pre-screenings for new films by thrashing Disney's yearly moneymaker? RIP Star Wars.",0

I am sure if this script was not backed by Disney nor part of the SW family, it would have gotten a less stellar reception.  Far too many attempts at creating subplots, especially subplots that is irrelevant to the story.  Even the prequels had better attempts at plot twists vs this.  The idea that a uber powerful villain that should have had a back story that stretches prior to the prequels (given his assume age) should have been similar as Palpatine and not be killed so inconsequentially. Luke persona in the SW universe would never have tried to kill his sleeping nephew nor would have fallen into that state of depression. As powerful as Anikin was with the force, he still needed years of training and he still had his arm chopped off. How is it that Rey reads the cliff notes version and becomes an expert?I have far more issues with the film but will run out of space. No way is this equal to the tight story that empire was.  If you know Mass Effect, this makes me feel the same way as I did after playing all 3 games and then got the middle finger from EA with the 3rd ones' original ending.SW is not the SW of our youth as much as you hope it will be.  It has been commercialized like a modern pop star. It lacks the vision and storytelling of the originals.",0
1645,"Alright here it goes. I really love Star Wars and have no problem with making big changes in these movies. However they need to make sense and flow with the story line. I have no problem with surprises either. This movie was the worst of all the Star Wars I have ever seen. The actors in my opinion did a really good job. The problem was the story, it was all over the place. My biggest issue lies with the way Luke Skywalker was handled. Luke being a bad ass was snuffed out and died in the worst possible way a movie could. Luke going to an island to hide and no backstory to discuss what hes been doing, or anything makes things even worse. Luke continues to wander off and dissapear, to suddenly show up again with Rey. I like Reys character and agree with the direction they are going with her, but her character was underdeveloped as well, back to Luke. All Star Wars fans know Luke is extremely powerful and wise. This movie makes him appear to be a lowly old man who has nothing going for him, and has a pitty party. Then to make things worse, at the end of the movie, he suddenly shows up out of nowhere as a projection... Really? This is the worst part. If your going to kill Luke fine, but he dies on a rock after not even fighting Rey in real life. There is no honor in the way Luke dies, he may be giving the resistance time to flee, but hes so powerful he could have did some extreme damage to the FO. I had a bad feeling when I heard of Rian Johnson directing this movie. People praised movies like Looper, that was garbage and mostly everything else hes done. Hopefully JJ Abrahms can save Episode 9. Severely dissapointed with this movie. I will compare TFA, to this movie. When I went to see TFA, there was a standing ovation and people were really excited by that movie after it ended. When this movie, the look on peoples faces and people talking how badly this movie was said it all. There was no standing ovation, there was no clapping at all.",0
1647,"I read the Aftermath books, some of the EU, the comics, and watch the cartoons. I love Star Wars and once TLJ ended I said to my wife that was the most bored I had been watching a Star Wars movie. Even worse than some of the prequels. TFA did such a good job with Solo and Leia feeling like they were older versions of their original trilogy selves, but in TLJ Luke and (even Leia) this time around just were just new characters played by the actors we are familiar with. New characters were introduced for no reason other than to kill off somone Disney is trying to make us have an emotional connection to (why didn't Ackbar get to crash the ship, true fans would have been into it, and that plot point was used in the 3rd Aftermath book).",0

Not enough alien characters, they just replace them with colored people (seriously wtf? I say this as a brown man). This is a Marvel movie in space (and not the good kind like Guardians of the Galaxy). Humor comes at inappropriate times leading to weak drama and no gravitas. Rey is still unnecessarily powerful and overall there are no explanations for anything. Really mad at where Disney is taking this beloved and magical franchise.

But it seems the media is always praising this franchise for all it's worth, and the nerds have made it their own modern day mythological centerpiece, bordering sometimes on a religious fervor.    Here's what I do like - special effects, some of the scenes imaginative creatures, the red room where the Migraine From Hell rules the uh, whatever evil empire, and fight scenes, to a point.    Here's what I don't like:    everything else.    Am I the only mortal to recognize the lame beyond description acting and so called storyline?    This is so predictable, so cliched and unimaginative it's almost insulting.    It's like ""General Hospital"" with light sabers.    Not even otherwise fine actors like Tom Hardy (where was he?    I missed him), Benecio Del Toro, who out acted everybody in the brief time he was on screen, and others could save this script.    Just to show how predictable it was, I was positive there would be the most overused ""hero"" style line in Hollywood - ""fulfill your destiny"", and sure enough, Cranium Brain didn't disappoint.    Of course, my opinion will make no difference in this installment's success, and nobody will care what I think.

I read in several interviews now that Rian Johnson consulted every part with Disney brass to make the movie that was released and that is simply unacceptable. How so many bad decisions of poor storytelling, poor editing, and poor character development could make it into the final release screams of brand mismanagement.  Indy and Trek suffer from this same fate. Marvel is well on its way.THIS is why we are upset, Disney. Take notice and fix it.",0
1654,"This isn't a Star Wars film. When Disney took over, we all worried the films would be childish. They are now a bit too... trying. They want an up to date film for a series that revels in nostalgia. This isn't exciting at all. The death star run, Hoth battle, speeder bike runs... all iconic scenes but you just don't get them in this. The bad guys aren't bad enough either. They should consider doing an entirely different timeline. I guess this horse needs flogging some more.",0
1655,i loved looper but all the respect that this director used to receive from me has vanisheddisney threw away any care for star wars like a terrible written idiot would throw away a light saber,0
1656,"The movie is seriously flawed and the worst episode in the series. It is too long, has a weak plot, tries to hard to introduce humor and completely trashes everything from the original series. Kathleen Kennedy needs to be replaced for green lighting this trash. Where should I begin with this...- Luke is completely off base from the original character. It’s almost like Rian Johnson never actually saw one of the original movies. A disappointing end of the signature character from the OT- they drop the ball on Rey’s parents, Snoke, and any cliffhanger from the first movie. They don’t seem to matter at all which is very unsatisfying - The film trashes everything from the original series in order to be new and different and bold. They problem is it replaces those aspects with nothing. The plot is thin and full of deviations that go nowhere (casinos chase on animals, random holocall to Max Kanata just to throw her in the mix for no real reason- there are no hooks for the last movie. No Han Solo frozen in carbonite or other things that leave you waiting for more. - the movie tries to preach that “the force is for everyone not just the jedi”. Great but that’s not a movie plot! The original series was about the hero’s journey, good vs. evil, the redemption of Anakin Skywalker. This one is just some bland message of inclusiveness that anyone can be a hero. Really? Sounds like a plot developed by a commitee It seems that either Disney has influenced all the “critics” who are reviewing the film or these people are too scared to say anything bad about about the movie for fear of losing access to films from a company that controls 40% of releases now that they own 21st Century Fox. These people are like the stock market analysts who say everything is a “buy” even if the company is garbage.  Rotten tomatoes is really suspect given the different between their critic ratings (93) and audience ratings (57) are so large. Not a surprise since they are owned by Fandango who sells online tickets. Bit of a conflict of interest perhaps?? I’m sure no one will investigate that though.",0
1657,"Terrible, star wars is my favourite saga and now star wars is dead. This isn't a star wars film, Luke isn't a master jedi, look at Yoda, look at Obi-Wan how they teach to their padawans and look Luke now. Look what were the laser sword battle in starwars (Obi-wan and Quai gon jin vs Darth Maul, Anakin and Obi-wan vs Doku, Luke vs Darth Vader...) and now Luke vs Kylo looks like a street fight. And the humor, this horrible humor for star wars, it will be ok for Guardians of the Galaxy but here... no words, Finn a terrible character the history with Rose has no relevance inside the star wars universe and in the film has a lot of scenes, when Rose saves Finn with the spider **** and more **** Leia flying for the space like superman, using a space ship at light's speet to split a destroyer (why use blaster cannons? use ships) but it's not the worst this film has lost completley the star wars essence...there is not more hope for star wars fans.",0
1658,"There's some eye-catching set pieces, so you'll enjoy it in the theatre. But in retrospect, the story wastes interesting characters on literally useless side quests and meaningless deaths. The core light/dark side struggle has zero payoff as no character grows or learns anything, and we are left exactly where we started - waiting for the next movie.",0
1659,"I checked out of this movie almost midway. Some scenes were unconvincing. Princess Leia flying as super man or the cute animals with the wookie (added so Disney can sell stuffed animals I literally thought when I saw it). Others felt they served no purpose like the weird scene with the ""mirrors"" in the cave. Many scenes felt rushed like Darth Vader taking off his helmet (I was wondering why that even was important?) and the emperor being killed 2 minutes after he was introduced. There was enough storyline for 3 great movies but they pushed into one while being boring and unconvincing.",0
1660,"There's a narrative element pivotal to a good story--tension. However, Lucasfilm under Disney has thrown away any tension in this title. In the process, the producers have managed to erase every mythological background related to the past. Thus,  I've completely lost interest in this franchise. Maybe this film is aimed for younger audiences, but I'm glad for the fact that I can move on, and say goodbye to Star Wars.",0
1661,"I loved all the other movies very much and this is the worst movie of all by a million years! Here's why the 1 score;-Luke milking an alien and drinking the green cum outta it; unecessary and disgusting, who thought of that!!?? fire him!! Its going to be the mark where the good Star Wars end!..like..''hey, you remember the **** Star Wars?...uhn the one with the alien milking scene!??'' WOWWWW that suck-All the heroes are super weak, except Luke at this one moment. Dies in a boring way. Other heroes all fail miserably..why making a movie about it??-This movie goes no where; nothing is explained from E7 plus you know you wont get any real or good answer later.-Dark side isnt much dark at all and the bright side, not so good. I feel like Kylo and Ren should really work together, Kylo did save Ray!..no trust but whatever, confusing still. Bad dialogue.-New annoying that shout and does nothing else. Jar Jar bink did have an army to fight at least and played a significant role. This is just for sale gimmik but its too much ''in your face cute so buy toys''-Yoda set the fire to explain things to the old Jedi tree and say its stupid books...I mean is just that to learn the force!!?? They missed a huge opportunity to add depth to the Jedi training and origin...no explanation except old books. What a let down.-Rebel star pilot dont do nothing and no mission, except Leia making him look stupid. Another let down on a hero.-Casino scene...dont know what it brings to the movie.-Kylo is stupid and weak and so Ray, but Snoke is the joke of the century...the 'not so great Snoke' ahhahahaThe more i thnink about it, the more it deserves a 0, but I'll give it a 1 because there is some badass effect, but Star Wars is over for me. I'll wait for better movie on Jedis and Darth whatever, but not part of this stupid story.",0
1662,"I can't believe I watched the same movie as the critics. Everywhere there were glaring plot holes and lampooning of the force as we knew it. Too many liberties and too much Disney-fication makes for a wishy-washy experience unbecoming of the series. In an attempt to follow many characters, The Last Jedi is painfully lacking in character development, leaving more loose ends and WTF moments than any Star Wars movie to date. This movie will succeed because of its' name alone, even as it strikes a death blow to all that many have come to love about the universe.",0
1663,"@rianjohnson My full congratulations for making Episode I no longer being the worse Star Wars ever, by a long shot. Yes, multiple characters in your movie were worse then Jar Jar, and that says everything. You insulted Star Wars.",0
1664,"The worst Star Wars movie by far, and this is coming from someone who hated The Phantom Menace.  There are no redeeming qualities in this movie.  A complete waste of potential.",0
1665,"This entire thing is starting to feel like bland soulless corporatized fan fiction. There is no spirit. I won't post any spoilers, but the characters are just uninspiring. There is nothing memorable from this film, I feel like I won't even remember it in a month. I had this same issue with ""The Force Awakens"", it just wasn't memorable. None of the characters stuck with me. Also, the plot of this film just seems hokey and poorly thought out. I won't post specifics, but you will find yourself laughing or rolling your eyes in several parts. That's not good.",0
1666,I generally don't write any critic but too much is too much. How much critics got paid to give a good note to this movie. It was an awful experience. Its a very bad movie and an even more terrible Star Wars. The 3 points are for some scene with nice special effets and Laura Dern. But if you are a SW fan. Make yourself a service and imagine that movie doesn't exist and the last Star Wars was Rogue One.,0
1667,"This was an extremely disappointing movie. It took all the exciting mystery from 7 and just threw it all away. Instead,it introduced possibly the worst character in the series and put a useless b-plot in with mildly interesting Jedi lore. Such a disappointing direction for the series. Hopefully JJ can salvage the next one.",0
1669,"this film made me angry to my core, it felt as though star wars has become something of a parody.from acting to plot this whole film is a mess and marvel tier jokes dont even get me started wow im kinda sad right now.",0
1670,"Where do I begin? I made a metacritic account just so I could post this review.  Worst Star Wars movie to date bar none.  I can't believe the blatant disregard for the prior Star Wars movies this film has.  It feels like the writers and director decided that instead of making a coherent story with fleshed out characters they decided to just do things for shock value  even if it didn't make any sense. So much wasted potential with this film.  Can't get into too much without giving away spoilers but all the dangling plot threads from the Force Awakens are thrown out the window in favor of cheap ""twists"" and even more new characters that most people don't care about.  I will say the movie looks beautiful and Poe Dameron of all characters got the most to do in this film and the only satisfying character arc.",0
1671,"A very disappointing movie. Was not a fan at all of how Luke Skywalker's character was treated. Also, many of the characters were underdeveloped and the ending was horrible. Almost killed any excitement I had for episode 9.",0
1672,I can't beleive how bad is this movie. All important things are just ignored. Plot holes are bigger than black hole in center of our galaxy. What they did with Luke is beyond words. Star wars is officially dead.,0
1673,"I would accept this movie if it was the end of Starwars saga. It's a great finale.But it's not. This movie should be a bridge to the next episode. And it's falling down now. I really liked the idea of burning down the castle to build a new.But if you are not ready enough to build a new castle, just don't do it.This movie is focusing on twisting your expectations, destroying your childhood memory...TOO MUCH, for 2h 33m, whole time.Because of this, there is not enough time to understand all new characters. Rey, Finn, Poe and Ben... they are all good characters, performed by great actors.But still I don't know them.It may be one of the best SF movie as an original single episode.But as a Starwars movie? No.I am not angry about this movie though. I just lost my interest in the next episode 9.And I don't care about this franchise anymore.",0
1674,"Ok... That is my third rate changing... And now I finaly decide that this movie sucks... =( I was watching this with almost less of emotions and... it was ultra boring... First star wars movie, when I was waiting for the end soon.",0
1675,"I couldn't ignore the giant holes in the plot and worldbuilding.  Most of the performances felt like the characters were just going through the motions.  The juvenile and inappropriately timed attempts at humor broke my immersion from the start, and continued to throughout. The whole enterprise was a complete slog for me to sit through. By the time the movie got to what should have been some cool scenes, I was so checked out that I didn't care or feel anything.",0
1676,"I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that would make me want to walk out of the theater. I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that I never wanted to watch again. I never thought one Star Wars movie could taint the entire series, possibly beyond repair - but somehow they managed to do all those things.I have watched the original trilogy easily 50 times. I grew up in awe at the universe that George Lucas created, in awe of the amazing way Star Wars balanced incredible creativity and imagination with down to earth, amazing characters. The balance of being very futuristic, but almost in a way so nuanced and relatable that it seemed like it could actually be real.Enter The Last Jedi - completely took all relatability and threw it out the window. This movie completely started rewriting the Star Wars universe. The Force is apparently much different than the other 8 movies showed us. Characters apparently use 10 times the amount of sarcasm and humor that they did in the other 8 movies. The physics of space are different than the other 8 movies.Not to mention, the many totally and utterly pointless scenes that did nothing for the story or the character - What was the point of Rey going into that dark hole and seeing 1,000 of herself in the mirror?! Why was the code breaker in a jail cell if he could just let himself out?I physically cringed/rolled my eyes multiple times during the movie. They took the beauty, the depth, the amazingness of the Star Wars saga and made it a cheap, made-for-merchandise, gimmicky superhero movie a la Transformers or Avengers. It screamed ""WE MADE THIS SO WE CAN MAKE LOTS OF MONEY"" not ""WE MADE THIS BECAUSE WE FREAKING LOVE STAR WARS"". I cannot believe this movie is supposed to sit next to the original trilogy on the shelf.There were so many moments I thought there might, just might, be a redeemable storyline and every time it was a let down. Poe going rogue to save the day - nope, just kidding. Finn giving his life to save everything - nope, replaced by the cheesiest line I've ever heard from Rose, a totally disposable character who seemed thrown in for the diversity requirement. Imagine if Laura Dern's AWFUL character (I was hoping she would die the entire movie) was replaced by Admiral Ackbar giving himself up for the resistance!! It would have been so much better and a character anybody remotely cared about. Luke following Obi-Wan's example and giving himself up - nope, he was Force appearing somewhere (which no Jedi master has ever been able to do before) and died anyways.....WHAT?!!?!Not to mention, the agendas and cheesy messages that were so obviously pushed throughout the film - ""You can do anything you want, no matter where you come from"" ""It's not about fighting against what you hate, its about fighting for what you love"" Save the animals. Be a vegetarian. I could keep going. There is nothing wrong with these messages, its just that they were forced into a STAR WARS MOVIE! Go put that in your low-budget animated **** for kids, Disney. It was an assault on the audience's intelligence, like the director didn't realize people would pick up on how obviously he was forcing messages through. So many terrible lines as well, like the characters were giving us all a play by play. (Finn saying, ""Man, they hate that ship"" or Poe ""Oh, so you mean we're going to slip down to the surface and wait for the First Order to pass"") Thank you for forever ruining this series, idiots. Thank you for literally destroying a piece of my childhood. I just can't believe this movie was released. I might need freaking therapy to get over it (ok, a little over the top). Our only hope is that JJ Abrams that somehow pull this train back onto the tracks. But its a long journey back to the tracks.",0
1677,"I am not sure if this is the worst Star Wars film, but I hate it more than any other Star Wars movie.  It honestly made me sad to see the legacy of Luke Skywalker get ruined in such a casual manner.  It focuses so much on being different from expectations that the plot suffers in the process.  I came out of The Force Awakens with several questions that I was excited to see answered in episode 8.  I had no questions at the end of this movie and I felt no excitement about seeing episode 9.   I will admit that it was beautifully shot in several scenes, but that is the only thing I enjoyed about it.",0
1678,"Disney's hand in all its glory. Inappropriate jokes in situations where the viewer should be sad, but it turns out that he is at a loss. A big pile of not logical moments, almost the whole movie on them consists. It's just a nightmare, not a movie. You can write a lot about this film, but I have no mood to do it. I bet 3 just because it's Star Wars.",0
1679,The worst Star wars movie...- Rey is Mary Sue.- Superman Leia flying through the vacuum of space. Really.- Rian Johnson turned Luke into the biggest looser and Luke tried to kill a kid while he was sleeping.- Snoke was a wasted character. - So many jokes. The forced humor and gags ruin emotional moments. Disney just wants money. And all.And... Did critics really see the same movie that I did?,0
1680,This is bad Star wars movie. And Rian Johnson wan t to made new triology of Star wars movies please just stop. I don t know what critic$ whatch to give so good $cores$.,0
1681,Worst SW ever. Ryan Johnson is a genius. To make the worst part of the Star Wars is talent. All these breaking storylines and a useless piece of history with the casino are gorgeous.,0
1682,"Jeez what a let down. Killed snoke with no backstory, now only a whiny weak sith left, angry jedi acting out of pure emotion, no new interesting characters or development with the ones they had, Leia floating in space, Luke portrayed so weak the entire film. Just terrible won't be seeing anymore of these films. Huge let down they finally killed star wars for me.",0
1683,This movie sucks. All the interesting characters die and all the sucky characters get to live. No point in seeing the next one now. It was not the worst movie I have seen in a decade; it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I will no longer pay for anything connected to Disney's Star Wars franchise.,0
1684,"New star wars are so boring and illogical. Since everyone owns Disney, they only filmed for the money money money and for children of course. Seventh episode is an insolently taken plot from the fourth. And the eighth episode is the fusion of the fifth and sixth episodes. For the complete failure of this film, only Jah Jah Binks was missing. Heroes are all good without blemish, they act right. Evil is stupid and always loses to them. This is a very brief narration of the plot, what you need to expect from this film.",0
1685,Genuinely the worst film I've ever seen. Destroys everything about star wars and is filled with plot holes and cringey humour. The people who made this have no idea what they are doing.,0
1686,"It's so hard to rate a movie a 0 - this is not to dismiss any hard work done by anyone but the director, writers, Disney, and JJ Abrams. But this is a STAR WARS saga film. You have a reputation and history to live up to. You have dedicated hardcore fans, fans like no other franchise has ever seen. You betrayed us all. It's obvious you care more about copying Guardians of the Galaxy and cloning the Avengers, which are okay things by themselves but do not even come close to the longevity, fanaticism, and dedication that Star Wars has. If you wanted to start a new fanbase that's enamored with cheap comedy, horrible storytelling, and breaking every known boundary of things the bind the films together (the Force, space, light-speed, and the legacy of one main character, to name a few) while stealing story components from previously successful films in the franchise.... congrats. You lost us all. We were the ones that in-between trilogies bought comics, books, action figures, watched animated tv series -- and even sat through 2 1/2 mediocre films before we saw the payoff that Revenge that the Sith gave us. We won't do it this time. Enough is enough. Someday Episode 7-8-9 will be re-written and honor restored to the characters we all love, and new, more-dimensional characters will be written to carry on their legacy. Until then, good luck with Episode IX. I won't be there, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who will be moving on.",0
1688,"Episodes I, II and III were already breathtakingly stupid but Episode VII and VIII are even worse...two good things:1.) Great CGI (but that is actually a standard requirement nowadays, so nothing special)2.) Mark Hamill shows great acting, even when forced to say or do stupid ****that's it.",0
1689,"The Last Jedi is the rebellious little kid of Star Wars movies. It unashamedly broke all the rules of Star Wars. It shattered our expectations and derailed the ongoing story. It's a movie that's constantly one step ahead of the viewer and stubbornly refuses to stick to the Star Wars formula, frequently changing direction in ways that any fan of the previous movies would never expect. Oh, you thought Snoke would be the big final boss of the saga? Nope, he's dead and Kylo's taken his throne! Thought Luke was a saint with a heart of gold? Nope, he's a grump and tried to kill his nephew! Thought Rey would be revealed to be Luke's daughter or Obi-Wan's granddaughter? Nope, she's just some nobody who is uncommonly strong with the Force!All of this and much more has disappointed thousands of fans, but all of these changes were necessary in order to redefine what Star Wars is and what it can be. The Last Jedi could have been a formulaic and predictable continuation of the previous film. It could have been two and a half hours of obvious fanservice. But that's not what a good movie needs to be. It needs to be daring. It needs to be shocking. It needs to be challenging. It needs to pull the rug from under your feet. And The Last Jedi does this again and again and again. And by doing this, The Last Jedi has exposed the danger of fan theories and what happens when you raise your expectations way too high. In other words, don't write the movie in your head before you see it. Just sit back and see what you get!The Last Jedi is by no means perfect, but it doesn't need to be. Its impact on Star Wars history will not be forgotten. And now, the events of Episode IX are shrouded in mystery. We have no idea what will happen next, and this has made me really excited for the final chapter of the saga and the conclusion of the Skywalker family story. It's going to be a treat.",1
1690,Wow. What a let down. I'm speechless at how awful this movie was. I made an account just to say how much I hate this movie. I saw it last night and I'm still upset.,0
1691,"Despite the visual effects and amazing soundtrack, the film lacks personality and comes across as a cash grab with plenty of fan service. The plot is thin and the sense of humor is just... bad. Disney's attempt to please everyone is the main responsible for making Episode VIII so generic.",0
1692,"This movie deserves 0/10 just for the magical space Leia scene, what the **** was that?! Also, who's bright idea was it to kill snoke, the most powerful character in the series who we are literally told nothing about expect a vague mention of him manipulating Kylo somehow. The comedy in this episode was very childish and very unlike other star wars movies, especially the opening scene with Poe mocking the officer, makes the ""bad guys"" seem very non-threatening and gets rid of any tension building up.",0
1693,"I was never as disappointed after watching a movie in the theater as yesterday. This movie is a punch in the face of every star wars fan. They make legendery characters ridiculous, such as Yoda and Luke. It had some interesting ideas but the movie never could develop them because Disney did what Disney always does with movies: They put stupid cheesy jokes in the movie. The days of serious star wars movies are gone. Diseny destroyed a whole franchise within 2 years.",0
1694,"Wow, what a disappointment.  Rey continues to be a Mary Sue.  No light saber or force training?  No problem!  The Poe/Finn/Rose subplot was pointless filler.  Luke only needed to yell ""Get off my Lawn"" to fulfill the grumpy old man trope.  Leia, aka Mary Poppins in space was ridiculous on so many levels.  Worse of all, this movie just wasn't entertaining.  Rian Johnson gets a new trilogy out of this?  I hope Disney reconsiders that decision.",0
1695,"Mi volt ez a fos ? Mit csináltatok a kedvenc univerzumommal ? Nem értem. Annyira látszik a Disney jelenléte.SPOILER. NA én is egy hatalmas fanboy vagyok/voltam, szinte az összes játékot kitoltam, könyveket is olvastam stb.Az első és legnagyobb bajom az hogy abszolúte nem mertek kockáztatni, itt van egy hatalmas univerzum tele érdekesebbnél érdekesebb történetekkel és helyszínekkel amiket bele lehetett volna építeni a filmbe, ehelyett ebben a részben is konkrét jeleneteket megint lemásoltak amik ráadásul fele annyira se működtek. Most nemmegyek bele az űrbéli bombázásba meg egyszer van vákum egyszer nincs mert SW de legalább akkor csinálták volna egységesre meg az indokok hogy a lézer már nemsebez annyit 50 méterrel hátrébról stb. Az az üldözéses rész az komédia volt. Továbbá a karakterek megint 0-ák. Nem volt egy normálisan megírt karakter talán még Kyloval próbálkoztak és reméltem behozzák a szürkejediket de az se volt. Finn az vicc volt amit művelt ebben a részben, az ázsiai csaj csak a kínai piacnak volt beletéve.Leiarol nem is akarok beszélni. Joda volt még talán a legértékelhetőbb meg azok a cselédek Lukenál XD. A casinos jelenet megint tök fölösleges volt. Disneynek megint bele kellett rakni valami cuki állatot amivel plüssfigurákat eltudnak adni. Jöttek is  repülőmedverozmárpingvinek... Meg ez az ősi Jedi könyves hülyeség hogy ezek milyen szentírások azt kb meditált a rey egyet és akkor má nem is értek semmit... Ja és kifelejtettem a kedvencem... A sith nagyurat... SEMMI ÉRTELME NEM VOLT EGY NAGY **** volt az egész, utána azon röhögtem akik már 2 éve gyartották a teóriákat hogy húú ki is ez a nagyúr  és hogy milyen badass lesz meg stb... hát semmit nem tudtunk meg róla. Épkézláb harc megint nem volt, felrobbant 2 hajó azt csá. Fénykard párbaj volt az a 2 perc azokkal a samurajokkal vagy mikkel... Szürke rohamosztagos megint kb minden plakáton ott volt ésa változatosság kedvéért megint volt 2 mondata és megint valami mélybe belezuhant mert mashogy nem tudnak itt meghalni az emberek. Aztán megint jött egy Hoth 2.0 csak mégkevesebb akcióval ahol megint semmit nem értek a lépegetők és megint elmenekülnek. Ott azt hittem lesz egy jó harc Luke és Ren között de csak egy DW Obi 2.-át láthattunk. Beleerőltettek a marveles hülyeséget hogy az milyen poén ha visszaemlékszünk előző részekre meg minden jelenetet amiben volt egy kis feszültség valami huszadrangú poénnal próbálták lezárni. Engem már rohadtul zavar, hogy lenyomja a torkunkon a Disney ezeket az ötlettelen SW filmeket mondván , hogy majd a név úgy is eladja magát...Nekem kicsi ez az univerzum. Olyan mintha csak egy naprendszerbe játszódna és nem egy egész Galaxysba. Nem gondoltam volna soha de visszasírom az előzménytrilógiát, mert minden hibája ellenére egy ízig vérig látványos sw filmek voltak aminél a sok ****et megfelelően kompenzálták a látványos csatajelenetekkel és a változatos bolygókkal stb. Megértem hogy valakiknek tetszett de azoknak nem tudok megbocsátani akik így legyintenek rá és nem foglalkoznak vele mert amíg profit jön addig nem fogunk jó SW-t látni mert nem fognak fölös energiát belefeccölni. Itt is ideje egy olyan összefogásnak mint amit a gamer közösség csinált az EA ellen mert ezek a gigacégek csak abból értenek ha pénzt veszítenek. Még jobban kielemezhetném a filmet de már látom hogy így is elég sokat írtam.  Nekem ez a véleményem erről de szívesen fogadoma válaszokat amikkel esetleg nem értetek egyet . Végszóra az Erő és egy jobb SW film legyen veletek :)﻿",0
1697,What a mess this film was. Fire Rian Johnson Now. Bad script. Bad acting. Ruined episode 7s plot JJ Abrams setup. Rogue one was much better. Whatever Disney changed they need to change back. Stupid immature joke everywhere. Too long. Too much cgi. Felt like the prequels.,0
1699,"Wow, the lackluster trailers failed to give me any hype for this, so I wasn't even expecting much, but this, this is a new definition of ""low"".Virtually everything in this movie is outright bad. The plot is disjointed and stupid. The action is bland, the space battles lack in scale and logic, with 1 fighter being able to destroy all of a huge dreadnought's cannons. As for lightsaber duels, well, there ARE NONE FOR F**K'S SAKE! And the one fight using sabers has horrible choreography that is nowhere near the spectacle of acrobatic battles of the overly-hated prequels.The characters also f**king suck, both old and new. The largest new addition is an ugly fat (I mean, body-positive) Asian chick who is extra-annoying. As for the old ones, Kylo and the Ginger still act like hysterical children whereas our Wonder-Girl can still do amazing feats of the Force with no prior training, like holding a ton of boulders like it ain't sh*t.The huge problem is that Episode 8 has managed to blatantly flush the intriguing stuff from Force Awakens down the toilet. Big SPOILERS ahead.Made theories about who is Snoke? Nevermind, he is just a CGI model with no backstory who dies after a stupid cliche villain monologue.Thought Phasma would be an actual character, a leader of the stormtroopers? Nah, she is just an extra who also wastes the chance to kill off the heroes to die in an utterly stupid way.Hoped that Luke would kick some ass for the old times' sake? WELL HELL NAW BOY HE'S JUST GONNA MAKE SOME F**KING HOLOGRAM OF HIMSELF AND THEN DIE OF NOTHING!!! (How the sh*t would he even make that ""hologram"" on another planet with the Force?)Theorized as to who would be Rey's parents? Lo and behold, they are noname off-screen motherf**king bums.Sounds amazing right? To add to that there's garbage like:Boring talks about Hope and Resistance; Yoda's cameo who looks like a plastic piece of sh*t from the old movies, talks nonsense and somehow spawns a bolt of lightning even though Force ghosts have never been able to interact with the physical world before; A space casino which looks like a normal Earth casino but with some silly creatures; Leia survives in outer space and flies like Superman though she has never displayed any knowledge of the Force except for some connection with Luke; A lot of sugar-cutie (ice foxes) and disgusting (""Porgs"", that thing with nipples) creatures designed so the incarnation of Satan aka ""Disney"" would sell merchandise; The annoying Asian prevents Finn from stopping the ram thing for no reason.This isn't even close to everything wrong with this movie, just what I remember off the bat. It's one of the two films that I've ever given a 1/10 to (the other being Movie 43) and the single worst movie in the Star Wars franchise. I now have zero willingness to see Episode 9 or that trilogy that will be written and directed by this movie's creator, Rian ""worthless f**kbag"" Johnson.The Star Wars are dead, baby. Was fun while it lasted.",0
1700,The only thing I felt coming out of this was sad for the death of the franchise I love.  Clearly they learned the wrong lessons from the negative reactions to Ep 7.Time to end the JJ timeline and bring back Legends.As for the ****ing mystery box.  It's the smoke monster from lost all over again. JJ needs to learn that setting them up is a bad idea.  They are only good so long as you never open them.,0

1702,"It's a very good film for watching in the cinema, but like a Star Wars film is very bad... Simply it ignores the Star Wars Universe. Luke is not like this Episode! Luke is good and tenacious, not an hermit :-(",0
1703,"Rey is a nobody, snoke is murdered no backstory, leia becomes superwomen, they bring back phasma just to kill her off again, luke is an old whiny disney kid who just wants to die and yoda is not yoda anymore wow what a letdown thanks disney now i cant get this crap out of my brain (sigh)",0
1704,"A disappointing, disrespectful treatment of a beloved, timeless franchise. Disney should be ashamed. Trivial, extraneous subplots that don't make any difference at all to the over-arching ""story,"" terrible creative choices related to the primary antagonist who is carelessly tossed aside without any explanation, countless other examples of disregard for already established canon personalities and story-lines (including Luke Skywalker himself), make this perhaps the worst ""Star Wars"" movie ever made — if it could even be called that. It's almost like reading an alternative universe Star Wars fan fiction or something. I literally felt sick to my stomach leaving the theater.",0
1705,"Yikes. Heteronormative much? Star Wars 7 (aka Force Awaken) led us diehard fans to believe that there was a budding romance between protagonists Finn and Poe Damoron. We waited anxiously with baited breath in hopes that we would finally get to see a genuine male/male (interracial) relationship on the silver screen. Star Wars was going to finally break the mold by presenting viewers with a gay couple we could root for but instead Disney pulled a classic bait-and-switch. I guess they had to cave into the demands of all the homophobic people that are in charge of things right now so they could convince their backwards manchild audience to cough up fifteen dollars. Fingers crossed that Finn is just doing this for appearances and Poe is actually the object of his heart's desires, but with the way things are going lately I wouldn't be surprised if Disney/Lucasfilm decide to churn out more exclusionary trash for their overwhelmingly straight white male gamer audience. The believability of the film is strained further by this forced cishet ""romance"". Finn is way too hot for Rose. It would be more believable if her character was trans, but again, that wouldn't play well with Disney's ""core demographics"" (aka BLORMPF voters aka the real life First Order). Disney will not be receiving another dollar from me after this stab in the back. I was literally shaking when I saw the on-screen kiss. I had to explain to my four bi-curious nephews (all of whom are under 8 years old) that it would be okay and that in the end the good guys would win. But in this age of Drumpf stealing our internet, I'm not so sure...",0

1707,"One of the most disappointing things I've ever seen. Characters are completely wasted,and plot lines are utterly pointless.  It takes everything that The Force Awakens set up, and completely destroys it for no good reason, and with no regard for it's characters. The point of the movie is to show you that nothing matters, and that it doesn't care about the  saga as a whole. This film was filler garbage, and a waste of time.",0
1708,"Where to begin? First this is the worst fking blockbuster star wars fan film I have eve seen its worse than the freacking prequels can you believe it. This is not a star wars film, let alone a film. Rian Johnson and Disney has managed to do what George Lucas couldn't do, which is utterly sanitised Star Wars into a toy commerical with cheesy cliches, barren plot with no story, dumbed down social commentary and a joke - a very long joke for the money in your pockets. I really feel sorry and sad for Lucas at this stage, the guy is decent and cared about his myth, but its finally over, Star Wars is finished at this point. Everything about this film is rubbish, the music, cinematography, fighting, lore, characters, dialogue, lighting, plot, argh every fukin thing is rubbish.Lets be clear here, if you never seen Star Wars before and don't care about anything else, then this film might work on a technical level. Other than that, this so called 'film' is 2.45 hours of bore where literally characters enter and go as they please, with little character development, pure **** scenes of expositions and boring cliche action like omg its the last bomber - will she be able to drop the bombs? oh damm she can etc etc etc. Oh god the black guys going die? Oh wait the other minority character going to save him... geezus **** Honestly, there's not a single lightsaber fight in this scene, and when there is action its highly choreographed like a music video. The film is also full of sexual imagery that is truly disturbing. At one point, BB 8 becomes a phallus ramming at the side of the ship, whilst another scene we get Luke milking vigorously an animal with **** before drinking the milk like a girl would drink the seeds of a man before giving the audience a stare only rape victims would know. Its so bizarre. The franchise is finished at this point. It disrespects the lore that came before it but also seems to not give a flying fck about the Force Awakens. What happened to the Knights of Ren? Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? The movie's simple answer is ""WE DONT CARE"". Also, all the retraded people saying how this is original and the best episode since ESB are 1) fkcing retarded and/or 2) corporate shills. The Last Jedi is so unoriginal in that it just copies all the iconic scenes in the OT trilogy. Battle of Hoth. Tick. Meeting dark baddie in throne room and trying to convince the conflicted villain to betray their master. Tick. Obi wan v darth vader fight where one of them vanish. Tick. Training montage. Tick.Techncially the plot doesn't go anywhere for a large chunk of the way, with the worst jokes littered every 10 minutes. General hux is reduced to general hugs and the audience is supposed to laugh at this whilst the resistance is about to be blown up. The film story is laugable simple which is that the resistance is running away from a bigger ship. That is it. Nothing new, nothing special, its just Empire Strikes Back reduced to a ****ing chase sequence that doesnt even feel like a chase sequence because they keep telling us they have like hours to go by. The film also jumps to so many different places and minor events that tension never builds. Theres a particular bad leap of logic at the end, where after Rey battles Kylo and escpaes, its never shown how she gets to the millenium falcon and then suddenly comes to Crait undetected with a ****ing fleet of First Order ships. She then magically disappears for most of the battle, whilst the film focuses on Poe and Leia **** whilst the black and asian character decides to see who can committ kamakazi the quickest. She then magically comes back to lift some rocks before meeting Poe for the first time. Yes that because we have to remember these characters actually never met until now after 5 hours of screen time in this triology. Its so awful and cringe that I wanted to die. There are so many plot contrivances like this throughout the film, like BB8 magically espcaing and using a walker to let Rey espcae, people flying in and out undetected, some awful character motivations like why does General Holo (the purple lady) just tell Poe the plan all along.Dialogue lines are so wooden that they feel like from a Ps2 game, definitely watch the scenes with Rey and how **** of an actress she is giving some of the worst written dialogue since Attack of the Clone. There are no emotional stakes in this film, nor is there any entertainment. Scenes that almost show tension are almost inevtiable cut to something else in a split second, and also characters seem to come and go as they please. Whilst the Canto blight world intiially might seem interesting, it is by far one of the worst subplots in history as it goes nowhere but becomes a Greenpeace SAFE commerical about racing horses.Well done Disney, well ****ing done. You've done it. Youve managed to make the worst Star Wars film. This so-called Trilogy is sad and disgusting. May the force fking kill your company.",0
1709,"I am saddened by the direction the franchise has gone. It now has more in common with Transformers than it does with the original Star Wars. Too many plot holes and inconsistencies, they haven't answered any of the questions that The Force Awakens left us with. I really do not understand high praises and scores. The last Jedi seems to be targeting younger audience. For original Star Wars fans this film is not. I really hope that viewers will be able to get past all the visual effects, forced jokes and cheap twists to give it rating that it deserves so that Disney would rethink their strategy for the episode IX.",0
1710,"Not bad this brand new episode of Space Balls!Stop joking, I have to be serious now. I felt teased from the first minute, to the last.Here's some bu****it you can find in this abortion of movie:1)A phone joke in pure Scary Movie style;2) Ok, it's a sci-fi movie, but the bombers that drop bombs such as in WWII... In the space? I didn't know that there's gravity in space;3) Leila resurrects and flies into space: an awful mix between Superman and Marry Poppins;4) Luke launches the his elder lightsaber in the sea, such as in comedy by Laurel and Hardy;5) Luke from a mature and reflective character, being transformed into a rebellious, obnoxious and pathetic old man;6) Luke shrugging when "" the camels"" end up shooting him;7) Luke winking in camera, like John Belushi  in Animal House;8) Non-stop jokes and moments of humor inopportune, out of place and embarrassing;9) All villains totally dumb;10) General Hux who's not scary; he's even teased by his soldiers and brings others comedy moments totally out of place in a Star Wars movie;11) Kylo Ren, should be the super villain of the trilogy; instead, he is a nefarious kid who fails to be respected by his subordinates and is almost killed by some species of ninjas that are not mastering fully the Force;12) Snooke, should be the mind of the First Order, everyone wondered what was his past etc... Is dismissed ridiculously, immediately after giving the impression of being very powerful. Perhaps they didn't even know how to justify this character;13) Captain Phasma...A Character just invented only to sell silver plated soldiers, totally useless for narrative purposes;14) What is the meaning of a person staying on the rebel ship just at the very end? Once you have to sacrifice, why do you not immediately make the kamikaze move, instead of getting dozens of ships destroyed in a useless pursuit?15) Being  given of the vast fuel supplies of the empire, why do their ships not increase their speed a little bit? Are there only light speed and snail speed in the galaxy?16) Rey was a padawan for  less than 10 minutes;17) Rey already mastered the Force and the use of the lightsaber; she was born learned of course;18) The Force used such as Skype-calls;19) The movie starting with Rey and Finn looking for each others; then the arrival of the ""chubby Rose"" is enough to create a new magical love triangle? Guess who will Finn finally choose of the two?! Can't wait to see it...20) Finn and Rose saved, by pure chance, from the bad copy of Lando Calrissian, and in less than 6 hours they manage to fly on different planets, escape from prison and get to the ship of the First Order;21) An immense clump of characters, useless, except only for Disney's merchandising;22) The nuns frogs;23) The screaming chickens, repeatedly;24) Luke, who dies of heart attack after doing the spooky ghost;25) An ending that never comes (unfortunately);26) Flashbacks that do not exist in original Star Wars, 'cause they are not Star Wars;27) Forced scenes, shot specifically made to subvert the very few interesting ideas of Ep. 728) Stop, I'm tired29) Leia flying in the space.",0
1711,The Bangladeshi kids at the click farms being paid by Disney to up-vote this thing are going to have a hard time keeping up with the truth that this film is a steaming pile of garbage.,0
1712,"Once again this era of Nu-Star Wars disappoints. I'll cut to the chase. The Last Jedi is better than The Force Awakens, but is only just better than the Prequel Trilogy.Which is shameful.I mean how creatively dead are the writers of Hollywood that they basically have to rip off the Original Trilogy.Again.But it doesn't totally steal from The Empire Strikes Back - It does the same plot, in reverse.The fact that the writers cannot come up with better factions than the Empire and Rebels despite the fact that even with seemingly infinite resources and manpower the First Order cannot seem to crush a ragtag group.Not even America had this much trouble in Vietnam.Frankly the CGI also was a bit of a mess. Watching this in VUE's usual quality really brings to the fore that modern technology is simply reaching the point where the Uncanny Valley effect begins to take effect.The Characters themselves were largely a disappointment as well. The star of the movie was General Hux, played by Domhnall Gleeson, in that his character not only goes through an arc but also take his role in the movie seriously. The addition of constant quips and jokes from the cast, apart from those on the Antagonists, is really jarring - Let Marvel movies stick with the machine gun gags.Once again Rey is a flat, unlikable main characters, but at least she has improved since TFA. Finn and Poe have lost their charm because they almost feel like the exact same character over the 2 films - they are static in a changing world.Kylo Ren is good, though only towards the second part of the movie. Which is a shame because of Adam Driver's strong acting in TFA.Phasma is being pushed for being this Nu-Era's Boba Fett but has none of the charisma, or screen time, to pull it off.This movie has zero ambition and frankly i was not alone in the theatre bored and mockingly amused at this production. It is such a shame what this wonderful IP has become - but that is what happens when you play it safe with a bunch of executive suits running the show, for maximum profit of course3/10",0
1713,Literal **** garbage tier **** rofl I cant believe I actually wasted my time with this **** tier movie. Even the garbage tier Lucas prequels made more sense than this Mary Sue Deus ex autism piece of **** What a garbage tier waste of time Disney rolf,0
1715,"I got the impression Ryan Johnson got in to destroy Star wars lore and troll JJ Abram That's the only explanation I can come up with after Watching the last Jedi beside obviously Disney trying to sell us useless toys.More seriously I loved Rogue One and I very much enjoyed TFA.The latter wasn't perfect but the characters were consistent and very likable with a great dynamic between them, the action was on point and the question that were set up were nothing but exiting.And more importantly the Star wars mythos was still standing strong.TLJ however did not make any sense.It didn't bother making any significant and meaningful characters growth to the old and the new (aside surprisingly for rose)and to answer half the main driving questions and themes brought up in the previous episode(and when it did it was in very poor fashion or stupid manner). It isn't a bad made movie per say but Story and characters wise it was so off I got the impression that sometimes I was watching an entirely new but less entertaining saga.Plus nothing felt earn in it..aside from some nice visuals and action scenes there is not much there I enjoyed.Spoiler----If you are still reading my post and wanna know why I am so disappointed just look at the following and  tell me if i am wrong to be. - we still don't understand what the hell is the first order, whence they come and how they rose up to preeminence?-How the resistance came about to be ,why there is even one?-Where does Snoke come from? why is he so powerful? and how...can kylo kill him so easily knowing how powerful he is..like i am still scratching my head over this.-What is Rey's origin and why is she so powerful?(stating her parents are nobodies does not answer that a tiny bit)-Why Kylo turn to the dark sidewho and where are the knight of Ren? -How comes Finn has been able to escape from his conditioning as a Storm trooper.Why does Luke refuse to go back to help the resistance after he gave a map to R2D2 so that the resistance can find him ? How comes he cannot feel the force in Rey when he first see her?why would Luke even try to kill his young nephew when he is not even able to kill his dad (Darth Vader) who was the most evil villain beside the emperor we have ever witnessed and the almost perfect embodiment of darkness. Why would he wanna leave the whole galaxy without Jedi to protect it knowing evil is still around just because he got upset.Why would Finn try to leave the resistance knowing that Rey will come back after he's been ready to sacrifice his life for her three times?How does it happen that Finn can fight Captain Phasma so easily without any training and having been kicked his ass by a less ranked Stormtrooper.Why is kylo so obsessed with Rey without even knowing her ?How comes lea has power now?Why can Luke touch lea and lea touch him when no one is able to touch him, even kylo ?How come Snoke is killed in the second movie????why make a movie that doesn't follow the plot laid in the former one ?what was the point of Finn and Rose arc ?What about kilo training? nothing?What about Rey Training? nothing?Why make Luke a coward ?is Rey stronger than luke? how comes she is able to mate him?...come on guys!!See this movie can't save itself and to me Ryan Johnson just butchered star wars.Sure the prequels have problems and lots of them.Everyone can acknowledge that but this is just awful.Ryan johnson wasn't the man for the job he should have been given an entire new trilogy all for himself.Putting him in this one was a big mistake. He just ruins the all thing to me with his poor choices. Praising that film as the new empire strike back is a definitively a non sense to me. maybe i missed something but That movie was a failure to me.But that is just my opinion though.",0
1716,Such a disappointment. Way too many WTF moments.There is an entire sub plot that could have been totally cut without any change in the plot.It doesn’t have a good flow from the force awakens.  You can definitely tell we got a new director for this movie.,0
1717,"I liked ""The Force Awakens"" well enough. I wasn't a big fan of ""Rogue One"", but I thought the main series would be solid.Well , I didn't expect them to remake ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" down to the details of (I've tried to only spoil scenes and themes, not the whole film):* A battle at the beginning that involves the rebels frantically evacuating their planetary base while under attack* The force-sensitive character spending the majority of the plot away from the rest of the characters, learning from the old master* The majority of the characters being pursued and closed in on by the bad guys for much of the film, unable to escape into light speed* Said characters taking a gamble by recruiting a new character, who's known to be a bit of an unsavory scoundrel* The force-sensitive character going into a cave strong in the dark side, then leaving her training early to pursue her own reckless agenda* The unsavory scoundrel betraying the people who were counting on him* A revelation about the force-sensitive character's parents* A major confrontation between this character and the bad guy* Land speeders facing off against AT-ATs on a planet covered in white powder* The rebels being scattered and broken at the end, but with a sense of hope and a missionAdd to this:* Dumber and more frequent jokes than The Force Awakens, often made by characters who really don't make much sense to be cracking them* Repeated situations in which the continued advancement of the plot is dependent on the bad guys being really, really stupid and hesitant* The bulk of the film being dependent on what, as far as I can tell, is a gaping and unexplained plot hole * Said bulk of the film being resolved through an action that could have easily been taken at any point in the film leading up to that moment* A significant side plot that ends up serving literally no point in the broader story* Some really ham-fisted social commentary about war* The one time the film could actually take a twist with real stakes, they dodge it at the last minute* A new roster of supporting characters that makes the ""Rogue One"" ensemble look memorable* Blatant pandering to Asian audiencesI think that if you stripped out all of the bloat, you actually have a decent and compelling story at the core.  The big plot hole could have been smoothed over with some slightly better writing, the jokes could have been tweaked, the supporting characters could have been removed, and the side plot could have been eliminated.But you know what else had a decent and compelling story at its core if you got rid of a ton of extra garbage?  The prequel trilogy.This was better acted than the prequel trilogy, and it was more subdued, but all told, I think this is a prequel-level quality film.But the porgs were cute...I'm stunned that the critical consensus of this mess was so positive.",0
1718,this is terrible. they made a bunch of pc propaganda movie out of star wars material. why you do this to us? this is what's happening disney takes all of feminist nonsense.,0
1719,The good - great visual effects!The bad - the whole story killed every plot line from TFA with POOR reasoning.The horrible - the treatment of Luke's character is an utter insult to the entire legacy of his character development and what he would REALLY do.The result - I am giving up on Star Wars (TFA & Rogue One gave me hope - it is now dead),0
1720,"I was disappointed in the direction of this film. It was tonally, very strange. Slapstick comedy bits injected into insanely serious scenes. Very chaotic, like an Avengers akin. The final scene felt like a holiday Target commercial. There were pieces I loved, but overall, it was incredibly dissappointing.",0
1721,"I am so disappointing in this movie that I had to create an account to write a review. I went into it, with the hopes of seeing a space epic that with be talked about for years to come, but all I got was a two and a half hour movie that left me questioning so much. For starters I checked my watch multiple times, because the movie felt like it was taking an age to get where it wanted to go, but then it actually never got there. There was sub plot that were totally unnecessary to the overall plot and plot holes that made know sense what so ever. I mean how did General Hux become a General, he has got to be the most incompetent fool in the whole galaxy. Ok let follow there ships for hours than seems like a great plan, really you have a crazy amount of weapons and ships at your disposable, jump ahead a light speed and cut them off. Literally do anything else than what you did. I mean the start where he is being messed with by Po was so bad if he was so determined to kill the resistance then he would have destroyed the x-wing and moved on. Are the First Order not the bad guys? shouldn't they be ruthless? So much about the movie bugged me, the Leia superman scene, the pretty much shot for shot Return of the Jedi scene with Snoke, the jokes that were just so forced they were cringe worthy. All and all a poor showing from the what was the most anticipated movie of the Year. It will make money no doubt, but it won't go down as the best movie of the Year, it's not even close.",0
1722,"If you think after the first pilot joking scene rest of movie will be better. You are wrong! It will even worse! Weak scenario, bad directing, bad 3D scenes, and too much whining. It is not what we are used to seeing in Star Wars! I liked to see this series more proud of itself. I hope this movie will be deleted from this saga forever. Let's just forget about it!",0
1723,"A disappointing, bloated failure, easily as bad as the worst of the prequels ... except emotionally worse, because now they're not just defiling the old Jedi Order, they're defiling Leia Organa and Yoda and Luke Skywalker himself.The Good: CGI is pretty, practical effects are fun, there are some individually good character moments and several decent battle thrills. A lot like Suicide Squad and the first Star Wars prequels, in that regard.The Bad:1) Every ""Mystery Box"" element from The Force Awakens is cheaply thrown away, making that movie a far lesser experience. Knowing that this dismissive ""Who cares?!?"" is the answer to all those questions from that movie, there is now no reason to care about most of that movie at all.2) Every political and historical point in the previous movie (and entire series) is thrown away. The entire concept of a Galaxy-wide Republic is forgotten, and three capital ships and a ridiculously-stupid fleet of ""bombers"" are apparently the sum total of vessels willing to oppose the First Order. This is made all the worse in that this pathetic ""Resistance"" keeps forgetting to call itself a Resistance, and keeps inaccurately mislabeling itself as a Rebellion instead.3) Speaking of dismissively throwing away history without a single word: Admiral Ackbar4) The Resistance's bombers are quite possibly the most ridiculously useless spaceships seen anywhere in this franchise. Y-Wings did the job a dozen times better, by not being ponderous sitting ducks without defensive weapons, and also by not being silly rube-goldberg devices that take multiple minutes to arm and drop a payload.5) The goofy, two-hour Battlestar Galactica chase has so many plot holes. Why doesn't the First Order call in reinforcements to surround the fleeing ships? Why doesn't the First Order warp some ships ahead to surround the fleeing ships? Why doesn't the First Order maintain ships in orbit of Krayt to shoot at rescue ships coming in (like the Millennium Falcon) and escape ships trying to get out (again, like the Millennium Falcon)? Why doesn't the First Order just once again ""track through hyperspace"" the fleeing Rebels (sorry, RESISTANCE)? The ability of the Millennium Falcon to get in unmolested, putter around close-to-unmolested, and get away without still being tracked makes absolutely Zero sense, given the setup as presented by this film.The Ugly:1) Luke Skywalker is willing to be a reluctant book-burner. To show him up, Yoda comes back from death solely to become an ENTHUSIASTIC book-burner.2) Luke Skywalker's character and memory is violated in almost every conceivable way, up to and including being dismissively thrown away with no clear explanation at all. (Yes, I know that the director has gone around giving explanations about what the heck happened on the Internet. ProTip: if you need to make Internet explanations about what the heck went on in your movie's climax, you have released an incoherent movie.)3) Snoke is a true idiot, an oblivious can of Diet Palpatine thrown away without any consequence4) Phasma also means nothing, and continues her unimpressive incompetence from the last movie5) Last but not least, Leia is Mary Poppins, y'all",0

1738,"- No need to respect concepts and characters already released in the original trilogy or prequels.- Story and plot make no sense (i.e. running out of resources to jump to light speed so most of the film consists of the First Order shooting but not eliminating the Resistance fleet, Luke utterly failing in every way imaginable post Return of the Jedi, Snoke going no where and just dying easily, Rey's parents being nothing but junkers who sold her for drinking money, the adventures of black guy and Asian girl simply for the sake of diversity not because it makes any sense, etc.)+ Some originality (Kylo Ren being evil but not scary or intimidating).- Clear feminist agenda throughout that is distracting and unnecessary.- Porgs.- Yoda's puppet looks **** terrible. And his dialogue is atrocious. Where the **** is force ghost Obi-Wan?!- This film and the Force Awakens **** all over the legacy of the original trilogy. What was the point if galactic history completely repeated itself 35 years later? Just sad. Say what you will about the prequels but at least there were different scenarios and plot intrigue.- Misdirection and jokes were extremely over used. - General Hux should be called General Sucks.- Franchise has become a tiresome bore like Marvel, Pirates of the Caribbean, + Cool that Luke can use the force to great power just by meditating from a planet far from the action to deceive Kylo BUT;- Leia being Superman to survive open space? Really?! You hacks couldn't think of a better way to display that she is also strong with the force. Talk about jumping the shark or surviving a nuke in a refrigerator.- Casino aliens did not look Star Wars. Similar to the Force Awakens aliens not drawing from established Star Wars alien races. Like, why Disney? More toys --- **** off.- Benicio Del Toro's character was a complete waste and throw away.- The resistance seems to be led by old lesbians. While all the males are either incompetent, impulsive, stupid, cowardly, or evil.- Admiral Ackbar killed off unceremoniously. - Overly long.+ Salt planet was cool, cute one liner about it not being snow.- Caretaker puppets looked terrible. I can't believe I am defending the use of CGI.- Extended long range force telepathy scenes.- NO background plot information NOR character development WHATSOEVER.- Holographic Maz was pointless. Might as well have been Jar-Jar Binks.- Rey's training was extremely short and supposedly she is the greatest Jedi of all time? I call bull ****.- Why didn't Hux just take out the Resistance at the beginning.- Vice Admiral Holdo's purple hair.- Poe's mutiny for no reason.- Kamakazis from hyperspace and interrupted kamakazi, thanks Asian girl. I hope you bolster the Chinese box office. - Rian Johnson is a yes-man for Kathleen Kenedy. George Lucas giving her the reins of this was a serious lapse of judgment or perhaps a deliberate means of sabotage after the criticism he got on his prequels which all look like masterpieces compared to this new Disney hot mess of a Star Wars franchise. - So much talk about being the spake of HOPE to light the fire to burn down the Resistance and how Luke is the HOPE blah blah blah, this film literally killed any hope of a good future for Star Wars. **** it. I am out.",0

1740,"WARNING: this review contains spoilers.It's  easy task to give a proper review of a Star Wars movie. I think the best way to do so is by considering the movie in 2 different ways. Hence I'll be talking about TLJ as a movie, and second I'll be talking about TLJ as part of the SW legacy. Let's begin with saying that Unfortunately the R. Johnson movie fails to deliver in both of these aspects.TLJ as a MOVIE:Sadly the movie is flowed with several and fatal mistakes.1) THE PACING. This movie is the longest in the franchise (152 min. long), despite of this it totally fails to deliver a smoth crescendo of rythm. Expecially in the first half  TLJ will put the viewer against very long and static senes such as the slow FO-Resistence chase or the Luke-Rei-on-an-island plot. Both of these start way to slow and never begin to grow, untill the last thirty minutes of the movie. The result of this is that TLJ feels way longer then it should be, and that fails to keep the viewer engaged for all its entireness.2) THE HUMOR. Star Wars movies have always been (also) about humor and comic relief characters. TLJ makes absolutely no difference on this behalf. Overall, comic moments are fine, characters like BB-8 or Porgs really manage to snach a smile out of anyone. The real problem lays in the abuse of these moments out of some pivotal scenes that end up with losing all of their charm. Moments like the ""put-something-on"" scene really manages to kill all the spirit and emotional meaning of Rei-Kilo connection. The Poe-Hux gag at the begining of the movie is by far too long and makes both characters look more stupid then they should ever have looked. Even worse, the moment when Rei hands Luke his father's longtime lost lightsaber, the same scene J.J. Abrams perfectly set up at the end of TFA, is completely ruined by Luke sudden reaction to throw it away that completely kills it.3) THE PLOT. For all these, and many other reasons, the plot really struggles to stay together. The script fails to feel meaningful in any moment, the entire 40 min long Canto Bight plot could have simply been removed entirley if only vice-admiral Holdo had bothered to communicate with the rest of the Resistence her plan all togheter. After a too-long part of the plot were Luke refuses to train Rei, he promises her 3 lessons and actually delivers just 2 of them. And the list continues. This feels even worse if you think how rushed senes like the final Luke-Kilo confrontation look.TLJ as part of SW legacy:Sadly is right here that TLJ totally falls apart.All of the old characters are severly belittled. Leia becomes a sort of Wonderwoman-like figure who feels so unconnected to her value as the leader of the Resistence (The leading role for most of the movie is actually taken by vice-admiral Holdo). They wanted to make her look strong in the Force, they just managed to make her feel unapropriate. On this note, I have no idea how they could resolve Leia's character now that Carrie left us, She will probably be even more meaningless in Episode IX.Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C3PO have been reduced to such a little screentime, to make them look just like cameos for fans, that actually important characters to the plot. I strongly got the feeling that Disney is trying to marginalize them for unkown reasons.Even new characters like Rei and Kilo fail to develop. All of Episode VII references to Ren Knights and Rei's Parents have been completely removed from this movies. Emblematic in this sense is Snoke who dies a shameful death and fails to cope with fans expectations on his true identity.By far the worst work was made with Luke. He was the brightest hope of the Galaxy, he was THE JEDI, the man who managed to bring back Vader from the dark side, the man who saw hope and light even where there was almost none. He was reduced to a coward heremit who refuses his place into the galaxy. On this behalf, Johnson looked disrespectful to the lore of SW, failing to convey a meaningful reason for this change, again the scene where he throws the lightsaber felt like a punch in the gut to all of long-time SW fans.Also the Role of the Force of Siths and Jedi have been questioned. Disney is tryin really hard to make the Brand advance into a more ""democratic"" vision of the Force where there are no heroes, just everyday guys who make the right decisions for the people they love (Rose character is emblematic in this sense). The big mistake is rappresented by the way this has been implemented. By simply throwin into the Sarlac's pit 40 years of tradition between the Dark Side and the Brightside. Also this change fails to happen in the movie couse dispite what they say, Rei and Kilo still pretty much fall into the Jedi-Sith stereotype, they just seem not to like it at all.Eventually the transition between Lightsabers to broomsticks at the end of the movie, is not something any fan wanted to see.",0
1742,"Really ruined star wars, like they had no idea what they were doing.  This is, without a doubt, the worst movie in the Star Wars series (and one of the worst movies I have seen in a while, period). I am so sad",0
1743,"This is not Star Wars. This is Disney's SJW. Disney figured out a formula that worked with MCU and applied it to recent SW movies to give general audience an illusion of good movies.but this is really poor, I seriously have no idea what film the critics have been watching. Truly disappointing.",0
1744,"This Movie lakes depth of a Story, as if they decided No background info on any character in movie was Ever needed. So your Always asking why they do that WHY why do why , why did they just do that??? Plot repeats in all 4 point of movie.If you loved the Original 3 your Leave this movie Sick to your Stomach it craps all over those. the Magic is gone for Star Wars for me,  I just don't care Now for future movies, I Don't .. Disney KILLED IT!! EA killed the GAME Disney Killed it in theaters. Its the Story/Writing its dogy Doo terrible Directing Horrendous Some acting very lacking ..Bright Spot Mark Hamil for what he was Dealt with..which he has mentioned in press past few months he didn't like what Director Wrote for him. We see now..   For those that have not seen is.. WAIT..till it comes out in DVD Not worth the Disappointment  I still have Sick feeling inside..Force Awakens & Rouge One Roced this makes Phantom Menace an Awesome in comparison. I never seen so many people Run out at a End of a Movie before.. like that one..I can only guess ticked off Fans..",0
1748,"I generally suspend disbelief for a good space drama, unfortunately this mess is the first movie in the series where I walked out disappointed. It really feels like the plot of tESB & RotJ were haphazardly mashed together...while at the same time the director/writer threw the baby out with the bathwater in his overt desire to reboot the series and make it his own. Too many pointless characters/plot lines and too many un-dismiss-able plot holes. There are some excellent sequences and you can see the elements of a great story...but they fail under the weight of nonsensical script choices. Years ago RotS almost snapped me out of my adoration for Star Wars...but this mediocre film is the worst in the series, and the first that does not deserve a place in our beloved fantasy world.",0
1749,"A real disappointment.First Star Wars since 1977 where I have left the movie theatre deflated. I really wanted to like this movie. The acting was fine, the special effects also fine. It was the story and the dialogue that let the movie down and Rian Johnson has to take responsibility for this. He may have made Disney a lot of money and attracted some new fans to Star Wars but he may have alienated the fan base for good. Star Wars has always made a effort to present a diverse cast and this is to be commended but Disney make it look like a tick box exercise rather than an integrated, natural progression.  Finally, the movie missed a huge opportunity to use Luke Skywalker properly.  Mark Hamill should be at the centre of the movies going forward.  Rey, Finn and Poe are solid characters but none of them come close to Luke, Han and Leia.  Johnson and Disney have stuffed up but it will take several months for this to be widely accepted.  The professional critics are not the Star Wars fanbase.  The critics will move on to the next movie soon but the discontent amongst fans will continue.",0
1750,"I don't really want to write something, other people already made the point. The story is not even important in this movie, Rose and Finn are useless et caetera... Leia is still alive but Phasma is dead ???",1
1751,"This movie at best seemed so typical, majority of the plot twist in it seemed like you could have seen it coming or just not liberate enough. I think the whole setting for the movie was off.It feeds off nostalgia from the old movies but in such a cliché way. At the end of it i really cant say that i enjoyed this movie.",0
1754,"Can't understand how people can like this movie. I am a star wars fan, and was very excited about the new movie. But after about 30 minutes the movie started, the expectations from the movie went down. Overall visuals, OST and actors' performance is on a top level, no doubt; but the overall movie plot does not make any sense. My only hope for this movie is, that the directors are ""collecting"" all the cool stuff to be filmed in the final episode, and then maybe it would make sense.Here is a list of things I wanted to point out (spoilers):- Kylo was not able to shoot at the cruiser, where was his mother: this was very emotional and heartbreaking part, but after seeing Leia performing a ""Superman stunt"" was a total buzzkill.- Was afraid that the movie would end the moment Luke confronts Kylo, but now I guess it would be a good cliffhanger than having Luke killed in a some strange way- Luke Skywalker fighting Kylo Ren was kinda cool, but the ""Ghost Jedi"" thing was a bit unnecessary imho.- Was expecting some revelations about Snoke & Rey - Who they are, and where they come from. My only hope is that these would be revealed in the final chapter.- The only thing that was keeping entertained was the porgs part: silly creatures stealing attention to not dive into details.Overall I am very disappointed about this movie, just hope that it was all done in purpose - to make final episode awesome.",0

1758,So many problems with the plot it's just not worth trying to bullet point every single horrible flaw. This was a movie made by a bunch of crazy people.Star Wars has been officially and utterly raped. All we can do is keep our own canon.,0
1759,"This movie was hot garbage, talk about ruining a 40-year-old multibillion-dollar franchise with just two movies!Lukes character was completely butchered and thrown under the bus.Ray is now confirmed mary sue cause he parents are dead drunken nobodies that sold for drinking money.Leia is now Superman and that was pretty much the dumbest scene in the entire movie, who in Disney allowed this?Finn and Rose's animal rescue subplot was boring and should have been cut from the movie because it was an irrelevant waste of time.Snoke was supposed to be this BIG BAD villain whose character remains a mystery because he was easily killed off.Apparently, suicidal hyperspace can destroy a fleet of ships in half, if that was possible why hadn't that been done in previous star wars films?Yoda is now completely senile and destroyed most of the Jedi history with a lighting bolt and  says ray didn't need what she already knows because mary sueI like Rey and Kylo's force bond conversations idea but it was ruined by teenage drama hogwash.No actual lightsaber duels.Luke can somehow project holograms of himself through the force  across the galaxy, therefore, killing himself in the process in which I ask again if this was possible why hasn't it been done in previous films? To think The Force Awakens movie was a let down The Last Jedi is even worse! I'm no movie expert but I know the writers of this movie were consistently lazy! All the fake spoilers that were written by average people on the internet had way better plot structure than this multimillion dollar shlock!I'm giving this a big fat 0, but it doesn't matter anyway since this movie will do well at the box office because of the name alone.",0
1760,"SOME SPOILERS.  This movie, while having some problems with tone and pacing, doesn't deserve the level of vitriol being thrown against it.  Admittedly, I understand.  For awhile I was right there with everyone who is posting negative reviews.  I even created an account and rated it low.  Like Mark Hamill, I initially fundamentally disagreed with the direction that took Luke's character.  But then I saw it again and like Hamill, I appreciated the nuance and development that was expressed.  It took a second viewing to understand what this movie did right and what it was trying to do.  This comes from a life long Star Wars fan.  I feel bad that I initially trashed it.  Watch it again and your perception may change. As I said, I disagree with some of the pacing and storyline decisions (purple hair, Canto Bight, some politicizing and Rose saving Finn I am looking at you) but this movie actually does a lot of things right and cleans the slate for the Star Wars universe to go in any direction.  We don't have a Vader clone in Kylo Ren, we don't have a carbon copy Palaptine.  We have a Skywalker that is a supreme commander and lowly woman from a backwater planet with no special lineage as the one standing against someone from a powerful bloodline. We have probably the best pilot we have seen in a Star Wars movie in Poe Dameron who is not an Antilles/Solo copy, who goes from brash hothead to capable leader.  We have an immensely outgunned resistance in a small ""ark"" trying to carry the light of hope.  Sure, there were issues.  There are always issues in Star Wars movies and anyone that says otherwise is looking through rose-colored glasses. This was the most nuanced and deep Star Wars movie that has been released and, when the dust settles and tempers calm, may go down as being on par with Empire in the future.UPDATE 1 I would like to offer a rebuttal against some of the criticisms suggesting that the Last Jedi was merely a feminist hit piece against  masculinity. Although, I understand how someone can try to make that claim,  bear in mind that , toward the end of movie, Leia when asked for guidance by the surviving resistance points to Poe and says ""follow him"".  I don't believe that this was an attack on masculinity but a lesson on wisdom versus recklessness and what it takes to be a leader.  Remember that in Return of the Jedi, Yoda had the same lesson for Luke (""You are reckless"").  He wasn't attacking Luke's masculinity but his immaturity.   This lesson, whether it comes form a female character or a little green puppet, is a timeless one.  UPDATE 2 Let's talk about Luke since this seems to be one of the main reasons that people are disliking the movie.  As I said above, initially, I was right there with everyone.  I thought they utterly screwed up his character and I was pissed.  So pissed in fact, that I made account on review sites, trashed the move and signed a dumb petition.  But I was wrong.  Think about it this way..  Who hasn't contemplated what they would do if they could go back in time and kill Hitler before he rose to power.  That's the dilema that Luke was facing.   It's not, as some suggest, that he sensed a little bit of darkness in Ben and decided to go full-on murder spree.  Yes.  This is the man who sacrificed everything to save his father.  This is the man who, for the duration of the OT trusted his instincts  (They ""served him well"").  In that moment, he saw what Kylo would become.  A tyrant that would undo everything that he and his friends fought and lost so much for.  Someone that could plunge the galaxy into a new dictatorship, killing millions and bringing darkness.  For one second, his instincts told him to strike him down.  But you know what?  This is a wiser Luke, still human and flawed but someone who now knows that following ""feelings"" isn't always the best course of action.  You need wisdom and patience.  He might have thought about it for one second but that second passes.  Is this really out of character or does it show a very nuanced character growth?  For me, after thinking it through, it shows the latter.Some people had a problem with him not showing up in person to defend the resistance against the First Order.  First, I don't think he could, his X-wing seemed to be beyond repair at the point but, more importantly, what he did reflected the wisdom of a Jedi Master.   If he showed up, one of two things would have happened.  He would have either killed Kylo Ren robbing him of any redemption or he would have been struck down, robbing the resistance of any remaining hope that they had.  By projecting himself, across the galaxy, he not only showed himself to be the most powerful force user that we have ever seen, he also became something more than a man. He became a symbol and a legendary hero.  Is that really a bad way to end Luke's journey?",1
1762,"What happened to Luke Skywalker? The greatest hero in cinema history reduced to a bitter, cowardly man. This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who loved the Star Wars trilogy. Thanks for absolutely ruining Luke, Rian. Must feel good that with a swipe of your brush you negated 40 years of imagination. I am so happy that real fans are honestly reviewing this movie and bringing down the cume. I’ve read a lot of reviews saying this new trilogy is “not for us, its for the kids and my kids loved it.” Well, guess what, when the prequels came out, the kids loved them too. Speaking of, I would rather watch any of the prequels INCLUDING Menace than to watch Last Jedi again. At least they FELT like Star Wars movies. Rian, how did you make a saga movie with Luke, Leia, Chewie and more OG’s and make it NOT feel like Star Wars? That is an amazing feat but you did it. Congratulations. You were so concerned about doing something different and edgy that you completely missed the point. FUN. JOY. ADVENTURE. HOPE. RESPECT for the source. This movie sucks and for the first time in my life I am not looking forward to another installment in the trilogy. Not at all. I don’t care anymore. Thank you Rian.  #NotMyLuke",0
1763,"This was not a star wars movie.It was a Disney moneygrab. More cute animal merchandise, more pretty visual effects...The plot however, was ridiculous. They cut up Empire Strikes Back and glued it back together, butchering it into a confusing, twisting mess that has more holes than actual substance.The Lucas magic is gone. TFA was good, it made sense and worked well as a movie. A Star Wars Movie. This would be a 5/10 for an original franchise but a 2/10 as a star wars movie.",0
1766,"I originally gave this a 3. Having watched it again I'm giving it an 8. Once you accept some of the decisions that have been made (which I still don't necessarily agree with), it's actually a very enjoyable film.",1
1767,"*SPOILER ALERT* From a fan who love FA, Empire, ROJ and a bit of Roque One:  This  movie looks amazing.  But........ is overwelming inconsistent, messy and has really badly motivated storylines. Even if they would have skipped the wole codebreaker search it's still a movie that doesn't have a good pace. For me the movie started failing when Leia suddenly resurrected as superman from the dead with her Force. WTF!  Also these strange long distance force phone calls between Ray and Kylo where to easy; there is no limitation, tension or magic when this happens. In the old movies, Luke had to be at least near Father to sense him, they could not talk like a phone call, only maybe one word orso. This was more indirect, more limited and therefore with more imagination of us a the viewer. A good movie I think should give the hero a  limitation to struggle with.  Let them deal with maybe two problems at once. Or when someones solve one problem, a new problem automatically comes forth of that. And show the a little more struggle/effect of a character, with sweat, a small silence, hesitation, an inner battle. Come closer to the eyes like a Spielberg shot. Why not show Luke battling internally with going bad if he is so scared of Ray, why not let Luke heavily attack her in his blindness. This would have got me on my seat immedaitly. Then Rey could be maybe be the one who turns Luke to good again.  I also agree with the not so adventurous retro aspect of the movie, I could have accepted that; Force Awakens was also a remash, but i loved it in many more ways compaired to this one.How is it possible that is from the same guy who made  Looper! I don't know if his new trilogy will be ok at all.... Man what a major bummer indeed!  And how can JJ fix this stuff? Man!﻿",0
1769,Phantom menace was better. Please back George Lucas... I hate what the did with Luke Skywalker...whole movie was just a  big mess...for me is not a Star Wars film...,0
1773,Never buy tickets to this terrible movie. Disney is trying to ruin Star Wars for the fans and push their liberal agenda by making a Chinese girl into a main character. We do not even know what leia is anymore she is proudly a unicorn. I rather watch the phantom menace 50 times because it has more story and light saber duels unlike this movie and Luke a master Jedi gets beat by a noob (rey) that doesn't even know what the force is. Disney hates the fans never watching any of their movies ever again I would rate this movie a zero if i had to and Luke loves **** green milk.,0
1780,"Upon reflection after seeing this a few days ago. Yeah, it's a run of the mill poor Star Wars movie with some of the most depressing plot sequences ever. Especially in Force Awakens but it only continues here. Bringing back old cast members is fun and games but not original in any way. Some weird historic turn we did here on Earth to deserve such petty rubbish. Aside from all that the actors do an ok job and the special effects are good of course but for how much they are making on this.. the locations, new ships, new re-imagining of weapons, etc, plot and script suck. Just a money generating machine is all Hollywood is. Pretty much the embodiment of Snoke's obnoxiously huge star ship. It's no longer art, just leeching statements of the left.",0
1781,"Having read the reviews, I went in with high expectations. I thought the movie was good - not great, as the majority of the critics are saying. First, the positives: It's beautifully filmed - quite possibly the best looking film in the franchise. The action is brilliant as well - superbly executed dogfights and light saber duels. Mark Hamill and Andy Serkis are mesmerizing whenever they're on screen. And finally, BB8 is freaking awesome! Now for the negatives: Snoke is HEAVILY underutilized - watch the movie and see for yourself. It's a shame really as Andy Serkis does a fantastic job portraying him. My second gripe is the lack of chemistry between some of the characters (Rey and Luke, Kylo and Rey). Lastly, the plot doesn't progress all that much from The Force Awakens. Because of this, the movie feels like it drags sometimes.Well, those are my thought on the movie. It's good - but definitely not a game changer as the critics would have us believe.",1
1782,"It's good, solid fun, with some amazing visuals, but in no way does it rise to the quality of the original three films. No, those don't necessarily hold up in terms of film making, but the acting, the pacing, and the excitement were just so head and shoulders above anything that has come since. I will say that Ridley, Boyega, and Isaac have solid performances, but the material just didn't make them shine in a way that I had hoped. Yes, I had monster expectations, and they weren't met, but again, it's a good movie.",1
1783,"This movie is not going to go how you think it is. That's not a bad thing. Sure there are some boring side plots that don't wrap up extremely well. However, to say this movie is a 0-3 is simply untrue. This isn't a very bad movie, which that score would indicate. People need to realize just because this movie didn't unfold or hit their personal plot points that it is an extremely bad movie. You thinking it should've gone ""this way or that way"" doesn't make it a worthless piece of hot trash, as almost all these negative reviews are indicating. Expectations and presumptions lead to the dark side. Get over yourselves, your theories got debunked, move on, look to the stars and remember this is a middle trilogy movie, meant to subvert expectations and theories and leave loose threads and questions hanging. For everyone giving it undeservingly horrible reviews based on personal hubris, grow up, these aren't as bad as the prequels.",1
1784,"Feminist & SJW propaganda piece of **** The worst Star Wars movie by far.Some positive things: Graphics, sound and that was it.The story is TERRIBLE, especially overall story arc (as a sequel to Star Wars 7), it is like someone else did the story and went in a completely different direction (p.s. that is actually what happend, wtf Disney), the worst thing is by far that propaganda **** and always gotcha moment.",0
1785,"I'm a fan boy. I was 5 when it all started. The OT means everything to me. I disregard the prequesls but have a soft spot for Rogue One. I hated TFA, so I was fully prepared to hate TLJ.

1786,"Once again, Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to bring back everything that made its predecessor worth seeing. It was worth all the hype it deserves which makes it another one of the best of this year and the only movie with such a score automatically makes this one of the best films of this year in my opinion. What makes this film truly deserves the score are the surprises it gives us. Like literally, they are completely unexpected and aren't forced onto the film unlike every other film that were released this year I see as a joke. To tell what it attempts to do is completely difficult to say in a couple of words because they keep changing as the film progresses to its end and I got to say, it was worth waiting for another great film of this year.",1
1787,"*You'll find my original take on the movie below as i've had a different perspective since seeing it a second time.12/26/17 It's not perfect, but there are a lot more continuity connections than just watching it the first time. Character arc choices that I despised the first go around came into focus the second time through. Even the Snoke and Luke arc made much more sense; though I still feel like Rian Johnson threw a hail mary pass to episode 9 that is more a problem with the DIRECTOR and not the movie itself (and a sincere reason I don't ever want to see another Rian Johnson directed Star Wars movie).Lines given the second time around worked (nominally;""Rebel Scum"" still made my skin crawl and wanna throw-up a bit). Humor, while still contrived, didn't bother me as much. This brand of humor has no place in a Star Wars movie, but the second go I guess I just came to terms with it.The biggest change for me was the plot and how much depth I missed in the first go around. The argument that it ignored everything from Episode 7 is false, that it doesn't tell the story in its own right is false and that it doesn't get us to episode 9 is a massive falsehood. The biggest crime The Last Jedi commits (and Rians greatest sin) is that everything is hinged on the answers Episode 9 has to cover.....which is a lot.This isn't like the transition from A New Hope to Empire and how that lead to The Return of the Jedi. The empire is stung with the lost of the death star but the war rages on in empire. The rebels aren't destroyed in empire, nor are our heroes lost. If anything they too deal with turmoil and setbacks (and revelations), but their way forward is clear (as are the rebels as a whole). Jedi sums up empire and brings the series to a close (until then). The Last Jedi tries to do this but instead ends up being a stand alone story which was squeezed through a sieve and forced to be a bridge for the prior and the future, when really Johnson wanted to make his own movie with his own story. There is no place for this in Star Wars.They are ""episodes"" sure but that is in name only. This series is just that--a long-running ""LINEAR"" story that must FULLY connect to the prior story and also be ready to line-up with the future installment as well as fit into the overarching narrative. Rian Johnson did not want to do this, I firmly believe that--which is why the movie is hated by the community at large. Not only this, but Johnson buries the literal previous trilogy (4/5/6) by upending the events of ALL participants, making them ALL failures. What a great feeling it is if you've watched these all your life. If that isn't overwhelming ego at work I don't know what is. At most, Rian Johnson should have been give just one of the ""Star Wars Stories"" to make. He could have done whatever he wanted to there, but with The Last Jedi; he was the absolute wrong choice.Still, there are plenty of things episode 9 can (and will) use to make it all work and those things will (hopefully) vindicate episode 8. But that isn't good either. A future installment should NEVER justify the quality of the prior; Star Wars or not. I cannot truly sin the actors, the story or the movie at-large for the sins of the director. The movie itself does it's job, but only on a second viewing (which is why I also increased my score from a 6 to a 7). Do yourselves a favor, see it at least one more time.*12/15/17The movie is far overrated for it's sake. The pacing was droll, the cinematography was dark (as in physically dark, you can't see much of what is happening half the time). Story told through imagery can be fine, but if everything is representative of something that needed to be told it gets oppressive. And that is what this move felt like; oppressive, bland and out of sorts with what it was supposed to be.And that's not what I felt, the movie kept second guessing what it was or where it was going. Is it a Stars Wars movie or was it the evolution of the series into something else? I left the theater not knowing what the hell I just watched and not in the good way.There is a disturbing trend happening with Disney's movies; they are all starting to taste like the same thing. Dialogue from the last jedi could easily fit into an Avengers movie. Humor and places like Canto Bight....I've seen it in Guardians of the Galaxy. That can't be the case with Star Wars. IT'S STAR WARS! The jokes were terrible. There needs to be some humor, but this? The fan service moments were cringeworthy and left a terrible taste in my mouth.There's a really good reason Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's performances have barely been covered in the early reviews of this movie; Neither really have ANY screen time when they do it's as side dressing to the bigger names. There's no kidding myself here with people not going to see this movie, but I promise you; you'll leave disappointed. Shame on you Disney and shame of what you've done to Star Wars",1
1788,"Beautiful, mesmerizing, hilarious. Rian Johnson has made a masterpiece -- perhaps the single greatest Star Wars film  for the better part of four decades.",1
1789,"Star Wars the last jedi is an amazing movie, full of surprises. Rian Johnson definitely went for a more intellectual approach with this entry, judging by the subtle influences riddled throughout. The action scenes are an incredible ode towards Three Outlaw Samurai, full shots often complimented by stunning imagery. While there is no big twist there are multiple moments of surprise and fan service which will surely make any true fan tear up or smile with joy as the nostalgia trips are strong with this one. The acting is worth mentioning especially in Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace) cases who gives the standout performances of their entire careers. The movie does have its problems, mainly story arcs that don't feel compelling enough and some of the new characters are just not that interesting, however the already established Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker and Leia make up for this giving us an overall entertaining, endearing, Star Wars experience. I will also take a few moments to point out how disgusted I am at the bunch of people giving this movie 0,1,2 just to bring its score down. These are the bandwagon flag carriers which are the most damaging not only to the film fan community but also to the Star Wars community, giving us a prime example of immaturity and lack of composure and/or ability to have an opinion of their own. While this movie may not be perfect and all film is subjective, this is not a 0, the amount of beautiful looking shots, acting and the music alone raise this movie above any other average flick.",1
1790,"TFA was a horrible movie, hate it and almost made me not see TLJ. TLJ is a good movie. The plot isn't riddled with deux ex machinas. While I almost fell asleep at TFA, TLJ kept me pumped up until the end, the reason: the plot is not predictable (at most of the times), character actions have good and bad consequences (not just good as in TFA), the plot is fresh not a rehash of an old SW movie, characters are more compelling, acting is better, music score is net superior, cinematography and directing is astonishing (there are still frames I want as wallpapers).The movie is not perfect. A big part of the flaws is from what Jar Jar created in TFA: boring rebellion plot, Luke the hermit, Snoke the boring Palpatine, etc. Also, the jokes sometimes are cringy. But overall , TLJ earns is name as a SW original movie",1
1791,"What this movie does right, it does very very right. Some moments were hard to swallow, I don't mean any of the plot points or character arcs (I loved those!), just some of the unimportant scenes had dialogue that was a bit... off? The main story arc, I love, it's something very different to Star Wars land and even has a bit of a George Lucas vibe of sometimes thinking 'wait, what the hell?'. Imagine the movie as a grilled cheese sandwhich with cheesy-ness oozy out the sides, but damn it tastes good and you just keep eating it even though you know there's way too much cheese.",1
1792,"Best Star Wars movie and best movie of 2017 for me! I had low expectations, when going to the theater, but I was happy to be proven wrong! A lot of instances are simply EPIC and the design, overall quality is great!",1
1793,"This will not go the way you think...It's a line that defines the whole philosophy behind this film. Old fans seemed to hate it, giving it 'extreme' negative ratings even on this website.  The reality is that it is a Star Wars film made for the newer fans, a passing of baton of sort. As Luke Skywalker passes the mantle of this franchise to newcomer Rey, so should this franchise seek what can be considered as 'new customers'.  For me, it is a great Star Wars film, and the complete polar opposite of the Force Awakens.  While the latter is essentially a love letter to the original trilogy (some even accuse it of being a carbon copy), The Last Jedi's whole purpose is the upend any sort of notions that you have of the franchise.  Johnson writes and directs this like a slow burn thriller...starts of with a bang..slows down for some exposition..before turning the storyline with twist after twist.  I myself enjoyed this thoroughly as for the first time, we have no idea how the story will turn up.  These series of twists and major changes are the points of contention for 'older fans', a fanbase that has digested loads of materials in the so called expanded universe (now made 'obsolete' by Disney).  Other than that, absolutely great set pieces and high production values similar to TFA.  Face it folks, Star Wars are here to stay, whether you like it or not.  Disney is now the purveyor of many major franchises beside SW thanks to its purchase of 20th Century Fox and in my opinion, they are in good hands. Bravo.",1
1794,"“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” broadens the story The Force Awakens built up, sending this new trilogy in thrilling, and in some cases, unexpected directions. Rey, Luke, and Kylo Ren are the co-MVPs.",1
1795,"The plot holes and head-scratchers can't overshadow the furious last hour, which has more eye-popping battles and ""oh **** moments than any other Star Wars film.",1
1796,"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' throws so much at you than any other ""Star Wars"" movie, that you walk out feeling both confused and exhausted... but, it isn't short of its fair share of thrills. The movie pretty much begins where 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015) left off, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has finally found Luke Skywalker (a powerhouse Mark Hamill), and is ready to take her training. Gone are the days of her being a desert scavenger on the planet Jakku, and she has become what she never thought she could be. The Resistance is back with Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), as they try to escape the First Order after the destruction of Starkiller Base, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is not wasting any time as he is being constantly tested by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Now, I already know that just by explaining the plot, it already sounds similar to 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' (1980), but no... it isn't. There are similarities for sure, and similarities to another ""Star Wars"" film which I won't mention, but you'll know when you see it. Director Rian Johnson ('Brick' and 'Looper') was adamant about how this is a more ""different"" Star Wars movie, and he is right. Aesthetically, this is one of the most stunning ""Star Wars"" movies I've seen, there is a lot of uses of the color red here. Not to mention that Johnson does break some rules (if I can say that) regarding the ""Star Wars"" lore and mythology, but at the same time, he also shows us how powerful something like the Force can be, and we may not have realized that. There is one scene however, which turns away from all that. Without spoiling too much, let's just say that there is a small plot where two characters have to travel to a particular planet to find something, and while on that planet, it feels like a completely different movie (maybe this was Rian Johnson's intention). The scene does go on for a bit too long, and ultimately, I could do without it. For 2 hours and 32 minutes, cutting out that scene would shave at least 20 minutes. The main reason why I would prefer ""The Force Awakens"" more is because that movie's plot was minimal and simplistic, despite it being infamously similar to 1977's ""A New Hope"". But it had great character development, and fast-paced action, and the story never lost focus. Here, just with that one scene, it did lose just a touch of focus, but Rian Johnson isn't afraid to throw so much at you. This movie tells a brilliant story regarding where our main characters go, and what fate lies ahead of them. There are also so many plot-twists in this movie, breaking the narrative code and taking as many risks as possible, this might just be the most complex entry in this iconic franchise. Obviously, I really enjoyed this movie, and cannot wait to see it some more. It is a fantastic follow-up to a very entertaining ""The Force Awakens"", and is sure to open more doors for the upcoming ""Episode IX"", Rian Johnson clearly has a unique vision for this franchise and its characters that no other director - not even George Lucas or J.J. Abrams - would dare to take. Johnson took some risks, and for the most part, it paid off, which makes his upcoming ""Star Wars"" trilogy all the more anticipated.",1
1797,"This movie is absolutely great, for hardcore star wars fans or not, everybody can enjoy it, i had a ton of diferent emotions watching it: i cried, laughed, felt hate, happiness and surprise, it got everything.The character development it's great, you got to know a lot more about Rey and Kylo, about their journey and their conflicts, the old characters are also awesome with Leia and Luke, they had purpose and a great job done. The action is great, in the ships or with the lightsabers, it all get you pumped.The problem here is the way they got Luke going, some decisions made doesn't seem the same character as we know.The story line is very good, with a few unnecessary scenes, but it does get you curious for what's coming next in the franchise, it's completely impossible to be sure of anything, which is great.",1
1798,"I believe the film was good but it wasn't great. There were a lot of things different and it went out of its comfort zone. We always wanted to see something new from SW and this film did that. And we also never expected twists which is good.There were some scenes that were really good, well thought out and executed perfectly and just made you feel excited. It also showed some really good stories but there are a lot of flaws but even with those flaws the film is still good. The flaws would be that some of the side plots were completely unnecessary and not needed in the film. It was also a little bit of a mess on how they told the story and there are some characters that are just completely not developed.There are a lot if twists going on in the film but those twists don't have an impact since there is no development at all for these twist which is really a waste. The twists in the film when combined together will not match up to the level of the Empire Strikes Back plot twist. Sometimes the humor was good but sometimes it was really cringey and that made the dialogue suffer. The new characters were not really needed but I believe that they were pretty much fine. Overall, I believe that the film was good. It's not great but it's good. I think that the fans were not happy with the twist and they might not appreciate change, which is hypocritical but everyone has an opinion and for me the film is good and is not a disappointment.",1
1799,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was easily the most anticipated film of the year. Not only did it live up to the hype, I honestly believed it surpassed it. The acting from the entire cast had some of the best performances in the entire Star Wars franchise. Specifically, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, and Mark Hamill stole the show. Given the extremely positive critical reception, I would not be surprised if Mark Hamill got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The story and the script were fantastic. I loved the epic three act structure with the ""ticking time-bomb"" trope driving the action. The humor was excellent! Another thing I must say about this script is that Rian Johnson TRULY understands The Force. None of that midichlorian crap, but the energy that binds everything in the galaxy together. The script was also very surprising, and constantly took twists and turns. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole film. Any fan theories I had or twists I expected were subverted beautifully, and I honestly never knew what was going to happen next. The action sequences were some of the best I have ever seen in Star Wars. Rian Johnson's shots were so beautiful that at times the audience in my theater gasped at what was being shown on screen. The character development was strong throughout, the world of the Galaxy was beautifully fleshed out, and I can't wait to see what happens in Episode 9.My one complaint with the film is that the subplot between Finn/Rose felt a little bloated and dragged at times. It definitely slowed the pacing of the film, and it could have been cut entirely or trimmed down.All in all, The Last Jedi is a MUST-SEE for Star Wars fans, and I think general audiences are really going to like this one as well. If you liked The Force Awakens and Rogue One, The Last Jedi feels like a baby that those two films had.",1
1800,"The Last Jedi is a amazing film, but it does suffer from some pacing issues. This film is amazing, there is no doubt about that, the action sequences are fantastic, the character development is better than in any other Star Wars film and the Actors, both new and old, are performing to the best of their abilities. Although the themes in this film are maybe a little darker than The Force Awakens, it still manages to combine comedy elements with more meaningful moments, something Star Wars has always been able to do. The only issue I had with the film was its pacing, I guess when you start off in the way this film does you have to expect the it to slow down, but I feel like The Last Jedi took a little too much time before we were treated to some more of the amazing action sequences that the film does so well. Overall this film is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe, picking up where The Force Awakens left off and leaving the trilogy perfectly poised for Episode IX.",1
1801,I fairly enjoyed thr movie i thought it was nicely made. A few plot issues but not nearly as critical as most are as it pertains to sw.that being said i had a good time watching it.,1
1802,Movie this be good is... -Yoda    :),1
1803,"Nobody hates Star Wars as much as Star Wars fans! I watched a midnight screening of this movie on Wednesday and I'm really glad I did. Star Wars has always been close to my heart and I normally don't write reviews on sites like these but since I've seen the low score I thought I should throw my hat into the ring. I don't want to talk about the movie scene by scene I just thought I would address some of the most common points of outrage about the movie: a)Yes the movie is funny! I'm someone who checks out halfway through most of the Marvel movies and I still really enjoyed most of the comedic efforts made in this movie. Especially Characters like Poe and also Luke have some great moments in an otherwise very dark atmosphere. b)Luke is not what you'd expect!If you liked the portrayal of Luke in the EU then you are most likely to be surprised by how he is presented in this movie. But I genuinely think his character makes way more sense that way. This is actually the only point of criticism I understand some people having but in my eyes if you think about what the character has gone through it is way more relatable than the person he is in the EU.c)People who say ""It's the worst movie in Star Wars"" are bugging out! There is great character development in this movie, some of the most rewarding and breath taking action in all of Star Wars and some mesmerizingly beautiful locations. Contrary to the prequels CGI is used only when necessary and a lot of great practical effects make the movie a true joy for any real Star Wars fan. I don't believe people can make an actual rational argument for why this movie is worse than the phantom menace or attack of the clones. I watched every single SW movie in preparation for TLJ and I can tell you it's a far superior in almost every aspect. Maybe the most important one being: There is actual emotion in this one!! That's the kind of luxury you get for casting good actors (and actresses, Rey has an amazing story arc) There were numerous times during its 2,5 h runtime that I sat there with an open mouth and could not believe what I witnessed. In a very good way. I knew the movie was gonna be controversial but that's what happens when you try something new with a franchise after the revival was a rehash of the old formula ( don't get me wrong I liked TFA but TLJ is a better movie in almost every way to me). If someone is actually reading this, I hope you go watch the movie with a (relatively) open mind and if someone who has already seen it reads this .... I hope you enjoyed it just like I did!",1
1804,"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a movie which defies expectations for better or worse: visually stunning with some epic moments that will leave you in aw, but it may leave you scratching your head for some questionable decisions. The flow is constantly zip-zagging between intriguing plot twists, slow-paced sequences, breathtaking battles, semi-pointless characters and narrative archs, and impressive scenery. Some answers are given to the audience: some could turn out to be unsatisfactory and some may never be answered at all. The film is a courageous move by director Rian Johnson that will not please everyone but which could thrust this cinematic universe into wide variety of possibilities. Go see it, but leave your expectations home!",1
1805,"Great Star Wars movie with amazing visuals and a lot of unexpected twists, but a bit too much comedy. Overall great, but not as great as the original trilogy.",1
1806,Awesome movie!I want to see this movie again and I do this so soonFor me this film - best film in Star Wars seriesI was shocked after the movie and I registered in the metacritic for this film,1
1807,"The strongest Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back! It has more heart and character driven plot than all the other films. Its made me laugh and cry intensely. At the very least it is a visually stunning masterpiece! Certain scenes left me utterly breathless. Most importantly, the core thesis of the film is so inherently what Star Wars is about and leaves both old and young with an inspirational lesson/ message: The fight is not about defeating your enemies, it's about saving those you love! This is the type of message I want my children learning.",1
1808,"The Last Jedi was a decent movie with some flaws. Yes there were things that seemed ""forced"" but it was entertaining. I grew up with Star Wars and things have changed. It was as good as ""The Force Awakens"" but needed some ""polish"".",1
1809,A few things to love and very few things to 'disapprove of'. I loved the Ahch-To moments and Leia's 'controversial' moment was great imo. Overall a solid film with a few odd choices.,1
1810,"I don't understand the hate for this movie. It is not perfect but it damn well isn't a 5.3 (as of writing this). I will get past the flaws of the movie first. Yes, it is long and the Finn and Rose Story line is pretty useless and we could have done without it. In addition to that some of the humor is kind of s**t. (Milk?) However, it has so many good aspects. SPOILERS PAST THIS LINE------------------------------------------So..... first things first. THe one complaint I universally see is the hate for Snokes death, saying it is a twist for the sake of twists and how they were spuer pissed and how he served no purpose. However, Snoke did serve a purpose, he seduced Kylo to the dark side, this movie and this trilogy isnt about the power of Snoke but rather the story of a conflicted, angry man who was born and raised in the light and has now been pulled towards the dark by this character. Not only is it a good twist but it represents something. It represents Kylo affirming his siding with the dark side but at the same time I feel that he might have chosen to kill him to avoid the tyranny that would have accompanied his rule over the empire. Secondly, people complain that at the dn of the movie nothoing has changed. I disagree here. Rey and Kylo are no longer the inherently good and inherently bad guys that we are used to in these films. Kylo is beginning to see the light and rey was pulled toward the dark. There is more a grey area forming and it is a fascinating thing to see. IN addition to that having Reys parents be nobodies shows how that anybody can be something, they can make a difference, you define who you are. This movie requires you to think and consider what has happened. It is nuanced. YOu cannot take it at face value as you can the other movies. It has subtle yet fascinating character arcs that are not completely obvious. To sum it up, this is where I think all the hate come from. People are taking it at face value but it is not a face value film, it requires thinking. It is not perfect but I think from a character standpoint this is the best star wars film of all time. It is intriguing, emotional, and also the fighting looks cool.",1
1811,"While this movie is sure to divide Star Wars fans, I found it to be quite a thought-provoking piece of work. Yes, Johnson takes risks and completely blows up parts of SW canon that is sure to have Luke-loving fanboys crying tears of saltiness, but at the same time he takes SW into a very bold new direction. The standouts in this film are Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, who both share some of the film's best moments. ***SPOILER ALERT***Leia finally using the force was one of the most clap-inducing moments in the theater during my showing. ***END SPOILER***While the movie does sometimes pack in too many plot threads, and new characters lack development, overall it was an enjoyable experience. However, with the slate pretty much wiped clean for Episode IX, I am hoping for a time jump of 5-10 years between episodes to allow this new world and order to grow a bit.",1
1812,"I don't get the negative reviews for this movie. It's almost like there is a segment of people that automatically gravitate to the polar opposite of the conventional wisdom. So this thing gets great reviews across the board and poof they hate it. This is a great movie and sad it largely getting hammered because it got such great reviews. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Lots of twists, genuine scenes that had high gravity (something totally missing from the prequels). I genuinely disliked the prequels as they were almost like watching a cartoon. This movie was excellent and has a very real real Star Wars feel to it in every way.",1
1813,"I stopped going to major releases a time ago because I've always found myself disappointed. All of them seemed to be boring and predictable, milking the same old stories: good guys beat bad guys, the young reckless kid is right, etc.So I went to this movie fully expecting this kind of crap. Fortunately (and surprisingly), I was completely blown away by this movie. Every minute kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what is going to happen next. I have not felt this kind of suspense while watching a movie for years.Outside this, the movie has some amazing scenes. I was constantly getting goosebumps, and I'm considering going to see it again only to watch one of such scenes.I would say that this movie is a masterpiece, the best Star Wars movie since ""The Empire Strikes Back"". By far. I cannot recommend enough that you go watch it. 10/10",1
1814,"The movie was absolutely fantastic. Reasons:1) The plot is intriguing and rapidly changing, it keeps your attention throughout the movie.2) The characters are flawless. They all have their separate personalities, and every one is conflicted throughout. Rey and Kylo have somewhat of a bond in the movie, and their interactions, especially on Snoke's Star Destroyer, were interesting and believable. Rey changes from a naive little girl, to a headstrong, determined, but filled with internal conflict at the end. Kylo goes from a monster in TFA, to in doubt about his future in Last Jedi. 3) The film is unique. No Star Wars movie is like it. And I love it for that. I personally don't want a remake of Empire, so to have something different is a breath of fresh air. 4) The dialogue is decent, but it is delivered in interesting ways. In the prequels, characters deliver dialogue in a very basic and boring way. They are usually sitting on a couch, or walking to nowhere when they speak. Here, there is energy in the dialogue, and the characters don't just talk on a couch.5) The twists. Killing Snoke off was a fantastic move, as it ensures Episode 9 isn't going to be a rehash of Return of the Jedi. Admiral Holdo's character and death were believable. Most of all, there were so many points the movie could have ended at, but didn't. 9/10, only bad was the codebreaker/casino subplot.",1
1815,"I want to thank Rian Johnson for giving us the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back!This bold entry moves the franchise forward in a way that was necessary after The Force Awakens. All of the cast succeed in portraying interesting, three dimensional characters. The Music and and the visuals are stunning, as you might expect. But it really is Rian Johnsons direction and writing that makes this movie so special. He managed to infuse Star Wars with new ideas and concepts, while keeping the core of what makes Star Wars special. The dynamic of Luke and Rey, Snoke and Kylo is fascinating. I especially love Lukes Character development before and in this film, and Mark Hamills portrayal. Unlike Anakin Skywalkers character development in the Prequels, Luke Skywalkers path here made sense. You can see his conflict and his suffering, and understand how on impulse and fear he thought for an instant to kill Ben. This informs Kylos path as well, as it is equally understandable how terrifying this must have been for him, pushing him over to the dark side. The interplay between Rey and Kylo Ren via force skype was also very well done and interesting. I was really wondering during the whole throne room scene wether Kylo could be turned. This sequence is a big setup for the final confrontation between Rey and Kylo in Episode IX.General Leia had a bigger part in this movie then i expected. She finally got to use the force, but it´s really her message of Hope thats important to the movie. Despite all the loss and sacrifice, she will never give up. Her relationship with Poe and Holdo worked quite well, showing her development since Return of the Jedi. I loved that the ""our chances to pull this off are one in 15.623"" plan did not work out for once. It showed Poe and Finn that their hot head approach may just not work every time. Finn and Rose do not actually contribute to the immediate story, but they manage to give the enslaved children of Canto Bight hope for the future. The final scene of the movie takes us back to the message of The Force Awakens and sets up the future of the franchise in a big way. The next generation of Force users is on the way, probably to be trained by the Last Jedi, Rey, but what will they identify as?Star Wars is often described as ""black vs white"", and belittled for it, because the world is ""grey"". But Rian Johnsons writing manages to come back at this with DJ and the Canto Bight sequence. I think this shows us that this kind of moral relativism is, in the end, just black, just evil. The rich slave holding weapon traders are not grey, they are just evil. And to me, that gets a point across to the real world. If you sell weapons to places like Saudi Arabia, you are not grey, you´re evil. If you eat chocolate that nine year old kids are forced to work for, you´re not grey, you are just evil.",1
1816,"Much more emotional and comical than it appears, ""The Last Jedi"" is an unusual follow-up in deified Star Wars canon.   ""The Last Jedi"" is titled the latest entry in this huge galaxy. Dynamited controversy arose at the time when it was announced officially and publicly the name of this episode, causing hundreds of suspicions and therefore theories that connected and disconnected hypothesis about whether a possibility would be provided to find more than one Jedi in the tale. Did they allude Luke Skywalker as the last one? End the Jedi? Who are Rey's parents? What has the real reason Kylo Ren murdered his father? Is this movie featuring a new lightsaber color? Will Finn and Poe have a more personal relationship? Thousands and thousands of attractive questions came up on the web daily, Internet-using fans who theorized about the possible course of the second part, in which most of their questions have been solved.As an advice or a warning, there is a great surprise factor — of the many — that will replace the death of Solo in the previous installment, IE, this flick keeps shocking cardinal events for the course of the story that will leave you on the edge of your seats, with an analogue or more powerful impact that this one of Ren hurting his father's torso with a vengeful lightsaber. What is this obsession Mr. Vader has for killing characters with lightsabers?Regarding the new adds in terms of characters, three roles are those that stand out in importance and presence. The first one is the aforementioned Rose Tico, a three-dimensional maintenance worker introduced in a key point and although it presents absolutely nothing of her past, she stars one of the most poignant and deeply romantic scenes of the franchise. The second one concerns Golden-Globe-nominated Laura Dern, who, thanks to Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, must be placed at the forefront of the Resistance. Her tenacity and courage make this woman a fundamental character for the progress of the story, while on the way delivers a sophisticated, determined and as always superb Dern. Finally and personally the most unexpected participation is Puerto Rican Benicio del Toro's performance. Surrounded by complete secrecy and theories, DJ, the character played by ""Sicario"" actor, is a kind of intergalactic mercenary, corrupt moral, an expert in deciphering ultra-confidential codes. Currently, one of the most potential roles for following installments.Technically, just wide-open eyes. The creative journeys the film proposes are irrefutably evocative, captivating and professionally realistic, enabling a thorough immersion in the voyage. Cinematography doesn't go far from its predecessor, however, it's important the radical change that gives Steve Yedlin for the pictures; Camera angles and movements (characteristic of the films) harmonize  different technical components of the film, making a drastic improvement at the cinematographic level, the movements are more intimate and personal, there are a greater presence of close-ups, fast and dynamic movements in the battles and dolly variations or precise approaches in situations where more than two characters are on screen.John Williams, the always perfect John Williams. Master in compositions of sound masterpieces, the score manufactured for this film is, without hesitation, one of the most melodic, portentous and powerful of the entire franchise. Staying on traditional strings, the composer manages to beautify each scene with his traditional symphonies, melodies that are masterfully joined with the advance of the story. Ineffably, I had an inexplicable connection with the soundtrack of this feature film, it was something wonderful to listen again the emblematic anthem of the saga at the beginning, that made my heart stop, an act that would be repeated a couple of times later. Bravo, Maestro.Rian Johnson's ""The Last Jedi"" leads the spectator placidly into a legendary voyage of lies, revelations, and transformations motivated by an unexpected comical touch, an important social message, first-class performances and an unforgettable score, sadly, the script doesn't end up being perfect and although it manages to resolve many of the unknowns of the previous installment, doesn't propose others as a substitute, any of them is sufficiently suggestive to keep in suspense the devout fanatics during two years before the arrival of the last movie. With unaccustomed twists in the genre, risky but well-received decisions, Johnson makes his official letter of presentation to the galactic universe, one in view of knowing the new trilogy that is in the hands of the promising filmmaker. Without fear of being wrong, the director will get great things for ""Star Wars"" future, for now, has created and delivered a great Christmas gift: magnificent action sequences, moving performances and a more acute and intimate analysis of the already legendary characters: We love Rey, Finn and Poe.",1

1818,Don't listen to this sea of negativity. I swear all these bad reviews must be from a sea of butt hurt social justice warriors. This movie was amazing. It will keep you guessing the entire time. I can't wait to see it again.,1
1819,"Oh, I don't get the negative reviews for this movie. It's almost like there is a segment of people that automatically gravitate to the polar opposite of the conventional wisdom. The Last Jedi is a very innovative film in the Star Wars universe. It's one of the best Star Wars film ever!",1
1820,"The Last Jedi is an emotionally complex, deeply philosophical movie with great lightsaber duels, spaceship dogfights, and actual humor. Yeah, it's REALLY that good. Anchored by some truly remarkable performances, and a host of good to great ones, the people are both more believable and more important than the effects, and the effects are amazing . Mark Hamill's turn as Luke Skywalker will be on my list of best performances of the year: he is funny, heart breaking, and legendary, it is the best acting this series has ever seen. Carrie Fisher's performance is wonderful, but the tragedy of her loss was impossible for me to separate, but it is a perfect farewell if it is her last appearance. The new heroes and villains carry the story and make it clear that the Force is still with Star Wars and the rebellion.  If you don't love this movie, you don't like Star Wars, you like the Star Wars you have in your head not the one that exists. A great movie on its own terms, The Last Jedi is without question either the best, or alongside The Empire Strikes Back, one of the best this series has given us. I can not wait to see it again and again.",1
1821,"Film fans will like this, common Star Wars fans not. If you like episode 4,5,6 and 7 thus is another great instalment to the Star Wars trilogy we all love so much.",1
1822,"The Last Jedi will be the most fiercely debated and polarising Star Wars ever. Some of the humour and sequences are a bit off, but make no mistake, this is the most powerful Star Wars film ever made. The Last Jedi has some of the most epic moments and lore in the sagas history, coupled with amazing camera shots, an exciting plot, and the best character development it's ever seen in Ben and Rey. This is a very different Star Wars, and many fans will feel negatively towards it it; but there's no denying we begged Rian Johnson to take risks. The Last Jedi will stand alone as one of the most unique and memorable films in the saga and I only have praise for this.",1
1823,"Pumpa pe pepepepi pe pepepepi pe pepepepe.. :D The Great, Legendary, John Williams’ One of The Best Themes.. This is the First thing you’ll hear when someone says “Star Wars”, Isn't it.? ;) And our Desi awards stole even that :PFirst thing first, when I heard about Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher, I just couldn't believe the news. I was so shocked. Then & then, I decided to watch this movie if no other reason but to give my respect to Carrie. She was The Best. May her Soul Rest In Peace. She did Fabulous work in this movie. Salute to her.Now, the story isn't going ahead much. I’m a Spoiler-Free reviewer so I’ll not spoil anything but the movie definitely could've been better if written well.

1824,Im actually confused in why others think this is a bad movie? I was smiling laughing in awe the whole movie. The amount of detail Rian give is heartwarming. Leia has the force in her....not to sure why you're surprised shes can wake up in space and use the force to save her life. The acting in the movie was perfectly fine. If their was on character that annoyed me the most it would of been Admrial Holdo the actress just didnt fit that role I know shes a well known actress but I just was not a fan. I thought Rose and Del Toros character were perfect and a great add on. I honestly see reviews where people make 0 sense talking about Disney and how they make their movies now and how there is comedy added....there was comedy in the original Star Wars movies lol. Also there is nothing wrong with laughing sorry you didnt laugh tho. How in the world can you compare this movie to the prequels lol HOW! I see people saying worst movie but 0 people are even explaining why? there a few of you but im searching and honestly there is nothing there.,1
1825,"I really don't know what these people saw,this movie have incredible acting,an unpredictable story,beautiful shots and a great ending.For me this is the second best star wars movie.You can fell that the rebels are in serious danger in the first time.Kylo and Luke are the best characters. Both ground and space battles are intense and epic. You can see the characters change and grow. For those haters,I really don't know what movie they saw.",1
1826,"Yes it has flaws, I don't like some of the jokes and the whole finn/rose mission feels a bit long. But I still think it's a decent Star Wars movie that I'll enjoy. Comparable to Empire? Nope. But is it that awful? I really don't think so.",1
1827,"This movie is fine. Ultimately, how it will be remembered comes down to the next film which is the biggest shame of this movie. I can see the complaints on the Disney-fication of this movie and it kinda blows, but the question this movie asks in Rey's storyline is one of the best in the series. There are a lot of questionable choices too. Rose and Finn's story should have been better and the way the Leia scene is shot makes a weird situation stupid, but I don't think it detracts from a fine story.Few more thing; 1) Kylo is the Anakin we never got. The conflict within him is better portrayed and the relationship between him and Rey helps show this to us. 2) Snoke being snuffed out is good. This story is about how bad, how far Kylo is willing to go. Him removing Snoke complicates things and allows him to either be more nuanced or balls to the wall evil.3) Poe being trapped on the ship doing nothing was good for him, it allowed him to grow as a character. I know we don't want that from a hothead, but it could be good. It comes down to how IX chooses to let it pay off. 4) Rewatch A New Hope and forget the rest of the series. Empire completely changed what that movie meant and what the series would become. So the people complaining about The Last Jedi recontextualizing The Force Awakens have simply forgotten the nature of sequels.Ultimately, the user score right now doesn't matter. How this movie is remembered will come down to how IX chooses to let this movie play out, which is why this movie will never be Empire or A New Hope, but also why this movie isn't worthless. Pray IX is good.",1
1828,"lifelong Star Wars fan, took 4 kids who all loved it! I thought there were some great bits and some very poor bits! shades of Flash Gordon, Battlestar Gallactica, and Star Wars! better than the prequels but no Empire Strikes Back! Kids gave it 10/10 im giving it 7. Enjoyable enough, just not a classic.",1
1829,"This is by far the most serious installment of the series. Even though most user reviews are describing it as Porg-overwhelmed pulp for mass audiences, it's much more about the characters' internal conflicts and finally having them undestand what the balance in the Force is really about. Where ""The Force Awakens"" showed us recycled planets from the original trilogy with new names, ""The Last Jedi"" shines with creativity by showing us places we've never been to before - just like Lucas intended it to be. One particular place (you'll know which one it is once you see it in the movie) reminds us, that the galaxy is not just divided between The First Order and The Resistance, but also has a lot of neutral space that's ruled only by business. The cinematography is very interesting and really gets into the heroes' heads, though the usage of CGI is a bit more noticable than in ""The Force Awakens"". I know it may sound pretentious, but there weren't enough puppets and other practical effects that had worked so well in the previous part of the ""Star Wars"" saga. Even if not everything looks 100% real, the movie still has many moments where the whole audience, including always-talking 12 year olds, was silent and just watched in awe. I found the soundtrack a bit disappointing as well. It was as good as in every other part of the series, but I don't think you'll be able to find anything new worth remembering like ""The Imperial March"", ""Binary Sunset"", ""Duel of the Faiths"" or a much newer Rey's theme.Many questions are answered, more remain unanswered, even more new questions are raised - the movie is an excellent bridge between episodes VII and IX and lets some fresh air into th Star Wars franchise and it's lore. In my personal ranking, it's the best Star Wars movie so far - never has the line between the Dark Side and the Light Side been so blurry.",1
1830,"As the young Martin McFly would say ""Guess you guys aren't ready for that yet"". This film shows the true power of the force, in the prequels the Jedi were weak and naive. However, it seems that many fans have not liked this. Rian Johnson did very good work and showed new things, but I think he should leave star wars, it's a dangerous place. It seems that the only stories in which people might be happy are those that take place in the times of the original trilogy.",1
1831,"This review contains SPOILERS. First of all I never write a review here before, but this nostalgia about the 4, 5 and 6 need to stop. The first trilogy wasn't perfect, ok? There's flaws on every Star Wars movie. First of all like Snoke, we didn't know who are the Emperor or his background history before the Prequels, and for almost 20 years they didn't answer that on the movies. And like Snoke he died in a stupied way, he didn't even fight, he just used the force on Vader and Luke, and that's it exactly like SNOKE did. The best Palpatine fight isn't on Movie Screen but in the Clone Wars 3D Cartoon.Phasma didn't had much attention? Ok she has her own Comic Book, and if you are a real Star Wars fan and not this Fake Nostalgia Fanboy, you should know that. She is like Boba Fett in the Episodes 5 and 6. Everybody loves Boba Fett, but before the comics he is just a Guy in a cool Suit, he didn't add anything to the movies, actually the whole Crew of Mercenaries that Vader hires to pursuit Han, Luke and Leia was useful or even relevant to the movies.Another thing, Luke died in a better way that Obi-wan or Qui-Gon Jinn. He won a fight without fighting, that's the most Jedi thing ever done. And to the people complaining about his death, if you are a fan of Star Wars you should know that the master always dies in the movies, always. That's how Star Wars always worked, there shouldn't be any surprise about that, we could know that since TFA. This movie is about bring back Luke to give some Hope to people around the Galaxy, and not about winning the war they are losing. Because this Luke isn't the Luke from Expended Universe (LEGENDS).I love to see people complaining about how stupid the comedy is on the New Star Wars era, but C'mon C3-PO is just a comic relief, since day one. You hated the Porgs? The Ewooks looked awful on Return of the Jedi. Star Wars always had jokes and some silly moments.Some people are complaining about how The Last Jedi ruined his childhood memories, but they cannot accept that a movie can have some jokes for Kids? Really?Another thing, stop trying to fight the CGI, we live in 2017, almost 2018, all the Hollywood studios use CGI effects for a lot of reasons, and they will not stop using such a good tool because you want to live in the 80's. Finally this new movies isn't about Luke, Leia or Han, we all need to accept that, they are just giving the torch to a role new generation. That's why Disney dumped the Extended Universe (because there, Luke is so overpower, and do things beyond the Last Jedi stuff that people are complaining, and makes the force on the movies look boring, and again if you are a real Star Wars fan you should know that). Extended was heavily based on Skywalker family, and the new trilogy isn't. I liked the movie, has flaws? Yes, like every other Star Wars Movie. Personally I think people need to see this movie as something new, and different, and not waiting some nostalgia, because this movie is about the new generation of heroes in the galaxy, and not the old one.",1
1832,"Hated Ep VII so I went in with grim expectations but this movie nailed it. Humour was good, adequate amount of explosions and the twists were unexpected and very un-Lucas. It's a hole filled poor science fiction, but great science fantasy!",1
1833,"This movie is awesome as the critics said. There is everything in it, emotion surprise action. One of the best star wars movie. I want to see it again as soon as possible",1
1834,"Easily the best Star Wars movie since Episode V. (To everyone who rated it 0 or 1. Take it easy, folks. Star Wars movies were always just dumb and cheesy blockbusters. Don't be blinded by nostalgia.)",1
1835,"My message to Rian Johnson:First 40 minutes - f**k off palRest of the movie - love you, but next time drop the occasional jokesIf it wasn't for the Lego Star Wars-like jokes for me it easliy would have been best movie in the main saga. When it relases on BD i am making my own version with all the jokes cut out.",1
1836,"The Force Awakens and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story want to please you. They want to hit familiar beats and remind you why you love Star Wars. They are so much fun. But The Last Jedi doesn’t want to remind you of anything. It doesn’t care about your relationship with Star Wars. The only relationship that matters here is Rian Johnson’s relationship with Star Wars, and for the first time in a long time, here is a Star Wars movie with a proper point of view, one delivered by a storyteller who is unafraid to shatter a universe he loves, to break down the heroes that mean so much to him. A wise and noble Luke is easy. A Luke with regrets? That’s hard. That’s tough to swallow. That’s what elevates The Last Jedi beyond a simple retread – it asks you to take these characters seriously in a way that other Star Wars films have not, to acknowledge them as something beyond a vessel for escapism. Star Wars can only matter in the long run if it’s given the room to grow. And right now, it feels like the sky is the limit. Right now, Star Wars feels…unsafe. And that's great.",1
1837,"Taking your frustration with the real world out on this movie is bizarre. While I enjoyed both TFA and R1, this film made me feel just like I felt when the graduating class of Horizon Middle School's first year decided to go to the first matinee of Return of the Jedi over Highland Hills Water World. So that's my bona fides. I could not have cared less about Snoke and Mark Hamill delivers. Your petty plot hole complaints mirror the petty plot hole complaints from every single episode in this series. They ALWAYS have plot holes. It's part of the force. It's worth seeing in the theater. Period. Peace!",1
1838,"A different Star Wars, but that's what makes it so special. The story and the plot twists are very surprising. The actors are better than ever. Carrie, Mark and Adam made a fantastic job. The visuals, the cinematography, the music. I have to watch again!",1
1839,"Easily the best Star Wars movie in the franchise with more character development, a darker, more serious plot, and more in-depth than any other in terms of lore, and personal motive/ideal behind characters.  It's borderline too much for kids, unlike other the other entries, so be prepared for that.For all of those with a positive review, definitely agree. Star Wars has never been particularly heavy on plot, rather effects and character driven with wonderful world-building so not saying that's a bad thing. This was heavy on the plot though, analytically it's the first to go into personal motive that isn't just ""let's destroy the empire"", we're talking about characters with their own personal backstory and ideals that drive them.  It was the first to even ask the question ""which person is right here?""(aside from not knowing if Anakin should be a Jedi Master or not, which was forced drama)- so take that as you will, it's just another testament to the fact that the originals were never particularly deep.It explored human themes like abandonment, loss, failure, and death without giving up the Star Wars charm that we're used to. Again, it easily had the most plot, lore, and most thorough execution of any Star Wars to date- plenty of well-placed fanservice, and overall was like Star Wars if they ever decided to add a heavier, darker plot, more lore, and wanted to increase the characterization to something that wasn't just comedy banter and cheesy smiles.  Again, not saying that's a bad thing.  It explored the full extent of the universe.  Star Wars has always been legendary level, but this took it to the next level and is the standard for the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre to come: 10/10.",1
1840,"Это совершенно великолепный фильм, изумительно снятый, глубоко эмоциональный с великолепными героями, которым хочется сопереживать. Ну и , конечно, эпичный саундтрек от Джона Уильямса! Райан Джонс нетривиально развил все идеи, заложенный Абрамсом. С нетерпением ждем финала этой истории! Спасибо всем создателям этой эпичной и сделанной с душой картины!",1
1841,"The movie suffers for a few weak scenes, but overall it's still a very satysfying and incredible history with great scenes and characters. Just don't trust the **** reviews giving TLJ scores like 1/10 - it's not ideal, but still good as hell.",1
1842,"Spoilers BelowThe main theme of this movie was ""let the past die"" not only for the plot but as a direct message to fans. Once you accept this and view the movie as a part of this trilogy and centering around our new characters, a greater appreciation for this film is found. I found a few moments of the film to be strange and perhaps unwarranted but overall it played to the whole theme. The Last Jedi turns our attention away from theory and speculation about connections to the past, like Rey's parents or Snoke's history and forces us to place all our attention on Kylo Ren and Rey and their present. This is the dynamic we should be focusing on and it was executed wonderfully. I was thrilled and overjoyed with the writing and execution of every scene involving Rey or Kylo Ren. As for the other subplots of the movie, i.e. Finn, Poe, and the Resistance, they had their moments of beauty and Star Wars level of awesome, but also had their moments of confusion and uselessness. However, these all lead us to the same major theme of letting the past die. Finn and Poe at the beginning of this film were thinking to heavily about opportunities arising from previous moments and not thinking about the future. Poe was resting on his laurels of brilliance from previous victories to show failure after failure in this movie, and Finn focusing on his relationship with Rey and not realizing his opportunity in the present to do what is right. Going into this movie I thought how difficult it was to transition from thinking that this trilogy is about Rey and Kylo and how my Star Wars brain will always attempt to tie things back to Luke, Leia, and Han. I left the theater fully focused on Rey and Kylo and the future of the Resistance. Their connections to the past no longer matter. For Rian Johnson to force me to focus on the future and truly 'let the past die' is an accomplishment that cannot be overstated. My questions entering The Last Jedi were focused on how our new characters connect to the past and where they fit into the Skywalker story, but my questions leading to episode 9 have nothing to do with that. I am more plot and new character-focused than I have ever been. Overall it was a great movie that was unafraid of the potential backlash from the fans that are unwilling to break ties with the original 6 films. I fear that a completely separate trilogy that Rian Johnson is currently developing will be poorly received because of this same realization.",1
1843,"I'm keeping it spoiler-free so you're safe with this review.WOW... The Last Jedi was quite an experience. The first 1.5 hours is great with moments of brilliance, but that last hour... I honestly thought the movie was almost over, but it just got started. This is one of the most unpredictable recent movies I've seen, please don't get the plot spoiled for you. I've no idea how the sequel will be and that's a very rare thing in a movie franchise. For anyone who thought The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope and who thought this would be similar to The Empire Strikes Back rest assured, it is not. It's almost 100% original ideas and that's so ballsy. Not every single thing worked perfectly, but I have so much respect that they went into this route. Not everyone will like all the ideas and I can understand if you don't enjoy parts of the movie because of this, but I still can't believe they actually went there. The acting is unbelievable. Hamill is amazing, but Adam Driver is the true star of he movie: seriously Oscar worthy. I actually got emotional twice during the movie near the end and I didn't see it coming, it just hit me. I want to see it again right now. For the last 20 minutes I kept wishing that it wouldn't end and if a 150 minute-long movie makes you think that you know it's a good one. Personally I enjoyed The Force Awakens, but this movie blows The Force Awakens out of the water and then some. Empire will (probably) always remain my favorite Star Wars movie, but this is top 3 Star Wars material. Even though Empire is my favorite I dare to say that the last hour of The Last Jedi is the best hour ever in a Star Wars movie. I have to let it sink in for a while, but if you're doubting if you should see it, go immediately! I think the first 1.5 hours of the movie is an 8/10 & the last hour a 10/10. So you'd say that a 9/10 would be reasonable, but I'm giving it a 10/10. That last hour was just so good that it elevates the entire movie and shows you that you need the slower first part to prepare you for what's coming. I think that the first part of the movie will be even better on a rewatch.  P.S.: this movie has received quite a bit of hate the last days. I read the negative reviews and I don't agree with them at all. Yes, this is a very different Star Wars movie and not what you expected when you went into the theaters, but that doesn't make it bad, especially not when all the new things are handled so perfectly. Quite the opposite, it makes it the most refreshing Star Wars movie since Empire.",1
1844,"Saw the last Jedi 83 hours ago-- It was incredible! there has never been a Star Wars movie like this one that's for sure-- someone said in this movie you laugh so as not to cry and I think that's spot on, things happen in this movie that will wind older fans-- and fans of the video games are probably going to be inclined to reject the humour as incongruent to the Star Wars they thought they knew-- but Star Wars doesn't belong to them, it belongs to everyone and we want to bring new young fans into our world -- movies are different from their video games, and franchises that have existed for this long risk getting stale, and Star Wars is too precious to go stale for the sake of nostalgia",1
1845,"The Last Jedi is another great Star Wars movie. Don’t listen to the fan boys, this movie goes to places no Star Wars movie has gone, great acting, cinematography, directing, editing, etc. I only have one problem, it’s an small scene with a lead character that does something that’s seems not very “Star Wars”, but all the rest works.",1
1846,"I was sitting in my seat after the movie ended, thinking about how anyone could hate this film. Are it the risks they took? Is it how they handled the characters? Is it too long? Some people might answer those questions with yes. I however, loved every second of this film, it left me speechless. This film is so original and yet so loyal to the mythos that is Star Wars, I can hardly find the words to describe it. Maybe it is the scale of this film, that is so humongous, that people can feel like it is too much, it is a burden. As if they can't follow everything that is told in this movie. To to those people: Go see it again and maybe a third time. You will see why this movie is pure Star Wars and only that. The respect to the original characters is immense and yet The Last Jedi takes those characters into new territory that is so unexplored, that it seemed impossible to make them feel like the same characters we used to love. But they have done it. They have continued the story for the original characters and crafted a new story for our new set of characters. Yes, some questions might not be answered, but this is only the second movie of a trilogy and it is already so much better than Episode 7, that I cannot wait to see what Episode 9 has in store for us. Do not judge this film too soon, do not hate on this movie to soon, because you think they made mistakes that are just merely risks they took, that change things you used to know. Change is something that should be appreciated, at least if it is done right! And every change in this film worked, because it is seeing a future we do not yet see and should await with unbearable patience. See the future, accept how the past made everything in this movie make sense and how it made Star Wars so much more complex and exciting. How can you hate something you haven't even fully explored yet? I love this film and I love Star Wars. I am in shock that this movie receives this amount of hate from 'fans' that just want to see the same boring thing over and over again. I can't give this a better score than 8 tho, because the Casino storyline was very out of place and weird and just didn't fit. Other than that, fantastic film.",1
1847,"Do not listen to the negative reviews, this is a fine Star Wars film, and while it might have some light passing issues the general idea behind the hate the film is receiving is that it doesn't follow along with the fanfiction version certain fans had in their heads, unable to accept any other view.",1
1848,"This movie was excellent, there’s no other word for it! I legitimately can not understand why there is such a huge dramatic rift in fan reactions other than people are just being awful trolls. People complained that Force Awakens was too much like the originals and too safe and now they’re whining that this is too different. The filmmakers can’t win with fanboys and trolls. I’m legitimately torn on whether this or Empire Strikes Back is my favorite film. This film was DENSE, even at 2.5hrs long, there was a lot in it and if anything I could have used another 90 min to really explore some things. But even at the breakneck pace it was still awe inspiring and astounding. It felt like Star Wars at its heart, but at the same time felt like bold and dramatic new direction you wouldn’t expect for the franchise. This 2 year gap between movies is going to be even harder than the gap between Force Awakens and this film.Pros: Great development for all of the characters and some really shocking twists for a handful of them. Incredible visuals. Humor. Shocking returns. Porgs! Much better use of Leia for the most part. Rey’s parentage. Clean slate and completely free and open new direction for the franchise.Cons: The 30 seconds of Mary Poppins. Not enough Phasma. And shockingly the film wasn’t even close to long enough at 2.5 hours, that’s just how big the film felt.I can’t recommend it enough and can’t wait to see it again, all the points and stars for this!!!",1
1849,"The movie is one of the best Star Wars movies made. The best things about it are the unexpected turns the viewer has to cope with. It is not an easy movie, be aware that you have to give your own interpretation of things",1
1850,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is unlike any Star Wars film before. It delivers fantastic performances, writing, cinematography, action, special effects, music, worlds, emotional moments and beyond that; something truly special. The acting in this movie is simply amazing. Everyone does a great job but some of the standouts for me were Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke, and Snoke. They arguably have some of the most integral scenes in the movie and flawlessly deliver believable and emotionally driven performances. The writing is also great; with more twists and turns then any Star Wars movie before. It will keep you guessing the entire movie, and continue to prove you wrong time and time again. The cinematography is very beautiful and unique to The Last Jedi as Rian Johnson's long time cinematographer Steve Yedlin worked on this movie. He framed certain shots in a way no Star Wars movie has ever done before, which is great as it gives this movie a really different feel. The action sequences are fantastic. The lightsaber choreography specifically blew me away as to how amazingly executed it was in this movie. The special effects are also top notch. Snoke specifically looks much better than he did in The Force Awakens. His appearance is a lot more life like and believable. There are not as many new musical themes in this movie as The Force Awakens, though the music is still memorable and balanced very well throughout the movie. I really liked the new locations in this movie. Of course it spends more time on Ahch-To, which is always a beautiful sight to see. Canto Bight is a gorgeous looking town with lots of light effects and things going on. And Crait looks gorgeous with the salt flats and bursting red colours. The movie is also filled with some really great emotional moments. I want to highlight on Leia specifically, as there are certain moments in this movie that pay tribute to her last appearance in the saga perfectly. All of what I have mentioned is great, but this movie does something else entirely that makes it so special. The movie has an underlying message/meaning, that separates it from the rest of the saga. I do not want to give away too much without spoiling it, but The Last Jedi makes you rethink about its heroes, and what it means to be a hero. The movie is not without its flaws, however certain people will be bothered by more things than others. Some of the humour in the beginning of the movie did not work for me, and some of the supporting characters could have had better conclusions. But the things it does not do well, are far out shined by the things it does tremendously well. I can see why this movie is getting a mixed reception, as it takes a lot of risks that some may not agree with. However for me, I think the risks it takes are incredibly powerful and payoff in the end.",1
1851,"AWESOME. It respects the elements of the classic trilogy, brings back that sense that the Jedi are a religion and the Force is a connection between everything and everyone. And that's a LOT of incredible scenes. Crazy fights, a great movie and probably the best blockbuster of 2017.",1
1852,"Star Wars will always be plagued by the success of the originals - ground breaking film that spawned an entire culture that people are a living, breathing part of.  Because if this, some people will love, or hate, Rain Johnson's take on Star Wars.  I think it's a fantastic addition to the mythos; fun, the cycles of light and darkness, good and evil, and how the choices we make will impact those around us.  Worth seeing on the big screen.",1
1853,"SPOILERSTo kill Snoke was a good idea. Now Ren is in a leader role and it will be interesting to watch. Also I do not think that Rey need's a big backstory. Mace Windu has no backstory, Yoda hast no backstory and Obi-Wan has no backstory. Why should they be all related to eachother? Good action, music and amazing effects like always.I do not think that they should have killed Luke in this movie becouse now there is no posebility Rey is not turning to the dark side and she needs more training. And there were a few jokes that did not work for me or were on the wrong place. Also the Leia space scene looked awkward but was still a nice idea. The actors made a very good job. Adam Driver, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were just amazing.",1
1854,"Movie was So good, people complaining ABOUT this movie it's just ridiculous... I dont get how people can be mad at this amazing film, just shut Up and enjoy that star wars is as live and exiting as ever !",1
1855,"With welcome changes and countless surprises, the film manages to be nostalgic and new at the same time. Bold and surprising, it's sure to be a franchise classic.",1
1856,"The Last Jedi was UNBELIEVABLE! So Well-Made, Beautiful, Funny and just Amazing. Go see it as soon as you can!!! And AVOID spoilers like the plague until you do! Definitely very close in my ratings to The Empire Strikes Back.",1
1857,"Best SW movie after original trilogy. Absolutely loved the movie for its originality. it doesn't change the characters too much, but still let the audience see them develop into the people they'll become and have become.",1
1858,A great Star Wars movie with a lot of twists. Exactly what I hoped for and I am excited for Episode 9! Luke was pretty badass with his new force power. And I loved Rey trying to find her place in the story.,1
1859,"Going by the scores on here, you can tell that there is a clear divide with the critic and user scores, which is the same with The Force Awakens. I've seen people say that it's 'the worst Star Wars movie', which is a ridiculous comment to make when you look at what was in The Clone Wars (acting, script, tons of exposition, childish humour etc.)The Last Jedi is by no means a perfect movie and there are some story arcs which I feel weren't needed (Finn and Rose, for instance) and the whole casino segment felt very out of place, but I liked what they were trying to convey with this. Like in Rogue One, it shows that it isn't as clean cut as 'good v bad' and that there are many people out there looking to make money and that's it.On top of this, I also felt that the scene where Leia uses the force to float back into the ship just really didn't work. If they wanted to have her out of the picture whilst we're introduced to a new character, having her injured from a blast would've worked a lot better.With the negatives out of the way, I loved the scenes with Rey and Luke, loved the continued story of Kylo and how being under Snoke is affecting him even more and the battles both on ground and in space felt grand in scale. I particularly loved the opening scene and felt it was a great way to kick The Last Jedi off.Pacing wise, I loved it and aside from the casino scene, I was invested in where the story was going and more importantly, I didn't feel like all the key characters were devoid of any danger. It's definitely a film with flaws, but more importantly I enjoyed the film and will definitely go to scene it again. I grew up on the original films and The Empire Strikes Back is my all time favourite film, but I can appreciate where this story is going. The fans of this franchise are very, very passionate and I've expected there to be a split opinion with the user scores, but at the same time I am happy that the people behind this film will get the recognition they deserve.",1
1860,"THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEWFirst of all, wow, the fanbase is split down the center over this movie. I personally think it's crazy the people who criticized The Force Awakens for being ""too similar to A New Hope"" are largely the same people criticizing this movie for being ""too different"". Anyways, despite some parts being kind of meh, I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this movie greatly and that this is probably one of if not my favorite movie this year. The movie started out alright, and then as it went on it became something amazing. The acting is excellent. I don't think I can pick a favorite actor in this movie. The plot doesn't follow many of the big Star Wars tropes, and I think that's great. There is one or two times where the plot is a little too different, but for the most part it is an intriguing addition to the saga. About half of the big moments in the movie were really predictable, but the other half were pretty good. While I did laugh a lot at every good joke, I feel they went a little overboard with the amount comedy. The characters were very well done in this movie. By the end I truly cared about all of them. Also, can someone give the guy who choreographed all of the fights scenes a raise? Those scenes were incredibly exiting to watch. Unfortunately, many things from Force Awakens didn't seem to matter in this movie, and the loose ends that were tied weren't always brought to a very satisfying conclusion. Overall, this is a very good movie that isn't quite a 10/10 due to the somewhat slow beginning, some things from Force Awakens not having a good payoff, and a few other flaws.Edit: So, Nostalgia Critic just made a review for this movie, and his verdict is pretty much exactly what I thought of the movie: ""It was awesome except for when it was kind of dumb.""",1
1861,"The movie is simply wonderful. Star Wars The Last Jedi is a great continuation for the franchise, it is an extremely captivating film, it has scenes nostalgic and that make the public get thrilled. All characters have their screen time, developing in an exceptional way the old characters and the new characters. The film is beautiful (especially the scenes of space battles), director Rian Johnson surprised me with his work and his way of filming the scenes. Star Wars The Last Jedi leaves the public waiting for the next movie and curious about what is to come.Sorry for any errors in English. I'm brazilian",1
1862,"There are some cringeworthy moments on par with the material from the prequels. But the rest is good, very good. It's even occasionally amazing, and beyond anything achieved in the original trilogy. If anything it makes me wonder how far Johnson could have gone if he'd been allowed to really take the next steps, the studio was clearly worried about him going over too many people's heads. I'd rate it an 8/10 but had to bump it up to a 10 to cancel out the ridiculous hater/fanboy meltdown going on.",1
1863,This film does what is brave and new rather than safe and familiar. I am so thankful for filmmakers who are willing to fight the urge to simply seduce hardcore fans with empty promises.,1
1864,"WoW !! I didn't dream this could be so good. It's one for our side of the culture war, no more SJW stuff, cool battles. 2.5 hours of STAR WARS and no flipant feminist remarks. GREAT Humor, can't top this. 110/10 bless this movie.",1
1865,"Pure eye candy and fun times. This is exactly what I want from a Star Wars movie, great action humor and just enough cheese. It's obvious you can please everybody but this works for me.",1
1866,"I don't get the hate. Thought it was fantastic, everything worked very well for me. I thought it had a sense of urgency and intimacy that we don't get a lot of. Anyhow, I rarely post anything...I hate how the fans are treating this film.",1
1867,This Movie and the New hope are my top Star Wars Movies. The battle scenes are quite possibly the best of any sci fi movie out there and the Character development in incredible.,1
1868,Great movie! I love it. Almost my favorite Star Wars movie. The characters that develop and just... everything about it is awesome. And don't forget Daisy Ridley's beautiful smile! :),1
1869,"This film is about resistance through compassion and decency. It's about regret, fear of choices made in the past, irrelevancy, and growing old. It's about rising above or sinking below our origins. It's also a Star Wars movie that takes a lot of risks. The movie is a kick in the pants for the franchise. I adored it.",1
1870,"It's funny - I see people asking ""what movie did the critics watch"", and I'm over here wondering what movie THEY watched. The critics are bang on with their assessment here. This was awesome! I had my expectations beaten and lowered badly by these crappy user scores, and the movie delivered on the heart and action I would want from a Star Wars movie. I honestly don't get the negativity. I halfway think there's some sort of ""anti-SJW"" angle to it, which is really stupid if that's the case. Either that or people had trouble understanding or following what was going on. It's hard to say.  Actually the more I read reddit, the more I realize a lot of people didn't understand some of the plot points.  Some of them are pretty subtle.The movie isn't perfect - it has pacing issues for sure, and was too long in my opinion. It could have used some editing and some of the story arcs dragged a bit. But damn, the action was fantastic, and they put in some great plot twists and surprising moments (although I saw a couple of them coming) - it wasn't nearly as cut-and-dried fan service as TFA (although I loved that one too). Honestly, people are out to lunch with this negativity.Oh, and I also see complaints about the humor and jokes. Really? What series have you been watching all this time? There is a LOT of humor in Star Wars, and that's what makes it so damn entertaining. Get the sticks out of your butts.Lastly, please be aware that older fans of the franchise are capable of loving this movie (I'm a lifelong fan, 45 years old) - I think some folks assume all the negativity is coming from that age group, but that's not the case.",1
1871,"There are so many reviews that say this movie is garbage, and that it's not ""real star wars"". That is so false on so many levels. Yes, some people may be divided on the twists in this movie (i personally loved the new direction), but you cant say in any regard that this is an awful movie. Having grown up with the prequels i never felt that real love for star wars that people growing up in the 70s and 80s had. Now, with the Last Jedi, i understand it. SEE THIS MOVIE",1
1872,"The Last Jedi is the most light-hearted film in the entire saga. One can really see Disney's touch, but that doesn't mean that this film lacks what makes a good Star Wars film i.e. space battles and lightsaber duels.",1
1873,"Gran bel film, non capisco come mai i fan non l'abbiano apprezzato,forse perché è il primo film che osa, che cerca di cambiare qualcosa. Lo ritengo al pari della trilogia originale, complimenti al regista.",1
1874,One of the best Star wars movies to date.It won't in a different and much needed direction that other SW movie.Hope they make tee next episode just as good or even better.,1
1875,really extraordinary. Its true thats it is really different than the orginal films. But it doens't bother you because its refreshing. A new kind of story with new problems but there are still refrences to the past and thats just utterly amazing. This movie also suprises you in ways you coudln't imagine. This movie is there for the star wars fans who are open minded and appreciate new things. Because this movie was above my expectations.,1
1876,"A truly beautiful film. After seeing the discrepancy between the critics and the users I was hesitant to watch it, but I'm really glad I did. Great film.",1
1877,"This is overall a fantastic film!!! Great characters and world-building, however, it struggles with pacing and struggling to find anything for some side characters to do.",1
1878,"A phenomenally innovative and extremely ballsy entry to the series. The fact that many fans aren't appreciating it, is how you know it was a different, unexpected and high risk-taking film. Smarter, less ""black and white"" and more complex than any Star Wars film before it. Gives each and every character (new and old) a ton of dimension, deep motives and a reason to empathize with, even the wildlife and droids. Characters that were lame in The Force Awakens now have plenty of reason for us to care for them, and have worthy subplots that will be stuck in your mind long after viewing. Everyone is greatly tested. The film takes the series to new places, cracks open the flaws of Star Wars lore and questions them, further strengthening the story of the saga as a whole. The film has huge personality, not afraid to make fun of itself and to cast aside dopey fan theories in a way that feels almost meta. If you are a huge Wars fan but also desire something new from the series, this is your film. Long Live Supreme Leader Rian.",1
1879,"What an amazing movie! The movie has built many different scenarios and took off the focus of the main characters. As a matter of fact, the main solutions on the movie were done by those whom we couldn’t imagine. Beyond that, we could realize the importance of each character of the movie, and it made the movie more dynamic. The end of Luke Skywalker was perfectly built and acted. I would never think of a different ending.The footages were really nice and the soundtrack was fantastic (I mean, it’s a Star Wars movie). There were some plot twists and surprising moments.",1
1880,"(Minor spoilers): One of the best movies of 2017. While not perfect, it had me on the edge of my seat... I've never had a movie/theater experience like this before - I didn't know what was going to happen next. I can understand and respect why some would not like this movie. I used to be a die hard Star Wars fan who obsessed about lore details. As an adult I care more about moment to moment impact, emotion, humor, and surprise/wonder.. This movie surprised and moved me multiple times. (Spoiler) It feels like the movie and series are breaking from the tired old usual mold of Good vs. Evil, and into something different. We already had that story arc with episodes 1-6. (Jedi vs Sith, Empire vs Rebellion) To phrase what Luke said (in the trailers) it's time for the Jedi to end..",1
1881,this movie is very awesome i can't believe it. i want to see this movie again over. characters are very attract and awesome. this movie attracts all people,1
1882,"By far one of the best Star Wars movies. Completely different than any other the other movies and it definitely leads the series in new, more interesting, directions.",1
1883,"There are no perfect movies, but I'm giving 10 to The Last Jedi, because even with its imperfections it is the best of the franchise by far and a great movie for fans and not yet fans. Rian Johnson showed us what he imagined of the Star Wars universe and it was the best usage of its different creatures, society and the Force, opening a vast range of new posibilities and stories.Keep in mind that this is a movie, not a book. Its focus is on what is most important, so it won't answer all the questions, naturally. The movie give us everything we could ask for: amazing batles and fights (physical and emotional), interesting characters, great villian, mounting tension and unexpected plot events. Plus it is a lot of fun to watch as well, but not trying hard to be funny.Well done!",1
1884,"I loved this movie. My favorite action movie of the year and certainly on my top 10 for the year. Each of the central characters had an arc. I was definitely surprised at several places the film went but it made for a more personal story that actually had something to say which is pretty rare. The whole film looked absolutely gorgeous and I can't wait to see it again.I think it's really interesting that people seemed to see two different movies. The movie I saw had substance and was dripping with creativity and talent. I have a hard time understanding the negative reviews for the film, but I do not offhandedly reject the notion that some people might not like it.Kylo Ren and Rey are both fantastic in this movie and it even manages to make a character arc for Luke Skywalker, which while risky I think ultimately pays off in a big way.",1
1885,"This movie kicked ass, and I have to wonder if all of the haters have simply never watched good films outside of the Star Wars saga. What people keep complaining as ""wasted opportunity"" or ""not getting it"" is actually a brilliant, total re-examination of the stale formula that has gripped the entire series thus far. I don't want spoilers in this review, but the film has a VERY cohesive core point/message that every single negative reviewer here seems to have somehow completely missed out on (both contextually and in general).",1
1886,"Amazing movie. Some of the attempts at humor may not fall with some people, but the twists and turns the movie takes is amazing. Really surprising stuff, very different kind of Star Wars movie. Generally speaking, if you like Star Wars, you'll like this movie.",1
1887,"Brilliant, ballsy, and fresh. TLJ is the Star Wars film the sequels need and deserve. Subverts expectations and still excels, it really is unlike any other Star Wars film we've experienced.",1
1888,"A very good movie that rights the wrongs of TFA. The directing is top notch with great pacing and good acting, so I'm dumbfounded by how much hate there is within the USER SCORES because it's so much better than TFA. For myself.. TLJ is the 3rd best Star Wars film after ANH and even then it's almost on par with it. It really was enjoyable and I wasn't bored at any point like I was with TFA.Now for one scene which a lot of people are complaining about... Injured and unconscious Leia floating in space and then she wakes up to self rescues by launching herself towards the safety of a ship. It was a magical moment like a Superman moment. People seem to think that was farfetched... No it isn't, it should be common knowledge that Leia has force potential equal to her brother but has never really used it, until now. So calm down!!Okay, now among other complaints like dumb convenient situations... Uhm that is in all Star Wars movies... It's no excuse to dislike this or any Star Wars film especially when you call yourself a fan of the original trilogy, like so many unhappy reviewers have been stating.Luke Skywalker dying... why not? He over exerted himself with an insane feat. Don't worry people, Jedi like Luke are even more powerful when they ascend. It won't be the last we see of him.I scored this movie a 10 to level out the unfair scores people have been giving out. It's a 9 really. Let go of the hate and you will like TLJ.",1
1889,The movie is great. I  would give 9 because the first act is slow. But when it goes to the second act the movie grows and it's so great and beutifull. Very recommended.,1
1890,"A masterclass in glorious visual effects, stunning cinematography, and exquisite tension, this is an absolute must see at the cinema. With a storyline that is utterly captivating, and some powerful performances, this is a satisfying film for fans that delivers on its promises with ingenuity, providing some of the most awe inspiring cinema moments in recent memory that are sure to be revered in years to come. Whilst some dialogue is occasionally overly simplistic, the script is generally a delight that further endears us to characters we are now intimately familiar with, An experience that will stay with you well after you leave the theatre, I will certainly be seeing this again on the big screen. May the Force be with you. 9.46/10",1
1891,"I've read every single user review before doing mine, and it seems that there are too many dissapointed fans becuse of a reveal that I'm not going to spoil. Those who are dissapointed should rethink this again since this reveal has a great meaning for the kids that will see this movie.Now I can safely say that this movie is far better than Episode VII. Rian provided answers to most of what I wanted and some great twists to keep me engaged. I love Star Wars, but I only care about the episodes (the spin-offs just don't make the cut for me) so after waiting for two years for this movie I am happy to say it was worth the wait.DON'T LET THE HATERS OR ANGRY FANS GET INTO YOUR HEAD, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, GO. IF YOU DON'T THEN DON'T GO.",1
1892,"I have absolutely no idea how this film is getting bad ratings.Well actually, that's not true.  I do know.  Fanboys.I'm not sure what direction some of you wanted this movie to take, but as a lifelong fan of the series, old enough to see the original when it and I were still young I was delighted when Rey's turned out to NOT be the offspring of anyone prominent or shocking.I also felt that the handling of the Rey and Kylo's struggles with the force was spot-on, as was the explanation and exploration of Luke's failure.  The way each of these characters expressed subtle emotions and soul-searching in these scenes was night and day from Anakin Skywalker's ""turning"" in the prequels.  In fact, while I've never been as down on those movies as some, seeing similar scenarios and processes handled well, makes me feel worse for what those movies could have been.Could we have learned more about Snoke?  Sure.Did some of the last-ditch ""saves"" feel a bit stretched?  Indeed - but that's true of not just every Star Wars movie, but just about any film of this nature ever made.For the most part though, this movie was incredible.  It avoided being predictable, while being careful not to go with the polar opposite of the expected outcome often enough that it became crass.I'm not sure how you can watch this and say that the characters don't undergo development.  I mean, the way detractors are talking, you'd think the original trilogy fully explored Han Solo's history, background and motivation.  Do we even know how he became best friends with a Wookie?  Nope.  We didn't need to.  Tying up loose ends was my biggest issue with the prequels.  Boba Fett was cool because he had a menacing demeanor, a cool look and he was mysterious.  Knowing his backstory, literally removed one of his defining characteristics.Personally, I think TLJ stands with Empire as one of the greatest films in the series.Oh, and an enormous THANK YOU for returning Yoda to his wise but wryly mischievous self.  After the stilted, pompous, joyless, one-dimesional know-it-all that episodes I-III presented us with, it was literally a joy to see the restoration of my favorite character.",1
1893,"I'm quite surprised by how negative the feedback has been in terms of user reviews. I admit the movie has its flaws, pretty big ones at that. Finn and Rose's little adventure was just throwaway nonsense. Rose is a very dull and cliched character. The heroes introduced in force awakens didn't get as much screen time. The new resistance leader with the purple hair wasn't very interesting. It also has a slow start and the overall story about trying to escape from imperial ships was a bit pointless. Still, despite all of those criticisms I had a really great time watching it. There really are some fantastic moments and I appreciate the fact that this movie was clearly made for the fans. Ray and Kylo Ren in particular pulled me in. It didn't quite meet my expectations and struggled with pacing but overall it's a great movie and i'm excited to watch it again.",1
1894,"The Last Jedi is by far the best of the Star Wars Movies to come out in the last 30 years. The cast is amazing, the set pieces and visual effects are breathtaking. Mark Hamill's portrayal of Luke was spot on, and his story arc helped give the movie life. The emotional plot was perfect, and the many twists were created unexpected suspense. Best Star Wars movie ever made!!!!",1
1895,i do not know why there is so much negativity for this movie. i just got back what a movie i enjoyed it very much. cannot wait for the bluray and the next movie to come out. maybe i'm not a hard core star wars fan but when i get entertained for 2 1/2 hours then it was a great movie. if you all going to go by the ratings here then stay home.,1
1896,this is a great movie and is incredibly better that TFA and rouge one. if you like star wars you should definitely go see this movie now it is worth it. also most of the people are giving this movie bad reviews are racist and sexist men who do not want women or minorities to not play a lead role in star wars or any film. I would like to remind them that women and minorities have played major roles in star wars since the first film in 1977 and if you cant handle that this franchise isn't for you.,1
1897,"What a fantastic edition to the Star Wars universe. It is as fun and exciting as any Star Wars movie. It brings a new sense of wonder and mystery to the Force. And yet, at the same time, it wisely dares to explore new themes and to subvert genre tropes.The haters giving 0 reviews often complain that TLJ is ""Disneyfied"" and a ""kiddie"" movie. The major themes of this movie must have flown over their head. This is an uncompromising story about the disappointment and bitterness that encroaches on all of us as we age, mature, and reflect on our youth. Luke's conflict relation to the Jedi is all too familiar to any of us who have attached ourselves to noble but imperfect causes. I don't know too many kids who can relate to that.It's also the rare adventure movie that allows for the fact that heroics can be misguided. In TFA, Han chooses to go to lightspeed from within a hangar. (""Isn't that impossible?"" Rey asks. Han replies: ""I ask that after I've done it."") Surprise, surprise: Han's risk works. In contrast, in TLJ, hastily conceived plots don't work out the way our heroes hope. People have pointed out that Finn and Rose's side quest could be removed and the plot would end up in the same place. Perhaps that is the point--although more accurately, Finn, Rose and Poe actually make things worse by compromising Holdo's solid and unflashy plan! As Leia tells them, Holdo cares about the cause, not about acclaim for her heroics.These thematic elements breath new life into the expanding Star Wars universe. TFA felt like a warm familiar embrace, and I was happy for it. TLJ builds off of that goodwill, but then enters into dialogue with many of our assumptions about the world, themes, and morality of Star Wars. But in doing so, TLJ doesn't cheapen what came before: it deepens our appreciation of it.",1
1898,"I enjoyed this film very much the first time I saw it, but it doesn't benefit at all from repeat watches. It's flaws just become more pronounced.",1
1899,"I think Disney finally realized a huge part of the star wars fanbase is over 9 years old, this movie leaves you with  lot to think about and is definitely the best star wars movie I've ever seen and my sister, mom, and dad all agree. In fact this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, The only problem I had with it was the casino planet sequence. Also I believe all the 0-2 reviews left by fanboys are because Luke wasn't Yoda 2.0 and didn't do amazing flips and blow up spaceships with his mind smh... I feel sorry for anyone who didn't enjoy this movie but I have a hard time believing they honestly think this movie deserved a 0, 1 or 2 because they've obviously finished the movie and anything under a 3 isn't worth staying till the end for, another thought is this completely deviates from the original trilogy, you know the children's movie where a boy grows up and learns to swordfight with his pet robot and fuzzy animal friend. I can imagine in the 70s the original trilogy being considered a great kids movie but the last Jedi is a different beast entirely and will have you thinking on whole new levels as in not everything and everyone is completely good or evil. The conflict within Luke's mind is for lack of a better word realistic. I mean did some people expect this movie to be about Luke destroying armies with his mind and being some type of zen God? I mean think about what he has witnessed, maybe it would be better if the Jedi were dead? I hate it for the bad reviewers cause I wish that they saw what I did or at least enjoyed it in someway. All I can hope for is Disney listens to the less vocal majority of people who truly loved this film and I hope they stay the course",1
1900,"I would give this film a 9 but i'm going to try and balance out the user score.I loved this film, it was brave enough to take these beloved characters in fresh and unexpected directions as well as tell a story in such a way that many modern blockbusters wouldn't dare attempt. Mark Hamill deserves an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Luke, such a heavy performance that expertly conveys the loss and hopelessness that Luke feels. Ridley, Boyega and Isaac were great once again with another stand-out being Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, furthering a character that is quickly overtaking Darth Vader as the best Star Wars villain.However there are flaws present particularly with the casino sequence feeling out of place and a few narrative hiccups here and there but i'm willing to look past them as the challenging and risky feel of this movie threw me completely off guard and was exactly what this saga needed 40 years after the original.",1
1901,"Clearly this film is divisive, and its easy to understand why.  Even among those that did not enjoy the movie, many still agree that it is exciting and well acted. Most who didn't like it tend to take issue with its near disregard for the sanctity of the series.  It is a challenging movie, a movie that exists in a moral grey area when Star Wars largely up till this point has dealt in absolutes, blacks and whites.  But to me that is invigorating.  The prequels were criticized for their poor special effects, poor plotting and dialogue, poor acting, and overall not ""feeling"" like Star Wars movies, with the exception of Episode III which began to approach the feeling of the original trilogy.  We want a movie that feels like the original trilogy, many fans said.  Then came along The Force Awakens, with great actors, great dialogue, great practical effects and sets, and which returned the series to the kind of story and plotting fans had been asking for.  But then came the criticisms that it was too derivative, played things safe, and didn't try anything new.  Now with The Last Jedi, we have a movie with the fine acting, spectacular action, practical sets, shot on film, which takes risks, moves the series in new directions, and broadens our understanding of the force, the light and the dark side, and what it means to be a hero.  Yet there are criticisms - how dare they change this, how dare they make this character act in this way, how dare they challenge what I thought I knew...it hardly seems fair to me.I believe there exist fans who did not like the prequels, who thought The Force Awakens was too derivative, and now are up in arms about The Last Jedi.  To any fan that finds themselves in that position, I ask: what do you want?  I do not mean that flippantly, but genuinely.  What is this Star Wars movie you have in mind that you have yet to see?  Because if only the original trilogy is worthwhile in your estimate, than perhaps you do not like the movies as movies as much as you like the fandom that comes along with them.  The original trilogy is not perfect, and a lot of criticisms that have been directed towards the prequels and the sequels should, and have been directed at the originals.  They are intentionally derivative of older works, much of the special effects do not hold up, the acting is often suspect, and on and on.  But they are fun, and they are cherished, and they mean something to many.I think the problem with Star Wars is that its such a huge universe full of so many possibilities, that sometimes when something in the universe doesnt conform in the way an individual imagined it should, it makes them very upset.  But if you asked 100 different fans  what should happen with a certain character, or which direction a certain plot should go in, you might very well receive 100 different answers, so how do you begin to please everyone.  You can't so you have to make the movie you would want to see, and hope that its a movie that resonates with the fans.  In this case, I think Johnson made the movie he would like to see, which is one that does not play it safe and which challenges its audience to think, consider, and discuss.If you have not yet seen the movie, I would suggest going in with an open mind, and trying to enjoy where the movie takes you, not dwell on how closely the movie confirms to where you hoped it would take you.And if you dont like it, and you didnt like TFA, and you didnt like the prequels, then I guess you'll just have to write your own Star Wars script and try to get it made.",1
1902,"Can't believe some of the comments on here. Clearly, people are just angry their fan theories didn't come true. This film makes Star Wars fresh while providing an homage to what came before, as far back as the prequels. I really couldn't ask for much more, and I'll be damned if these bitter fanboys slander this film without response.",1
1903,"It's hard to talk about the movie without revealing spoilers, but it is excellent and a massive improvement over Episode VII. Deserves a lot of praise.",1
1904,"Star wars the Last Jedi is the boldest and riskiest star wars films to date. As result we have gotten one of the most exhilarating cinema experiences of the last decade. Nothing I expected to happen happened leaving me in awe, I have seen many viewers disliking this movie as result of it subverting their own head cannon. But too me and I am sure many the risks this movie took really heighten it above other star wars movies. While the plot is somewhat lacklustre, this movie instead focuses on the characters letting Rey, Kylo and Luke shine. Additionally what allows this movie to have a leg up on other star wars movies is the sense of urgency felt throughout the movie (Besides the Rose and Finn Subplot which is definitely the worst part about the movie) you are truly on the edge of your seat throughout the movie unsure about who will make it through to  episode 9. While there are some weak moments there are many amazing moments throughout that definitely outweighs the weak. I cant forget to mention how gorgeous this movie looks, one of the many highlights of the movie is that it is a visual masterpiece.",1
1905,"Absolutely stunning, it is the best in the series. Incredible action and gorgeous imagery. The cast is impeccable (bar maybe Benicio Del Toro's DJ, who doesn't quite work) and the central narrative between Kylo Ren and Rey has some of the absolute best scenes ever from Star Wars. I don't know who these people are that saying it's the worst ever. It's the best.",1
1906,"I truly do not understand the hate being thrown at this film. This feels like the only thing that could have possibly followed something like episode 7 - the entire theme of the film was ""Out with the old and in with the new"" and the message wasn't just for the Galaxy, wasn't just for the franchise, but was also for us in our own society. I felt that the weakest point of the film was definitely the casino scenes, but I'm very sure they will tie this into a future plot and I was also thrilled to see more universe and lore expansion happening in a main series. I cannot wait for the final installment and part of me can't wait for the Skywalker stories to come to an end so we can see what else this rich universe can show us. To all for you out there who hated this film: Take a deep breath and remember that it wasn't ever about you anyway.",1
1907,"All this negativity is why we can't have nice things. TFA was too close to the originals and the fans hated it, now TLJ is too far and they hate it. There's no winning. Honestly my rating is a 8.8/9, but someone needs to offset all the 0's. Could have used a little less humor, let us live a little more in the emotion of the moment. That being said at least the jokes worked. SW has always been a little cheesy, and that's okay, but in my opinion they slightly cheapened the maturity of this entry. I liked the movement away from the black and white morality of the series, towards something more real and adult. This is a Star Wars film that's finally willing to acknowledge the grey areas, and I think the series is better for it. Yeah, there are still a lot of toy commercials in this, but it's SW, what do you expect?All the things you want from the series are here. Space battles, ground battles, adventure, excitement, heroes and villains. The spectacle of it all is amazing, if not a little overlong. The saber duals featured here are by far the best choreography the series has ever seen. No spoilers, but about 2/3 of the way through is a sequence that I don't think Lucas could have conceived on his best day. These expected moments are solid, but what this film really has going for it is when it steps away from those expectations. To start with there's actual character development, believable and relatable character growth! TLJ features some of the most nuanced people I've seen in a major studio franchise film. Finn could have used a little more to work with, but his B-story is still fun, and has some payoff for the future of the series. What always made Han so great was that he felt like a real person dropped into this fantastic world. His presence is missed, but Rey and Kylo make up for this in spades.This finally feels like a new direction for the series, and as someone who grew up with the original trilogy, I'm happy to move beyond the characters that shaped my childhood. Those characters are still here, and feel so much more real than they ever have before. You can feel the weight of 30 years of war on all of them, especially when you look in Luke's eyes. Life seldom turns out the way you expect it to, and this movie acknowledges that. I think this sentiment is the exact reason so many have trouble with the film, they want a simple story of good versus evil. They want the heroes that they know and love to be challenged, but they also want it to be safe. This movie is not safe. It wants you to see beyond the space opera conflict. To see that the universe is larger than Rebels and Empires. It wants to break the cycle and become something more. I applaud the audacity of this, and enjoyed every moment in the theatre.",1
1908,"I really understand when people don't like it because it follows the same Empire Strikes Back format. But in this one, it's so well done and it also brings so many new features and simple but great plot twists that I really don't care at all. Of course Disney will rely on a safe formula, they don't want to do what George Lucas did to the franchise. The movie managed to deliver what the fans wanted to see, expected to see and they also managed to surprise everybody. Maybe they were too hard with Luke and maybe the second act could have a better rhythm or be shorter. Those are the reasons I don't give a 10 to the movie. But it's really good!",1
1909,"I will update this with a more in-depth review later on, so as to avoid choking the net with spoilers. In short: I loved it. It had weak moments, but where it was strong, it was strong. I can see why lots of people hate it, but it was needed to set the ground work for everything that is to come. If you loved Rogue One and Empire, you will likely really love this entry in the series. It is compelling, fraught with peril, danger, and sacrifice.",1
1910,"The Last Jedi lives up to the hype. Easily one of the best movies of the year due to stunning visuals, great storytelling, humor, and uniqueness. It is very different from the original trilogy, but that's what makes this movie refreshing to see. Star Wars fan or not, this is a must see.",1
1911,"Absolutely, truly magnificent. Star Wars The Last Jedi is the connoisseurs Star Wars movie. Thank you Rian Johnson, you just delivered the best possible early Christmas present!",1
1912,Shocked by the number of poor reviews.  It was a great mixture of nostalgia and the new.  I have to agree with the critics on this movie.  A worthy addition to the Star Wars saga.,1
1913,"I thought this was one of the best Star Wars movies.  I understand why some fans are conflicted, but it really does hit all the right notes for me.  Brought me to tears a few times and was lots of fun along the way.",1
1914,"I have been a lifelong fan of Star Wars and this is hands down the BEST Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes back! The battles were absolutely edge of your seat intense from the very start. I loved the attention to detail in all the props and costumes and CGI. The new characters were great and as Luke states in the teaser, ""this (movie) is not going to go the way you think!""I have minor gripes but I won't go into spoilers. They could have trimmed some time from scenes. I believe there was line in that was intended to be comedic but fell a bit flat. Other than that, this was an absolute triumph! I cannot for the life me understand why some fans have given it such a negative review other than there is a certain subsection of our society which have all lost their minds at the moment. So take their reviews with a gigantic grain of salt.",1
1915,"Incredibly beautiful movie. Loved the characterization of the characters and even some that fans hated. Loved Luke, Rey and Kylo. War scenes and fight scenes are amazing. Rose and Fins bit in the movie is unnecessary to the plot of the film. Rose herself is an unnecessary character given way too much screen time and importance.",1
1916,"I would say this is now my second favourite movie in the whole franchise (may become my favourite but need to watch this one as many times as I have the others to make a fair call on that one) and being in my late 20's this is the best SW film I have seen in a cinema. Adam Driver is much less of an angry-teen-type as Kylo Ren in this one and I loved seeing the ""light""er side of him. The space battles in this movie gave me anxiety but in a good way, I didn't know whether to close my eyes or sit on the edge of my seat. When I thought about it on the way home some of the lesser characters arcs seemed to be a bit unnecessary but I think they exist to serve the idea that not everyone has to be some revered hero. I got very emotional seeing some older characters return but also was wow'ed by the new sets. The standout part of the film for me was the costume design particularly on some of the newer, more red enemies. I will definitely be watching this a couple more times at the Cinema and I cannot wait to get this on a home release so I can pick it apart even more.",1
1917,"Its a good movie have several good moments, but haven't the previous Star Wars essence. Its more a new star, more than TFA. The 10 its to equilibrate the rat bad critics.",1
1918,"Brilliant film, made me very emotional in certain parts. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. Really excited at the prospect of seeing it for a second time!",1
1919,"When the fan-base is incensed, you know someone is doing something right. I enjoyed this movie, and I'm delighted to see Star Wars carry gravitas and emotional weight again.",1
1920,"I saw the midnight showing of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and I absolutely loved it. I won’t drone on and on about it but I will say that I am so happy that the movie didn’t play it as safe as ‘The Force Awakens’ did (and that’s not to knock TFA, I really enjoyed that movie) but it did regurgitate a lot from ‘A New Hope’. In this one, we get a lot of creative twist and turns, engaging story arcs, some genuine surprises and an abundance of thrilling action sequences.While I could nitpick about certain bit moments, the only thing I wasn’t really crazy about some scenes involving Finn’s subplot - those could have been handled better, in my opinion. That said, I am so happy with this movie. I will definitely be seeing this one multiple times in the theaters.",1
1921,"Nice movie ,I love star wars.This is a great new part in the family saga of Skywalkers.There aren’t enough words to express how much I LOVED star wars  It is mind-blowing! I’m in geek heaven!",1
1922,"Star Wars VIII was brilliant. I do not understand why other audiences are so disappointed. It was remarkable, the characters, the development, the story lines etc. It was magnificent. It kept me on the edge of my seat.",1
1923,"The new Star Wars episode is unique. It has great sense of humor. The movie have everything what a movie need. Humor, action, legends, next level of Jedi and Sith clash. If its a new beginning of the franchise, i will be very glad. Wonderful, amazing sightscenes. Good job Johnson!",1
1924,"If episode 7 was a love letter to past movies then episode 8 throws the old rules out the exhaust port.  This is a beautifully directed, written, and acted movie.  Nothing will be as you expect; Luke wasn't kidding when he said ""This isn't going to go the way you think.""  This movie is bound to be divisive, but it moves the series in exciting new directions.Go in as blind as you can and enjoy one of the best movies of 2017.",1
1925,"Amazing!!I had low expectations, when going to the theater, but I was happy to be proven wrong! A lot of instances are simply EPIC and the design, overall quality is great!",1
1926,"I am a life long fan who was appalled at the prequels. I had very low expectations for Episode 7 and it was good, but I felt it was lacking. Rogue One was my favorite movie since the originals, and now Disney has delivered a work I believe deserves a place in my top three. This is the first movie that I feel actually scores on par with the original three movies. Do not listen to the naysayers. Frankly, I've read the bad user reviews and I cannot find any coherency in the outrage, nor do I share any of their opinions.This movie does something that Star Wars has been lacking since the original 3 movies. It stands alone, yet is part of a greater story.SPOILERS TO FOLLOW:I have heard people complain about the casino planet. I found it refreshing that Star Wars would take on something as cerebral as arms manufacturers and point out that wars are always armed by the same people who are just exploiting division.I have heard people complain that Snoke was wasted....... Snoke was never necessary in the first place. We didn't need another emperor. They could have just brought back clones of the true emperor. There was so much emotion in the scene with Snokes death. It was the perfect end.I've heard people complain about Luke, but these people have obviously never explored any of the written works that were once cannon and are not now. Luke was always going to be tempted by the dark side and haunted by it well for he removed all the instruments of the dark from the universe (except for Snoke, whom I believe was a terrible character to begin with and one of my pet peeves from Episode 7. However, we could have used a little more back story, but I digress). There must be balance, and without balance Luke starts seeing the dark in Kylo Ren. He almost strikes Kylo down in anger. Brilliant. Luke was never perfect. I wanted to see his flaws, and this installment did not disappoint.I've heard people complain that Luke didn't show off his power. What do you call him appearing from across the galaxy as he meditates on the ocean world of Ahch-To. I mean come on, not even Yoda pulled off a stunt like that. I'm glad they didn't have him bouncing around like a buffoon the way they did with Yoda in the prequels. I love the fact that they refocused the Force as a religion, and that Luke becomes a proponent of the death of the old religion. There has to be balance. The Jedi were not balance. The Jedi lead to the Sith. There answer is somewhere in between, and I hope that Episode 9 expands upon this.All in all, Episode 8 is now top 3 Star Wars movies of all time.",1
1927,"People seem to be angry because they didn't do a remake of the original trilogy like they did with TFA, or they actually developed the characters from the original trilogy nor did they fulfill their ridiculous theories. There seems to be a large portion of the ""old fans club"" who don't seem to want to see anything new. And there's nothing wrong with disliking the film, but to pour the same amount of vitriol that I see in these reviews is just childish.It's literally the reason I made this account. (Hello, by the way)And for reference, I too grew up with Star Wars, actually learnt English from it, played all the games and watched the series. I'm a fanboy too.The film uses many plot twists and subverts the traditional ""hero with an unlikely plan saves the day because he's the hero dammit"" trope and is actually realistic about losses and such. Making realistic strategy work and the emphasis on sacrifice refreshes the action scenes leaves anticipation as to what will happen next and who will survive.Some scenes in particular just mesmerised the whole theatre, the set design, animation, choreography and general aesthetic of the whole film is just beautiful.Also, Kylo Ren is probably the best character from this trilogy, most certainly better than any prequel arcs.There's no such thing as a perfect film, but this film does enough right to merit the high score,I'd say its biggest flaw is probably the set up for Luke, I disagree that he would run away like that (not a spoiler, seen in the previous film), however, I enjoyed how the film continued his story at the end. Ditto Admiral  Holdo, both could have been handled better but I liked how their characters evolved.I can't do 9.5 so I'm rounding it to ten. Equal to a New Hope, not as good as TESB.",1
1928,"I would rate this film 9/10 for a Star Wars Film, though i admit there are some elements of the film that don´t land that well. What i can´t believe are this 0/10 reviews. That simply makes no sense. I can´t believe how angry these people are because the film didn´t go their way. Overall I am really happy with direction the saga took to move forward. I find Kylo Ren a truly fascinating character and I´m really looking forward to se where this all leads to. So I´m giving it a 10 to compensate for this 0 nonsense (probably a 10 is nonsense as well but we really need a balance)",1
1929,"A masterpiece, thanks Disney, Rian and Kathleen Kennedy for the ride. This was the best Star Wras movie ever. Prequel fans will hate this, but that speaks for itself.",1
1930,"Dissapointed at first watch. Better on second viewing. Respected the movie for its originality. It doesn't change the characters too much, but still let the audience see them develop into the people they'll become and have become. Rian Johnson brought something new to the table!",1
1931,"Best Star Wars film made as of yet. Everything about this movie was incredible, aside from minor issues. Every performance, the multiple extremely engaging plot points and insanely awesome character arcs and bonds, the ridiculously amazing fight scenes and chase scenes with the most stunning CGI, the humour and general Star Wars banter between characters and the creatures within the galaxy, the as-ever intense battle between the First Order and the rebels... usually I go in depth when reviweing a film, but the 5000 character limit holds me back. The only thing which I think they could've handled better was the way they scripted Finn, as I was kind of disappointed at the way his storyline ended. 100% go and see this film, regardless of whether you know what Star Wars is or not. I shed a tear.",1
1932,The movie is far from perfect and deserves more than a 5 overall rating from the users. The first half is kind of annoying with its tone and pacing but after thats out of the way the movie is very enjoyable.,1
1933,"I cannot believe how off the user reviews are for this film thus far. I'll keep mine simple and spoiler free: this was the best Star Wars film, with the best cast, the best acting, the best writing, and the most compelling and nuanced story of the series. All of that, and still with the adventurous spirit and excellent production design that the series is known for.",1
1934,"Best movie in the series! No complaints at all! Honestly, It gave me answers I wanted and left me wanting more Star Wars! I can't wait til Episode 9 AND the Han Solo movies! WONDERFUL JOB DISNEY!!!",1
1935,"If you have your headcanon, forget it before you watch this movie. Do not come with preconceptions. You will love it. This is very different, yet one of the greatest Star Wars movies of all time.",1
1936,"I am big fan of Star Wars. Love this universe. And this film was awsome. Story, characters, actions all this at the highest level. Looked at one go. My favorite film! So cool! A lot of their ideas and innovations, courageous moves. The original trilogy is felt, but the Last Jedi surprises with its plot turns and what is happening. It was unexpected and interesting.",1
1937,"This is a great hate campaign against Disney orchestrated on **** and through the facebook group. Well done guys, just a few of you with multiple accounts can achieve so much! Oh by the way the movie was awesome I've seen it twice already and plan on going again. You just need to strap in and enjoy the ride! Talk to someone in real life who has actually seen it and don't worry about thE negative fan reviews to get a real idea of the movie.",1
1938,"First of all it's my first review and I don't want to make furious anyone. For my opinion if we divide Episode VII and VIII we can totally find differences in all aspects. I think it based on work of director(J. J. Abrams was changed by Rian Johnson). And for me this change gives great result in common. And now step by step:1. I'll recommend you watch Star Wars: Episode VIII in IMAX cinemas because for my opinion it's the best way how feel and be imbued with this film. Audio and picture are in directly high level. IMAX will help you find it.2. When I had watched previous episode I definitely understood that this film will be some kind introduction to the new trilogy and in the next one we'll see something great. And it was right think. The plot is testing your nerves throughout the film and you never know what will be next, maybe In this aspect I thought about II and III episodes because plots of them were absolutely amazing. In my childhood, when I watched them, I was very worried about what would happen next. My body was shaking but my mind wanted more. Yesterday I felt same feeling so for me it's great success.3. Cast. The new picture will continue to introduce new characters like Finn, Rey, Po, etc.(And actors coped with this task) But like a previous part of the saga it will also satisfy the appetite of old-school Star Wars fans and me actually too ( =)  )For conclusion I want add that we don't know about next part but I feel if they continue working in this direction(RIGHT DIRECTION) we will see absolutely amazing IX part of Star Wars saga.My score - 10/10",1
1939,"Ignore the trolls. This is the best Star Wars movie since Empire. It has everything. You won't be able to look away from the screen. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll cheer. Trust me, this one is IT.",1
1940,"I've been a fan of Star Wars all my life and was so excited for this movie, and I'm pleased to say I was beyond satisfied. The action sequences were amazing, visual effects were stunning and the characters were phenomenal. Even just looking at it as a sci-fi, action movie I was very pleased with this movie, highly recommend it.",1
1941,"It's simple and dosen't try to explain everything, just like the OT. The PT ""ruined"" that and everybody moaned, now they don't do that and every body moans. HAHASNoke is snoke, a powerful force user that controls the First Order and Kylo Ren, that's it. Just like Palpatine even in ROTJ was the emperor that had force powers and controled Vader and the empire, that's it. But Snoke is dispatched without ceremony and the ""Vader"" of this generation gets to be the ""emperor"". The Sith are not ""explained"" in the OT none of it is, The Knights of Ren neither.In ANH Luke was a nobody that was the son of a powerful user, Rey is someone that everybody thinks it's linked to that but it isn't, or is Kylo lying? In ESB half of the audience didn't believe Darth Vader why should Kylo be telling the truth?.Obi Wan was a jedi knight that did nothing except confront vader and become all powerfull, Luke just did the same and in a cooler way.In Ahn there's no reference to what controls what, nobody knows the extension of the empire, where the throne world is, nothing , neither on ESB.ETC ETC ETCMan , this movie is everything a Star Wars fan would want. Almost nothing got explained in the OT, just that luke was vaders and leias sister in the second and third movie.I'm really happy they didn't explain a damn thing. This isn't grey's anatomy, this is STAR WARS.The fanbase is spoiled if they want exposition. The emperor never nedeed exposition to be powerful.I may be in the minority but this IS the way SW should be.",1
1942,"I absolutely loved this addition to the franchise. As a Star Wars fan of over 25 years, this was a really refreshing change. The movie was fun, engaging and I really loved all the characters. There were some moments that I'm not 100% sure about, but the movie had so much to offer I need a second helping to full digest it. It's very much a movie for a younger generation and it's about the NEW cast, for me that's wonderful as the old cast had their time in the sun and they are helping to world build and bring in these new ones in the best ways possible. Let go of your hate, and see this movie as soon as you can.",1
1943,"EPIC. Hands down, the most beautiful Star Wars movie ever made. In my opinion, Hollywood has lost some of its...imagination in recent years. A 're-hash' of this, a copy of 'that', mentality. Not this movie, finally, a studio took a preconceived, and up until now, cookie cutter George Lucas episodic Star Wars franchise and turned it upside down, on its own head. Bravo, Disney! I, and many others commend You! Rian Johnson had the vision, tenacity, and resolve to take this Saga where it needed to go, into the uncomfortable tragedies, and the unknown futures of characters, new and old. His vision is a mix of black, white and the color of red blood sand (with salt) palette, of death and destruction. A Rebellion, still clinging to ""Hope"", pursued by the ultimate evil. Mr. Abrams I do not envy you, and the task at hand. For finding your vision, to the conflict in this trilogy. As I, and am sure many others, would like the Star Wars trilogies to continue. Good luck, and may the force be with you, always...",1
1944,"Despite being a bit long (150 minutes), Rian Johson delivered one of the most epic episodes of the saga. He managed to make a somewhat kid-friendly film but appealing to young and adult audiences. Lots of questions are still open to the IX episode.",1
1945,"Rian Johnson did it. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is truly a masterpiece and by far my favorite Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi is definitely the darkest of all Star Wars films, but it contains 3 great new characters and the perfect amount of comedic relief to keep the audience happy throughout the film. Seriously, it is undoubtedly the funniest Star Wars ever. Don't think the movie is all jokes though. Rian Johnson delivered a film with a ton of action and scenes emotional enough to leave some fans in tears. The Last Jedi is the only Star Wars film I have ever almost cried during. Not only that, but the film gives the audience some of the most jaw-dropping moments ever to be seen in a Star Wars film. Luke Skywalker was right: ""This is not going to go the way you think."" Overall, Star Wars The Last Jedi is a grand slam. Rian Johnson has delivered a Star Wars film that is incomparable to any other movie in the series. He took a big risk with this film, but it was risk I am happy he took. I have already seen The Last Jedi twice and can't wait to see it again: it's that good!Pros:- Tons of action- Epic plot twists / shocking moments- Clearly not a copy of The Empire Strikes Back- Nostalgia- Very emotional scenes- Great new charactersCons (if I had to pick one):- A couple very small, unimportant plot holesVerdict:Sound/Visuals - 5/5Plot/Characters - 5/5Structure - 5/5Acting - 5/5Overall - 100%",1
1946,"This is easily one of the best Star Wars films. I write that as a huge Star Wars fan, but also a someone who understands that the quality of Star Wars films tends the be iffy. The visuals, sound, and production design are all top notch. The pacing and story fit perfectly with the mechanics of the universe, but still subvert expectations. I truly believe this movie will be appreciated as time passes. So many people are upset that their beloved theories were wrong, and are ignoring all of the amazing things Rian Johnson does in this film. Give it a chance.",1
1947,"I'm going to be direct, and if haters start their pestilent attacks with who they liked, fo ***, I LIKED A LOT OF THE MOVIE!I'm going to keep kicking. Forgive me, but the Luke he built is FOR MIN, incredible. I think Mark was attached to the classic Luke, but this Luke is the result of all that has happened to all the jedi. He erred just like all jedi, feared the dark side like all jedi, isolated himself just like all others, redeemed himself with strength, because he understood that the Force is not only in a reclusive group, and became a legend - A legend that endures in all the stories in several galaxies that make him the greatest hero in the galaxy, and the reason to catch the rebels shattered by the New Order, and instead of fleeing or being slaves like the boy, fight. Karamba.",1
1948,"This movie is so poorly written and has so many plot holes and out of place jokes it hard to feel any emotion whatsoever.  Seriously, I can think of at least a dozen story breaking plot holes just off top of my head!",0
1949,"Simply embarrassing. That's the best word to describe it.The Force Awakens created a lot of mystery and, even though it wasn't the most original Star Wars movie, it was an actual Star Wars movie. This? Doesn't answer the mysteries, it just removes them. Porgs, Luke drinking alien tit milk, Poe remorselessly killing, Holdo allowing the majority of the Resistance to be killed, ""it's salt"".. so many weird and bad decisions.There were a few real Star Wars moments, that brought chills, a few amazing views (way less than the Force Awakens), but also more copying and more unoriginality. And so much empty story it was insane! For every good minute there were at least 25 bad minutes..",0
1950,"This felt like a comedy roast of Star Wars. Apparently having the force now means you can do literally anything. Kylo Ren is a terrible villain, Luke Skywalker didn't ever even leave the planet he was on to help and most of the ideas are either flawed or copied from the previous films. The Last Jedi was cheesy and superficial. This wonderful franchise is pretty much dead.",0
1951,"Clearly the worst Star Wars movie. It's boring, messy storyline, lazy writing, obvious plotholes, wasted characters, ridiculous scenes (you know what I’m talking about), no real lightsabre duels, that pointless **** sidestory on the casino planet, Rey is a cardboard Mary Sue, the condescending matriarchy of the rebellion made me root for the First Order, the too earthly politics (I see Star Wars to get away from that crap), the lame gotcha twists and the strange nihilistic undertone. And no, it’s not “different”, it’s the same unimaginative rehash of scenes and plots like they did in TFA.They clearly don’t have a story arc or any idea what they want to do with the trilogy, except making money.The Galaxy far far away is supposed to be this amazing place full of interesting characters, cool new worlds, funky aliens and new adventures around every corner. The Disney sequel galaxy is a boring little place inhabited by a handful of uninteresting characters.Good things: Hmmm. I liked the porgs. No, really.",0
1952,"I guess we should all take in a deep breath, lean back on our chairs, and finally realise that this movie destroyed the Star Wars franchise as we knew it.To say it's a bad movie in of itself, isn't enough. But even people coming into this 'new' Trilogy with only a passing knowledge of what came before must have left the cinema (or ejected their Blu-Ray) had to realise that everything this movie 'is' dismisses almost everything established in the prior 7 films.To the point that I (personally) have no desire to find out what happens in the next (and final) instalment of this 3 movie 'saga'.First off, the original (and prequel) trilogy had defined gaps between them in terms of time within the narrative.We came into each of their 2 sequels knowing the characters had developed and matured in various ways which would be explored and used to propel the narrative going forward. It's how you retain an investment, when you're waiting 3 years between the films (2 years in the case of the 'new' trilogy), that their is a character arc that extends through the timeframe and allows the audience to go through that journey too.However, TLJ (The Last Jedi) simply continues straight after TFA and so their isn't any unwritten (but inherently understood) character development at all.And it's that fundamental issue that permeates the entire movie.Then we come to insane plot devices, insane choices made by characters, and insane levels of unexplained major plot points... Plot points that either completely contradict ideas established in TFA (and to a lesser extent the earlier trilogies), or contradict ideas I/you/we as the audience have logically concluded.I could sit here and just define 20 things that pop into my head that either ruin the franchise, ruin the ideas establised in TFA, or ruin any hope that the final film will tie it all up and explain why things happened as they did.Makes you wonder if Carrie Fisher died of a broken heart after realising the number of nails her performance hammered into the coffin that the Star Wars franchise now lies within...",0
1953,Destroyed Star Wars for me. This SJW **** Rey can do everything without training. The purple haired leader for the rebels wants to first get all her soldiers killed before she does anything. Makes no sense. They destroyed Luke his character. He wanted to take the most evil person in the galaxy a.k.a. Darth Vader back to the light. But oh no his nephew has dark thoughts. Let's kill him. That is not Luke his way. This movie is garbage,0
1954,"[SPOILERS] Oh man, this is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. This is so poorly written and thought out that I can't even comprehend the stupidity with this film. Rian Johnson has absolutely 0 understanding of Star Wars and how the force is suppose to work; especially when it comes to the Jedi and the Sith. I'm not sure the dude has ever read a Star Wars book in his life. This was complete trash. The dude needs to read a few books, get high as **** and then watch every movie 1-6. Maybe then he will realize how poorly thought out this movie was. Unless Kylo was intentionally hiding his true power from Snoke by means of the force and intentionally looking weak then the death of Snoke makes absolutely 0 sense. Palpatine used the force to hide the presence of the dark side in him from the Jedi until he was finally able to rise to power and reveal him self as the Lord of the Sith. Sure, he killed his master in his sleep, but only after learning everything plagueis taught him or at least was willing to teach.I hope this is a similar case with Kylo or this final trilogy is doomed.",0

I didn't find this dumpster fire as insulting as The Force Awakens, which was just a soulless remake of A New Hope, with the primary intention to make a quick buck. I only wish director Rian Johnson had gone further to alienate fans and newcomers to the saga, by going full-retard like he did in the 3rd act. Like an unintentional version of Spaceballs, the final 20 minutes was pure comedy. Star Wars was dead the moment Lucas sold Lucasfilm to the Disney empire, in 2012.",0

How can this movie achieve universal acclaim is beyond me.Plot holes galore, poor humour, and really unbearable to watch midway. I've watched tons of movies and sadly episode 8 got me so bored that I was looking around and wondering when this movie will end. Sad to see the way such an amazing story go down like that.

Rey's origins- Finn's arc with Phasma).I feel sad they destroyed a universe my family and I enjoyed for three generations.",0
1964,"It's objectively a horrible movie. Any ""professional"" critic that gave this movie a decent score should be fired from their job or investigated for accepting bribes from Disney. There are obvious issues that any critic should be pointing out: inconsistent tone, breaking the laws of the established universe, embarrassing dialogue, ridiculous actions of characters, major plot holes, etc. It's very misleading for critics to take what is obviously just a bad movie and call it ""ambitious"" or ""different"". It's as if a really talented high school film student wrote the 1st draft of the script and that's what Disney went with. It's an abomination. We as a society should actually be saddened that so many people liked this movie.I look at blockbuster movies and I see a trend, the companies creating this ""entertainment"" must believe their audience doesn't care about story. Somewhere along the way movie companies stopped believing in order to make money they needed to tell a good story and make a great movie. The very substance that made movies appealing and fun to watch is missing from film today. It's all spectacle without any heart or brain.",0

1967,"A terrible mess of a film, with continuity and canonical issues galore. It is evident now that the soul has been ripped out of the franchise. This is made all the more apparent with the use of socio-political tropes such as the attempt to further the SJW agenda - present throughout the film which began with Episode 7.Instead of celebrating the Star Wars franchise by making full use of their new amazing creative opportunity and learning from George Lucas' mistakes, Disney's ego gets the better of them entirely. The film disregards their fans with a plot that passively mocks their intelligence, Disney then goes on to unprofessionally mock fans directly in response to negative feedback to their film on social media.Unlike the so-called ""professional"" shill critics, viewers have the finger on the pulse as to what value this production and the franchise is now truly worth. This is already evident in the recourse of film boycott by fans when the Solo movie was released and went on to be a financial flop. Of course Disney and their paid media outlets blamed it on “Star Wars fatigue”. All said and done, unfortunately there isn’t much hope for Episode 9.",0
1968,The intent of this movie is to tear down the old Star Wars. Anything pre-Disney was treated with disdain and disrespect. This movie is insulting.,0
1969,"TL;DR: Rian Johnson took what made Starwars the greatest sci-fi movie franchise ever and just ruins it completely.A toddler can make up a better story line... Disney butchered everything that made Star Wars special and enjoyable to make money off of its dead body. The main protagonist is a huge Marie Sue which is a big turnoff for me. She has virtually no background information to go on. Heck the main ""villain"" doesn't even have any history or introduction. Now that I think about it the entire movie has nothing to go on other than an ""abandoned child"" that is somehow the next Luke Skywalker.Absolutely nothing makes sense and the narrative is confusing, with so many irrelevant side characters that add nothing and blur out the main narrative even more. The forced cultural diversity can be noticed in every scene that includes more than just the characters.I feel disgusted about the end result of this ""movie"".",0
1970,"Terrible script - basically ruins the Star Wars universe and destroys the Luke Skywalker character. How this movie got the greenlight is beyond me.

1973,I really love what Rian Johnson did he will finally end Star Wars with how bad this movie is. Thank goodness,0
1974,This film is a disjointed mess without a coherent story.. There is just an overload of pointless nonsense and silliness that beggers belief.I struggled to watch this and was actually bored; looking at the lacklustre acting of much of the cast and it appears they were bored as well...,0
1975,This is probably the worse Star Wars movie. This movie completely betrays the character development of the original trilogy. The writers do not seem to understand Star Wars. The space battle scenes completely conflict with established canon. The movie takes the audience to a side story that has no impact on the main story. What a disappointment.,0

Um...No. Empty characters, completely absurd situations and even talent! **** Disney killed the franchise and will continue to do so, only in the ninth episode.",0
1978,I can't really think of anything I liked about the movie besides the effects. Very little world building when compared to the other Star Wars movies. Seemingly bland story that poorly reuses the plot from the previous trilogies while belittling their achievements. Mostly uninteresting characters with heavy plot armor and bad dialogue. So many inconsistencies from plot holes to choreography. I could go on. It sure looked pretty though.,0
1979,"The Movie is the worst of all saga. It has no relation with Star Wars, Hope and faith in the Jedi way is now invalid because now being mediocre is normal. It has a clearly political message. At least if you want to introduce toxic feminism do it well and STUDY the Star Wars Universe!! George Lucas needs to be back! I was totally dissapointed.",0

This movie is basically Anti Star Wars and filled with general plot holes. For most long time hardcore Star Wars Fans whole loved everything George Lucas created it's hard to believe this could be viewed as a satisfying story. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy created an abomination of cinema.,0
1983,This is how you nail the coffin shut. Sub-par writing with cardboard characters. The whole movie could have been an e-mail. Kathleen Kennedy and Disney have done what nobody thought possible; they killed Star Wars.,0

Thanks for injecting your SJW agenda into a world that was once an escape from the drudgery of politics. Thanks for refusing to draw upon the wealth of stories from the Expanded Universe and instead removing it from canon, rendering 30 years of passionate work from authors and fans meaningless. Remember Kyle Katarn, Jacen Solo, Mara Jade, Kyp Durron?! None of them ever existed now. Yuuzhan Vong invasion? Never happened. What did we get in exchange? Some freaking Mary Sue? To hell with you, Disney. You have RUINED my childhood. I LOVED Star Wars. I LOVED the Expanded Universe. You had a responsibility to the fans who grew up with this franchise. In the words of Adam Sandler, ""YOU BLEW IT!""BTW, the movie is terrible, and full of plotholes, shallow character development, and cliches.

This is a fantasy fair tail movie, complete with magic and a princess, just like most everything Disney makes.

Keep in mind; if this was the first Star Wars to come out ever, there would be no more following and it would bomb. But big corporation needs cash.

Instead we get a random space race with half the film focused on character who escape - then rejoin the escaping fleet?! This doesn't even make sense.  Add to that a purple haird ultra feminist and space kamikaze at the speed of light and that's the film.  Oh...and Luke vanishes into thin air at the end randomly.  Complete garbage.",0
1991,"I don't know where to begin. I was/am a lifelong starwars fan. Grew up watching the original trilogy. The prequels were ""meh"" for me, too much CGI not enough character cohesion/chemistry. But this.. this new Star wars by disney is abysmal. it is destroying the franchise, and the universe of Star wars.1. The mary sue jedi is annoying as hell. So she just magically learns all these abilities because...? oh right.. GIRL POWER! smdh. apparently you can just be a jedi off the bat with absolutely no training. 2. they ruined Luke's character. Nay! assassinated his character. Luke goes from converting DARTH MF VADER back to the 'light side' of the force from only a tiny sliver of hope that he can save him; to trying to kill his nephew because he MIGHT be bad some time in the future? Are you kidding me? Who ever wrote this in, needs to get shot. horrible, just horrible. 3. Killing off characters (for some reason) doesn't always work as a shock or loss. Sometimes it just feels rushed and nonsensical. 4. Leia should have died in the movie, if they wanted to space her that is. Her magically having force powers (that strong) was silly and did nothing but break the immersion. Half the audience laughed at the scene, and it was supposed to be an emotional and tense scene.5. The whole forced political PC/SJW thing is annoying, and the fact that they keep pushing this makes the movie horrible. There are so many moments where I was just like, ""oh for the love of god..."" that they take you out of the feeling and immersion.6. The subplots are dumb. They use smaller crafts to go on ""side quests"" and keep returning to the space chase... why can't everyone just get on these smaller crafts and escape as such? Again, points to rushed/dumb writers. It's pathetic, and this also makes the movie a jumbled mess. 7. The bad guys (especially the general, who is supposed to be a threatening high ranking officer) are made into comical jokes. Everything is 'tongue and cheek' humor... forced into unnecessary scenes. were the jokes funny? some of them. Were the jokes silly and forced. yes. Nothing says ""be afraid"" of the bad guys like having the main character joking with them in dire scenes ... sigh...How does Disney mess up the trilogy so bad when they had the books from the extended universe to base their story from? Just loosely follow the books, and BAM movie gold. But again, some genius (looking at you Kennedy) decided to stuff these movies with sjw drivel instead of focusing on the characters and plot.",0
1992,"This movie was an embarrassing letdown. Good special effects unfortunately were not enough to save this steaming pile of garbage. It's a shining example of the lack of creativity and respect for what made previous movies good, these corporate ideologues seem set on destroying the franchise.",0

1994,"To keep this short and sweet, I am almost positive that the story seemed like a massive hit on paper, and it was decent enough, if we are being fair. However, the execution is absolutely atrocious. I can't think of a single scene that wasn't forced, awkward or overdone. Let's not even bring up the Co-Op fight after killing Snoke... The WORST choreography in cinematic history. The only hope of redemption was the fight between Luke and Kylo... But, somehow, they failed to execute on that too. Episode VII was so good, how did this even happen?",0

I can say now, with the most genuine sincerity... that THE LAST JEDI is the worst major release I've ever seen. Ever. I am 42 years old. I went to film school. I work(ed) in Hollywood. I watch about 225 films per year (I keep a detailed ""film log"" -- yes, i'm a total film geek). This film is vomit... in so many ways. But MOSTLY in it's overtly anti-StarWars vibe. Rian Johnson is the biggest troll/hater in Hollywood history. Nazi hipster, begone! BLEGHH!! I just puked. I'm not a bot. I'm not a hater. I'm just a genuine film-nerd SW-lover. Bye bye, StarWars.

2005,"I am shocked and amazed at all the high numbers given by critics for this horrible movie. The plot was bad. I mean epic level bad. It included but limited to waste of life and resources on a pointless attack, A disregard for general intelligence in not sharing tactics and strategy with the senior leadership of the rebels leading to one cluster mess after another. They completely dismissed the original characters or made them all quick cut out throwaways why even bring them back. Luke Skywalker deserved a better fate, Han Solo Deserved a better fate. Hope they got a good payday from Disney to waste there times in those films. It does little to capture the fun and adventure as the first 3 movies and any fan of these movies would have to agree that hanging out with Jar Jar Binks for hours on end would be preferable than watching this movie.",0
2006,"A boring and completely uninspired story littered with forced characters that apparently do not possess the ability to think. Action scenes are unbelievably bad and nonsensical (look for characters throwing away their weapons). The whole clown fiesta is topped off by more plot holes than I have ever seen in a movie before. This is without a doubt the worst SW movie ever made, and if the world was a fair place, Rian Johnson would never be hired to direct another movie ever again. If you haven't seen this yet, don't waste your time.",0
2007,"This movie is hands down, the worst Star Wars movie ever created.  I am a star wars fan, and I will never watch this movie again, ever.  Yes it's that bad.  Main plot point is that a large first order ship can't catch up to a large resistance ship that is right in front of them.... WOW.  Apparently none of the first order weapons or star fighters work after an initial clash with the resistance... WOW. And yes, this goes on for the most of the entire movie.  Now let's move on to the character assassination that happened during this WOKE! star wars attempt at a movie.  The main narrative for character assassination when it comes to this WOKE! fest is that MEN are completely incompetent.  First up, Luke Skywalker is a putz.  I'm sorry if you thought he was some strong, accomplished, battle tested leader.  NOPE, he's just a hermit living alone, feeling sorry for himself.  The film blames his absence for the first order even existing.Anyone remember Dameron Poe from the force awakens?  Military trained, Ace Pilot, Spy that understands the cost of fighting a monolithic oppressive force...  NOPE, in this movie he is a toddler that apparently doesn't understand ANYTHING that they have been doing or fighting for.  This stupefied version of his character is written so that Leia and Holdo can hold the toddlers hand and tell him to calm down and let the women handle the situation.  Mostly because they have written him to rage and fly off the handle at every opportunity in the movie and he does.  Because Men are beasts who cannot control themselves... obviously.What about Finn from the Force awakens?  How about we throw him into a completely unnecessary situation (entire casino plot) and forced attraction with yet another new female character that has zero appeal or chemistry with him on screen?  Gotta hit that diversity quota I guess... I'm sure the actress that plays Rose is a great person, but the character itself serves absolutely no purpose in the film.  The entire Casino subplot was a left political bent fantasy of the writers/producers and completely 100% cringe worthy.I can go on but really, it was **** movie, with forced far left activism destroying any sense of actual entertainment value.",0
2008,"What an awful movie. It is sad to see what has become of Star Wars. The characters were not done justice, there are countless plot-holes and overall character development is missing completely. Johnson managed to make the worst Star Wars movie imaginable, yes worse than the Holiday Special, let that sink in. I'm giving the movie one point for its beautiful effects. Aside of that the movie is uninspired and is the first Star Wars film to not contain a memorable original Star Wars score. Guess even John Williams didn't know what to do with such a god-awful script.",0

They are chainging the hyperspace only for this movie to make a female character look good.And now the biggest problem they killt snoke the only interresting character gets killt so easy.

2011,What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said about Afghanistan?,0
2012,"I made an account just to write a review for this movie because it’s that bad. To fix the first of this trilogy they needed to find a way to make the villain threatening, and to give a reason for the main character to be the seemingly best fighter in the universe without any training or experience. Even though she has a natural bond with the force, luke, Annikan and every other Jedi who also had that needed to train for years to get good. What the movie did instead was randomly and easily kill off one of the villains and make the other question his evil ways. Then they made the only legendary character with a chance to be stronger than the main character a huge wimp. Then they made the main character even stronger despite her not getting any training. I wanted a movie about underdogs fighting a war to defeate a powerful evil villain in space. The main character is inexplicable the strongest in the universe and the villain is a huge unthreatening wimp, so there really isn’t even plot or meaningful conflict past a bunch of people whining about their emotions in space. Also strong female lead roles are a good thing in movies, but this goes beyond that to straight up policial propaganda that feels antagonistic towards males. Racial diversity is also definitely a good thing to have in movies, but rather than just having a diverse cast it is presented in a way that feels like a political statement is being shoved down my throat.  I just wanted to see powerful, coherent characters fight with laser swords in space. :(",0
2013,"This movie is an insult. Not just to the fans, not just to the characters. It's an insult to Star Wars. Plotholes, badly written characters (Rose, Holdo overall), destroyed characters (poor Luke), an idiotic story (ships running out of fuel? casino planet?), nonsensical things (since when hyperspeed can be used as a weapon? Since when ghosts can summon lightbolts? Since when the force allows you to fly in space?)...everything is just a kick in the nuts of what SW is. It's just like the ""director"" (that's what he call himself, I wouldn't...) Rian Johnson took everything SW was and decided to **** on it just to be different. Well, you know what Rian? You did it.

Rian Johnson has no ability to write or direct anything this big or special to so many fans. He took a beloved franchise and pissed all over not just the previous movies but all the fans. From Leia being able to not only survive in space but fly like Mary Poppins was just wrong. The complete character assassination of Luke was horrible to watch. While i would never condone attacks on actual people the character of Rose Tico was just awful and unneeded. Rian Johnson ignored everything that was set up by The Force Awakens. He wrote his script before The Force Awakens was even completed and did not care about anything that was set up to have a great story going forward. I have no desire to watch anything star wars anymore and that is very sad. I was a huge fan. I bought clothing, toys, movie sets and anything star wars I could find.

WHY? WHYY!!??I just do not give zero for this movie because i do not want to belittle the work of the people who made the look and the sound, which was almost perfect, and the performance of Adam and Mark is also good.I left the movie theater so confused, more confused than when i saw forced Fifty Shades of Gray, because of that movie i do not expect much.",0

Between poorly forced jokes that cover a veiled attempt to complete scenes and a lack of real substance in an exchange for 'twists' that achieve very little throughout the movie it simply seems to build to a point but chooses to fizzle poorly instead of creating opportunities for characters to truly grow and for the story to truly progress (whatever that might entail). But there is some good scenery every now and then within the three scenes in the movie I actually enjoy. Together those scenes all last around 10 minutes and I don't have much interest in the rest of the movie.",0
2021,"It destroys SW. It's an inconsistent movie, Finn saying hyperspace is not possible, and 2 minutes later knows all the details of it. The chase is absurd and boring, The First Order shouldn't have any problems sending more fleets just in front of them to cath them, also, they don't have faster ships? any civilian ship can outrun the first order if they don't have that tracker thingy? A dumb thing also, in the OT there's tracking. It's stupid that they only send 4 fighters to fight the Rebel/Resistance(they keep changing the name in the movie), they don't have more fighters in their 20 cruisers? Even in the OT we saw more fighters. Luke character is destroyed. Every plot opened in TFA is eliminated in the most absurd ways...The new SJW admiral behaves like and idiot, not telling anyone the plan for no reason, even when a mutiny takes place(you take Poe and tell him, he's no damm spy, he just destroyed Starkiller Base you moron, also, if there's a spy, the plan wouldn't work anyway). They treat Poe like a reckless idiot, but he actually makes all the good calls, he's demoted for destroying a ship that would've kill them all. They make Husk a joke(where are military leaders like Tarkin?), all the movie is full with stupid jokes in the worst possible timing, every serious situation has a stupid joke to ruin it. Rey is more a Mary Sue than ever, using force powers like nothing, defeating Luke, fighting elite guards after one day training, by herself, against a rock....Also, the worst fight in all the movies, no reason for it(what are the guards doing attacking Kylo? Is not their new boss?), full of mistakes, guards flipping and exposing their backs to the enemy, guards aiming to the air or the weapons instead of attacking the exposed heads of Kylo and Rey, weapons than dissapear, no force powers being used....A joke, and it's the best part of the movie, sadly. Canto Bight just a waste of time, the plot about selling weapons is also absurd, it doesn't make much sense that the Rebels and the First Order got different weapons from the same buyer, also, makes more sense that they create their own weapons, specially the First Order, they have the most advanced weaponary in the galaxy, that should come from their own I+D, no from buyers. Does the buyers sell Death Stars also? TFO can create Death Stars and not fighters? There's nothing to save in this movie but the visuals and acting of some characters, not worth spending more money on SW ever again, or at least until they say this movie never happened and make something coherent at least, I'm not even asking for good anymore.",0
2022,"This film is an insult to Star Wars, they ruined the original characters and made the new characters all complete idiots, everything in this film is an insult to Star Wars fans who have loved the franchise for decades.",0
2023,"The worst SW movie (and that´s quite an achievement since an abomination like the Phantom Menace exists). But it could be argued that this is not really a real SW movie anymore, it´s only on the name. Like other people wrote before me, it looks nice (hence the 1 star) but it's boring and way too often illogical/nonsensical. On a side note, it includes quite a lot of subliminal (and at times direct) political, economical and sexist propaganda. This in my opinion does not belong in a good fantasy film supposedly intended to entertain people from all genders, races and political orientations. Certainly it was never part of the SW universe before. But that´s not the worst part. There are many more other deviations in this movie from the SW that we all know and love: changes in old well stablished character personalities, in how spaceships work, in how the Force works, and a long etcetera. The director actually said he was doing everything he could to try to break the SW traditions and our expectations. He did achieve his goal unfortunately, and thus the film lacks any heart that makes a SW film. Why would Disney spend billions buying an incredibly loved and successful franchise and then allow a single producer or a single director to INTENTIONALLY break with the traditions and our expectations of such a valuable intellectual property? We loved it as it was (that´s why they had to pay so much money for it in the first place!) so why the obsession with changing it so much? Don´t waste your time with this trash. Metascore 85. User score: 4.4. That says it all.",0
2024,"A son is about to kill its mother. It already killed his father a couple of years earlier, so he hesitates. He is not alone, and the companions decide to seize the opportunity during his pause... and take the shot. The mother, and the rest of the people that was with her, get sucked up by the cold vacuum of space. All seems lost. But then, the mother, the leader of the resistance opens her eyes, extends its hand to the ship, and flies towards it! It's a miracle!A soldier that has doubts about his loyalty to his commrades and their believes, decides to sacrife himself to buy them a little more time. He is about to get killed, proving everyone (even the audience) that they were wrong, and he is saved by someone, who prefers to take the shot instead of him. It's a miracle!The resistance is trapped in a cave. There is no escape, as the tunnel just collapsed behind rubble, and the enemy will get them before they can get out. They need more time to clear the rubble. All hope is lost. But wait. Someone appears. A hero of legends! But he was in another planet, in another solar system! He confronts everyone, buying them the time they need! It's a miracle! Oh no! He was a ghost of some kind! We don't have enough time to clear the tunnel! They are coming for us! Wait. The rocks are moving! Are they... flying? It's Rey! She saved us! When did she become so powerful with the force? It doesn't matter. It's another freaking miracle.Oh no! We were jailed! ""I can get you out, and by the way I am a hacker of sorts"". Oh no! They are destroying the little escape pods! Our post-leader just went light speed kamikaze and destroyed their fleet (even tough there is no reference it could work that way)! Oh no! Snoke is going to kill us! He didn'trealize that someone is force moving the lightsaber, until it's too late... and he dies.Do you see the pattern here? In this movie miracles move the plot forward. Not the consequence of actions by the characters. At the end, the good guys are just lucky because someone up there (""up where?"" you may ask in space) cheers for some, doesn't care for others, and is playing god. No character development, the set where the movie takes place seems more like an excuse, the bad guys are bad for the sake of being bad.Oh no! They are making another one!",0
2025,"Watching this left me feel empty inside. There was no moment of interest, excitement, fun, or fear. It left me with nothing. It's a masterpiece of inverted greatness. It's amazing how it uses an established world with amazing characters and situations and it successfully removes all emotion from everything. I've always considered Highlander 2 the worst movie ever created, but at least I can smile at how bad it is. The Last Jedi is an emotional black hole. I will never, ever see it again.",0
2026,"Sadly this film takes star wars back to the level of the prequels and i'm amazed that disney were so happy with it that they are giving the director a whole new trilogy of his own!Johnson is obviously totally out of his depth with a film of this scale showing his inexperience during most of the action scenes,none of which i thought were exiting and in some cases were obviously fake and CG looking.BB8 has been reduced to a CG cartoon character in many scenes,the bit where he drives the scout walker with rose and finn is the worst thing i've seen since jar jar binks.While some of the effects were very good,some just weren't such as when the falcon is on crait shooting tie fighters and then flying through the planet.Just look at how masterfully done the kessel run from Solo is in comparison.There are continuity errors,plot holes and the film has more tonal shifts than Revenge of the sith and from the very beginning it felt bad with it's out of place,space balls humour (the first order are meant to be frightening for god's sake)and awful,corny new characters.Some of it was well done such as the stuff on the island with Rey and Luke and i thought their performances were good but what the hell have they done to Luke.JJ Abrams was respectful and very careful about how he made the force awakens but Johnson has made a shoddy mess and taken everything JJ set up and everything that went before and thrown it out the window.",0
2027,"I'm a bit late for the party. But what the f' was this sh't. I would say this movie has more plot holes than plot but that would require movie to have a plot to begin with. Boring characters that don't develop at all. A ton of inconsistencies with rest of the franchise. Grinchy as f'ck. If you have even watched a horror movie where characters do some absolutely stupid choices, this is worst. Everyone seems to be brain dead. In conclusion this movie is so sadly bad that I recommend you watch it, just so you can see how bad it is. I don't recommend spending any money on it tho.",0
2028,"I can't even give this a 1.  The ending completely invalidates all space battles ever, and makes every death star completely pointless.  Several SJW characters, and crappy acting.  Rey is a total Mary sue.  It's like they took everything great about star wars and killed it.",0
2029,"I wasn't originally going to post anything and, don't worry, there's no politics in this. While I was looking through the reviews I saw a post that said: ""Once again, Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to bring back everything that made the other movies good""... or something like that, but I'm going to focus on the 'manages to bring back', cause, it does bring back stuff from the other movies, but that's the problem, it's unoriginal and it's just another cheap ploy by Disney to make money. Understand that I am a fan of Star Wars, just not a fan of the way Disney is now conducting themselves when they create these movies. Thank's for reading and I hope I helped you make a decision on whether or not to watch this movie. Have a good day.",0
2030,"The Last Jedi was so bad, that a negative review could never do this level of trash justice. It did succeed in one thing, however; destroying with one fell swoop 30 years of character and world building just to push some trendy agenda. Unforgivable. Hate is too less of a word to represent my utter disdain for this dumpster fire and it's director and producers. The only positives are the special effects.",0
2031,"I admire Rian Johnson for at least taking a risk with this film, but The Last Jedi feels like a disservice to Star Wars. The humour is just plain strange, the new characters are hard to like and the plot just left me feeling unsatisfied and confused. I think Rian became far too fixated on doing something unexpected to such an extent where the plot just stops making sense at all, just for the sake of it.",0
2032,"This movie was awful but not for the general reasons involving wokeness and current year patriarchy bashing nonsense. This movie was bad because of the leadership both in the production and in the characters in the movie. Everyone involved in the writing process is out shopping. it is painfully obvious nobody in this generation was involved in any actual real world military. If we reduce the space opera to a World War Two Admiralty scenario, we can use the following parallel: Imagine you are a Navy Admiral in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack. In stead of regrouping and reforming for a plan, you gather all the allied forces and retreat. Your Wing Commander wants to make a retaliatory strike, but instead of sending the proper tools for the job, you send the wrong aircraft and smaller boats and sacrifice all of them. You have a plan but you never inform your upper echelon and higher command structure. You continue to deuce out. You just run. Japan’s fleet is chasing after you and the remainder of you forces. Japan’s fleet is picking off your ships one at a time. Your Wing commander on the largest carrier comes to you and states he and the Air Wing can hold off and even destroy Japan’s ships with high altitude low risk bombing runs. If they cannot do this, they could at least kamikaze themselves and buy some time or at least cripple the enemy. YOU as the Admiral say “nah”. No explanation of why, because there could be spies around. YOU as the Admiral ignore the situation and just want everyone to stand in awe of your military tactical prowess by NOT telling your upper echelon and ENTIRE LEADERSHIP the plan and course of retaliation other than to high tail it to Sacramento or San Francisco. YOU as the Admiral share another plan to just stay the course and basically escort Japan’s fleet to mainland United States. You as the Admiral do absolutely nothing and take offense when someone takes initiative. You, as the Admiral, have your Fleet Wing Commander charged with mutiny when he decides to do his duty and his job by fighting the enemy.  You do not fight, you do not attack, you do not bargain or surrender, you just stay the course. Then, 3 miles off the coast of California, you alone jump in a submarine and torpedo the enemy vessel. The attack was successful and the dreadnought was crippled, but now the enemy fleet is close enough to land. Japan makes a beachhead and commit to an invasion of California. Now the fleet is without leadership and the war was pulled to mainland US. Good job. You could have done this the whole time, or even remote controlled it into a guided weapon while both fleets were still in Southeast Asia or at the very least, torpedoed the ever loving crap out of the pursuing ships. Instead your incompetence and poor leadership led Japan to invade San Diego and take Temecula and Escondido. The remnants of the American fleet continue to retreat along with the rest of American forces back to the Rocky Mountains waiting for reinforcements from Kansas and Oklahoma. You have lost the war. Half of this movie has a side story where a whinny PFC begs General Patton to lead and then returns alone to Mary Sue leadership of the American Fleet. Two other equally whinny but hubris filled sailors attempt to find General MacArthur but their attempt fails too. Instead they found Bing Crosby and they return empty handed. Nothing they did had any impact on the outcome of the war. They wasted time and resources and everyone’s patience. The movie ends with reinforcements graduating boot camp as a Three Star General. This movie sucks. There was no point to any of this lazy writing and it is indicative of a generation and culture who has seen war on TV but never been to a war or had the threat of war in their neighborhood. Thank you for ruining Star Wars, Pumpkin-head and Hubris Medusa.",0
2033,"I saw the movie on Day 1, but I wanted to let it cool off, let the controversy blow over and see what I think of it later on. That later on was over a year later, when the hype from both sides has died down and I could watch both it and TFA in peace and in unisono.In short, I still think that TFA is good. Not excellent, but pretty good and stand on its own as a movie. And most importantly, it ends with opening full of possibilities for next in franchise to explore and build upon. As for TLJ, my opinion did change. For worse. In December 2017 I thought the movie was average, while having one of greatest cinematics, the plot was kinda subpar and characters were okay-ish. With the SW fever over, I can see that I was too generous.The plotholes for me year + on were even bigger issue, as I cant but keep noticing them, just as I now can see the plotlines that I know will lead to nowhere, put up as red herring that wouldnt be forgiven even to junior director. The casino section is upon re-watching painful to watch as now I know it has no purpose what-so-ever, while at Day 1 I was hoping until last second that it will come full circle and result in something. John Boyega character is criminally ignored by writers, he doesnt do anything, doesnt have any good line and looks like a lost boy who has no place there and shouldnt be there. Squadering his last chance for glory at end is just cherry on top. Daisy Ridley tries her best with scrip she has and while of all characters is given most respect by writers by her having an arc (subpar as it is), it is kicked off its feet at every chance by director. Developing her skills? Nope. Showing us her internal conflict? Nope. Growing as a character? Nope. I detested usage of ""Mary Sue"" term in TFA, but here ... what else can be said? And Ridley as aspiring young actress deserves better than such poor treatment by writers, just as Hayden Christensen did all those years ago. Adam Driver has by far the best character in the movie, but when time comes to give him his own worth and arc, that is detached from cliches of movie industry, the director simply decides that is not the way and instead we have the cliche baddie who shouts a lot and obviously needs some yoga to cool down. At one scene he is proclaiming want for something new than rehashed sith and jedi dichotomy, offering Rey to build it with him and in next he is Sith lord shouting and screaming to kill ""the rebel scum"". Disappointing. Oscar Isaac as a character is utterly ruined by Laura Dern character, who wins the trophy of worst written character in history of SW, topping Jar Jar Binks. Rose Tico is there, and she shouldnt. Knowing that one of last scene that Carrie Fisher filmed in her life is levitating through space like a Mary Poppins is heart-breaking. And Mark Hammil obviously wants to play character of Luke Skywalker, but not this Luke Skywalker and no one can blame him.The plot is non-sensical. Jokes are over-the-top, they wouldnt fly even in MCU in many instances. Any emotion that I should get from the movie are absent. I got teary at end of Rogue One. I got teary when Han Solo died. Here? Nothing. Luke ""death"" mostly angered me, because pulling inception of a red herring is just cheating. Bad one. All blames here goes onto director and writers. And in this case its one person. Ryan Johnson wanted to direct and write a movie, but he didnt want to do that for movie in a franchise so he just decided not to. And no one had half a guts to look at the script and say ""no"" to him, just like no one wanted to say No to Great Gorge when he thought that poo jokes are great Star Wars stuff.And so after decades of disappointment and occasional joy, Disney finally done it. It killed any joy I had for future of franchise. I just cant seem to care anymore.PS: Movie does get points for stunning visuals and Mark Hammil. Give people who did CGI massive bonuses. They deserve it. And Mark better script. He deserves it.",0

2043,"The movie looked amazing and had tons of spectacle but once you stop to think about it for a second the whole thing completely falls apart. Admiral Holdo's refusal to tell Poe the plan led to the most contrived conflict I have every seen in a film. Canto Bite is the most embarrassing thing to happen to star wars since jar jar (and the Rose saving Finn scene but I have bigger fish to fry). Kylo has more personalities than the goddamn villain from Split. The way this movie handed Luke was at worst a complete slap in the face to Mark Hamill and one of the most beloved star wars characters of all time and at best completely lazy (giving his personality a complete 180 because things during the 30 years after Return of the Jedi without showing what the hell happened and why). Then the movie killed him for no reason meaning there is no way to redeem himself in Episode 9. And oh boy did the movie handle the fact that they were in space horribly. Arching Lasers, bombs dropped in space, no depressurization when opening the airlock etc. The infamous Leia Poppins scene was...uncomfortable to say the least given the context. There was a particular scene that I think sums up the entirety of the movie. The scene were Yoda appears to Luke. It makes you smile for a second until he calls down lightning and destroys the library thing. Then you just shake your head and feel bad because you see what Rian was clearly going for and what he was trying to do but the poor guy just missed the mark with this movie.",0
2044,this is the most insulting and bad star wars movie ever made luke is portrayed as an idiot and is no longer the hero i loved also the way he dies is also so insulting. rey is a overpowered and bad character that is the bog hero in this movie but a week before the last jedi she didn't even beleef in the force. there are manny bad characters in this movie that should be left out of this movie. the only good things in this movie is the cgi and the sound effects (if that is the only thing you care about and if you have never seen a star wars movie before the your also gonna love this movie),0

The story has hundreds of plot holes, and the entire middle section of the movie is terribly boring. Defenitely one of the worst Star Wars movies.",0
2048,Terrible Writing and completely disregards points brought up in previous films. The Use of Bathos in this film completely ruins the drama and tension in many scenes. The editing is a mess and the Lore and fans have been completely disregarded by the director and Kathleen Kennedy. The film is also filled with so much SJW propaganda it isn't even funny. The 30 minute casino sequence is just a waste of 30 minutes and their is no character development at all in this film.,0
2049,"This is a bad movie, but a terrible Star Wars movie. This movie suffers from several problems.1. The humor. Some of the worst jokes. Star Wars is not a comedy. There are some jokes in George Lucas' movies, but at the heart it's a space drama/epic. The humor in this movie is completely misplaced. There's a ""your mom"" joke. That is how bad the humor is.2. The destruction of Luke. Luke is basically crapped on in this film. Luke is a grumpy old man in this film and all of his character development from the original trilogy basically means nothing. He was HOPE, but now he is just a grumpy old man who doesn't care. He gives up and the reasoning doesn't seem convincing enough.3. Finn and Rose. The chemistry just isn't there and the forced romance is uncalled for. I didn't see it coming at all and they randomly kiss? It was jarring.4. Breaks the Star Wars universe. The hyperspace jump through the ships breaks the old movies. Why didn't they just hyperspace through the death star? What's the point of hiding the plans in episode 2; what's the point of making a weak point; what's the point if you can just hyperspace through the death star? Weaponizing hyperspace BREAKS space combat in every way.5. Plot points introduced in episode 7 not followed up on. Rey's parents? No one. Knights of Ren? Not in the movie. Snoke? No one; he's dead. Luke left a map? Yet, in episode 8, he doesnt want to be found?There are other issues, but these are the main ones. A terrible Star Wars movie.",0
2050,"mary sue wars Wasn't a great movie with lots of issues. It didn't follow through from The Force Awakens properly after it set the foundation for a fresh trilogy.We still do not know who Rey's parents are after the big fuss from TFA, Snoke turns out to be easily killed and there were many decisions that could've been changed.For Example, Admiral Ackbar shouldn't have been killed off so cheaply and he should've been the one who did the light speed run not Holdo who means nothing to Star Wars fans. Also, Luke should've fought Kylo Ren with a green not blue lightsaber for continuity's sake! There was no reason for him to have the blue one at all.And finally, there is Rose. The bit when she stops Finn from ""saving those who we love"" by flying into the cannon only for her to claim that she is doing just that is just senseless.I have to admit that it wasn't until I had come out of the cinema when I realized the issues with The Last Jedi. It certainly took a while for it to sink in given the high hopes I had after seeing Rogue One a year later!",0
2051,"The Last Jedi completely ignores all the plots and stories and the base its self on Star Wars and what the sequels were going to be. There was no plot development and ruined Luke fundamentally as a character, and decided to kill him(also in a stupid way) and kill spoke without telling who the hell he was. It also ignored and forgot the Knights of Ren and more. Just a poor movie in total when it comes to a Star Wars film",0
2052,Too many feminist propaganda. The nonsense scenario. I like Star Wars but this movie is hopeless.,0
2053,"This movie made me feel stressed, awkward, and disappointed. The movie is about failure and the characters’ failures are not due to inherent flaws, but because they make stupid decisions. Finn and Rose get caught by security on the casino planet because Finn crashed the ship. It was established in the last movie he was a terrible pilot. Once in prison they decide to trust an obviously untrustworthy guy, and it ruins Holdo’s plan almost making her sacrifice pointless. Poe had them go on the mission in the first place because he was overreacting to Holdo’s refusal to tell him the plan. He mutinies and ruins her plan, yet he is barely reprimanded. This does the opposite of endearing me to their characters.I thought Luke’s portrayed was great. The explanation for how he came to that state was too vague. Luke and Kylo’s actions in response to this event seem extremely irational, hopefully we get more context in the next movie. I liked both this portrayal and his original heroic one, so I was very dissapointed at what seemed to me to be a half redemption. He saves his sister, but he fails to confront Kylo honestly or bravely. He humiliated him and died spreading an incomplete image of he was. The galaxy doesn’t need hope, it needs the truth. Luke wasn’t perfect, and that is okay. They should know the truth and continue to hope, fight, and struggle regardless. I very much disliked the way the movie portrays these final scenes as positive when I felt they should be bittersweet at best.Overall the characters I liked from the last film were made to look foolish. They were at their best interacting with each other, but Poe, Finn, and Rey barely speak to eachother the whole movie. Kylo Ren has a chance to be a different kind of villain and chooses to do the whole “rule the entire galaxy thing”. Snoke’s death was genuinely exciting and this ruined it. There are about a dozen other things I could rant about, but I will end on a positive note. The acting is great and this is definitely the most visually stunning Star Wars movie yet.",0
2054,"It is awful and completely unwatchable for a Star Wars fan. The story is dumb, and creates even more plot holes than the franchise can afford.

2056,"There are many plot holes in the film, but the biggest flaw is this: you can't make a hero's journey without the hero learning anything. Check, for example, Luke's learning curve in the first three films. The hero is encountered with the unknown, he goes into it, slowly but surely he learns, through many trials, what it is to be a jedi.Now look at the plot structure in the new films (especially in this one): the hero already knows too much of the jedi powers. There's a total disregard to legacy. When the hero walks into a force trial of sorts, she only sees herself. In the previews film, she already knew some secrets of the force with almost no training. Here, the hero gets a free pass into becoming a jedi.There is also the issue with the ideology that the film wants to set forth, and worst of all: diversity for diversity's sake. No. In a monomyth structure the key is having the heroes do their work, learn something and with that confront the ultimate plot twist before the resolution. Here I see very little of that.",0

It contains the universe's slowest and most implausible chase. It contains the most pointless side quest in history. It contains plot holes that cause it to lose internal consistency (eg, Finn drags Tico across an open plain in front of a dozen walkers that are just standing there and survives, because?) and contrivances that break the established workings of Star Wars (The Holdo Manoeuvre). It contains political messages that bring you crashing back to our reality and have the subtlety of a sledgehammer and the crudity of the carbon-freezing facility on Bespin.Spare yourself the misery of watching this movie if you still can.

Milking the boob of a space alien and drinking its green boob milk.  The entire Casino scene and sub plot revolving around it. Flying Leia. Killing off Luke.  Sorry, I can not bring myself to even give this movie a 1. I'm not the Force Awakens hater, I actually enjoyed it.  It 'felt' like Star Wars.  but this abomination?

But apparently it doesn't matter why she is so good at all these things.Luke became a hermit that lives by milking aliens, after trying to kill his own nephew and fleeing to an unknown planet. I can't even describe how disrespectful and unlike the original Luke Skywalker this is.Their ""training"" consisted of secret talks with Kylo, scenes showing how powerful and open-minded Rey is, how disturbed Luke has become and flashbacks where he tries to kill his nephew. In fact, there is no training at all. There's something like two conversations about the force and the one that learns something by the end is Luke. Rey doesn't learn anything.Snoke...it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how/when/why he got so powerful, who he is, how did he get a massive high-tech army capable of conquering the galaxy,etc...Neither the current director nor the past director knows who he is. All they know is that he is the big bad guy, very powerful, with an immense army. Whatever comes next, Ryan Johnson doesn't have a clue and doesn't care that much.The rest of the film is a festival of boredom. It's full of fillers and plot holes, with a good fight, an emotional scene and many cringe moments.I don't know how they managed to make such a bad and disjointed sequel, but they did it.",0
2063,"Luke, one of the most beloved characters utter destroyed. The character assassination to the original characters is horrible and done terribly.  You also ruined characters with so much potential like Finn, Poe, Ray and Kylo. And the General Holdo menuver, it is arguably the most overpowered weapon in the galaxy, especially since all you need is a ship (that can even be built from scrap), and a hyperdrive. And yet, it seems no one ever thought of this in a galaxy that has had space travel for thousands of years.",0
2064,"Sadly disappointing.Tons of plot holes, destroying Luke and Leia characters, main character is a Mary Sue (especially painful in SW, since other heroes had to work hard to get good in other SW movies), even some fight scenes were sub par (highly unusual for a SW movie), some incompetent leaders, lackluster bad guys (again, atypical for a SW).Only good aspect of the movie, at least for me, are the effects. But visuals can only push you up few points in rating, not all the way...I am not that big SW fan and that is probably the reason I am no going lower in my rating, but I can fully understand why die-hard fans are angry and are voting lower or even go with zeroes.",0
2065,"To start this film looks beautiful, and the actors tried they're best, But does not save this film. - Luke skywakers character has been dumb down to an old man, who say get off my lawn- canto bright scene really has no point it is filler- Lots of SJW stuff shoved down and it makes no sense in Star Wars-The story set up in Ep.7 has really gone no where, -lots of plot holes bigger than a crater - it turns a lot of characters(Heroes) into horrible peopleJust to name a few things. This movie has destroyed Star wars and its fan base. I hope they can save star wars after this film.",0
2066,"Okay, where to start?1.	The first 1  1/2 hours felt like they tried to fit 2 Hours of Spaceballs into the movie: to many jokes, to many stupid punch lines. Anoying2.	Score: uh was that bad.3.	Story: where to begin?a.	That stupid and useless sideplot destroyed the only decent Character (Finn) for TFAb.	Leia flying in Space without a Spacesuit, what dit the secreenwriter smoke? She should have died. Making force users able to live and move in Space is a stupid idea!c.	Hyperspacing into Ships: cool effect, but why did the Rebellion didn't do that with the Death Stars? Droid controlled Frigate hyperspacing into Death Star(s) and not one Rebel life is endangered. Deus ex machina Screenwriting? Alway a bat thingd.	Luke Skywalker giving up his complete ideology and leaving the galaxy high and dry? Who wrote that crap?e.	Why does the Resistance exist in the first place? Why weren't all oft hem part oft he new Republic (which actually existed) ... okay, that is mainly a dumb thing of TFA, but it contuinued to this movief.	Slow speed chase: why didn't the Empir... ah ... New Order just call for more ships to cut into the Resistances way? Or just jumped in front oft them? Instead they chased them for weeks (remember: Finn and Rose went t that lenghty, useless sidequest)4.	Charactersa.	Kylo Ren: still as intimidating as Lord Dark Helmet. And, by the way: Ben ist he Name oft he son of Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker, the Kinds of Han and Leia are Jacen, Jaina and Anakin!b.	General Hux: still a bad Josef G�bbels Jokec.	Chewbacca: he should have eaten all of those anoyying furballs ... what purpose did they have in that movie (except for merchandise)d.	Balldroid: still a stupid and anoyying idea ... by the way: why does it have a coinslot and how many coins can he store? And who came tot he idea repairing something punching ist head into a wiring board and causing a whole bunch of shorts? Hte whole damn X-Wing should have explodet after that stupid droid did that (sorry, electrical engineer speaking ... tha whole thing was stupid)5.	Original Trilogy: everything that happened in the original trilogy has been made irrelevant with Last Jedi (and TFA), except fort he meeting of Han and Leia I believe, that I forgot stuff (a lot), but this covers the most stupid things.I like Disney, I love what Marvel does under the cover of Disney, but Lucasfilm ... sorry, Luicasfilm went for me from one oft he best studios to one oft he worse:-	Bad Characters-	Bad Continuity-	Bad (and lazy) Screenwriting-	Bad StoryAll in all: Last Jedi is in my opinion the second worse Star Wars Movie,the only one worse ist he force awakens (Yes, I thing, that A Phantom Menance"" was much, much better than Ep VII and Ep. VIII copmbined .., and Ep.I wasn't even a good movie)",0
2068,"Wow!  Terrible doesn't start to describe what a mess this film is.  Characters acting completely out of character, the story had no direction, and stretches of scenes that could have been cut from the movie without any effect good or bad.  How did this script make it out of the first reading?",0
2069,"Garbage, much worse than ep-s 1 to 3. Better buy any pre-EA Star Wars games for WAAAAY better story.",0
2070,The movie on an objective level is one of the worst I've seen. The screenplay and the pacing is terrible with a lot of plot holes and sceens that was not thought out at all. All of the negative reviews are true.,0
2071,"After the disaster and pandering that was TFA, I waited for this on Redbox. It was stupid, confusing and the writing was awful. I'll probably just pass on the next one. Disney killed all enthusiasm I ever had for Star Wars.",0
2072,"I gave this movie a 2 because it was visually exciting. The story however is absolute trash. There are so many mistakes made that NO writer should make that it baffles the mind. Who signed of on this? It feels like my 8 year old nephew made a story for school based on star wars and I laughingly say to him; not bad for an 8 year old. This is that story, it doesn't make ANY sense.",0
2073,"The disparity between the critic score and the user score is telling, and it's present on every critic/user aggregator.  It's been nearly 17 months since the movie was released, and the gap has grown as the hangover from the hype set in.  Fans, in droves, are realizing that they've been sold a bill of goods.  This is one bad movie, not just as a standalone film, but especially as the middle chapter in a sci-fi trilogy.  The nonsensical plot is basically Empire Strikes Back warmed over: we have a space chase story, we have a Jedi training on a remote planet story, and we do have an AT-AT battle on a planet covered with white powder which turns out to be...salt.  The comedy is beyond clumsy: TLJ starts off with a prank call and a yo mama joke, and it goes downhill from there.  The poorly-timed and cringe-worthy attempts at laughs just kept on coming, throwing off pacing, seriousness, and the overall feel of what is supposed to be a Star Wars movie.  TLJ can be written off on that alone, but the complete waste of otherwise interesting characters, lazy plotting, lousy dialogue, lack of any logic, and the intentional disrespect of the source materials all scuttle this turkey.  TLJ is so rotten, that the much-reviled Lucas prequels are getting a second look by the disenchanted fans.",0
2074,"So much plot hole that it will make you think ""fantom menace wasn't that bad""It s no more Science Fiction, it s just fiction.",0
2075,Garbage story. Horrible character development. They ruin luke. Rose. They turned starwars into SJW propaganda.,0
2076,"The absolutely worst Star Wars movie ever made. I wasn't really angry or disappointed when i saw it, i was heartbroken. I almost felt like i was going to cry. How they treated the Star Wars characters and made everything some sort of weird SJW propaganda is almost unbelievable.",0
2077,"When even Mark Hamill, the original actor playing Luke Skywalker hates what this movie did with his character, it really tells you everything you need to know. Take your usual ten pounds package of standard Hollywood stupidity, slowly dissolve in the bubbling, green fuming liquid of anti-male hatred and heavy handed feminism, throw in a handful of bad dialogues and poorly written characters, spice it up with nonsense like a deep space bomber that actually depends on gravity to deliver the payload to enemy ships(!), and you get a toxic mess I admit was not able to finish watching. And I tried several times. Similar to the stupid end of the Game of Thrones, this movie kills the Star Wars franchise dead. I no longer care about it.",0
2078,"This movie was terrible, nothing else to say.  When I go to Star Wars, I expect to see Star Wars.",0
2079,"To the people attacking the fans: calm down! If you don't care, why do you need to complain so much about ""the fans""? Why do you have so much trouble accepting that people just didn't like this movie? They aren't ""trying to get the score down"". They thought it was a terrible movie. There are MANY people that felt that way. You want to make accusations about bots? How about all the ""reviews"" that gave this 10 and are fake, or vapid one-liners? How about the attempts to puff this score up? Read the reviews. Some people are admittedly giving this a higher score than they normally would because the low scores are ""unfair"".Why is it unfair that this is a bad movie and lots of people dislike it? A few people have been rude in criticism but some people have been equally rude in defending the film. The racist, sexist and bigoted attacks on the fans are completely undeserved. The vast majority of complaints against the film are from people that wanted to like it and were disappointed. Would it hurt to listen to those critiques and at least consider them?I would have given this movie a 2-3 maybe, the first time I saw it. But now that I've had time to let it sink in, I have to give it 0.There's nothing redeemable here. People say how great the FX are. Yeah, some of them are good but the whole casino planet was terrible. Those animals were some of the most rubbery, fakest looking CGI that I have seen.The length of the film is unacceptable. It's far too long for the story it tries to tell. And that story is terrible for a myriad of reasons that have been discussed. Almost nothing in the movie makes any sense.The way to ""rescue"" someone is by ramming your vehicle at high speed into theirs? No. That is most likely to kill both people.And the Resistance are not cast in a good light, at all. Their decisions are senseless and stupid. And what if you are not involved and want to leave? You get knocked out with a taser! You want to know the plan? Shut up and do as you're told. Sounds like a fascist new order. Don't ask questions! Obey (or get hit with a taser)! I found myself hoping that they would get wiped out. I don't need ""heroes"" who treat their ""best pilot"" as an enemy. They make horrible decisions and take no responsibility.I didn't have any ""fan theories"" about this movie. I didn't watch any reviews, insights, etc. before viewing it. I had one expectation: to see an enjoyable movie. This movie was not enjoyable. It was a failure.For anyone who likes it, that's great. But people already liked ""Star Wars"". It didn't need to be ""fixed"" and for the majority of viewers, it was a miss.This movie really had potential but I feel that it was all wasted. I won't be watching the next one. Time to move on.",0
2080,The worst Star Wars movie ever I don’t like it made Luke hermit ok do something different not for fans screw it rian Johnson hates Star Wars period that’s why he messed It up,0
2081,Basically ruined the entire saga. Force awakens had a decent start but unfortunately Rian Johnson failed to connect the dots and because of his subverting our expectations he made an unrewatchable mess that has nothing to do with star wars.,0
2082,"This is hands down the worst Star wars movie made. there are countless plot holes and MARYSUEEEEEEEEEEE (Ray is invincible and ""perfect"") it is just disgusting horrible excuse for what was an amazing franchise i will always see this movie as the worst unless the sequel somehow manages to be even worse. the worst plot holes (flying a starship at light speed into the largest fleet vessel the empire has ever had and somehow destroying it and most of the fleet, *if this is the case they could literally build ships to destroy the deathstar in the first SW.* Luke somehow not seeing a glimpse of hope in his grandson and not caring about anything going on in the galaxy, literally the antithesis of his original character... and he can somehow become a force ghost on command now, Ray gets a triple kill with one shot from inside the cannons of the Millennium falcon with no prior use of them. Ray somehow single-handedly defeats one of the most powerful sith lords at this time in a ""mind force battle"" because she's ""A STRONG WOMAN GET OVER IT"".) looks graphically good that is why 1 point. those are a few and i could go on but it would be a waste of time, **** this movie.",0
2083,"Upended many canonical elements in the Star Wars universe.  Utterly, utterly, devastatingly disappointing. George Lucas, we miss you.",0
2086,"This is complete, absolute **** And I presume, I'm russian bot now. Screw you paid reviewers.",0
2087,There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said but this film proves that a 4 decade old franchise isn't seen as a form of escapism but instead a soap box for what ever political problems line the top of Lucasfilm and Disneys lists.,0
2088,"Really don't know where to start.This movie is a abomination of Star Wars movie, destroying everything that was great about it.Tricking us into believing that there will be a continues of the story and wasting our hard earned money.  And what was done to Luke was unforgivable. I remember when I watched it for the first time as a kid 40years ago, it blew me away, it opened up my imagination. Now this ? rubbish...why? We don't matter anymore? Getting rid of the ""old"" and in with the new?? Basically you intentionally went out to say F### YOU to all of us loyal fans that have stuck with SW for ever????Well F### YOU I wont be watching anymore, the real STAR WARS is dead.",0
2089,re watched it again on Netflix after i initially saw it opening day in the theater. It has not gotten any better. Way too long for nothing to really happen.,0
2090,This movie took a long time favorite movie franchise and completely destroyed it. They disregarded everything that is Star Wars and crapped all over everything we loved about it.It tried to make up explanations in my head for all the things messed up in this movie. However it's time to accept that the Star Wars franchise will never be as great as it once was.,0
2091,"It had so much potential and it just felt like a spoof. I am no longer interested in this saga thanks to this one movie. Writing makes up for so much of the film. It was well directed and visually beautiful, but the film had the worst writing I've ever witnessed. 2.8/10",0
2092,Just rewatched this. Movie is gorgeous. Acting is solid. Story was so so bad. Characters were all bland and uncompelling. I hate to use this term but... Mary sue all over the place. LUKE! They put Luke's name on some random character and expect me to believe it's Luke? Nope. Luke's most defining trait is optimism and he becomes emo because he screwed up? Nope. Luke would then sacrifice himself to make sure Ben Solo knew he was loved.,0
2093,"What was this movie? There's no logic. There's no gravity in space! Everyone was basically made into a fool than character buildup. Fight me Rian, but this was not a Star Wars movie. More or less, it's kind of like a 'Spaceballs' movie gone political. The only good thing about this movie was that it was beautifully shot. That's why I didn't look at my phone throughout the duration of the film.",0
2094,"Despite having a collection of over 3000 movies I rarely post a review on movie sites...but this movie deserves its increasingly poor rating.The cinematography is excellent, as is the score and the effects...but the story is a mess. Juvenile humour that is jarringly out of place for a Star Wars movie, ""world mechanics"" that are internally contradictory, repeated middle fingers to significant events in the Force Awakens (which made the rebooted franchise fun to watch).I'm not even hating on the movie for its blatant political messages or gender and racial biases.This movie is not a Star Wars story, because it gives middle fingers to plot points from the original movies that started the franchise.If all someone has to do is fly a starship into an enemy at lightspeed, why the hell did the rebels sacrifice most of their best pilots in a new hope on a million to one chance that someone could drop a photon torpedo down the thermal exhaust port?Light-speed through the death star...problem solved with one death. Luke Skywalker wasn't needed. At all.Which is the basic point of why this entire movie is not a Star Wars story...Skywalker is unnecessary. The past is meaningless and insignificant. Giving middle fingers to past episodes by belittling amazing plot points is not ""innovative, bold and fresh"" storytelling; it is not ""growth and revitalization"" of a franchise. It's a lazy and disrespectful deconstruction of previously brilliant, original, inspired movie-making!Rian Johnson should be ashamed that he wrote and filmed this. He is now as dead to me as Brett Ratner since X-3.Dear Kathleen Kennedy. I will never pay for another Disney-Wars movie. I am infinitely grateful I saw this for free at a sponsored screening. The cosmic irony is that Spaceballs celebrated its 30th anniversary this year...considering that a number of themes from it were used in this movie.My disappointment has rarely been so profound.The 1 star is for John Williams, the effects guys, and the unfortunate actors and crew that were contractually obligated to make this stinker. The studios, writers, producers and directors get 0 stars.",0
2095,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I saw it over a year ago and I am still pissed off about it.  After seeing The Force Awakens, I was so excited to see The Last Jedi.  I could not have been any more violated by this movie. I loved Star Wars and saw the first movie in theaters when I was a kid. My childhood hero was Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson ruined this movie and burnt the entire franchise down with it. This movie had excellent music and beautiful cinematography, but none of that mattered once the character started acting. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. I felt like I was watching a Star Wars spoof.   Rian Johnson did the one thing that I thought was impossible—he made me not care about the next Star Wars movie.  I won’t go see it now just to protest this terrible film.",0
2096,I never thought Star Wars would be the reason for me to not love it as much as I used too. The decisions made for the franchise after the Disney purchase baffles me,0
2098,"Nearly as bad as it's touted to be, the prequels are better or just watch your favorite version of Empire same movie much better done.",0
2099,"I expected to be engaged by this movie. My friends were divided between ""it's OK"" and ""it's the worst Star Wars movie ever,"" but I thought that meant it would be a thoughtful and engaging film given the praise critics heaped upon it. I should have realized nobody said it was a great movie, but I found it the most disappointing film I watched. First of all, the pacing was off and the movie jumps from scene to scene without a realistic time flow. Due to reasons other viewers mentioned, I found it hard to suspend my disbelief despite not exactly having high standards in that department. The acting from the villains was over-the-top and the protagonists' acting was melodramatic-maybe OK if this were a romance movie, but it isn't. Both the protagonists and antagonists acted in a manner that broke verisimilitude and rationality.I guess it was pretty to look at though, like a Transformers movie. To conclude, this movie failed to make me excited about the sequel or any Star Wars media made under Disney. As critics seem to have a very different definition of a good movie compared to mine, I will not be watching Episode 9 unless the audience reviews are overwhelmingly positive.",0
2100,"I am not sure if it deserves 3, 4 or 5, but I fail to see how such a badly written script can deserve over 6 or 7 (very odd that this site adds ""universal acclaim"" and ""must see"" medals to it).  With so many great Star Wars authors, flatly ignored by Disney, and with so much money, how can you end-up with such a bad story.  Utterly ignoring even The Force Awakens (first of this trilogy) is mind-blogging, as it shows that the team and Disney did not even have a story planned to start with.  I will not detail all the bad points that numerous reviewers on Youtube properly explained.  This movie must not be considered canon in the Star Wars universe/lore. -- It is the opposite of a ""must see"". I watch such corny movies with a child's heart, so it is very hard to make me give a negative review!  I write this months later, with nearly a year to think about it (read: not just a reaction).",0
2101,"Vieron la escena en la cual Luke tira el sable laser hacia atras sin importarle nada, es lo que Rian Johnson hace con la mitología de star wars y lo que habia construido J. J. Abrams.",0
2102,"I rate this movie a 2 at best.I can't really add anything to the already unnumbered amount of reviews that rip this hot dumpster fire of a movie apart, but I'll list my gripes.1. Of course, Rey is a Mary Sue and lacks any explanation for her stupid amounts of power. Barely, if not at all, trained in the ways of the Force and she can somehow beat Luke in a duel. I call b.s.2. Luke's character. Need I say anything? Somehow he went from one of the most positive and hopeful characters of all of mainstream media to being a lonesome, cranky hermit who wanted to kill a Youngling. Yeah no, way to screw over his character, Ryan Johnson. Glad you aren't working on the next movie.3. Finn's character arc is totally ruined by that Rose chick coming in and knocking him out of the way right before he could take out the cannon. He could've capped off his story by sacrificing his life and doing the exact opposite what he'd been intending to do since the previous film, to run away from the First Order. But alas, gotta have this random chick come in and stop that from happening.4. The blatant feminism and SJW leanings in this **** movie. The purple-haired lady, Rose, and especially Rey are all examples of it. Rey, the strong female lead, with absolutely NO explanations for her power or how on Earth she could beat Luke Skywalker of all people. Rose, the pointless addition to the cast made to make Finn look like an idiot. And oh joy, purple-haired lady. Literally the most SJW looking character I've ever seen in all of fiction. I needn't rant on, anyone reading this already knows how garbage this movie is. That said, don't go out of your way to watch it if you haven't already. No need to further fuel the left-leaning movie-making machine that is modern Disney. Don't give them that satisfaction.",0
2103,"I'm giving star wars the last jedi a 3 out of 10 because it technically is a bad film  though it deserves a 4 or 5 if you love scifi but not starwars.  I've waited many years to review this film which emotionally left me hollow on opening weekend. It actually upset me in a way which I can't quite express. Like no other sw film , even the prequels.As a sci-fi fan and a movie fan and a star wars fan I can't help but love the character and actor like skywalker and Mark hamill but this film seems to hate him and the franchise on multiple levels. Like the recent sonic film they choose in their arrogance to reinvent the wheel for no good reason beyond they could.  It's a bad film and a disrespectful film to your time and money and memory.  Though there is a half decent film under all the garbage and there are good fan edits out there.  They usually have removed almost an hour of stupidity and left a series of impressive action scenes with some of our most beloved stars.  Sadly one of those stars has been extinguished.  For that reason alone the film is worthy of your time as Carrie Fisher delivers a solid performance.  I enjoyed Solo.  I liked rogue leader. I loved the original trilogy and enjoyed attack of the clones.  The force awakens is ok i guess though seeing han get old made me sad.  The last jedi is nothing like these films I like and love. It is not a star wars film despite the packaging and label.I don't have much more to say beyond I was dissapoited in Ryan Johnson as director because I enjoyed his previous films for being popcorn fun.  Jurassic park 3 is my fav film of the series even though it's again a technically poor movie. It was funny. TLJ tries so hard to be a whacky comedy and a political commentary and fails at both. I strongly recommend seeking out that fan edit and give yourself the sw experience you deserve.",0
2104,Killed the franchise. There is just nowhere to go storywise. I have zero interest in seeing Episode IX because there is just no way to make a coherent story out of this mess.,0
2105,"This movie was garbage in so many ways. if i went into detail no one could shut me up. As a longtime fan of the near perfect original 6 movies, i can safely say that this movie was a waste of time,tallent (cast (mostly) anyway) and my time as a longtime fan. I just have one thing to say to Rian Johnson you have completely ruined Star Wars.",0
2106,I have to admit that it takes some talent to completely misinterpret and destroy one of the most iconic and beloved fairy tale sifi character of all times.,0
2107,Boring plot. The story arch didn't seem to have anything to do with return of the Jedi or the force awakens. Not fun to watch.,0
2108,"Very disappointing. Threw away a lot of the more interesting plot points of episode 7, forced new characters who gave little to the plot and main plot lacked sense.",0
2109,Thanks for ruining stars wars with this horrible movie. Thanks for messing up the best hero in stars wars.....Luke. I’m done with stars wars bc of this horrible movie.,0
2110,"just when you thought it couldn't get any worse than the force awakens, this movie comes out and hands it a oscar. disneys third trilogy of star wars is really nothing more than a ingonito re-imanging/reboot  of the original's claiming to be a continuation of a story built on the same plots. not to mention there horrible movies by them self. especially the last jedi.",0
2111,"Completely ruined Star Wars for me. From the writers not understanding and ruining beloved characters, to them not understanding the force and the skill that it requires to be a Jedi to to useless plot lines and the Mary Sue main character that becomes a master by doing literally nothing, I can confidently say that I will not be watching anymore Disney Star Wars movies and I will not consider any of them canon.",0
2112,"I don’t need to say anything that has been said a million times over and over, all I have to say is just NO!!",0
2113,"So what did i gain from watching this SJW take on Star Wars? Absolutely nothing...Rey is the biggest Mary Sue to ever grace cinema history, Luke is now a hermit that lets himself get beaten by Rey, to remind us that this is a movie with SJW feminazi ideology. Rose is the definition of a pointless character, she takes up screen-time that should have been used for Snoke or Luke (THE MORE IMPORTANT CHARACTERS) She also ruined Finn for me.Snoke is the definition of a wasted villain, episode 7 was meaningless now, huge villain build-up is gone.Admiral Holdo was just stuck-up the whole time, completely unlikable and withholding plans to escape from her own team. Didn't even look like a military leader at all. Poe was in this movie to get bashed for saving lives.There was too much comedy and subverted expectations, everything that happened, happened only because we wouldn't expect it.... that's not good story telling in the slightest.This movie saved me from spending my money on future star wars movies.""Go Woke, Go Broke"".",0
2114,The disregard for previous films and continuity. The plot holes. A script written by a small child without a rudimentary grasp of basic human nature and behavior. Strike that. Any child who has grown up to Star Wars has probably spent years playing better make believe games that this. In short. See something else.,0
2115,How can they make star wars this boring. this is Easily the worst star wars movie ever made. Half the movie is the resistance running away from the first order. The casino scene is easily the most forgettable part of the movie. They ruined luke skywalker. They kill off snoke to advance the plot which means snoke is a wasted character. Oh I also almost fell asleep watching this.,0
2116,"Easily one of the most disappointing films of the last 50 years.  Beautiful visuals, surrounded by non-sensical plot points, ridiculously written characters (including complete personality changes to already existing characters), and action scenes with tactical decisions a high-schooler would laugh at.  Not to mention attempts at slap-stick that were just awful. It was boring, dumb, and insulting to long-time Star Wars fans.  At least the prequels TRIED to tell a coherent story.  This thing was just a mess.",0
2117,"A lot of the movies plot made no sense. There was an entire approximately hour long scene that was a complete waste of time in the end.If Poe is one of the high commanders and best pilot, you would tell your high ranking officer the plan. That makes no sense not too, only for the writers to make the long and useless plot that wasted half the movie with. The character development and the plot fell flat. I was hugely disappointed in an entirety. Every build up The Force Awakens build up, this movie destroyed. And then the one scene that was incredible cringe. Flying through space. You all know the scene. That was just. Bad.",0
2118,"If you've never seen another Star Wars movie, then this one isn't completely terrible...just a typical big budget space fantasy that makes no sense.If, on the other hand, you are (or were) a Star Wars fan, this movie absolutely is terrible.  So many other reviews have pointed out most of the problems (and they are significant), but they've left out the one that bothers me the most.  The main reason I didn't like this movie is because it renders all the movies that went before it pointless.  All the fantastic effort, all the near death battles, all the just-in-time victories...they're all pointless because, by the end of Episode VIII, the entire rebellion is crushed down to just a few people.Everything Luke and Leia and Han and Obi Wan and the droids ever fought for...all lost.  This is key:  if they had never existed, the Star Wars universe would be no worse off.  They accomplished nothing.  What sort of nihilistic excrement is that?  Wherever the series goes from here, it's a completely new story with no heritage from the original movies.",0
2119,"I visibly cringed while watching this pile of vomit. Everything sacred was torn down and buried. Subvert expectations is an excuse for gross negligence, perhaps even malicious intent. Jedi training matters, no one is born to the art and skill. Ancient Jedi teachings matter, wisdom matters, no knowledge should be burned. Murder is not the Jedi way, especially of unarmed individuals presumed guilty before innocent. Credible character arcs are born of flawed journeys. Giant characters built up over time should not be eliminated in ridiculous and implausible manners, without adequate back story and closure. I was emotionally detached from this mess, and retained no affinity or attraction. It is utterly unwatchable, even repulsive. I have never witnessed such a rabid and rapid destruction of a franchise. Subvert expectations indeed, the expectation that Star Wars is reborn or has a future.",0
2120,"By far the worst of all the star wars. This movie is a complete mess made by someone who wanted to do something different and assuming that because its different its good. Not everything needs to be different some things are good and that's ok. Lets see... Rey keeps getting more and more powerful without any real training. Instead of failing and learning from it, she always wins! There is a woman who ordered her army to do stuff that made no sense and just said they should obey just because she said so. The people who didn't agree with her where made to be selfish and reckless. Suddenly Leia had super powers that allowed her to wake up from being unconscious and fly in the coldness in space with no problems. A woman stopped a man from saving the day because she ""fell in love"" with him even though they had no chemistry at all and barely just met. Also, Luke would save the day but when she selfishly stopped the guy from saving the day she didn't know this. The evil villain who was supposed to be the baddest was killed pretty quickly and easy. And then we get to Luke... Luke Skywalker, the guy who never lost faith, who never gave up, the guy who saved his fathers soul and the galaxy, for some reason, became a hate filled, hopeless guy. You know, because when you are the hero of the galaxy and manage to make all your dreams come true, its only logical that you would become bitter, hate filled and leave the world to become a hermit and not care about anyone else. Makes a lot of sense! Also, even though you never gave up on your father after he already turned evil, you give up easily on your nephew who hasn't turned evil yet and try to murder him in his sleep like a coward. This dude destroyed all that Luke stood for and was. I know this is just a movie and I shouldn't care, but I cant deny its sad. I will wait for my friends to let me know what the next movie (episode 9) is about and then Ill check it out because I dont trust this people anymore. There are a ton more things that i disliked about the movie but This is long enough. Its just terrible. I hope Rian Johnson's new Star Wars trilogy gets canceled, he should never be allowed near any SW thing ever again. The one good thing that came out of this movie, to be honest, is that this movie made me see how much I liked star wars because I never was hardcore into the movies, never owned any of them or owned anything star wars but it really bothered me what they did which was surprising to me and made me realize I do like the movies.",0
2121,"One of the worst instances of script writing. Where was the respect for the lore? Where was the temperance to involve oneself with the legacy? Fast rush to CGI, constant stop and start film 'progression', a side-plot romance that serves no purpose, half a film's worth of lore left to imagination. It did some glorious acting, superb involvement but to a script that was tantamount to a five year old's wishlist, not the continuation of a saga. Key emotional throwbacks to the episodes 4-6 were the only sentimental moments in a plot that lacked direction. A chewed up, discredited lineage development for the main character discarded. A villain built up in the previous movie but dispatched in seconds of encounter. No notion of galactic politics or the balance of forces at the time. Superficially engrossing your audience is not telling a valid story. Whereas Rogue One is an absolute masterpiece, this film learnt nothing. It had every reason to take the failures of Episode 7, take a look at the acclaim of Rogue One and draw the lessons. Rian Johnson should not be let near a classic movie again. Lucky to get 2 out of 10, the actors deserve praise for sticking to it.",0
2122,"This is probably the worst Star Wars movie ever made, it is full of nonsense.  There is no way to defend this aberration.",0
2123,"Pros:- CGICons:- characters- writting- battle choreography- dead SnoKe- dead Luke- SJW propaganda- overpower Rey, defeat Luke without training,defeat Snoke guards,...- betrayal Luke Skywalker path Jedi.

2126,"PLOTHOLES the movie, yes, i know all SW films have plotholes, but this entire movie is a plothole the only reason im giving this a 3/10 is for some good performances and some great ideas it has.This movie makes no sense (having no fuel makes your ship stops even tough u are in SPACE), the timing is wrong, how much time does Rei spends at the island? a few hours like it is implied? how come Finn is only in a comma for like 2 minutes? and then when he wakes up he knows how to fly a ship, when he not knowing how to fly was a mayor point of the last movie? did he learned how to drive in the comma?",0
2127,It's a truly terrible movie. Rian Johnson should never be allowed near Star Wars. Totally trashed and disrespected the lore. Terrible acting. Terrible writing. Worst big budget film I've ever seen.,0

Please don't accept this representation of the character. It's totally wrong. Everything from the previous movie is meaningless and it goes so far to break a lot of important concepts in the series... warp kamikaze: seriously? Lightsabers physics totally wrong ( That's Disney right there for you!); The plot must be the most boring **** I ever saw. Oh and the pseudo feminist themes... they end up portraying women as totally incompetent. And then? Well, salt.",0
2129,"Utter piece of crap. Period. This isn’t a movie, is a propaganda film, and it isn’t Star Wars. The critics reviews are paid. No one can like this trash.",0
2130,"I grew up with George Lucas' vision of the films, its themes, ""poetry"", oftentimes silliness, and creativity. Above all, it pushed boundaries. On SOME LEVEL, it pushed boundaries. I'm really not here to get into all that. All I can say is that this movie did none of that. It didn't even try. Give this IP back to Lucas. Daddy knows best (you can quote me on that). Other than that, I don't really want to get into it. This movie just didn't have any of the aforementioned qualities to it.",0
2132,"You think it couldn't get any worse than The Force Awakens and then it does. Bad acting, cardboard characters, illogical scenarios, and zero respect for the mythology - coated with more than a dash of PC propaganda.",0
2133,Terrible movie.  I bought it through Vudu and fell asleep taking a total of 5 days to finish.  Ep7 was forgivable with its bad decisions but this film is pure garbage.  Done with Disney/Star Wars.,0
2134,"This is the worst movie ever made for the starwars franchise. Every one involved in that movie except Mark Hamill should be ashamed of themselves, they literally are ruining the fabrics of society with their absurd sjw pushed agenda.It's as if they are seeking to have humans hate each other and put them in a state of civil animosity. This movie is pure garbage that destroy and humiliates beloved/established characters by replacing them with unlikable characters that have no story to back anything in what they can acheive.Kathleen Kennedy is the worst of the worst and she placed the worst trolls of all time to direct this movie by obviously spitting on George Lucas hard work.This is outrageous. Anyone who likes this movie is absolutely nuts and should do an immediate introspection.",0
2135,"As the second installment in a trilogy tasked with moving pieces into place for an epic finale, TLJ fails. As a direct sequel to The Force Awakens, tasked with continuing the character, plot, and development threads, TLJ fails. The dialogue needs work, but what Star Wars movie can't claim that? The color palette is lacking. The characters feel flat and forced into place for whatever scene the writer decided he wanted to have in his big epic movie. Character choices and motivations make no sense. Tonally dissonant from one moment to the next. Fight scenes poorly shot and choreographed (the throne room scene is a particularly blatant example. if you need to have a full weapon digitally edited out of someone's hand, otherwise they would have murdered your heroine, then it's not well-done). The characters you enjoyed from TFA feel off-brand. The movie seems to go out of its way to tell you and the in-universe characters that you were stupid for expecting Star Wars to feel like Star Wars-- in how things work, in slim chances succeeding. Except, of course, when they do happen the way you expected half a film ago, true to formula, ultimately leaving your heroes in an even worse position than when they ended the last movie. The moral lessons make no sense and are all over the place. Characters and talented cast are wasted. It's lackluster and frankly mediocre in most ways. Finn is selfish and a coward for not wanting to jump all-in for a cause for another army (after being raised abused by another army that didn't even let him have a name and wanted him to be willing cannon fodder), except then the person who berated him for that decides that he's wrong for trying to sacrifice himself for the cause later on. Poe is wrong for the mutiny and being upset with Holdo, but Holdo didn't tell anybody in the entire Resistance they even had a real plan with a chance of succeeding, ultimately leading to the failure of the plan she had. Rey trusting Kylo Ren and confiding in him comes with no realistic buildup whatsoever. I still can't wrap my head around it. You care about Snoke and his origin/motivations? Want to learn really anything interesting or new about the First Order? Too bad. Expectations subverted. ""Free the racing animals, but not the slave children."" - The Last Jedi's inherent problem in a nutshell.The pacing drags. Most of the deleted scenes would have been better off in the actual product. But I guess they really needed that milk scene and shirtless Kylo Ren scene? At the very base level when I go into a Star Wars film, I expect to have fun. This movie is not fun. I have not rewatched it but once since it came out, and if my sister hadn't asked, I wouldn't have watched the second time at all. I cannot enjoy this movie. And god help me, I tried to.There are one or two interesting concepts, which were poorly executed. And one very breathtaking shot at the climax of the film (which takes place 40 minutes before the film even ends, so consider that). The actors are all clearly doing the best they can with what they're given, and they are ALL talented. Kelly Marie Tran is a welcome addition to this franchise! I hope the next movie has her character make sense and stay true to what all the additional canon information told us about her.",0
2136,Movie is crap. We all know that though. Mark hamil does a great job as well as adam driver.,0
2138,"What a disaster. The performances by Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Mark Hamill are pretty great and still they could not save this. I have no idea how I made it all the way through on my first watch. I made it about a third of the way through the second time. Brutal.",0
2139,Movie is nothing more then feminist BS! Star Wars RIP :( There is nothing good and new in this movie.,0
2140,"I would put a zero but l liked Poe.. nevermind, this has nothing to do with the old good Star Wars. Star Wars without Luke, Leia, Obi Wan, Darth Vader, Emperor and Yoda for me is a nothing. Also, Snoke died in a very bizarre way, isn't it? the most disappointing space movie (because this thing doesn't remind me Star Wars l used to know and love).",0
2141,This is how you ruin a beloved franchise. I grew up watching Star wars and this movie hurt my childhood. I remember leaving the theater confused after watching it. I thought killing Snoke was a bold move. But Then i read they want to expand his stories in other movies and comics. That is when i understood Star wars is just for grabbing money from fans. There was no artistic integrity or honor to the Original movies. Ryan johnson is one of the worst director's i have seen and subverting the exceptions is as bad as how Game of thrones ended. I might sound like an angry fanboy. but trust me i am not. There are few good things this movie has done but the negatives points are more than the positives.,0
2142,This was the movie that killed any interest in me for the new Star Wars movies made by Disney after Rogue One. It broke everything that made Star Wars great... Horrific experience.,0
2144,To many  Annoying characters with too little good story. The film is too long and spoils iconic characters like Luke,0
2145,"Lousy story, bad actors, badly directed, just as bad as it can get. I just watched it through because it was Star Wars and I, stupidly as I was, hoped that something for the better is waiting around ne next thene but that never arived. This movie is even worse then let‘s say a movie about Ewoks or Star Wars VII.",0
2146,Subverts my expectation that I was going to get a better SW movie compared to the last installment.,0
2147,This movie destroyed the star wars canon and my childhood along with it. I will never watch another Rian Johnson movie.,0
2148,"This movie is everything wrong with Hollywood and why I have lost faith in Star Wars under Disney. Never has a movie/franchise mistreated both fans and the original creator so much then this movie has done. As the follow up from to the horrible The Force Awakens, this follow up does nothing new or proactively pushes the narrative while trying to be new and ""bold."" It is laughable how bad the script is on a technical level as well as story level when you fundamentally don't understand how a beloved character such as Luke is supposed to act. Rian Johnson does not understand the universe he is working with, disrespects the story (Episode VII) before it to continue a follow up, and he does all of this while sitting on a high horse believing he made art when it is nothing but utter garbage. When you try so hard to put spectical and your own ideology before story and character you will result in garbage as this. This movie shows me what Disney's true colors are and I can easily tell they haven't take any liberty to understand what special universe they posses. Especially while writing this is after Bob Iger's autobiography is released where he admitted to conning Lucas (intended or not) on having Lucas believe they will do his story and his sequels justice. Now I agree with Lucas after Episode VII was released, he did sell it to white slavers and Star Wars is truly dead. I have a decent feeling after two years and this movie has really spit the fan base that Episode IX will not do well. I do not plan on seeing it for one. I bought multiple tickets for each Star Wars movie and I as sure many other have who will not see it. Just stick with the originals and if you crave more Star Wars then watch the Clone Wars Show and prequels. At least they're done justice in the way of good, original ideas by someone who cares for this galaxy far far away...",0
2149,This movie was a steaming pile of excrement and should never have been made. The director should be banned from film making indefinitely. All the bad things you have read about this film are true. Somehow the Disney machine has carefully controlled critic opinion of this disaster. Dont fall for it.,0
2150,"Just no. no no no no no no no no no no. Not focused on any important overarching values, just pushing a very specific agenda. We get it - women can 1 up men. Even if those men are billed as the main hero. Leia was such a fantastic character and it was organic af. Whoever injected this script with a cheap ideological agenda did a disservice to the female characters they manufactured because they weren't 3 dimensional - they only existed to be like ""hEy! WoMeN r SmaRt 2!!!! wE CaN bE bEtTeR ThAn MeN!!!"" Also wtf did they do to luke?????? makes no sense.",0
2151,Probably the worst film I've ever seen. I cannot believe what Rian Johnson did to Star Wars. Shame on you!,0

2154,"While it is an well-made movie, with great acting, cinematography and direction, this movie utterly fails as a movie in plotting and story. The entire movie is one big chase scene that could be entertaining to someone. however to me it was boring. The biggest issue with this film is the misuse of comedy (by this I mean following serious moments with unfunny jokes). It is really bad and it is comparable to the first two prequels.",0
2155,"Awful writing. A total lack of understanding of the rules established in the star wars universe. Completely disrespected anything that has come before it. It was not interested in building on what was there it was intent on destruction, this is not an exaggeration  just look at some of the writing explicity saying so.Ultimately Rian Johnson has mistook subversion for quality story telling. There wasn't even any real action or light sabre duels to compensate. I wish I could give it a minus score.",0
2156,"Follow a generic Mary-Sue through an unoriginal adventure that destroys past setup logic and pisses all over George's universe.This movie really feels like Disney is trying their hardest to shove their new and boring characters down your throat, while actively throwing the characters you know and love into a trash compacter. They use Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher as marketing tools and that's it. I hope the toy sales are worth destroying what could literally be a money printer for Disney.",0
2157,"It is the movie that separated the star wars community, it disrespected Luke's character from one heroic individual that never  gives up to a pathetic character, The only thing that is nice from the movie is the CGI effects but only that, the story doesn't make sense and the new characters like Rose Tico and that woman with purple hair were forgettable, It was so bad that it made the episode 7 unwatchable,and the choreography in the lightsaber fights was miserable and it can't be compared with the lightsaber fights from the prequels. I don't recommend it to no one.",0
2158,For what they did to this franchise someone shall go to prison.Don't pay to watch it. Not recommended.,0

2162,"Anyone that gave above a 4 for this movie does not understand Star Wars. The writing and character development was so bad its actually insulting. The director should not have even been considered for this movie, his work includes Breaking Bad...the fly episode. I rest my case.",0
2163,The fans don't hate The Last Jedi because it's a bad movie. They hate it because Rian threw away everything that The Force Awakens built up and for absolutely no reason. That is what makes this movie an utter pile of garbage. It will forever be known as the film that killed this trilogy.,0
2164,Rudite in movie industry. Disaster. Poob. .뭘 이리 많이 쓰래ㅜ젠장 개똥같은 영화에 요구하는게.많네.,0
2167,There should be a process to ban Rian Johnson from Disney headquarters for life.,0
2168,"The Last Jedi wanting to ""let the past die"" is ruined by the fact that it (like the rest of the ST) realizes too much on nostalgia yet for some reason wants to disrespect what came before it. Not sure what the OT did to Disney to make them hate Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewie but it comes across as needlessly mean spirited. The action scenes have too many leaps of logic to give any suspense or excitement, many of the new characters introduced in them film come across as unlikable, needlessly withholding information (ya know who they are) completely useless and say truly idiotic dialogue (ya know who they are) and Poe is just so needlessly crapped on it comes across as a ""toxic masculinity"" message that doesn't work in any way. The First Order is  incompetent and are played far too much for comedy. Plot lines set up from the Force Awakens just go absolutely nowhere for no real reason. In terms of the writing the movie is just a mess. Sure it looks great in parts, but it's just no enough to make a good film.",0
2169,"Awful excuse for a Star Wars movie. Writing & characterization are brutal. It's like fan fiction with a $300 million dollar budget--except the ""fan"" ignores everything that came before, doesn't know how to tell a story, and is trying really, really hard to make it like a Marvel superhero action movie. Genuinely uncomfortable to watch, for even a moderate Star Wars fan like myself. Hardcore fans will puke, then cry, then wish they could unsee it. Actually, I wish I could unsee it too.",0

2174,"Star Wars is, without doubt, my favorite series and films completely and it really kills me to say that this film was pretty bad and dropped the ball in many parts. Visually the movie is amazing and looks great but storywise and as a Star Wars movie it leaves you wondering WTH is going on. Character building and story questions that were left open from the first movie that should have been answered in this movie were just completely bombed. The plot of the movie was completely ridiculous and useless and there were scenes that literally broke Star Wars lore. It was as if someone was just making things up as they were going just for the sake of looking cool or trying to be edgy. The lightsaber battle which is usually always the saving grace in a Star Wars movie was terribly choreographed (Watch it over on youtube in slow motion and watch how many mistakes there are).   My disappointment is immeasurable for this movie and it left me not caring for the final movie. This is the first time in my life where I can say I don't really care what happens in the last Star Wars movie or that I am not even looking forward to it.",0
2176,"It's a bad movie that shouldn't have been made, but not for anit-capitalism, SJW or diversity reasons. The people complaining about those are incels and nationalists. No, the movie is bad because it destroys what the whole saga was built upon. It's like the director heard people complaining that TFA was too ""samey"" so he went in the TOTALLY opposite direction which had immense consequences. I do not recommend it.",0
2177,"Star wars its a legendary franchise since the first movie, characters like luke skywalker, leia organa and han solo made star wars good. Something that george lucas understand, he improve with the movies and he added a lot of things that make the movies more interesting.

I can't believe that the return of the jedi have an incredible low score and this **** of the last jedi have 8.5, i mean, really? THEY KILL LUKE SKYWALKER WITHOUTH ANY REASON, DAMN! mark hamil hate the new trilogy, yeah even if he got paid to appear, and yeah, he will return in ""the ryse of skywalker"" but he dont care about the franchise anymore, and a great majority of the fans think the same. all i can say of this **** is just that, its a **** movie for his own, its even worst like a sequel not only of star wars, its bad even as a sequel of the force awakens, which wasnt the big thing but definitely was better than this piece of ****.i can tell that this movie put the worst ideas, they made the worst version of luke, they killed luke, rey its a mary sue who is actually good without no reason, they killed snok when he was presented like a treath, the rhytm of the movie is slow, and dont made me talk about boring and stupid characters like rose tico or fin.i will give it a 1 just because a 0 score would mean that it doesnt appear anything, and thats not the case, disney put a lot of things here, the problem is that all the stuff is a incredible disgustin mountain of ****",0

Isn’t it funny that all the critics think it’s a great film but every single viewer thinks it’s one of the worst movies ever. Not just because they ruined Luke and wasted half the movie on finns pointless side quest. It doesn’t capture anything, goes for ages yet nothing happens, ruined everything the first movie started and possibly already sets the next movie up for failure. Critics out there need to have a good think and stop trying to look like an individual, it was utter garbage and should be scraped from cannon altogether. Last time I tried to rewatch it I feel asleep it was that boring. On rotten tomatoes there is an no love by the fans. Of course you will say they have to much heart in it and it’s creating a bias caused from nostalgia but that’s just wrong. You should have love for the film it’s what makes them good, not something that completely screws all the fundamentals of this universe and just throws everything into chaos because the story writer wanted to look bold. He did it for himself not for the fans and not for the story and I hope he never has involvement in star wars again. Period.",0

Many wasted plot opportunities from 7 that hopefully will be patched in 9. They will never get another theatre dollar from me again, thank disney and rian for crapping on my childhood. If the marvel movies didn't exist showing us disney can make a quality series i wouldn't be as harsh but this definitely was not well paced like those. They make women look bad and unappealing where as black widow and captain marvel are well done. The mary sue, asian token, and purple hair are weak shallow characters that do the opposite of empowerment.",0
2197,"This movie is a cinematic failure. Disney has used Star Wars as a battleground for SJW's rather than telling an interesting story. This movie has a weak plot. This movie attempts to crack Marvel style jokes throughout the entire movie. This is extremely distracting and weakens the movie. The movie fails to build a connection to the characters, making all characters in the movie feel weak with no story. The overall decisions made on the squeal plot in this movie are painful. I don't have much else to say... this movie was terrible in nearly every aspect and I don't feel like writing anymore.",0
2198,"The plot of this movie is contrived, meandering and uninteresting for the most part. Most of the progression seems to rely on coincidence and convenience. There are quite a few twists throughout that lead nowhere and introduce little to nothing of interest to the story. As such, upon multiple viewings, most of the story beats feel pointless as they are just drawn out build-ups to reveals that are ultimately unsatisfying.The writing is sophomoric and the pacing uneven. Scenes that should have time to breathe are cut short and scenes that should be cut short, or just cut, seem to linger. Throughout most of the scenes, attempts at humour are injected at points where they tonally clash with the situations at hand and work to undermine any semblance of stakes, severity or consequence. Character motivation is at best underdeveloped and inconsistent and at worst nonsensical and contradictory. Dialogue is clunky and a lot of it feels like metacommentary directed at the fans rather than an exchange between real characters. Overall from a purely writing standpoint this movie falls flat.However, this movie does have a coherent message and works well as a deconstruction of the Star Wars franchise. As a metacommentary, the subjects it touches upon and the points it raises are valid, despite being delivered poorly or heavy handedly. The best praise I can give would be to the cinematography and direction. This is unequivocally the most beautiful, and well shot Star Wars movie, and although I find the movie as a whole unentertaining, poorly written and problematic as an installment to an established and ongoing franchise, I can find enjoyment in the visuals of the third act. Rian Johnson has a talent for framing shots in a striking and meaningful way.",0
2199,"Michael Bay would have made a better Star Wars film. TLJ was the first Star Wars movie where the audience did not cheer at the end, we all just left in silence. This was garbage.

2204,"This is the worst movie ever made.  Star Wars is supposed to take place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away but this movie felt like it took place on earth in the year 2017.  Star Wars is supposed to feel timeless but this movie already feels dated. Horrible decision for a movie that is the 8th of 9.  The worst characters are the ones created by Rian Johnson. If you are a hipster living in Portland, you might relate to the characters and dialogue but it's all cringe.  It's a corporate version of what the left leaning centrists think the left wants to see.  But white people still run the show and all minorities are side characters with no force powers (unlike the prequels which had asian women on the jedi counsel and a black man as the most powerful jedi in the galaxy). The only character Rian Johnson created with force powers was another white male. I've learned to accept what it has done to the canon but it's still a horrible unenjoyable movie that doesn't go 2 minutes without a cringeworthy scene. There are decent moments but if you take a great meal and mix it with poop, it's still uneatable.  I'm hoping a special edition can at least be made so I can watch all 9 saga movies in order without having to skip one.",0

It in no way feels like Star Wars, and it subverts our expectations in a pointless way. It feels as if Johnson was trolling Star Wars fans everywhere. What a disappointment after the promise of Force Awakens. If only Abrams had been allowed to make all three.",0
2207,"The lore of Star Wars is completely disattended with this movie, with ideas such as hyperspace to destroy enemy ships that could have been used in any other movie to get rid of the first or the second death star, and much more.This movie seems to push as much as possible with the ""subverted expectations"" theme. Since when being consistent has been considered bad? Why jokes are needed to take out a little of pathos in dramatic scenes? Why Rose and Finn have to go for that quest with a stupid backstory to end up being completely useless? Why killing Snoke in that stupid way?Since when Leia can do things using the Force? How much ridicolous is the fight with the red royal guards in Snoke's battleship, with them doing a stupid coreography rather than a decent fight?Really, how can this movie being considered as any good?",0

2209,"The worst Star Wars film ever made to date.Flips the entire series on it's head and shoves misandrist propaganda down your throat that doesn't belong in the Star Wars Universe. SO bad, that the sequel to this atrocity reverses several plot points and tries its hardest to NOT be like this movie. Kathleen Kennedy should be fired.",0
2211,"The only reason that this movie gets even a single point is that it is a visually pleasing movie to watch.  Absolutely everything else about it, however, is some combination of terrible writing, eye-rolling scenes, or illogical situations.Let's start with the characters.  Significant things or developments happen to multiple significant characters throughout this movie without an explanation or logical assumption.  Character growth is virtually non-existent, where everyone seems to move/act/talk simply to create dramatic moments.  I stopped counting how many times characters did not act in normal or logical ways purely to add drama and pay some sort of service to an identity or tired character trope.  And finally, previously introduced characters seem to only represent their original identity by name/actor alone (with some key characters, notably Luke, inexplicably ruined).The story is as illogical and flawed as the character development.  Scenes are either fabricated purely for dramatic effect or as filler to offer some characters a modicum of utility.  I cannot think of a single scene in the entire film that stands on either logic or in congruence with what we've come to know or love about the franchise...save for the odd light saber duel.  There is even a solid 20-30 minutes worth of the film that could be completely removed without affecting either the rest of the movie or franchise in any tangible way (casino venture).Where Episode VII was an obvious trip down nostalgia lane (read also: retread of original trilogy, namely episode IV) adding little to the franchise other than fan service, this one seemed to aim at pushing the franchise into isolation territory.  It is a metaphorical middle finger to Star Wars lore, and only works as a film if you forget all previous films/literature and eschew logic.  This film was clearly made to push the trilogy forward for the sake of selling tickets, merchandise, and virtually nothing else.This is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made, and given the issues with episodes I-III and lack of originality/ingenuity of VII, that's really saying something!",0
2212,Well this is the worst star wars movie... It just doesn't feel like star wars and as Rian Johnson said he only cared about his movie but didn't think about it being star wars,0

In the theatre, the humoristic tone fell off, and then when Luke threw away the light saber of his father, I felt betrayed as a fan of VII and as a fan of the entiee saga. Disney doesn’t respect beloved characters, they kill them or change them to be replaced by new forgettable characters that no one can identify with because they don’t struggle. I watched the movie several times since then. And the movie is a piece of trash except for its visual. I consider today this entire trilogy to be non cannon. Disney betrayed the fans and destroyed a legacy. I stick to Ep 1-6 and Clone Wars.",0

I don't understand it. They make Poe look like an absolute buffoon just to make some pink-haired lady look like some kind of tactical genius and huge martyr. Meanwhile, Finn is running around on a casino planet riding giraffes doing things that have zero impact on the plot. I'm not even joking. It is like whoever wrote this movie does not care about the characters or their development. Don't even get me started on what they do to Luke Skywalker. If you are a fan of the original trilogy, it is best to avoid these movies to keep the mystique and fun of the originals intact.",0

2240,"TL;DR A pandering, soggy, feminist, non-sensical, critic pleasing disappointment of a solid series.As a stand alone movie, detached from reality, broken away from anything else Star Wars and that had 200 million dollars dumped into it, it's okay. As the 9th installment that was supposed to shine as the apex of the grand adventure that George started spanning several generations with an established canon and formula, Disney and Kennedy spit in our faces and ruined what was going to be an amazing series for the past several years. Physically going to George Lucas and throwing away his creative instruction for his own series over Disney money only further incinerated the dumpster fire that was started with the constant bickering and firing of directors and producers. IX made VII and VIII make even less sense, and throws away so much of what was already established as canon. IX does a good job on trying to tie the loose knots that is killing off all male roles, making the sith (Kilo) look like an unconfident **** sorry excuses for character development, worse romance than Twilight had, and story development time wasting. This movie feels like it was rushed, poorly executed, and molded perfectly to please critics and leave the entire body of fans in the gutter. IX is a perfect example of pandering, you can see that divide perfectly between the people and the critics. 6 year old me is still shaking his head over this poor development that was established between Lucas Art's movies, and what was established in VII. I created an account just to convey this disappointment. This isn't the Star Wars we know, this is Disney's portrayal of what they wanted Star Wars to be.",0
2241,"This movie would be fine if it was the first of an original series. Unfortunately, it follows 7 previous movies in the same universe with over 40 years of lore and connected story. You would think that being a middle film in a trilogy that plot points and character development would be carefully considered to connect the previous film and leave something worth following in the final film. Apparently, Rian Johnson didn't really care about the trilogy as a whole and forgot where he fits in the series as well as the new trilogy. Subverting expectations is exactly what he did by making choices that oppose a logical person's expectation for a congruent story. Sure its bold and also very stupid. Now we have a movie that leaves a dud for every interesting build up from the previous movie and leaves nothing for the final movie to go on. We have a new powerful villain....actually he was nothing. Well then maybe Kilo Ren will set up to be the evil villian....actually no he is  force flirting with Ray and even takes her side in a fight. The theme of letting the pass die because both sides are equally bad. Sure, the empire who committed genocide by blowing up entire planets is the same as the Jedi letting Palpatine rise to power because they didn't know he was evil. I guess there are good people on both sides. There has to be a reason why Ray is so powerful....actually no, her parents are nothing and she is not special. Which could be intriguing if we didn't have 40 years of story that emphasized the connection between linage and force power. Here is a little note for that...your audience will feel cheated when you set up a fictional world with established rules and then break those rules just to do it. Let just make everyone in Harry Potter, even muggles, just as powerful as Harry because it doesn't matter who your parents are. Just because you think its a positive moral message to children doesn't mean it makes sense to an established franchise. So the expectations have been subverted. So we are left with a movie where the main character spends most of the time on an island with a Jedi master who doesn't want anything to do with her or the doctrine he spent his life pursuing. We have a confused villain who isn't sure if hes bad or just a damaged boy with daddy issues. And the rest of the movie is the rebellion slowly wasting fuel while the first order is just waiting for them to run out of fuel. I wont even comment on the Casino planet scene that subverted all expectations that it would matter to the story at all. Anyway,here are a few subverted expectations that could have worked. Not having tired, forced, and cliche romantic interests for main characters. Apparently, Rian Johnson gets character tropes from his favorite young adult novels. Instead of Luke hating everything that the Jedi stands for because he failed one student, have him overcome his self guilt to regain a sense of purpose. Give Rose and her sister at least 1 scene together to give the audience a reason to care for their relationship. Better yet, let Rose sacrifice herself, like her sister did in the beginning, by knocking Finn out of the way and flying herself into the laser at the end. Maybe that would make the audience actually like her character. Give a reason why Ray is so powerful with the force given her parents were nothing. I'm not against the idea that linage has nothing to do with it but a bit of context would probably help if you want to insert concepts that go against well established lore. Establish a true protagonist. Give Snoke a backstory, or kill him off and make Kilo Ren something to be feared. They could have made General Hux the main villain, except he became everyone's punching bag. What about the knights of Ren? Nah, that set up was too good and interesting but it doesn't subvert expectations. Instead of Leia having that laughable Mary Poppins moment, don't have that. If we are just throwing stuff in the movie that doesn't make sense, at least give Luke a better death then force projecting himself and dying alone on that island. Why not have him show up in person and taking on the first order by himself. Its obvious that the movie doesn't want to follow the rules anyway, let Luke hug his sister in person one last time and have one last over the top, badass moment. Sure, but instead of having him really show up, we can subvert expectations and spoon feed the audience with obvious clues to lead them to the fact that he isn't actually there. In conclusion, I have two explanations of why this movie made the choices that it did. Either, Rian Johnson took the few criticisms for the Force Awakens of having similarities to the original series so seriously that every decision that he made involved subverting expectations to the point of ruining the whole trilogy. Or, he hates JJ so much that he set him up for complete failure. Either or, the audience and the franchise are the ones who have to endure the disappointment.",0
2242,"WORST Star Wars movie EVER!!!! NEVER was I SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED after watching a Star Wars movie. I literally felt dead after leaving the cinema. I still can't believe till this day what a mess this movie is! I SWEAR TO GOD, I will never rewatch this trash nor spent a single penny for this crap of a movie! Normally, I am a peaceful human being, but after so much disrespect, I sadly would like to kick Rian Johnson in his ass and punch his face. Yessir, and I am not even a star wars freak, i grew up with it and like it and that's it. The tonality...this movie doesn't feel like a star wars movie at all, unlogical story after 7, dumb and unimportant sidestory and side charachters (3 really bad choices....), jokes (often misplaced with bad timing and often not funny). I dont like to say that but I hate this movie!",0

If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend you watch the original trilogy first, because it's better.  If you've seen that, then watch The Force Awakens.

In addition there were some hints in episode VII that were not further developed in VIII.The characters are horrible: Leia is old and survive an explosion and the vacuum in the universe -> lol.

Rose and Fin ... forget them.Did you notice the many political correct elements in the movie, especially the feminism here? -> Episode VII was also garbage, so I will ignore Episode IX.",0

2251,"Regardless of how mediocre Star Wars: The Force Awakens was, there was still a sense of familiarity and originality that was used to tie in the Prequel and Original Trilogies to the Sequel Trilogy despite its dubious and frustrating separation in canon with the Extended Universe. However, with the perspective of a delusional director that antagonizes long time fans, uses subtle political agenda and blatantly plagiarizes aspects of the Extended Universe all under the guise of subverting expectation with absolutely nothing, any sense of the sequel being unique has been lost. Numerous roles and important plot points are outright ignored while either ripping off, slandering and subverting worst case scenario ideas from titles like Star Wars: Jedi Outcast II, or creating new characters and events that are rushed and have no coherence or impact on the plot at all. The story feels misconstrued as if important events where skipped over without explanation and almost every character with the exception of Poe Dameron was completely bipolar, irrational and lacked tact and strategy, often feeling just as comically confused about the plot as the audience were. When I had heard of a continuation to the cliff hangar used in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I would never have imagined that a 1.3 million dollar movie would make the First Order into just another Nazi reference, disrespect the promised roles of important characters, make irrelevant and questionable decisions, scenarios that feel out of context and would even go as far as to take advantage of the removal of strong female villains such as Komari Vosa and Tavion Axmis just to allow a nobody character like Phasma to pretend to be the first female Star Wars villain while accomplishing nothing. As a fan that grew up respecting the Extended Universe, I'm appalled to see an entire timeline rapaciously disgraced, disregarded, and then exploited by oblivious hacks that only recognized an opportunity to profit off of something they wouldn't have considered otherwise if it hadn't have given them the chance to push their political propaganda. An incoherent mess from beginning to end, disappointment doesn't even begin to describe the exploitative waste of time that is The Last Jedi.",0

2254,"The most visual impressive, well directed failure in storytelling and misuse of characters I have seen. Honestly which sane person decided to change the complete story in part 2 of a trilogy? J. J. Abrams has done a solid groundwork and very good set ups in The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson has wasted everything to tell his own new unimpressive story full of plot holes because of the changes. Rian Johnson is even a really good director and writer and I would recommend much of his other work. I don't know what happen there but I will list all failures. I start with the characters: Luke Skywalker is so misrepresented that even Mark Hamill has spoken out that he doesn't know who that guy is and that Luke would do nothing like that before he got silenced. Rey got demoted to Mary Sue (Flawless avatar far better than anyone else with all abilities at grandmaster level). Snoke  became the Hugh Hefner of Star Wars and a laughing stock for me. All leaders made incompetent decisions (= Hux, Leia and Holdo). Hux exspecially became an incopentent moron stereotype. Finn and Rose have a story arc that is completely wasted. You can remove all that happens there and nothing changes. In defences of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) and others. Nothing in this is the fault of the actors. They deliver a good performance in a horrible script. Rian Johnson is credited as writer so he should be the person to blame. I want to apologize for all fans that lost their mind and wish all of you the best. I will say that Rain Johnson did a horrible job for representation of female characters. Star Wars is full of strong, intelligent and interesting female characters that could have been used. Story: Like I already said the story gets rebooted and there are a lot of plot holes. !!!Slight spoiler warning!!! Luke Skywalker hides and didn't want to be found but left a map. Snoke is so powerful that no one can defeat him but gets defeated in a humiliating way. A simple Padawan could have done this. The chase of the Resistance is pointless. The First Order could destroy them at any time without problems. Solution 1: Use half of your fleet and jump via hyperspace in front of the Resistances (Have a ship with interdiction capabilities with them for max efficiency). Solution 2: Use all your fighters to attack. Look what just Kylo can do with some support. Now think about what all fighters of the First Order fleet can do. Solution 3: Avoid this situation completely. After you jump out of hyperspace above the Resistance base use curtain fire with all your ships and have the fighters ready for interception. But it is not only the First Order. Poe gets punished for saving the Resistance. Without his action all of them would have died one after another much faster. Leia and Holdo have no strategy. All they do is delaying their unavoidable demise by sacrificing their ships. The endgame is hiding in a place their enemies can easily destroy and find as easy as the back of their hands because they track them. Solution 1: Have enough fuel in your ships and be ready to escape you morons. They are the Resistance and must be always prepared to escape because their enemy has superior firepower. There are veterans from the Rebels in their ranks. They knew this and had terrible losses in the war with the Empire that had taught them this lesson. Solution 2: Scatter your fleet in as many directions as possible. This would scatter the enemy fleet or they must set priorities. Both would give you better tactical options. Smaller ships can hide in systems that are dangerous for bigger ships (Asteroid belts, gravity anomalies, high density of gravity objects etc.) This would save many lives and in combination with solution 1 with 100% certainty. Solution 3.:Jump to places that would defeat the First Order fleet or help you. Examples would be first Kuat. The shipbuilding system is the best defended place in the Star Wars galaxy and they don't take it kindly if an enemy fleet comes in for a visit. Bonus: The First order wants this intact and would never destroy it. Secondly Mon Cala. The Mon Calamari suffered under the Empire. There is no way that they would not fight the First Order no matter the odds. I would also say Coruscant but don't know if it is as well defended as in Legends. Then the already mention arc with Rose and Finn. Nothing happens there that has an impact for the story. Why waste this time? It looked like they are proud of it. Hyperspace ramming: There were ramming tactics in Legends (In the Corellian trilogy books if I remember correctly) and in a Star Wars comic for hyperspace ramming. It was not efficient because three ships could not take out a Super Star Destroyer.  I must come to an end because I run out of space. Overall this is an abomination of a Star Wars movie that is well directed. I barely can push myself to give a 1/10.",0
2255,"la peor película de star wars de toda la vida, la vez que leia usa la fuerza me pareció súper forzada y sin sentido, ya que ella no es una Jedi, rose es muy poco carismática, y ni hablar de DJ (el que interpretó benicio del toro), la trama de los rastreadores me parecio tan mal tratada, olvidadiza y poco original, me pereció plagiada de Dragon Ball Z, la vez que Finn y Rose, estuvieron a punto de ser ejecutados por manos de la primera orden y fueron salvados por una explosión que ya ni me acuerdo como me pareció cliché de porquería, la muerte de snooke hizo al personaje poco carismático y olvidadizo también, cuando creíamos que Kylo Ren se iba a volver bueno e ibamos a ver una evolución del personaje, pero no, nada de eso ya que mata a snooke para volverse más malo y nada de evolución del personaje, y hablando de evolución de personajes como es manejado a Luke en esta película se me hizo basura, paso de ser un héroe que le veía el lado bueno incluso a Darth Vader a ser un viejo cascarrabias que intento matar a Kylo Ren nada más por tener mucho poder en la Fuerza y además tiró el sable de luz de su padre que le iba a entregar Rey, y ni hablar de la muerte de Luke, me pareció mal escrito y mal estructurada de parte de disney, haciendo que solo desaparezca haciéndose uno con la fuerza ¿¡WHAT!?, y ni hablar de lo problemático que es Poe en la resistencia causándole problemas, en fin esta película tiene un millón de fallas, no puede ser que disney halla cagado la saga de star wars en esta película no puede ser que George Lucas permita que le arruinen la saga que es su obra maestra, que es star wars.",0

2287,"This movie is actually riduclouse. I'll try to keep my review spoiler free. Let's start with the beginning. So apparently in like a 1 month time frame or something the Resistance has gone from a tremendous victory against an already crumbling successor to the Empire to being almost completely and utterly wiped out and is in flight for its life. That already is a preposterous set up.Then, also, Leia, for some reason, some how, with no explanation, is all of a sudden a competent Force user and manages to save her life and doing other fancy things using the Force. Then the movie is 152 minutes long, that's not bad in itself but most of the movie is filler. It was like they reached the 2 hour mark and the director was like ""this isn't long enough, let's add a new sub-plot that leads to absolutely nowhere and accomplished almost literally nothing."" That's right, the whole Finn-Rose ark is actually completely pointless and nothing comes of it whatsoever, and it's probably almost a third of the movie.Also the director has apparently never heard of character death. So many points in this movie would be improved if some protagonist died or made a sacrifice or things fell through. However every single time this is about to happen, even after you think it happens, everything turns out fine because plot armor. There are multiple points where characters should in no reasonable way been able to do what they did or survive what happened but hey, they're the good guys, so they gotta live.If this movie was 45 minutes shorter and they cut out the utterly pointless Finn-Rose ark I would have given it a 5 instead.",0
2288,"One word - Consistency. Disney, Rian Johnson and anybody involved with this nonsense of a film should look it up. I don't care if you want to make Luke a depressed grump, throw the Jedi/Sith concepts in the trash and totally disregard all plot and character points from the previous film in the series. It's stupid but if that's what you want to do then fine. As long as these drastic changes have reasons behind them and as long as those reasons are *consistent* with the existing story, plot and characters then it's all good. If you pivot everything toward these ridiculous (and boring) new plot points and character personalities while giving reasons that are *also inconsistent* with the established story thread, then you're just being flat out lazy. It's basic story telling FFS.",0
2289,"It's an awful film, not because of the acting, but from the horrendously bad writing of Rian Johnson. Forced humor that drains the tension from the film is everywhere along with the obvious characters/creatures created purely for merchandising. The First Order went from being a Galaxy threatening force to just a few ships that can't catch, destroy or out maneuver Rebel ships. Huxley is now a buffoon, existing for no other reason than forced comedy. Phasma is just as underused and pointless as ever. Rey is even more of a Mary Sue than before, she's better at everything than anybody else in the galaxy, never needs training and therefore there is no danger or tension any time she's on screen. Mark Hamill plays someone called Luke, but it's definitely not Luke Skywalker from the original trilogy. Snoke, the big mysterious bad guy is literally wasted. Leia is Mary Poppins as she flies through the vacuum of space. Fin and Rose are absolutely pointless in this film, their whole side adventure is poorly written and serves no purpose. Benicio Del Toro is wasted, like everyone else. How Rian Johnson handled Luke is just a middle finger to fans.Rian Johnson doesn't understand how the vacuum of space works. Ships (bombers) move slowly through space even though weight has no bearing on speed at sub light. Rebel ships are ""faster"" than First Order ships, but they only get outside of firing range and then match speed...? Leia opens a door to the destroyed bridge and the hallway with people in it does not explosively decompress. ???The whole movie is a long, boring chase sequence in space that is the most disrespecting and poorly written dumpster fire in Hollywood history. You're not missing anything if you haven't seen it. It's trash and Rian Johnson should be banned from the franchise.",0
2290,"I'm 34yo and I loved the originals when I was a kid, watched them over and over and equally loved the prequels! Despite the acting, the prequels had many redeeming qualities such as a story that greatly expanded the universe of starwars, epic and unique soundtracks and awesome lightsaber battles. The new trilogy has none of them, this latest edition least of all. My issues with this film summed up:- Really bad jokes that felt shoehorned in. The iron space ship, seriously? Why take the mick out of Slave 1? - A Janitor storm trooper that knows all the weaknesses of all the stations and battleships. Terrible strategy First Order. Educating all your storm troopers in how to take them down, great for when they defect or get captured.- Tracking through hyperspace!? OMG! wait, so how did Jango Fett and Boba Fett track their targets decades ago then? - So Ray doesn't need any training to become a Jedi it seems. She is naturally good with a lightsaber despite never training with one. - Luke's first instinct was to murder Kylo? He turned Vader back to the light so he knows it could be done. - How did Leia get back into the ship after her little space walk without it sucking everyone out?- Could Kylo be any worse at fighting with a lightsaber?- So lasers have a range in space? That makes sense. - Also why not send out the small strike craft Hux? Where were all your bombers and tie fighters? Seriously!- The aiming of the giant AT-ATs was atrocious when shooting at the salt ski things, I don't know how they survived.- Purple Giraffe General seemed to take an eternity before deciding to help stop the transport ships from getting shot down.- Phasma was utterly useless again. - Far too many misleading moments, they felt so cheap.- The whole trip to the casino planet seemed pointless. What did Finn and co achieve? Got captured twice and released some animals. Such a hero.- Second film in the trilogy with a snow (sigh salt) planet base getting assaulted by walkers. - Who was Snoke? Where did he come from? What was he up to when the Emperor was calling the shots?- Po was useless.- The entire film was pointless, it was filled with pointless failed missions that did not further the story in any way.- The falcon seems to be in prime condition despite its age and obvious poor condition in the original trilogy.- Far far far too many last minute save the day moments!! - Poor unmemorable soundtrack. Equally as bad as the Force Awakened, if not worse. It is obvious this trilogy has been designed for the sole purpose of making money. Forget telling a great story, it seems Disney only cares about the money. It has been dumbed down to cater for the younger generation at the expense of the older generation that grew up with Star Wars. Makes sense as a business point of view, after all they will out live us oldens. For the record though, I loved Rogue One!",0
2291,"I'll just list the mind boggling plot holes that are enraging.Rebel ships can go slower or faster in space where there is no weight, gravity or inertia. Having to constantly burn fuel, even when not accelerating. Bombs dropping from bombers without gravity (maybe propulsion down?? maybe). FO ships can just light jump ahead or out and back in to catch the rebels. FO bombardment shots rising and falling as they are magically pulled down by gravity in space.Allowing your entire fleet to die one at a time instead of jumping in 4 different directions. The big ship won't track them all and they knew they were being tracked. FLYING **** LEIA.PURPLE HAIR LESBIAN NOT SAYING A THING TO POEabout her dumb plan(who is suppose to be their lead fighter commander, a senior(ish) officer in general, and the information is not dangerous at all.

How can Rey swim when she grew up on a sand, desert planet?Why did luke leave a map for people to find him, if he went to die?I GUESS THE RESISTENCE WAS AND IS THE REPUBLIC AND THEY CONSIST OF JUST 5 PLANETS FROM TFA AND 4 SPACE SHIPS. where is the galactic outrage or swelling of troops from the starkiller base attack on the republic? Where is the republic fleets and soldiers and other planets? You're telling me in a matter of days or weeks the first order conquered the galaxy? Luke wanting to kill Kylo, when he wouldnt even turn on his evil dad and it actually worked turning the good inside of him back out. So no reason he wouldnt pursue the good in kylo. THE LACK OF BATTLES THAT ARE MEANINGFUL OR VISUAL OR ACTION PACKED.oh our plan is to run, then run to a planet and hide behind a door... how retarded... but a purple haired lesbian did concieve it.IN ROGUE ONE THE REBEL SHIPS JUMP TO LIGHT SPEED AND CRASH INTO THE STAR DESTROYER, BUT NOW A SHIP CAN JUMP TO HYPERDRIVE AND DECIMATE AN ENTIRE FLEET. people will say it is because its a bigger more shielded ship, but Snoke's ship is way way bigger than it, just like in rogue one. Total **** and if one ship can do that, it woulda been done in losing battles years ago. Why not hyperdrive thru the death star? STUPID!Why didnt the FO just hyperdrive in the 30 seconds or so they knew what holdo was going to do?Porgs and Sea cow tit milk....The DJ character knowing about the rebel plan... impossible.

2293,"I'm a lifelong Star Wars, standing in lines for hours to buy tickets in the pre-internet days. It's with great sadness that I say that Last Jedi was a disappointment. It was overly long and bloated, wasting a good half hour on pointless scenes that the plot didn't need. Many scenes were literal recreations of pieces of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and the superfluous casino scene looked like a CGI prequel nightmare right out of Phantom Menace. But the most disappointing was how the story destroyed the long time character of iconic characters to make them unrecognizable and unlikeable. I agree with Mark Hamill's statement when he honestly said, ""This was not Luke Skywalker. I had to pretend that I was playing a different person."" So much of this movie destroyed what had come before for no discernable benefit. And audiences have responded. The movie has dropped like rock in its second week after the initial premiere rush, with awful Batman v Superman type box office numbers. When a Star Wars film is being compared to a DC movies bomb, you know they did something wrong. I can only hope that JJ Abrams fixes some of the damage this movie has done to the Star Wars brand in the next film.",0

2295,Very disappointed in this film. Most of the plot points could have been done in the opening crawl. But the film is not all bad the SFX are good and there is a lot of stuff blowing up. After watching this film I don't think the people behind it are Star Wars fans.,0

Ademas, sobra 1 hora de peli. Gran parte de la peli es relleno. En resumen, aburrida.",0

2299,"The movie was visually stunning, but it has many problems. Firstly, I was bored. Finn and Rose are useless, Rey is a boring protagonist, hooks from TFA were dropped.Moreover, the more I think about the movie, I get the impression that the director actively dislikes the Star Wars IP and wanted to subvert all of its tropes and undermine the established characters. I took off an extra point for that. I'd be able to withstand the movie if it was just boring, but I will now make a conscious choice to never go to another star wars film in theaters.",0
2300,"George Lucas has his revenge now that Rian Johnson has made the worst Star Wars film of all time.After the prequels were completed, George Lucas refused to make another Star Wars film. The fans were upset about the CG in the film and upset that George Lucas felt that Jar Jar Binks was a great character - the fans thought Jar Jar was annoying. After seeing The Last Jedi, however, I only have one thing to say, “George Lucas, you are forgiven.”  It is only fitting that George Lucas has his revenge and make his hero’s journey triumphant to Star Wars and that the fans are more upset with Rian Johnson who was given almost full artistic control of the script mess that is The Last Jedi.After viewing The Last Jedi I felt like quoting Ben Kenobi, “I sensed as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.” It's also as if a fandom was upset, if only slightly because it is the greatest franchise in history, and it seemed like the script was written by a man who is not a Star Wars fan.The script is what I feel to be the biggest problem with the film. The character ‘modification’ of Luke, everyone’s favorite Jedi is unnecessary to advance the plot. In this ‘exciting’ script, Luke goes against the Jedi way and apparently tries to kill Leia’s defenseless child and later is reduced to a weak old geezer who’s daily chore is to milk an alien space cow for greenish milk so that he could drink it in a glamorous way like the Got Milk commercials so that the audience would think its ‘funny’. Let me tell you something Rian, having the greatest Jedi of all time drink green milk in a glamorous way is not ’funny’ lol. Actually, I’m laughing that it will probably be the highlight of the film and should have been in the trailer, but I do find this lack of character continuity disturbing. Another problem is that Chewy is a morbid porg killer which also seems unnecessary to advance the plot and out of character, eating the cute pets that live in the Millenium Falcon. All of these story elements just don’t seem very Disney, tho they bought the Star Wars Franchise and they do have the right to totally mess up Star Wars if they desire, which I am sure is their complete diabolical vision for Star Wars. Perhaps most interesting of my theatre experience of watching The Last Jedi wasn’t on screen, but it was something I’ve never seen before. A man was on his cell phone the entire time in the theatre and nobody said anything. He left halfway thru but then came back for some reason just to surf on his cellphone during the movie. Its as if he didn’t want to leave but also didn’t want to partially miss the movie while looking up from his cellphone every 15 minutes. I am surprised no one said anything to him about his cell phone during the film but now I empathize with him and I’m sure the whole audience understands now what he understood then. This film is an entire snooze-fest.",0
2301,Not much more to add to the 3000+ negative reviews.  Too many flaws to name.  The one positive is at least now George Lucas didn't direct the worst Star Wars movie to date.,0

And after 30 mins, my chin was a hollow pit in my face where i had been scratching.  So many plot holes.  So much utter garbage.  Quite frankly whoever picks up this garbage afterwards might do well to just erase the whole stinking lot of it.  Thank you for taking a giant turd on my childhood.  Terrible.",0

2306,"Simply the worst star wars movie ever made :(Kylo ren is a comedy vilan, not like vader. That's sad. Nobody that see this movie, or ep. 7 can take kylo serious. It's just a boring ""bad"" guy.",0
2307,"I don't mind the overly stuffed direction they took with the story. The problem lies in the fact that it felt more like watching space balls than watching a star wars movie. It was a joke, start to finish. Built to sell toys and create spin offs for disney. Nothing felt like it had any weight. We weren't given any reason to care about any of the plot elements. The characters from force awakens have seemingly turned into completely new characters, void of any of their previous traits. As a serious star wars fan, this was a disappointment possibly even greater than the **** prequels we were subjected to.",0
2308,"Not only an awful movie in it’s own right, but an absolutely Terrible Star Wars film. If you are a true Star Wars aficionado you will hate this movie with a passion that can only be matched by the Phantom Menace. Established canon is ignored and Luke Skywalker's character is butchered beyond recognition by Johnson. I spent the entire movie waiting to see ""Jedi Master"" Luke kick dark side butt and although Hamill gives a great performance even he can't lift the absolutely terrible story Johnson has written for him. I very much agree with Hamill that I fundamentally disagree with every choice he made for Luke's character. For gods sake Rian, didn't you think it might be a good idea to listen to a man who pretty much IS Star Wars? For a movie with so much potential you are left feeling that Rian Johnson made a list of the top 100 ways to infuriate the fans and included every single one into this absolute pile of dross. Sure its funny in parts and the Porgs are cute as a button, but despite a good performance by Ridley, Rey's character is yawn worthy and appears to suddenly be gifted the powers of a Jedi Master without any kind of training. Given that the Skywalker family are more or less born of the force and none of them could magically attain their powers this seems like utter crap and will leave you frustrated and despondent. I was so looking forward to Luke ""passing on what he has learned"" but Johnson somehow didn't seem to think that this was necessary either! The casino scene is utterly pointless and reeks of the over the top CGI nonsense of the Prequels. Rose is also an irritating and unnecessary character who does as much to ruin the film as Young Anakin did in Episode I. I actually wanted to slap her after the line ""Now it’s worth it"" As if those creatures are actually going to go free. The bad guys have speeders and starships you stupid girl! Johnson didn't seem to know what to do with Finn's character and seems to have written in a totally arbitrary side story just to give him a part, which is a shame as I loved the chemistry between him and Rey in Force Awakens and there was so much opportunity to develop it further in this movie. In fact on reflection I agree with many other fans that this movie is as bad a Star Wars movie, if not worse, than the prequels (maybe not episode I) and really sticks its fingers up to the established canon of the original trilogy and the expanded universe as a whole, which in my view is absolutely unforgivable. Since when could blue glowies interact with normal matter! And are you really suggesting that a Jedi Master as powerful as Luke Skywalker supposedly is could magically die just because he was projecting himself using the force... Utter utter **** No expanded universe author would get away with doing this so how has Rian Johnson been allowed. When are Disney going to learn not to fix what ain't broke! Snoke is killed off far too easily and its frustrating beyond belief that we don't learn his identity (I think all the fans were hoping for Darth Plagus which would have tied in beautifully with the prequels and explained how there was suddenly this ultra powerful Sith Lord floating about) The chase between the First Order and the rebel fleet is ridiculous beyond belief, ignores the laws of Physics and leaves so many plot holes that you will find yourself bored and frustrated, since when were Mon Calamari cruisers supposed to be so fast? and why is it that Medical Frigates and other support ships seem to also be magically gifted this power just by virtue of being associated with them? Whilst its truly great to have more strong female characters and I would have loved to have seen more of ""Jedi"" Leia, Vice Admiral Holdo is arrogant and incompetent and you are left feeling that she is a ""stupid woman"" rather than the strong female leader they should have given us. Mon Mothma would never have been so arrogant or idiotic! The whole escape could have gone much more simply had she just revealed her plan from the get-go instead of pointlessly frustrating Poe. How dare Rian Johnson call himself a Fan! Please Disney don't let him anywhere near the Star Wars universe ever again. The critic that claimed that this movie was just as good as Empire should be taken outside and shot for getting our hopes up. Comparing Irvin Kershner's masterpiece to this utter nonsense is nothing short of blasphemy.",0
2309,"Not only it's a really bad movie, but it creates huge plotholes in the original trilogy (I'm referring to the hyperspace issue), while also mocking the fans: the characters of the original saga are unrecognizable and literally used as disposable tools to further some kind of political agenda and to try to make the new characters (that range from boring to pointless) look good. It was so bad that, for the first time in my life, I find myself having absolutely no interest whatsoever in seeing the next Star Wars movie.",0
2310,This movie is so bad that it resembles parody more than the real deal. It feels like a mockery of Star Wars franchise. I am pretty sure it destroyed Star Wars legacy for this and future generations...,0
2311,Imagine watching the final season of GOT - and the queen of dragons doesnt give a f... about the iron throne. This is Luke in the Last Jedi - bad story telling.,0
2312,No respect for fan expectations. No respect for the source material. Just because you make unexpected turns in the plot doesn't make it good. Using one of the most loved universes to employ TOTALLY BIASED political views. Several plot-holes. Character development comparable to a child's essay with no reasoning behind it. This movie clearly even disregards The Force Awakens and ignores stepping stones created by it. This is a disaster.,0
2313,"1 point for great visuals.Another point for sound design. Great music and great sound effects. That's it. Everything else about this movie is atrocious. TLJ is literally one of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. It's not even about it being a bad Star Wars movie, it's just a bad movie PERIOD.The plot is nonsensical and the characters are very poorly written. There is so much wrong with this movie 5000 characters won't cut it. If you wanna know how truly awful this movie is, go on YouTube and just type ""The Last Jedi Review"" and you'll see how garbage this thing is.This movie is so poorly written that you will literally feel insulted when you watch it. You'll ask yourself ""is this how stupid Star Wars' producers think we are, that we'll eat up this garbage?""It's like the SW board of directors got together, made a long list of things they wanna see in TLJ, and then told the production team ""make sure everything in that list is in there; nothing else matters. Butcher the story if you have to just make sure this list is complete"".Awful. It's so bad that I'm literally not gonna watch anymore SW movies. SW movies were never AMAZING to begin with or anything, but they were NEVER.THIS.BAD.",0
2314,"FYI: I'm not a bot John Campea/Collider Crew... Watched the film twice. The first time I was overwhelmed by what I saw so I knew I needed to see it again. After I watched it for a second time I started to have real issues with it besides Luke's character arc. Major plot points set up in TFA are never answered or just brushed to the side... The logic of Star Wars was completely changed... Somehow force ghosts can affect the world, and you no longer need training to use the force in advanced ways... Hell, even LEIA CAN SOMEHOW FLY THROUGH SPACE...  HOW?? Also the writing in this film is poor... Finn's storyline could've been cut out with Rey doing actual training. Instead we got forced political themes like animal cruelty and capitalism.. Which is completely funny because it's DISNEY... The company that is turning into a monopoly... Anyways, the movie was visually stunning and felt like Star Wars, but the fact that the characters haven't progressed at all in this second film makes me less excited for the finale of the trilogy. Also... Luke milking **** WHY!!!!!!",0
2315,"This film not only wiped out everything TFA set up, it also sacrificed character integrity and universe continuity for the sake of cheap laughs and trying to always surprise the audience. The time to change style and reboot story is NOT the second film in a trilogy (and the 8th in a saga). Characters don't go against their core values, even when they've been through trauma, they still stay true to who they are. These characters didn't. This was terrible, lazy writing, and it makes me sad beyond words to see this parody style for something so beloved to me.",0
2316,"I saw this film on the first Monday. It’s now Friday. I’ve had a few days to collect my thoughts. This was the biggest disappointment of my movie going life. This is the worse SW film ever made. Now before you think I’m whining that it didn’t turn out like I thought it would, let me just say, I expected it to be different than any preconceived notions or ideas that i may have had... I enjoy that. I want to be surprised. I didn’t need Luke flying over the screen against a 1000 storm troopers to be happy. What I needed was good writing. That’s it.  I’m actually a film producer, not on the scale of SW, but I make movies, and I know the process of creating a story for audiences and how difficult it is to do it well. Rian Johnson not only betrayed the SW franchise but he is a terrible writer. Terrible. I’m sorry. Maybe he’s a nice guy. But how he ruined this beloved franchise is inexcusable. The entire story takes place over the course of about 12-24 hours, something like that, and is essentially one long chase scene. Except The chase only “works” if you change the rules... to a preposterous set of rules to where light speed is a weapon (which should have been used at other times because it’s sooooo effective), shields that are basically indestructible, sensors that can’t see smaller ships that are right in front of them, it’s a chase but it’s conceivably the slowest chase in history... it’s just soooo stupid, and that’s just the chase scene. Every facet of this movie makes no sense. Kilo now is the big baddie but he’s already lost to Rey so he’s not menacing at all. Rey has no arc. She has no progression. Luke’s character, who saw the good in his dad, refuses to kill him, and even lays down his life in front of the emperor for truth and righteousness, is now a weirdo who almost murders his nephew, well at least thought about it, is a whiner, and worthless. It’s not a gotch’a look how creative I am... it’s stupid weak writing. It’s inconsistent.  Such a travesty what they did to Mark’s character. For the  people think that RJ is a genius for switching things up, i submit this, why doesn’t the next director of the James Bond franchise make his character into a Harry Potter wizard-like character because that would be so bold and cutting edge! They won’t because it’s idiotic and stupid. But that is what RJ did. He took everything that Lucas built, and every setup from JJ and threw it over his shoulder like a piece of trash (just like Luke). It wasn’t inventive. It was weak. I don’t even care about the back story of snoke or Rey... that ultimately doesn’t matter. What matters is struggle, the dynamics, between characters. And the most evil of evil now in this franchise is two white skinny males who are whinny brats who have already been bested. So going into episode 9 there is no suspense... no weight, because we know those two idiots will fail, because they have already failed. The emperor kept winning until his pride didn’t see the spark of goodness of Vader... that was his downfall. All was lost until Vader decided one time to do good. Very powerful. Right now we have the weakest setup for a new movie ever in a big franchise. Such stupidity by RJ and Kennedy. I could have put my team together of writers and producers, and made a film that would have been awesome yet unpredictable and satisfying for fans and new commers. I would have respected the franchise instead of crapping all over it. Thanks RJ for nothing. Unreal.",0
2317,Thank you for destroying a much beloved franchise. I do not ever write reviews nor do I think a single review makes much of a difference but this travesty infuriated me to a level that made me want to vent. I wish I could unsee this movie. The Star Wars saga has ended for me. Thank you Disney. Thank you RJ whoever you are. RIP.,0
2318,"pior filme da saga, honestamente espero que retirem ele da cronologia, alem de falhas gritantes de roteiro o filme é longo e cansativo, com dezenas de plots resolvidos por um deus EX machina fora a total falta de respeitos com os personagens clássicos",0
2319,"This should have been called Star Wars: The Last Star Wars as it takes not only the entire original saga but even The Force Awakens and throws it all in the trash including itself. So much potential ruined in so loooooong of a dragging on movie as if to torture you. You can now  watch Rey & Kylo Kiss or Kill in the next movie. Only options left except Star Wars ""Ghosts Awaken""",0
2320,"Great acting, good score, brilliant visuals, horrific writing, plot, weak jokes that diffuse villains.",0
2321,"A waste of money. Don`t bother. Lousy script. Much of the plot ""borrowed"" from previous SW films. RJ was following Disney Inc. orders to change the audience demogrphics, ie make it more apppealing to women, Asians and Black folk so more female leads, Rose is thrown in and Finn is given more scenes. Unfortunately the characters are so underdeveloped you dont care about them. Other reviews discuss the poor plot lines, the disrespect to the series as a whole. In short, a waste of time. I want my money and time back.",0
2322,"I wasn't a fan of the last movie, so I went into this one with extremely low expectations. But somehow the movie managed to be absolutely worse than I had expected. The dialogue was poor, the characters stale, plot holes all over the bloody place. In general really disappointed with this movie and the turn that the movie industry has taken",0
2323,"i would say this is pretty bad because they ignored alot of big questions asked in previous movie as well as huge plot holes everywhere.i will name a few things i think is wrong with this movie.ignored all questions the force awaken left us withuntrained rey can use the force to move hundres of pounds of rocks easier than luke and yoda can move a tie fighter, she also spreads them to two piles so the cast can walk through them without breaking a sweat.first order can't light spead ahead to blockade the rebels.if they could kamakazi at light speed why didn't they do it right off the bat and let the rest of the ships escape in light speed?casino planet is a big filler and adds nothing to the story unless that kid at the end gets recruited and turns jedi.",0
2324,"SO frustrating to see all the hard work of previous creative minds hacked apart to create this mess.  Feeling a bit betrayed by critics who were either paid off or scared into creating false hype to push up the opening weekend, though I see the numbers are now plummeting as people hear just how bad TLJ really is. There is absolutely no way those were all honest reviews. I saw the film the day it came out with a theater full of excited fans, and you could feel the energy drain out of them as the film wore on. This is the first time I've heard actual booing at the end of a Star Wars film, even the worst of the prequels didn't create this kind of bitter disappointment.",0
2325,"This movie is another Holiwood soap.Creators never red a single SW novel I m sure of it.Rey is simple whiny cow,put aside thing she dosent have a day of lightsaber training,and became Jedi who is strong with force within 15 minutes.Supreme leader Snoke is....Well...Better change his name in 'Supreme Idiot Snoke',because he s the most stupid Sith in history of our order.Thats how it looks like.Thats the vision of the director Johnson...",0
2326,"Movie is full of plot holes and SJW agenda that just shouldn't be in Star Wars, This movie deserves to be burned and buried. Here are some Reasons why1. Bombs drop in space?2. Mary Poppins Leia3. Leia at beginning of the film is disappointed with Poe because he got twelve ships killed while taking out a dreadnaught, a ship that has hundreds of other ships and can decimate bases. Leia doesn't think 12 ships is worth that...4. Finn and Rose's storyline is useless and a waste of my life i will never get back5. Admiral Holdo (purple hair) starts conflict off with Poe when all he wants to know is WTF are they gonna do6. Leia Tells Poe what the plan is when he awakes on the escape pods and he is like ""oh, yeah that make perfect sense."" Why didn't Holdo just tell him the **** plan7. Luke only gives Two lessons8. Snokes monologue about how he can see into Kylo's mind the perceives to get stab by a light saber that Kylo is controlling next to him...HOW THE ABSOLUTE **** DID YOU NOT SEE THAT?9. Luke's death should've have been Kylo striking down Luke but before he does Luke saying the same phrase as Obi-Wan Kenobi when he was stuck down by Vader10. The fight with Finn and Phasma is a joke, Phasma is supposed to be this Badass next Boba Fett type for the series but has gotten her ass handed to her twice by Finn a Trooper who used to mop floors...11. The Title of the movie and what Luke was trying to teach Rey is that all things have the force and the Jedi should stop using it as their own, therefore the Jedi should die, and nothing is good or evil everything is both, but at the end of the movie we still have both Jedi and Sith, NOTHING HAS CHANGED. The movie literally contradicts its own title",0
2327,"Mary Puppins unforgivable. It is not Star Wars, is a other history. Rian, please please please no more film about Star Wars",0
2328,"MY EYEBALLS ENJOYED WATCHING IT, BUT MY BRAIN WOULDN'T LET ME REALLY LIKE IT.I went into this movie with zero opinions. Didn't read anything about it, didn't follow it at all.The greatest improvement of The Last Jedi over The Force Awakens is that it didn't copy it's original trilogy counterpart as much, though there were still plenty of plagiarized scenes with throw away lines that tried to unconvincingly tell you that this is totally not the same as Empire.The visuals were gorgeous, and there were a couple of real heartwarming moments, but once you've seen it, your mind will start to review what you've seen and come to the conclusion that in all other ways this movie is basically a tire fire.Mark Hamill's return as the grumpy old Luke-alike was well done and I thoroughly enjoyed him, as long as you ignore that all of the events leading up to his self-exile were an enormous character assassination.Rey is more of a Mary Sue now than even the definition of the trope can explain because it's amplified by her ridiculous mastery of the Force... but she is charming, like a Mary Sue should be.Finn and Rose's entire subplot might as well not exist and the movie would have been better served using the 40 minutes of that on actually making the rest good and filling in the plot chasms.Poe Dameron was OK. Under the circumstances he was behaving like any critically thinking person should, even though the movie will try to tell you otherwise.The writing, structure, and editing of this movie is easily the worst of any Star Wars. Cringe worthy lines occur regularly, and stupid jokes that break dramatic scenes and then don't land well for most of the audience are sprinkled throughout. Character development is basically non-existent for anybody, new or old. It basically insults your intelligence but you don't notice at the time because of the eye candy.World building that keeps the fantastical elements of Star Wars within reason and believable has gone completely out the window for the sake of spectacle. I guess if you wanted to distance your Star Wars from old Star Wars you would do something like this movie, but it can't even maintain continuity within itself, let alone from its direct prequel. It breaks all of the rules of Star Wars that keep it grounded in a believable world. It's like the director looked at what was done before, lit it all on fire, and wrote his own fan fiction.Plot points and teasers set up in Force Awakens go untouched, or blatantly discarded. Who's Snoke and where did he come from? Doesn't matter, he's out. Rey's parents? Forget it, they are nobody. Kylo's mask and his persona of intimidation? Get rid of it because the old guy made fun of him. Finn got his spine raked by a lightsaber and goes into a coma? Nah he wakes up and shows no signs of being injured at all despite the fact that the time between the two movies appears to be less than a week. Why would Luke leave a map to find him if he left to go die in a corner? Captain Phasma? Still a non-character with like 4 lines between two movies; a shiny suit to sell merchandise that may as well not even have anybody inside and it wouldn't make a difference (strong female characters ftw?).  Knights of Ren? Who now? Nobody came after you sent the distress call? No duh. Hyperspace travel isn't instantaneous, and you gave them all of 5 minutes to get there before leaving.This movie didn't just take a dump on the original trilogy, it took a dump on its own trilogy. I wasn't a fan of FA because I walked out of it thinking, ""I've seen this movie already."" It was just A New Hope with modern visuals, and I guess some people are fine with that (I can't fault the visuals), but I wanted new content. In hindsight, however, The Last Jedi is inferior to The Force Awakens in every way, which is the saddest story of all. JJ Abrams will try to repair what has been done by this movie, but he will fail spectacularly because Rian Johnson is a complete tool.This new trilogy is officially not Star Wars to me. I just don't care about anything in it. The story is completely inconsequential and I don't care about any of these characters or what they're going to do now. It's not canon. The real canon is the Expanded Universe and TV series. This new stuff is children playing with forces they don't understand.1 point for Mark Hamill's performance.1 point for production values.1 point for Rian Johnson not doing EP9.",0
2329,"It's simply a bad movie, Star Wars or otherwise. It seems we are collectively too afraid to admit the truth - that the new trilogy is simply bad. Afraid that, if we admit it, it's all gonna go away for another 30 years, maybe forever. Perhaps that would be for the best.",0
2330,"The worst part about this movie is not that it's a poorly written movie with terrible (or non-existant) character arcs, poor plot, out of place humor or ham-fisted political commentary. It's not even that it ignores established Star Wars",0
2331,Everything what's wrong with the movie industry these days. Absolute disgrace.,0
2332,"Critics giving this movie a score of 85 proves 1 of 2 things.... (1)  They were paid; or (2) they spend their free time fellating Rian Johnson (maybe both).  This movie sucked.  Plain and simple.  With so many plot holes and pointless scenes and story lines, the max score should have been a 35 and that's being very generous.  The can't even get the synopsis right - ""Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker"" - WRONG.  Luke spends the entire movie **** about the Jedi and doesn't train Rey at all.  Yet she inexplicably becomes stronger.  What a joke.  And this is accompanied by a slow speed chase through space where the First Order simply waits for the Rebel ships to run out of gas.  Yeah you read that right.  Forget sending 1 or 2 of many ships ahead because the movie would have been over in 45 mins.  Worst movie of 2017 and I'd be willing to bet it will be considered one of worst from this decade.",0

Comedy does not get any better as the movies goes on, with a borderline Spaceballs scene included (https://i.imgur.com/VkxjYnE.gif). The final nail in the coffin was the Luke Skywalker's character assassination.",0

This pile of crap! what a mess my god... rey still has no weaknesses, luke is a coward FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE and just dies on a rock, yep he dies on a rock, let me say this again, luke skywalker... dies on a rock. there are 2 good scenes near the end of the second act of course being the throne room fight and the hyperspace scene, which of course adds a plot hole for the rest of the series, same with space fuel, yeah critics gave this a 10. now, on to snokes death. 2 weeks before the movie director rian jhonson literally said in a interview snoke is more powerful than darth vader and the emperor COMBINED. and he just dies. that's it.ok, this review was satire PLEASE tell me no one took this seriously",0

2339,"I have to say this movie was CRAP!!!It was a shameless attempt to SHOVE the social and political issues of the day down the throat of viewers who went looking for an escape of both those things.If any of the producers/directors/writers are reading these posts, then this I'm willing to bet is the MAIN reason why the viewers have scored this movie so low.I NEVER take the word of those STUPID movie critics, I go see for myself especially when I darn well know that a lot of them get paid to PROMOTE movies not give a brave and honest opinion on them. Anyhow, I HATED THIS MOVIE from the very beginning when I noticed the social and political statement they were PUSHING from the time the movie started. Now I love to take about politics and social issues. I very much enjoy the a mentally stimulating conversation/discussion about issues of the day but that is why they've made documentaries which I also love to watch.  When one goes to the movies, one is looking to be entertain and especially to escape the issues of the day NOT have them SHOVED down your throat.I've read many reviews on here and had to write this one due to some of the hypocrisy I read form many men on here. The biggest one was them saying I didn't see gender or didn't see a problem with the OVERTLY and ridiculous exaggeration of gender roles in this movie. Every character who had some importance or level of respect was only a woman. Men were made to seem as not as smart, incompetent and unable to control their emotions a la Luke Skywalker.This reminded me of people who when confronted with the subject of race first blurt out ""I SEE NO COLOR"" or "" MY BEST FRIEND IS BLACK"" such crap!!!Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with women in positions of power or in leadership roles, if you got it you got it, I'm not into holding back talent BUT this movie and its characters were not about that. I know what I'm saying, I've experience these things as a middle age black man. I know there were arguments in the past about Hollywood not having enough people of color in lead roles or as super heroes as well as women. In my view there has been good and steady progress in both arenas. I have seen good and exciting lead roles and superhero roles played by both people or color (minorities/black) and women alike, that glass ceiling was broken a while ago and there has been steady improvements ever since.With that said, there was NO REASON to do this and I am willing to bet that this is the main reason why this movie scored so low and I bet it's the lowest scoring Star Wars movie by far.As far as the other comments about the story lines not making sense and the characters not being developed well I fully agree with. There were too many important characters getting eliminated without their stories, past and roles being developed at all. Snoke for one was killed off too quickly, Captain Phasma just made what amounts to be a cameo appearance, DJ the same could be said for that character, the so called master code breaker, etc.Bottom line, is this was a poorly executed movie with nothing but a transparent social and political agenda of the day.  The original Star Wars movies NEVER injected the political and social issues of the day in such a disgusting way.",0

2343,"I'm happy for the people who liked this movie, but it was as big of a movie disappointment as I've ever experienced. The writing is bad in terms of story telling, pacing, and dialogue. And it undermines all of the previous material that had been created in the previous 7 movies. Its an OK/fine/little empty movie on its own but its greatest sin is diminishing the movies that came before it. Which is really the worst thing any Star Wars movie can do.

2346,"While the movie is well crafted from a technical standpoint, the plot is suffering from a severe lack of direction and purpose. Instead of pushing characters into new and bold directions, it is just more of the same and some character-arcs seem to be copied and pasted from the last instalment. The Pacing and tone of the movie are all over the place, and hugely dramatic scenes with high stakes (or so the movie wants us to believe) are intercut with humorous bits of droid-shenanigans. Some of the characters start to behave erratically and the internal logic of the cinematic Star Wars universe is pushed to the sidelines in favor of cheap, but visually impressive crowd-pleasers. Yes, I'm talking about that one splitting scene that will cause every single person to ask ""Why haven't they done that stuff in the old movies?"".With this being a second act of a trilogy, it plays much more like a third act and leaves little to nothing to do for the characters in the next film. The shadow of what this movie could have been looms heavy, and ultimately forces me to retitle it to ""Episode VIII: The Wasted Potential"".",0

I do not care about any of the remaining characters, even Rey isnt related to anyone she is a nobody, so why should we give a Shi*    No point going into any more details this movie was disgusting, hopefully J.J.

Say what you will about the prequels, but this (and also the Force Awakens) lack the tone and feel of what we have come to expect from a star wars film. While it is oftentimes a good thing for a director to take us in a new direction, Rian Johnson has demonstrated a lack of a fundamental understanding of any of the preceding material. Had Rian Johnson spent more time developing a plot, rather than ""subverting our expectations"",  as approving critics would say, thereby creating a nonsensical dumpster fire of a story, writing Marvel-type jokes for otherwise serious scenes, and stuffing Disney's political agenda down our throats once again, perhaps this movie could have been mediocre. This movie deserves a zero rating because, with it, they have irreparably damaged the in-universe legacy of the original trilogy with a story that really makes no sense.",0
2356,Another Star Wars film with apparently lots of money spent on CGI and very little spent on writing. Garbage.,0
2357,"Instead of nit-picking everything wrong with The Last Jedi (of which there are many), let me share what I think is the main issue with both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.In Episodes IV, V, VI, we quickly formed a strong bond with Luke, Han, and Leia. The character development was good and we actually cared about those characters. In extension, we came to care about R2-D2 and 3-CPO because of the excellent interaction they had with the other human characters. We cared about Chewbacca because of his interaction with Han. These were all characters that meant something to the viewer. This bond happened quickly, strongly, and stayed strong throughout the entire three episodes. Obe-Wan Kenobe and Yoda were mysterious, mystic, powerful characters that we yearned to know more about. They became more important as they interacted with the other characters - especially Luke. We grew to care about them as well. The main antagonist was mysterious, dark, evil, with just enough light within him to make the character very intriguing. We wanted to see how the fight between good and evil would turn out between the good characters we cared about and the powerful and evil Darth Vader and his troops. Fast forward to Episode VII. The writers had so little confidence in their abilities to produce new characters on the same level as Luke, Leia, and Han that they decided to actually bring back the old characters. And they ruined them in the process. They were not able to keep the magic that those characters brought in the first place. Their characters were largely wasted - especially Luke who was not only wasted but disrespectfully trashed. R2-D2 and 3-CPO have basically been forgotten in the recent episodes. They cannot be the same without their interactions with Luke and other main characters. Even Chewbacca cannot be close to the same with his great interactions with Han.The main problem for director Abrams in Episode IX is that there are no characters left that viewers are really connected to. Rey, Finn, and Poe have been so poorly developed that they are but a fraction of what Luke, Han, and Leia were. The viewers are so disconnected from them that many don't even care if they live or die. The emotional attachment just isn't on the same level as with Luke, Leia, and Han. The antagonist, Snoke, - who was killed off in the most laughably ridiculous manner - was never a menacing character anyway. He was certainly no Darth Vader. Kylo Ren - is played well by Adam Driver - is likely the best character in the new generation. However, he, too, is no Darth Vader. This is not the same level of doom and foreboding. So, how does director Abrams make a compelling episode IX? The sad answer is . . . he doesn't. There is no way that Episode IX can work because the proper development of the characters and story never occurred in the previous two episodes leading up to it. And that is the main problem that will likely doom these three episodes as failures.",0
2358,This once again did not follow the canon of the books and the EU which needs to happen. The books are great and it's what the real fans want. The new fans will then also see how great the books are and it will encourage more reading of the EU.,0
2359,"This film is bad and I do not like it. The dialogue is mostly good, and the acting is fantastic. The visuals are incredible, and so is the fight choreography (what little there is in the film). I also enjoy that the film respects the prequels and celebrates in a balance between the new and old Star Wars. The only reason I don't like the film is strictly Luke Skywalker's unfortunate and unseemly death. I mean - Rose was kind of in the way, but that's minor compared to the horrid act that is killing Luke Skywalker. Such an event will not be forgotten. Moving on from the past to focus strictly on the new is a naive and childish concept that has turned a franchise with some potential into a franchise with essentially no potential whatsoever. Episode IX will be interesting, but I am not in the slightest bit excited for its release. Solo and Kenobi will almost certainly be horrendous films and fail critically. This film was an atrocity to mankind. Artists need to learn that their actions have consequences. I do hope that Disney learns their lesson, and avoids damaging other franchises such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe and The X-Files. I suppose we'll see. In the meantime - go see the first two thirds of The Last Jedi! It's a fantastic first two thirds of a film! Have fun!",0
2360,"This is the absolute worst Star Wars movie ever made. This movie is objectively horrible; filled to the brim with plot holes, underdeveloped characters, continuity errors that completely negate any plot relevancy it's preceding movie had, and unforgivably lazy writing. Every man in this movie is a whiny, **** baby and every woman is an over-powered, condescending, egotistical, Mary Sue. This movie reeks of political messages and shameless misandry. The writers of this movie completely butcher any and all Star wars canon to the point of utter irrelevancy; in no way does this movie deserve to be a Star Wars movie, much less a sci-fi B-movie. Save your hard-earned money, do not watch this movie in theaters, do not rent this movie later, pirate this piece of s**t so not a dime goes to the creators of this abhorrent, insulting, revolting, pile of trash.",0
2361,"TFA destroyed the star wars universe, original characters and trilogy. The last jedi was a the last slap and a humiliation to all star wars fans and lore...What a disgrace thing to see thank god I didn't pay a dime to watch this non-sense.",0
2362,"How can this movie have a score of 86?What I liked: great CGIWhat I hated:- Overpowered SJW Rey, being able to lift huge ass rocks after like 3 days of training- Killing the only respectale villain snoke- Killing Luke ""WASTED""- BAD humor (is it a Marvel movie?)- irrelevant storylines (for example Casino scenes)- Leia reviving and flying through space- the whole first order, which can not be taken seriously anymore- the fact that the galaxy is giving no fcks about the conflict first order vs ""rebels""- kylo ren being a whiny Baby- the fact that all beloved characters of the original triology (Han, Luke) are randomly killed for obviously no relevant reason, so that These badly written new characters get at least some relevance. ESPECIALLY KILLING ADMIRAL ACKBAR!in conclusion: this whole movie has been a waste of potential and really disappointed me.I dont know how Star Wars 8 can have such high scores, because obviously SO MANY PEOPLE HATE ITDISNEY you are ruining the Franchise!! STOP, please!IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO WRITE/DIRECT A GOOD SW STORY:""GEORGE LUCAS, YOU ARE OUR LAST HOPE!"" bring him back... or stop",0
2363,"I found nothing worthwhile about this film.  From the writing to the directing it was a complete disappointment.  A cheap rehash of Empire.  None of the secondary characters had any impact on the film.  They did nothing for two and a half hours of film.  They could take Leia, Poe, Finn and Chewie out of the film completely and it wouldn’t change anything.  A total waste of a movie.",0
2364,"This movie was fun to watch, the sound, the music, the visuals, but as far as Star Wars goes, the writing was INSANELY TERRIBLE.  This betrays Luke's character and integrity and DESTROYS everything in retrospect that was good from episodes 4-6.  The Force Awakens had a few holes, but this movie, in my opinion, ENDS THE STAR WARS SAGA.  It was absolutely filled with plot holes and lashes out at the intelligent movie-going audience.  Shame on you Rian Johnson!!!The reboot needs a reboot!-So angry and disappointed",0
2365,"This is not Star Wars anymore. Is only a ""tribute film"" made to win money because it says ""Star Wars"" on the titles... The new ""story"" is pure garbage with no creativity and plot holes everywhere. It have no sense.Star Wars is not a movie that you need to see it twice so you can understan it.The only good thing is that John Williams is behind the music and you can feel that Star Wars essence that also was missing on Episode VII. BUT THATS ALL!!! Its like a slap on the face to Star Wars fans...The scene of Luke throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder feels like the way Disney sees the complete saga and George Lucas's story.They can do a lot of spin-off movies using ideas taken from the expand univers like ""SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE"" and with that build a great story like they do with ""ROGUE ONE"". But no by taking the story of six movies and throwing it to the garbage traying to do ""something new"" for the new generations...For me and a lot of people to; Episode VII and VIII never existed.",0
2366,"The writing has been dumbed down so much to appeal to kids and not adults, which isnt what originally made star wars popular, visually Its beautiful, but after that there is a serious amount of cringe. Every situation has only one possible solution that seems impossible, and they foil it every-time, which becomes monotonous and anticlimactic, after the third act you're dying for the credits, but it drags it out with not much to show for it. The old films visually age, but the music and the bare bones story hold up over time, at the moment this new film looks beautiful and in terms of sounds, sounds fantastic. But it 20 years the story will still be **** and will visually have aged.",0
2367,"Fun to watch, but couldn't respect it in the morning. Can forigve plot-contrived boring matrix-keymaster adventures, and the deliberately-withheld info that made them possible, or even the Neo SuperLeia, but it was anticlimactic with so many missed opportunities (for a moment we thought we were about to have a really great climax that would make up for being cheated out of a really cool mentor/pupil relationship or training story -or any strong plot really) but eh, what a letdown.",0
2368,"Yes, I may be an inexperienced 18 yr old dumbass, who has no idea how hard it is to make a movie, but I'm not incapable of telling apart a good and a bad movie. I saw the first six episodes and I must say, it should've ended with ep. 6 (3 originally). Ep. 7 and 8 just seem to be annoying repetition of the first 6 episodes, what more, aimed at young audience who, in most cases, haven't even seen the original movies.To me it's no longer the battle between the rebels and the empire, but a battle between big movie making companies about who can make the most god-awful remake of a legendary franchise, such as star wars, and make themselves even richer.",0
2369,"Это просто позор. Персонажи не цепляют, логика в фильме на уровне фанфиков школьниц 14 лет, не чувствуется проработанности мира. Из плюсов можно отметить работу оператора и игру Марка Хэмилла, видно как он старался в этой роли, но его персонажа просто слили в унитаз. Обидно, что под надзором стольких людей выходит такое недоразумение. Спасибо диснею за убийство по-настоящему великой саги, пускай и не самой идеальной, но такой душевной и родной. После 7 и 8 эпизода уже ее ничто и никто не спасет...",0
2370,"This was by far my least favorite Star Wars feature film. Did not like how Luke was portrayed, humor unnecessary, plot was lacking.",0
2371,"As a female fan, I was shocked by the total lack of female character development/arcs. The male characters (Luke, Kylo, Poe, Finn) are flawed, conflicted and interesting. They grow and change. But the female characters (Leia, Rey, Rose, Admiral Holdo) are flat, morally ""pure,"" and have all the answers from start to finish. While their plans are occasionally thwarted (always by men), the women never truly fail on a personal level, so I found them impossible to relate to. As a woman, I want realistic female characters who are challenged, tempted, mistaken, devastated - and grow as a result. What message does this send to kids? It's okay for boys to make mistakes and learn from failure - but only perfect girls are worthy of portrayal? Women are only there to redirect men, clean up their messes, and make up for men's failings? Come on, Disney.",0
2372,Its not the worst movie I have ever seen but its the most I’ve ever been disappointed in a movie.  Tremendous letdown on so many levels. The plot goes from illogical to outright absurd.  And Star Wars should be no place to push any political agenda.  There’s simply not enough room to get into all the problems with this movie.,0
2373,"If you completely ignore the fact this is a Star Wars film, you have a fairly decent sci-fi movie that I'd probably give a 6/10.  However, it is a Star Wars film which means it needs to be viewed in the context as it being a successor to previous Star Wars films. One must consider how it fits in with the greater fabric of the Star Wars Universe and how it takes the ideas, characters, and places from previous movies and creates something fresh and original while still providing that majestic and hopeful experience that we know as Star Wars.In the case of this utter atrocity of cinema, the creators have utterly failed in that and I am very, very disappointed.  This movie has the unfortunate effect of being more and more insulting the more you love Star Wars and I truly do love Star Wars.  I've watched all the movies save episode 1 more times than I can count.  When the expanded universe was still a thing I used to read every single book, some many, many times.  And while I was sad when ""The Force Awakens"" removed all those books from canon, I was still excited to see where they would bring the series.  I was still filled with the thrill of hope and amazement when I saw Episode 7 in theaters.  It may have suffered from a lack of originality but it didn't suffer from a lack of hope.  It didn't suffer from a lack of Star Wars.With the Last Jedi, all my hope and excitement is gone.  This movie is just such a slap in the face to people who really loved all of the previous Star Wars films.  The film is such a mess of plot holes, utterly pointless scenes, and blatant contradictions that I quite frankly don't even know where to begin when it comes to criticizing this film.  It simply does not suffice to talk about the problems with particular bits or scenes of the movie when the problems are so fundamental to the direction and writing of this film as a whole.  The only bit of this movie I can really praise is the marvelous score by John Williams.  The rest of it, from the characters to the places and plot points was terrible.  Characters were static caricatures of themselves and the film's treatment of its minority cast members nearly offensive in its tastelessness at certain points.I went into this film with such high hopes and I walked out very disappointed indeed.  I wish I could say I still have high hopes for the future of Star Wars but this movie was incredibly effective in its effort to utterly stamp them out of my very soul.",0
2374,"Dissappointing as hell! Massive unexplained things, bad pacing and character development, Disney- esque humour (not a big flaw, but it adds to the disaster) make Episode VIII the worst film in the saga IMOWorst offender here: complete disrespect to the source material of Star Wars canon. Scenes like the finale and the Mary Poppins Leia are pure cringe. About Luke, his portrayal in this movie is just awful to the heroic nature of the character as we knew him. I wasn' t even sad as he died! That explains it allJust an inconsisted mess of a movie, and maybe the end of my love with the sagaReally sad, because i really liked Episode VII",0
2375,"There are so many problems and disappointments with the Last Jedi that there isn't enough space to write. However, I will try to focus on most obvious. The movie was awful from a plot basis and understanding of the lore, mythology and history of Star Wars canon. It's as if Johnson never viewed the previous 6 movies or read any of the novels or Star Wars myths. Here are the central problems:1. Luke Skywalker was willing to die in ROTJ to turn his father to the light side. So powerful and good was he that Darth Vader, who had killed Jedi students, turned to the light and destroyed the Sith, bringing balance to the force. The only Jedi left to continue this religion was Luke. Apparently, we learn in TFA, that Ben Solo turned on Luke because of a dark side master, Snoke. We don't know how Snoke rose, whether he is a Sith, just a bad guy, whatever. And it appears with his baseless death that we never will. If you thought Snoke might be Plagueis or something more interesting or thought you would learn more about the religion of the Sith and Jedi you will be very humiliated. In fact, here's what you learn. Snoke is a weak nobody who is easily killed by Kylo without even a confrontation. Basically, Snoke tells Kylo to complete his training and kill Rey and then Kylo uses the force to turn a light saber sitting next to Snoke through his side. What makes this scene so stupid is that moments before his death, Snoke is throwing Rey all over the room like a gorilla could do to a cat. And after briefly striking Kylo with lighting earlier in the film, Snoke apparently can do everything but use his peripheral vision to see a light saber clearly moving next to his side. Did anyone review this movie before its release? Then, Rey's parents are drunks who have no power. And Luke...oh God, Luke Skywalker...perhaps the greatest Jedi of all, milks and alien and drinks the milk like a homeless man. He has no power and is easily dispensed of by Rey, who has as much training with the force as you and I do...and then in the climactic scene in the movie...Luke dies at the hands of exhaustion from using a hologram of himself to fight Ren. Think you've heard enough...hang on...the force ghost of Yoda appears to Luke--he looks like Kermit the Frog...and he burns the Jedi teachings and says about the Jedi books--and I'm not kidding here--""they are not exactly page turners..."" Then, after Yoda uses forces lighting to burn the Jedi teachings he laughs hysterically."" Clearly, in death, Yoda is not the same 900 year old Jedi who tells Luke that he's trained Jedi for 800 years and knows better than he...My God. This is just the surface. Leia, the only really dead person in the movie, survives, which means we all know her fate already in 9. And there is a scene where she is blown from a ship and uses the force to fly back to the ship like Marry Poppins! All she needed was the umbrella...And finally, the political agenda stuff is so thrown in your face you feel like you're watching MSNBC. And, I'm a progressive. It was just too obvious. The myth of the Jedi and Sith is dead. The characters we thought we knew are destroyed and in one movie the only story we have left to tell is of a petulant, cry-baby, impulsive loser, Kylo Ren. Star Wars has ended. And it was clearly intentional.",0
2376,Worst movie from Star Wars legacy. Luke is not the Luke Skywalker. They must reboot again in order to fix all errors in such movie,0
2377,"This was a terrible movie. What I hated most was the unflinching willingness of Disney to add characters they think will boost audience engagement--like the Chinese actress. I feel at a real loss for Mark Hamill and he must have nearly choked on his lines. This turd of a production was an insult to the audience and the heritage of the Star Wars legacy. I hope Disney executives lose a ton of sleep of this debacle and some clowns even lose their jobs. Finally, who THE HELL is Rian Johnson anyways? I want my money back!",0
2378,"Bad script, ""overdramatic"" scenes, not genuine ideas and ideology doutrination",0
2379,"Major plot holes and misses basic logic about the star wars universe. Apparently anyone with zero jedi training is able to master the force within seconds of screen-time.

2380,"Spoiler analysis!I did not like. It does not look like a Star Wars movie. Many things do not match the saga.Luke at the beginning of the film, with all due respect, looks like a loser!Rey's ""training"" was ridiculous.In addition, the film does not seem to make much sense. (My vision)Things that never happen, happen in the movie and without any explanation.Simply read Levite in space. Luke creates a homogram for you.Did not like.The supreme lord dies of **** It is unbelievable that the ""lord of evil"" dies with a lightsaber at his side, not realizing that he will be activated and simply dies.How can the ""villain"" of the movie die like this? No explanation of where he came and dying roughly.If you are a fan, go watch and draw your own conclusions.Personally, I did not like it.",0
2381,"Large sections of this movie are completely pointless and inconsequential. The movie is enjoyable at best, but how it handles the lore and how it's supposed to be a step forward in the grand scheme of things is an abomination.",0
2382,"Whoever made this movie needs to be drawn and quartered.  I did not like the cookie cutter story line.  1. It was so perfectly cut that one could cleanly remove a part of the movie and it wouldn't impact the movie in any way.2. Too easy to figure out the outcome of the story.3. The animals in this movie have absolutely nothing on the Ewoks or even R2D2 for that matter.4. The movie does an overall horrible job at showing enough variety of the Star Wars Universe.5. The movie acts like it's 5 years after the Force Awakens but it's clearly literally a day after The Force Awakens.  It leaves the audience absolutely zero sense of awareness of what time it is in this story line. They're just making this stuff as they go it seems...Finally #6. The training of Rey is 100% Unbelievable, she reaches the level of Jedi Knight with absolutely no effort compared to ""all"" of the previous movies.Makes no sense at all in this movie.",0

Luke's character progression was strange and awkward when we reach him in Episode 8. The ending also robs fans of the franchise to see Luke in action, which we were denied throughout the entirety of the film. I most likely will not be seeing Episode 9 and I'm saddened that I feel this way.",0
2385,"Unfortunately i watched it...Rian Johnson failed at everything. It was to be expected but so bad? Yes, so bad and even worse. That's not Star Wars. It was a slap in the original trilogy's face.

2388,"Ok, so some people claim, that ""Star Wars"" fans are outraged because they had too high expectations. No. NO! Please show this movie to anyone who never cared about Star Wars, never watched it, and trust me. they gonna say the same. Let's look at it as ""a movie"", not Star Wars. First..the plotline is just a mess. The whole ""find the codebreaker"" is a filler. They didn't need to leave, they didn't need to come back, none of that was necessary, they accomplished nothing. Second, it's boring. They recycle a lot of monologues and just a lot of meaningless and shallow conversations. There are lots of cool special effects, but none of them stands out to be any better than all the sci-fi movies in the past 10 years already done. 3Rd. Shallow and make people feel empty. The movie has so many missed opportunities and lacking any character development. Example: Who is Snokes? Where did he come from, how come he is so powerful? He basically exists as a filler to have someone more evil than Kylo Ren, but have no other role. The girl Jedi- if you can call it a jedi, has no training, and all she does is lifts some stones, talks to Kylo Ren via telepathy and she almost gets killed by some guards while fighting with a lightsaber. There is no demonstration of the force in this movie. Kylo Ren character is more like a misguided teen seeking stupid revenge, but doesn't feel like some powerful villain. There is nothing scary about that guy and he looks like he's gonna cry any minute, every time the camera is on him. So , in a nutshell, I was disappointed and felt empty at the end. That's it? The whole movie felt like a family feud and with all the starships and characters, it's like 40 vs 40 people, but the galaxy is fine, nobody cares, let them duke it out, but essentially they are insignificant. There is no galaxy-wide problem with this, as I said, a family feud.",0

I literally have zero excitement for episode 9 No expectations No enthusiasm Literally no thoughts or curiosity about what happens next theres’s no buzzYou are a stupid Johnson, Johnson and your movie is stupid too, full of stupid characters who do and say stupid things and you want us to laugh at it. Well no thanks mate I’ll pass next time. You killed Star Wars you idiot.",0
2390,"I don't understand why this (terrible) movie was even made. Why would Disney pay George Lucas 4 billion for an established franchise with a dedicated audience and fan base only to deliberately change all of the road-tested ideas, trash the beloved characters, abandon its successful themes and disparage its hardcore fans? If they wanted to make something new, why spend 4 billion to ruin something old?",0

There are several very large plot holes and even little actions throughout the movie have terrible motivation--even the basic science of the universe is discarded.  On the plus side, the actors playing Rey and Kylo continue to show that they are phenomenal actors and they actually have some interesting interactions in this show.  That's the part everyone likes.  But the movie overall was so destructive we would be better of if it had not been created because it changes the universe to make existing movies worse.  I'd say it's as bad as or worse than the prequels in that regard.Score: awful.  Not only is it not a good movie, it actively makes our world worse.",0

A Disney budget, however, can only get you so far.The actors are not bad people, but their acting overall is sub-par. The writing is uninspired, and if you look at any scene and imagine it without all the special effects and flare, you are left with a script a middle schooler would create.I have enjoyed Rogue One, The Force Awakens, and I hope to enjoy the Solo movie as well from the reboots, but this movie is beyond saving.(I own the bloody thing and I can't even bare to watch it)",0
2394,The movie is absolute garbage. It's extremely poorly written. Characters have no personality or motivation and acted really bad.

Finally, Luke was portrayed as a coward! A coward who flees from the fight out of fear! At least I won't spend another dime on any franchise product and that includes all the upcoming movies! And let's together boycott episode 9 for Disney to feel in the pocket the size of the **** they did! I will also boycott Rian Johnson, the new enemy of Star Wars Fans",0

If this was running on tv and didn't had the Star Wars name, you would turn this **** off after 20 min tops. Because it's just filler, disneyfied to an extend thats even insulting for actual Disney movies.The story was almost completely predictable and filled with bull****. For me as a imperial fan, this was just more than 150min of pure agony. And even my rebel buddy sitting next to me was facepalming every few minutes, only interupted by starring in disbelief at the screen.But let's talk about a few points of this movie that were just complete crap. 5000 characters are not enough to describe the mess. 500000 would even barely be enough.At the beginning it's said that the first order has nearly wiped out all of the resistance. And then shortly before they can deal the deceisive blow, all officers go suddenly braindead. Allowing a single **** fighter to disable the 2. most powerful ship of the order singlehandedly. And then a few bombers come and destroy it..... While every other ship of the fleet is watching......and no more fighters are deployed....and nobody is firing at the rebels anymore.....and somebody forgot to bring an interdictor cruiser.....The first order then tails the fleeing rebels and manages to detet them falling from hyperspace. The rebels can only run, since their fuel is almost depleted and they almost get wiped out by enemy fighters. Instead of finishing them off, the order decided to follow them.....without sending additional fighter to attack them....and waiting for them to run out of fuel....and without calling in reinforcements to block their escape route......And when they finally were about to destroy the last rebel ship and end the rebellion, guess who pulls out a super weapon out of their asses? And it's a weapon they could have come up with centuries ago.....Seriously, this movie is almost on level with episode 2. Go spend your hard earned money on a pizza. Or a handjob from a crack whore. In both cases more satisfying experiences than this gigantic pile of disney ****",0

Forget about the magic, the force, and everything that stood for the Jedi ways.The movie itself is not a ""bad"" movie, but ladies and gentlemen, this is NOT STAR WARS.I do not look forward to Ep. IX, I will not go to a movie theater to watch it. This is the end. Except for movies like Rogue One, and that is a big maybe.",0
2399,Last Jedi is the last Star Wars film that gets an automatic box office ticket purchase from me. Disney Co. really disrespected Luke Skywalker's character here. He's as good as it gets for a Jedi. He'd sacrifice his own life to save his father's but in this movie he'd kill his own nephew (the son of his sister and friend) for what exactly? No more Disney Co. If you can't figure this out with your 'Billions of Dollars' you deserve to go bankrupt.,0
2400,"Once again Disney is all about cramming a social justice commentary down our throats! Luke, the beloved hero we saw grow from farmer boy to Jedi through many trials and failure to become the savior of the galaxy is reduced to an insecure grumpy old man that against his character chooses to kill his student while he sleeps...so Luke is no different/better than Darth Sidious WTF?!? Yoda always told Luke to be careful when others would try to sway him to the dark side, but he declares Rey to be incorruptible WTF?!? Snoke can see into Kylo's mind enough to know he will not be converted to the light, but he is unable to perceive Kylo's cheap saber turning move WTF?!? The Rebel, uh hmm...sorry Resistance fleet is allowed to slowly retreat WTF?!? Canto Bright scene is tedious and unnecessary!!! I could go on... SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! DON'T LINE DISNEY'S POCKETS!!! Horrible, Idiotic and Annoying!!!!!!!!!",0
2401,"As others mentioning poor writing for Luke and other characters, id like to point out missed opportunities for dark side characters. Since Old Rebublic is non canon now i feel like lore of the siths have to be represented much more. Dont think thats gona happen in 9th episode. Snoke is a joke and this is very sad. Darth Sidius will be missed, also no hope for mentiooning characters like Revan.",0
2402,"It's sort of ironic, that one year after Carrie Fisher passed away the Star Wars franchise apparently met the same fate. Honestly I don't even know where to start here: The jokes are aimed at 5 year olds, characters are introduced and killed off for no reason (or explanation) and for some reason everyone keeps repeating their last sentence over and over and for some reason everyone keeps repeating their last sentence over and over... Also a sheer neverending amount of deus ex machinas and plot armor moments.",0
2403,"All the critics must be paid by Disney. And the positive reviews must be from botsThis movie was terrible. It had cool visuals but that's all. The worst part was Luke's character, he was not a hero or evil, either of those would have been better. He was nothing, the legend of Luke Skywalker was apocryphal, he created Kylo then refused to help fix the problems he created. The man that saw good in Vader would think of killing a teenager, impossible. Even at the end he did nothing. They dishonored the hero we grew up loving. Beyond ruining Luke, many gaping plot holes. Fin's role was pointless and caused hundreds of rebels to die. Snoke and Phasma were weak and went down like Jawas. Kylo's turn to the dark side was based on a misunderstanding. Flying Leia was moronic. Why not tell Poe the plan and save hundreds of lives? Why didn't a star destroyer cut off the rebels ship? No lightsaber duels!!!!! BB-8 can't be the solution to every problem(In the AT-ST, get's the ship, stops the prison guards...). Why didn't the laws of physics apply to Rose's ship. Fin is heading straight at full speed, she turns and comes at him from the side, and dooms everyone and stops him for actually helping the rebellion. If Yoda can affect the physical world with lightning, why isn't he helping the rebels?Rey going down the dark side pit, we learned nothing, it was pointless.That's all I can remember at the moment.Rey moving those rocks was cool(even though we never see her move anything prior to that, not sure when she developed that ability)Only casual Star Wars fans and children could like this movie. If you are a serious Star Wars fan, you will hate it.",0
2404,"This is not really a Star Wars film. There are no heroes here, or well developed villains, no cool light saber fights or amazing star battles. Even in in terms of being a regular sci-fi film there are so many questions. There are so many distracting and head scratching moments in this film - I cant believe these ideas got past storybording given the budget of this film. The director of this film shows no regard for the past of SW and no care for its future. Avoid this film if you want to keep thinking of Luke as hero rather than a coward, and Leia as a brave leader rather than a bystander. Sadly, Porgs are probably the best thing about the film.",0
2405,"Did we really wait two years to find out Rey's parents were a couple of drunks who sold her for drinking money? Lame. This film ruined Rey, making her some awkward, pointless character looking in on a family dispute she has no stake in. Rey was flat and was just used to give Kylo an arc, because Rian Johnson was in love with him. Finn was giving nothing to do, as well. All the mystery created by Abrams in TFA--gone. All the wonderful new characters introduced in TFA--disrespected. Yes, there was emotion between Kylo, Luke, and Leia, but Luke is dead and Fisher is sadly gone. No one cares about Rey vs. Kylo, now that Rey is a nothing character. This is not a legitimate Star Wars movie.  It is an ANTI-Star Wars movie.",0
2406,"The cinematography was okay at times, but felt rather weak during conversations.(TFA actually had better cinematography)The choreography was bad.There writing is full of holes and is very lackluster.The plot twists felt cheap and were more for a shock factor than anything.Rey is less annoying than she was in TFA though.Overall, not a very good film, unlike what most review sites would tell you.",0
2407,"What is there more to be said that hasn't been said already, from bigger fans of Star Wars than I.  As a simple movie goer, I actually enjoyed The Force Awakens.  I also very much disliked The Last Jedi.  Forced jokes that seem out of place, stupid focus on cute animals, unexplained segments or motives, bad editing, pointless and bloated scenes; it's all there to make a bad movie.  The real takeaway here is that we cannot trust critic reviews anymore, as I have not seen such a false narrative and huge discrepancy in critic and audience opinion.  Truth be told, Star Wars is at a point that it is too big to not make money.  Despite the sour taste from TLJ, I will see Episode 9, since JJ will be directing.  However, I will not ever pay to watch another movie from Rian Johnson; of that you can be sure.  A complete mess.",0
2408,"It was long, boring and heavily uneventful. Beautiful to look at, but did not feel like a star wars movie. Don’t watch it! wait for it on your favorite streaming source. It’s a movie that striped away all the world building of previous Star Wars movies, so what was the point of naming this movie Star Wars. Might as well made a completely different thing. They forgot that people wanted to see a Star wars movie, not whatever this was. How is it that their letting Disney Get away with this destruction of modern mythology, it’s a disaster for any Star Wars fan.",0
2409,"Welcome to the bastardization of Star Wars brought to you by Kathleen Kennedy and Disney! They made Luke Skywalker (the most beloved hero since Odysseus)a madman who thought about killling his nephew during his sleep! Luke was a brave-hero who redeemed his father in the OT, this time he's an hermit and a coward! yay! And Rey... the ultimate Mary Sue, she doesn't need training or advice, she's good at EVERYTHING! RIP Star Wars. We owe a massive apology to George Lucas. Keep the downvoting, people! they (Disney) deserve this backlash!",0
2410,"Star Wars: The Last Rites. As a movie it's just not very good, as a Star Wars movie it's a travesty - the tone is so jarring and incompatible with all that proceeded it that I never once forgot that I was sitting in a movie theatre the entire time.For me it's the worst of the series. I was actually bored for the first time watching a Star Wars movie. I'm giving 1 point for Luke's very brief interaction with R2 on the falcon which was one of the only points that made me feel anything.Star Wars: The Last Rites - any chance of a mulligan???",0
2411,"I honestly believe that those who actually like this movie, are only Star Wars movie ""fans"" because some of my friends who are true Star Wars fans that read comics, fan-fiction, books, or play the video games both past and current ones. This movie is honestly stupid, this movie makes me feel like Rian Johnson took the biggest, steaming pile of crap on Star Wars. I've been born into Star Wars, I know what I mean when I say this movie made Phantom Menace look like Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi did nothing to progress the story, answer any questions that were made by The Force Awakens, Rian Johnson dropped the ball on this one, and Disney let it happen. It was the stupidest move to avoid the death of Leia when Carrie Fisher (God rest her soul) is not able to play the part. There was no connection between the Luke Skywalker from episode VI (when Luke is the mature hero we love and grow up to be) and this Luke Skywalker that is a bitter, old man who doesn't give a crap about anything anymore, he just wants to die. Seriously??? The man, the hero, who saved his father from the dark side, who was willing to give up his life for his father, the one who sees the goodness in everyone, episode VIII was the worse interpretation of Luke Skywalker ever, to me it doesn't even seem like an interpretation of one of the Greatest heroes, but a parody. I grew up wanting to be like the real Luke, not this crapped on garbage. I believe that when Rey gave the lightsaber to Luke and he tossed it aside, that's exactly what Rian did as JJ Abrams gave him the formula for a great Star Wars movie. The sadness and anger that took over me when my hero became one with the force, you cannot, I repeat CANNOT, put so much hype into Luke only to kill him off because he was using too much of his Force Power, seriously no, that's not the way it works. You CANNOT simply destroy the stories of the characters because 'you feel like it', that is what Rian Johnson, did with Finn, with Poe, with Leia, with Luke, with SNOKE!, with Luke's old lightsaber. You have failed Rian Johnson, you have betrayed us all. You deserve all this backlash for your poor work. I really wish people understand what the problems are with this movie because they took a franchise that was beautifully made and written, the franchise that changed pop culture, and just took a massive dump on it, forget Phantom Menace, this movie sucked more than that!!",0
2412,"Uneven, plodding, nonsensical. These are the words that come to mind after watching what might arguably rival Episodes I and II as the worst in the series. It's as if the filmmakers knew they had a couple hours to fill and not much story to tell. The movie hops from one idea to the next without much weight, and as a result nothing in the movie feels as if it matters. Also, I'm not the most well-versed in Star Wars lore, but since when did the Force become this super-power that can conveniently do anything the characters need it to? I've been really hoping to like this new trilogy, but after seeing this, I have actually resolved not to see Episode IX.",0
2413,"This is an assault to my childhood and certainly yours if you are a star wars fan, this director/writer is the worst, twist are not the issue, the movie is just a real bad movie.... don't waste a penny on this...",0
2414,"Regardless of how you feel characters were handled, there are so many problems with the film. Whether it's the miss matched humor for the series. All of the casino / Rose sequences or the plot points that make no sense. Rather than another edition to a beloved film series. This ends up as just another disappointing, stereotypically Hollywood schlock-fest. Very surprised, especially with the directors previous work.",0
2415,"I didn't expect much after the episode 7, but I didn't think it could go any lower than it already did. This movie is OBJECTIVELY bad. There are huge cringe worthy, logic defying moronic moments that even a toddler could point out. Add to that all the useless moments that ended with nothing or all the set up from the previous movie that was just utterly discarded. If you want to make it for all audiences, go ahead, but you can still make it a story that holds up. Going into a coma and being an unthinking vegetable is the only way you will ever be able to remotely enjoy this.",0
2416,"Poorly written, like an 11 year old came up with the plot. It gets a three because the third act actually has some good moments.  The film is long, tedious with bad sub plots and they treated the character of Luke Skywalker with disrespect.  This character is nothing like Luke, and I felt bad that Mark Hamill had to play him.   They basically trashed my childhood hero, and I just don’t want to see this series any more.",0

2418,"Worse Star Wars ever made. No plot, no story no nothing.It's a atrocious bad movie. This is not Star Wars!",0
2419,"Es una pelicula obsurda, con alti bajos, con una falta de razon, secuencia, canones y desarrollo, que junto con su trama que rompe las reglas de universo star wars y su Deus ex machina a terminado con la basofia entre basofias de star wars mucho peor que el comic  o vizarro jamas hecho",0
2420,"Good things first: The Last Jedi progresses the overall plot decently, and vaguely resembles Star Wars. The bad things would be everything else. Where to start...Probably with the writers' apparent attempt to cramp three movies into one. The Star Wars style of narration still remains a poor fit for rabid modern hollywood pacing. The series is filled with characters and moments that fell short because they just did not have the time to develop. Many scenes required an involvement of the viewer that wasn't there, because the movie never established any meaning for them. They only leave eyes rolling back so hard you can hear it in the audience room. Another fatal flaw with the same result was the overuse of story twists and turnarounds, whose painful predictability completely negates the tension that should have been built.In this atmosphere, the writers' apparent urge to deliver references to previous Star Wars titles does work out as the loving innuendoes they may have been intended as, but appear as shoehorned in, or as uninspired copies.And these are far and away not the only things that tore me out of any potential immersion. There are all the usual urges to create big moments that just don't seem to fit and leave a bad aftertaste. There is the pop philosophy tuned to 11, complete with terrible visual metaphors. There is the usual ""incompetence as a plot device"" in laughable proportions, both with allegedly wise men and basic military protocols (say, how to secure a capital ship).In the end they somehow managed to cramp material that would have needed 8:00 hours to work out into 2:30h, and still have unbearable lengths in it.",0
2421,This is not the Star Wars we remember from 30 years ago or even the star wars we remember from two years ago. It is a long boring slog where they try to be unexpected but this just means there is no emotional payoff for anything that happens. It is also all over the place. In one scene a character sacrifices herself and this is meant to be nobel but then only a little while later another character does the same and it is show as foolish. They build up the big bad then kill him before he does anything. They have a scene about the mystery of Rey's parents then reveal who her parents are doesn't matter. The romance between Rey and Finn is established in the first movie but they have barely any interaction in this one and Finn meets someone new. Star Wars was so captivating because it was a fairy tale set in space about a white knight saving a princess from a black knight in a castle. It was a story about morality. This film doesn't know what it is because it tries to be everything except a Star Wars film.,0
2422,Went in this movie with a open mind and left wholly disappointed in the storylines.. the action was great but that's all it had going for it.. very disappointed in what rian did to luke.,0
2423,No he visto guion tan malo en mi vida. Destroza lo epico de George Lucas y mata la esencia que tenia la saga. La historia es mala y la pelicula es Disney pero no star wars. Meter a los personajes antiguos para destrozarlos....de psiquiatra.,0
2424,"Wish i could get my Time and Money back..... Horrible writing, i don't even know where to start... Marry Poppins makes a showing in this lol. I see what Disney did there. The Last Jedi for me is the Last Star Wars movie I'm going to see. Disney is on something.",0
2425,"Opinions evolve.  Maybe I’ll grow to like this installment but SPOILERS the characterization of Luke was actually spot on, but the resolution disappointed.  Having read Johnson’s cavalier response that there were too many characters so he decided to cut one loose is **** insane.",0
2426,"It’s the worst movie in the Star Wars saga by far. The plot is empty and the movie ends exactly where it started, except for some killings during some battles. None of the questions left by The Force Awakens find an answer: where does Rey came from? Why is Rey so close to the Force? Who are the Knights of Ren? Where does Snoke came from? Rey barely begin her apprentice as a Jedi, making no progress from TFA. What about Kylo? For the whole movie it seems like he’s going to fall with the light side, then wakes up and gets evil. Instead of the typical British humor director Rian Johnson used a blatant American humor that was way too off contest. It was interesting to see both good and evil for each character, but this is all I found good in the whole movie.",0
2427,Pretty big let down.  Terrible drawn out side plots.  The force awakens was a pretty decent set up but this movie definitely dropped the ball.,0
2428,"Beautiful cinematography and music. However, the Last Jedi is brought down by poor pacing issues and conflicting themes. The movie is ambitious but fails to juggle all the plot points and partially omits what The Force Awakens has already established such as the Knights of Ren. Humour is a huge part of Star Wars but the Last Jedi places so many that you can no longer take the scenes that were supposed to be filled with tension and emotion seriously. In other words, they were replacing cheap laughs and chuckles instead of a powerful, moving scene. There were glimpses of greatness but the bloated nature of movie stops it from surpassing its predecessors.",0
2429,"This was the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Without the Star Wars name this movie would have been trashed by critics. The whole movie is a bunch of cliches strung together to create a plot with entirely too many holes. The characters were flat and dull. The actors performances were a mess which I will attribute to either the director or editor. Oscar Issac is a phenomenal actor, but his performance in this reminded me of a high school student making a demo reel. There is absolutely no point of Rey's character in this movie. The movie supposedly takes place over the course of 6 hours, but so much happens in those six hours that it completely broke the immersion for me. Due to spoilers I won't describe it, but something similar would be a person from Boston travelling to Miami hanging and making acquaintances than coming back to Boston for dinner the same day. There were no true villains in this movie and the one could-be villain has his back-story and motivations completely rendered useless because of lazy writing. Rogue One was quite possibly the best Star Wars movie ever made and they follow it up with this extra long garbage. The Force Awakens was another bad movie, but not as bad as this. Star Wars went from a ""see on opening night"" to ""see later in its run"" due to Force Awakens, but now after The Last Jedi Star Wars went from ""see later in its run"" to ""pirate after DVD release"". Everyone should be ashamed of making this movie and everyone should be ashamed they rated it high due to nostalgia alone. Utterly useless movie.",0
2430,"Second time I’ve seen this movie. Last Jedi is not Star Wars. Storyline is hit and miss.  The characters like the plot are all over the place to much 21st century not enough Star Wars. Worse than the prequels, at least the prequels felt like Star Wars. Huge disappointment, just a movie with no direction. Great visuals, bad story. Rian Johnson killed Star Wars, and made it into a joke.",0
2431,"This Movie is no Star Wars Movie, this is an Visual Art Movie with the name Star Wars and really really really really shallow and bad Writing.. They did a BIIIIGG Mistake to pull Out JJ Abrams and give it to Rian Johnson and Now the Run back to JJ to fix that **** The only thing thats good about this movie is the CGI they did a great job on that but nothing else even Rei is more of a Mariesue then in The Force Awakens she is a perfekt boring charcter that can do everything and dont need any training whats so ever... wow",0
2432,"Terrible film, how the hell is the critic average so high? obvious they are getting bribed, that's the movie industry now. The film is full of identity, gender, vegan/animal rights politics. Reys a mary sue, Lukes made into a coward, Rose is a pointless character. Star wars is dead.",0
2433,"Worst Star Wars movie ever made. Way too long, way too repetitive, way too corny. Luke's character was totally butchered. None of these ""new heroes"" are likeable. This film felt like a parody of Star Wars. All involved should be ashamed for tainting the legacy of the franchise.",0
2434,"Remember Star Wars? Yeah. Well, this movie is not Star Wars. It's a bunch of crap, nonsensical storylines, pathetic characters, idiotic decisions, huge contradictios. Basically a middle finger to what SW has been until today. Want advice? Don't watch it.",0
2435,"Not only a whole lot of wasted opportunity, but far too much stupidity mixed in. Some good visuals (I like the modified AT-ATs) and a few good moments, but they're lost in the overall morass of mediocrity. Setups from TFA: wasted. Finn's character arc: wasted. Snoke: wasted. Rey's origin: wasted. Luke: wasted. Light-saber battle: lumbering, pedestrian choreography. NR backstory: non-existent. Incompetent + cringe-worthy leadership and decision-making from the Resistance. Was it bad that I started rooting for the First Order?What are we left with? Ren and Hux are joke antagonists. There is no credible threat against  M'Rey Sue protagonist. Finn is now a clown, having been given an excellent start in TFA. Chewie and Poe are about the only ones left worth watching, and they're secondary characters. So what's the draw for Ep IX? Meh.",0

I now have zero interest in what happens to these characters, as a 40 year Star Wars fan (I'm also a fan of other Rian Johnson films), it pains me to say that.",0
2440,"As a long time Star Wars fan, I'm sad to report that this film was essentially a greatest hits collection of scenes from 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' -- recycled for a new generation of millenials who never watched the original films. The bloated cast of uninspired new characters, coupled with the nonsensical portrayals of Luke and Leia drove a plot that lacked direction and was at times, baffling to watch unfold. The writing team failed to exhibit even a basic comprehension of the lore of Star Wars and the overuse of awkward, ham-fisted humour greatly detracted from my immersion and belied the supposed 'dark' tone the film was attempting to convey. All in all, while there were some entertaining action set pieces, the story decisions made in this film are baffling and have severely hamstrung J.J. Abrams' ability to make a well-rounded, satisfying film to conclude this new trilogy.",0
2441,"The way they made this movie made me so mad, especially on how they devolved this movie with poor subplots that made little meaning, and to many underdeveloped characters that make you care for the little about their characters, and finally on how they made of the legacy characters into a joke from the original series. NO!!! Too many unanswered questions that leave you to ask more question at the end of the movie. I'm sorry to say that I would not want to see another Star Wars movie again.

2444,"Pontos negativos:- Protagonizaram o Luke Skywalker à moda de um ""bêbado falido de Wal Street, complexado pela culpa"". Yoda também sofreu com a culpa pelo fracasso, e também se exilou, porém ele era um MESTRE JEDI, e na FORÇA ele viveu e aprendeu. Eu esperava o mesmo com o Luke.- A Ray entrega o sabre-de-luz para o Luke e ele o arremessa? Ridículo! Isso demonstra que o ""LUKE"" da ""NOVA VERSÂO DISNEY"" não têm valores JEDI.- O Luke se naga a ensiná-la, e não a ensina nada!- Esperávamos (Sim, pois falo por muitos amigos fãs no Brasil) que o Luke demonstrasse a Sabedoria que somente um eremita na FORÇA poderia possuir. Esperávamos que ele se assemelhasse ao Mestre Yoda, testando a Ray e logo após treinando-a nos caminhos da Força.- A morte do Luke foi péssima! Ele poderia sim ter morrido em um último esforço, porém que o seu pai, Obi Wan e Yoda estivessem ali ao seu lado, para levá-lo, para nos dar o sentimento de que o seu papel findou e fora um final glorioso, finalizando assim, a SAGA SKYWALKER para iniciar a nova história ""Disney"".- A Princesa Leia estava limitada. Amargurada e cinzenta. Sem qualquer participação especial.- O Snoke comparar o Kylo Ren ao Vader? Isso foi uma piada?- O Snoke morreu de uma forma ridícula em vista do poder que possuía (ou que aparentava possuir).- Repetitismo chato! Fugas e mais fugas... Visões conectadas e mais visões. - Se a Leia tinha domínio da força o suficiente para protagonizar aquela cena, porquê que ela não conseguia sequer levitar pedras?- Canhão Protótipo da Estrela da Morte? Outra piada da Disney.- Um filme longo demais para mostrar apenas: fugas, deserções, visões e o péssimo Luke da Disney.- Só não classifico como ZERO porquê se trata de STAR WARS.- O Luke deveria ter sido uma combinação de Yoda e Obi Wan. Aquele que treina a nova geração, a Ray no caso, e que responde ao chamado da Rebelião, findando a sua existência em um ato heróico, glorioso e sábio.- Sabe o que teria sido muito legal? Mostrar o Templo Jedi original como ele é, e o treinamento da Ray nos caminhos da Força dentro do Templo. O treinamento de um Jedi nunca foi mostrado, apenas partes mesquinhas.- Enfim, sigam esse conselho: REFAÇAM O FILME ANTES QUE O MUNDO PERCA OUTRO ATOR MARAVILHOSO!",0

When I went to see it I was hoping for to get the questions answered from the previous film, but instead, I was left with no depth and pointless explanation. The action scenes were not that good, characters were shallow, the script was brainless and there was too much comedy aspect everywhere. It is disgraceful to release a movie like this to the fans. The fans deserve a better movie. Also, stupid Disney **** us up real good and I hope they lose a lot of money on every star wars movie release from now on because of this disaster.",0

2449,What is the difference between The Last Jedi and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets?They are fundamentally very similar.  Both science fiction fantasies suffer from static characters meandering through uninteresting storylines encumbered by numerous plot holes that are surpassed only by the sheer amount of absolutely stunning visuals that the producers were hoping would be enough to supersede the complete lack of cinematic substance.    One of these films will be remembered for all time.  The other would be forgotten weeks after its release.  One of these films made profitable gains after one week.  The other was a financial disaster.  One of them is preceded in its title by Star Wars.  And that’s the only real difference.,0
2450,"I'll start with what I liked. The battle scenes were great. Lots of action and explosions. The opening bombing scene was tense and attention-grabbing. Watching Rey and Kylo Ren fight all of Snoke's bodyguards was awesome. Yoda's short appearance was spectacular - was a fun reminder of Luke's original training with him. Other than that, the movie was underwhelming and disappointing. They tried WAY too hard to insert dumb humor all over the movie, and it fell flat. It wasn't funny. They were stupid one-liners that honestly made me cringe. I can honestly say that at least Episodes I-III retained the same type of Star Wars tone that the original trilogy had. ""The Last Jedi"" completely threw out all remnants of the tone and culture of the original Star Wars trilogy. I honestly couldn't take the movie seriously because of how much humor they tried to insert. The sequence of Rey following around Luke had to be one of the dumbest things I've ever watched. And Mark Hamill is correct, they ruined Luke's character, and then to ice the cake, they killed him. Luke's character was incredibly boring, apathetic, and hopeless. He comes back at the end and helps the rebels escape, but it doesn't redeem his character. One little scene at the end cannot redeem how poorly they portrayed his character throughout the entire movie. If that's how you're going to portray one of the greatest Jedi Masters of all time, then just stop making the movies, because you're wasting everyone's time. Questions that have been left unanswered that make this whole trilogy bad: Who is Snoke and how did he come to power? How did the First Order come to power after Return of the Jedi? Who is Rey? How did the Republic become so weak and defenseless even after defeating the Empire? How did Leia not die, and how do you force-propel yourself through space while unconscious? There are so many more questions I could pose that poke so many holes through the plot and writing of The Last Jedi. Overall, the movie completely lost touch with what Star Wars is all about - the tone, the writing, the culture, the storylines, the structure, etc. The Last Jedi did not feel like a Star Wars movie, which if it's not going to, then why put the name ""Star Wars"" on it? The humor was ill-timed and ill-advised. The film dragged out for way too long. There were pointless scene-sequences and pointless characters. Ok, there are my thoughts. Bad movie.",0
2451,"So incredibly disappointing.  The main plot was slow and boring, the side story felt pointless and childish.  It barely felt like a Star Wars movie.  It abandoned almost everything the first film started and made very little sense.  It did an awesome job at making the prequels look good.",0
2452,I don't know what to say.  Star Wars is dead.  I'll never look at it the same way again.  You've probably already heard about it so make your own conclusions.  For the first time since the 80s I can easily say that I have no interest in this franchise anymore.  Thanks Disney.,0
2453,"The Last Jedi is a disappointing film. The movie was still somewhat entertaining, carried by Adam Driver's incredible performance as Kylo Ren, but it left a lot to be desired. Plot holes, poor dialogue, incohesive story - this is a bad movie on a more fundamental level, in addition to being a huge disappointment as far as Star Wars fandom. It's almost as if The Force Awakens doesn't even exist - The Last Jedi did little to nothing to develop any of the new triology's characters. Some of the scenes (""Carrie Poppins"" floating through space) and dialogue exchanges (Rose to Finn after saving him) were more cringe-inducing than anything I saw in the prequels, which I didn't even think was possible. The bar for this movie was not that high, but unfortunately Rian Johnson and co did not meet it, and it's a damn shame.",0
2454,"the disrespect shown to the characters of luke and leia is unforgivable. turning poe into a hot-headed latino stereotype for the sake of white feminism, reducing rey to a pawn in facist crybaby kylo's story arc, and turning finn into the butt of many, many jokes are just more nails in the coffin of my now demolished interest in this trilogy.",0
2455,"It is a large, long winded mess of a movie. The story telling could have been more focused and most of the movie seems like sub plot after sub plot.

2457,"The story is boring, ridiculous, and cringeworthy. The characters are flat and totally undeveloped. Beloved characters from the old movies are destroyed (literally and/or figuratively). As a matter of fact, the whole beloved saga is being destroyed before our eyes. This movie has a political and social agenda that has nothing to do with Star Wars. If somebody wants to push some particular point of view, they can either make it extremely subtle (so as not to destroy the story), or make a documentary, or at least make a separate movie dedicated to those things. Star Wars should not be turned into a platform for that. I'm all for equality, tolerance, kindness, and so on, but there are other ways to express those views. They should focus on storytelling and character-building, and should hire some professional writers. For example, I wouldn't mind at all if they hire Timothy Zahn to write the scripts.",0

The casino scenes went on forever and were nothing but terrible CGI and awful writing.Why are people so impressed by the visuals? Some of the effects were really good but there was a lot of *really bad* CGI.The writing in this movie is horrible. I hope I will never see another movie by Rian Johnson. I now have zero respect for anything he does.I think this is the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I didn't think it was possible to be worse than 'Phantom Menace' or 'Attack of the Clones' but... Yes, if I were forced to pick one of the three to watch, it would never be this one.I'm not a fan-boy. Number of theories I had going into this movie: zero. Number of ""Star Wars"" books I have read: zero. My interest in the 'expanded universe': zero. All I wanted to see was a good movie.

Some do, too bad there isn't some kind of plot to hold them together.And by the way, did anyone bother to check Johnson's filmography PRIOR to making him direct a Star Wars movie?  Guess not, or someone would have realized that he mostly had directed cruds, so far (and TLJ is no different).Nothing in TLJ makes sense, character development goes out of the window in favour of nonsense that is convenient to the specific scene.Some scenes are plain ludicrous. Most scenes, in fact. And most have nothing to do with the storyline.

Seeing Chewbacca having some thought about becoming a vegan even if he is a 200 years old alien beast, should just convince you how much this movie is crap.Rey is useless, her story pointless. Same for Snoke, same for everything and everyone...I think that people putting good score on this movie are the same people that try to convince themselves that modern art is actually art... It's pathetic !This movie is pure sh*t, the actors don't even try to be credible because they know the plot of that new Disney trilogy don't make any sens. It just an bad attempt to make money on the nostalgia of people ! And the worst part is : it actually work. They earned a ton of money from that movie ! What a shame, what a f*cking shame.I will not go see the others movies, Star Wars is dead to me!

2466,"I have watched all of the Star Wars movies to date excluding any animated films. The Last Jedi was by far the worst I've seen. The movie seemingly drops many important plots from the Force Awakens and probably due to Rian Johnson's leadership as director. He cared more for practical effects than anything else and I felt that he focused far too much on those aspects rather than on the actual plot of the film.The immense confusion that came from this movie are listed:1. Rey suddenly knows how to use a lightsaber with great form.2. Snoke dies after not revealing much about his character.3. Learned more about how animals were being mistreated than we learned about Snoke in the    two films.4. Why hasn't anybody tried to use lightspeed to destroy things in the past. (Why didn't  the Rebels simply program on send an empty ship at lightspeed toward the Death Star???)5. How does Snoke not sense the force that Kylo is using to move the lightsaber???6. Captain Phasma ""dies"" in the worst way. (UNSURE)7. Luke DIES in the worst way. Doesn't even go out like a boss. Didn't really do much for    most of the movie except mope around and reject Rey.8. SNOKE DIES??!!9. Leia suddenly knows force powers???!!!!10. Rey lifts what I would describe as a SH#T TON of rocks. While Luke (ONE OF THE MOST    POWERFUL FORCE USERS OF ALL OF STAR WARS LORE) took seemingly weeks to train to lift a    rock.11. REY HAS VIRTUALLY NO TRAINING YET STILL KNOWS HOW TO USE THE FORCE AND WIELD A    LIGHTSABER LIKE A TRAINED JEDI!!!12. Rose Tico is quite possibly the worst character in Star Wars history as she stops Finn    from sacrificing himself to save THE WHOLE RESISTANCE.13. Anticlimactic meeting of Luke and Kylo14. LUKE DIES????!!!!15. Luke does an Astral Projection which essentially projects your body to wherever you    want it at the cost of your LIFE. WHY??? Luke ""saves"" the resistance.16. Why is Leia kept alive after the unfortunate passing of Carrie Fisher and Luke is    killed while Mark Hamill is still alive and well and very disappointed in the way Luke    was treated.I can't write anymore I feel this pretty much sums up The Last Jedi.“He’s not my Luke Skywalker"".",0
2467,"The only positive comment I can make on this movie is the cinematography is nice. But the story is terrible and boring, lots of dumb amateur character actions, the dialogue failed, and the forced humor cringe-worthy.

2468,"Hated it almost as much as Phantom Menace.  Loved Rogue One, Loved Force Awakens, Loved the Original Triology, hated all the prequels. And I hated The Last Jedi.

Out of place popular politics shoved down the throat(I watch movies to get to take a break/get away from this! lol),poorly timed humor, badly written jokes. The latest starwars movies seemed to missing some of the core philosophy's that built the series. Lastly the lack of story was very disconnected and poorly written.... Its the first star-wars movie I found boring and found myself praying for it to end.",0
2470,"I’m writing this because I was wasting time on the internet and ended up seeing some of the initial critics’ glowing reviews of The Last Jedi (It's an 85, ""must see"" here on metacritic). There are always differences of opinion depending on what you want out of a movie, but watching people write about how they convinced themselves this movie succeeded in any way has been outside the normal range. It’s a little bizarre honestly, and fairly excruciating to listen to the phrases being turned to try to explain how this film wasn’t a failure. It wasn’t even impressively bad, it’s just boring and mediocre and uncomfortable. Be honest people, this doesn’t “turn the franchise on its head” or any other stupid euphemism, it’s an insecure and cynical mess that confuses self-ridicule with innovation and tries to be non-formulaic by setting up suggestive premises and then going nowhere with them. It’s like the creators are constantly daring the audience to care about where things are going and seeing how many times they can make you think this movie will eventually go anywhere before you just give up and start zoning out on special FX. Even the parts that deserve some appreciation don’t work well. The sequence on the Las Vegas-style resort world, notwithstanding that it’s completely superfluous to the plot, points out that many people are profiting from the war by selling arms to both sides. I appreciate that the story went out of its way to make that point, but if you are going to use fantasy to provide insight into reality, don’t do it by trying to out-realize reality. If I want to see war profiteering, I’ll just watch the news. This would not have been a hard movie to get right, but instead of the characters evolving naturally they just get repeatedly slammed through these disjointed scenarios ostensibly written to convince you that this isn’t “the same old Star Wars”. I was not a big Force Awakens fan and I don’t want the same old Star Wars, but this movie feels like being in a room full of friends that have lost interest in each other and are killing time by self-consciously making fun of themselves for trying too hard. The prequel trilogy was amateurish, but at least it had a plot and believed in where it was going. This movie might be the biggest flop of the bunch. Hey, sometimes your college try just doesn’t land and you get a real stinker. Life goes on, just stop with this weird insistence that this movie somehow accomplished anything beyond set design.",0
2471,"This was supposed to be the film that propelled the saga forward into a new direction??? What was wrong with honoring the direction and legends it started?! All this movie does is crucify a heroic character we all loved from childhood, and then leaves us completely unsatisfied with Rey's storyline. Are we honestly expected to believe ""anyone"" can be a Jedi?? Disney needs to stop controlling this ship! It's not supposed to be part of the ""Disney Princess"" history. What a shambles!!",0

What was with the completely meaningless subplot with the useless Rose character?  Must have been some sort of agenda, anyway grats on ruining this one disney.",0
2477,"Pros:Only reason I scored this a 2 instead of a 0 is that I generally thought the acting, special effects, and music were good.That's basically it though.Cons:1. Finn was a main character in Force Awakens.  Instead if developing him, they make him play second fiddle to a new character, Rose Tico, who feels completely forced into the story.  Their adventure is a completely unnecessary deviation, and very cringe-worthy in terms of how poorly it was thought out.2. Rose Tico. I have nothing against this character at all.  In fact, she's a good character.  But she shouldn't have been in this movie. Introducing her and having her steal screentime from Finn and literally bully herself into the story was difficult to watch.  I would have loved seeing her in a movie where she was the main character, but apparently Disney is so pathetic they are incapable of making new stories in the Star Wars universe.3. Captain Phasma.  Probably the lamest villain ever created.  She got her butt kicked in Force Awakens, then is defeated easily again in this movie. We never see her win a battle.  Cool armor wasted.4. The Holdo/ Poe Dameron conflict.   Incredibly dumb.  Holdo, for no reason at all, refuses to share her plan with her scared, confused, desperate crew, resaulting in disaster.  Yet we are supposed to see her as a hero when ...5. Warpspeed kamikaze. Let's see how much lore we can ruin with this movie.  All those space battles you've been enjoying? They could have just warped at their enemies.  In fact, they could have done that right away in the movie.  Awful.6. Luke's death.  He astral projects himself.  Ok cool.  He made Kylo Ren look like a tool, which was great. Aaaaaaand he's dead. Wtf.  No reason for it.  I guess he over exerted himself so the rebels wouldn't have to break into a light jog while fleeing. I'd be fine with him dying, but that was just about the dumbest way to go about it ever thought up.7.  Bad writing everywhere.  #6 Luke gives a whole speech to Leia about how he can't spare Kylo right before fighting him, which DOES NOT MAKE SENSE considering it wasn't even a real fight.  Literally just an obvious mistake by the awful person in charge of this film.8. Rion Johnson.  I already didn't like his movies.  Looper was some of the poorest writing I'd ever seen.  Wasn't a surprise to me when he completely botched the story to try and focus on visuals, other things where he could say ""hey look at what a crafty director I am"" that made no sense in Star Wars.9. Disney. Shame on your company for doing this to Star Wars.  Shame on you for not coming up with original stories, and not caring about ruining classic characters.You'll notice I didn't mention anything such as ""SJWs"" or ""Superman Leia"" because honestly they were not problems.  The problems were awful writing and lack of care about Star Wars and the universe George Lucas created.",0
2478,"An utter abomination of a film. Were it not for the sumptuous visuals and breakneck pace, clubbing the audience with inconsequential setpiece after inconsequential setpiece, it would doubtless be regarded universally as the worst outing in the series. The director's intention to ""subvert expectations"" goes some way to explaining the inexplicable: the non-entity that was Snoke being killed for no clear reason in a manner hardly befitting a Sith whose power one would presume to be comparable to the Emperor; Luke Skywalker being, well...not Luke Skywalker; Rey taking the concept of ""Mary Sue"" to a level previously thought impossible; a pink-haired Feminist insert berating Po for his toxic masculinity while refusing to brief the crew on her plan because...reasons; Leia Superman-ing in space and continuing to live despite the actress having passed away during the film's production; and on and on it goes.In lieu of a several-thousand-word rant, I would point interested parties in the direction of the Plinkett review of The Last Jedi, which can be found on the ""Red Letter Media"" YouTube channel, as well as a similar video by a YouTuber named ""E;R"".",0

2482,"Overall I found it pretty boring. Lots of stories that were mostly pointless with only Rey and Kylo having anything worthwhile going on. Kylo was improved overall. The whole ship chase was incredibly dull. Cut out the Poe, Rose, and Finn stories and it would have been a better movie. Didn't see a reason to go killing the old guard off, was looking forward to seeing a re-energized Luke. R2 was there with Luke but used only for like 1 scene, there should have been a bit more emotion there but it fell pretty flat. Other than Rey and Kylo the new characters are not working for me at all.It also seems disney was really hoping those little bird things they made would do great as merchandise as they are everywhere(many on sale in stores), quite literally added to the film to be merchandise. Doing things like that seems pretty scummy to me.",0
2483,"beautiful movie, but a disappointing plot.the opening are great, but middle to end part is a mess.especially after rewatch force awaken and the trailer before watching the last Jedi.i'm casual fans from Indonesia.the rose character feel forced, they should give a better backstory and actress.",0
2484,"Here is my review and reasoning for my 1 star rating:I seriously can't believe that the question leading to the ST was ""Who is Luke Skywalker"" and professional people and self professed Star Wars fans came up with this mess. They took the greatest hero in cinematic history and turned him into a complete failure that gets schooled in the Force by some random junkbaby. Rose says before we even meet Luke that heroes don’t run. Yet that is exactly what they had Luke do for years. Rey is also ruined for me as a character as of TLJ. Tell us she is junkbaby from the beginning. No need for secrecy. Her perfect mary sue-esque routine was slightly annoying in TFA, but I thought that she would be brought down in TLJ like Luke was in TESB or Anakin was in AotC, but instead they make her even more perfect with no failures and able to do everything. She is without a doubt what people feared she was - a MARY SUE. She will have ZERO failures in the ST while they completely destroyed the OT3. Clearly this was a direction from Disney and KK to kill GL's work. White slavers indeed.I didn’t mind the new characters or the idea of Canto Bight. Some of the sequences there dragged out longer than needed. Mark was outstanding for his work with what he was given, particularly since we know he didn’t agree with it. The OP Force use seemed more like a video game or cartoon than Saga rules. Hux and the FO as comic relief made this seem like Space Balls II more than Star Wars VIII. Poe’s prank call drew groans. Not good for an opening sequence. The chase idea was poorly executed. We’ve never seen fuel being an issue before on one ship, let alone a whole fleet. Also, they could have jumped to different locations and split up. This chase idea works great in a WWII sub chase movie, but this is Star Wars and the FO could have just jumped a destroyer or two in front of the limping rebel ships and pinned them in. The crawl seemed to make it clear the FO instantaneously took control of the galaxy, yet it is said in the movie that it will take weeks to take control of the central/important systems. Milking the monster was not needed and got universal groans in the theater, as did Leia flying. People laughed at Leia. The SFX looked off at times. Ships, particularly X-Wings, don’t move like that in the Star Wars universe. Yoda looked ridiculous and people actually laughed at it. The lightsaber effects were off as well. Fan films have better SFX than these and LFL did well in Rogue One so there is no excuse. The Holdo maneuver was executed really well though. I thought it was a nice place for the sound to drop. The whole Poe-tiny seemed out of place. Luke’s flashback costume looked like a RotJ version in TFA/TLJ color scheme. It looked awesome and I hope they make that Sideshow figure. Speaking of the flashback, you have to be kidding me. From Luke lying about it to Ben’s version to how it actually played out to Ben still looking like he’s 30 years old, all of it was horrible. Snoke was a complete waste. So many threads dropped. They also could have used Lando in either Maz’s role or as the target at the casino. I get what they were doing with the stable kids telling Luke’s last stand, but continuing past that and using the stable boy as the end fell flat. If they would have cut from the kids retelling the story to the rebels meeting up with ships answering the call and assembling a new fleet, it would have shown Luke as a legend and that the spark worked. It would have really given hope. It would have also ended on a more Star Wars style ending. A huge complaint is that the movie breaks the established visual language established for the Saga films. Not a problem in anthology films, but it is jarring in the context of the Saga. It was the first Star Wars film that I have seen with people booing as it irised out.I know that it doesn't matter, but I will never watch another Star Wars movie or series or buy any other non-Luke merchandise. My collecting that started when I was a kid around 1980 is now over. Congratulations BI/KK/JJ/LK/RJ, you killed my lifelong fandom/desire for new Star Wars content. We will never buy another Disney product, support Disney movies (except for maybe Captain America), or go to any parks again. I will never watch another movie produced, written, or directed by any of the above individuals.I wish them the same level of success they afforded the OT3. For what they did to Lucas' vision, I simply hope that what goes around comes around.#NotMyLukeSkywalker",0
2485,This is the second worst star wars movie. Only jar jar could have made it worse.,0
2486,"This movie was a breach of trust. JJ Abrams should reboot this entirely, especially the apparent resolution of Luke Skywalker's story. Sure the film was visually well made, and the Rey and Kylo Ren characters are well done and well performed. But three smart writers brainstorming in a room for one day could have written a far more compelling story (even an edgier one, if that was the aim) that did not stamp on the very heart of Luke Skywalker as well as break sharply from the nice new base created by The Force Awakens. It's trendy to eliminate heroes ever since Game of Thrones broke ground with Ned Stark, though it's getting tiresome and here it was negligent. Smart writers can pass the torch to a new generation of characters without destroying the foundation. If you're aiming to have big exits for time-honored characters, at least pen their tales in a way that doesn't rewrite personalities that were steadily built decades ago over a brilliant story arc that far surpasses anything in this film. This franchise and its key characters (especially Luke) deserve much more. It's no surprise there's a movement to demand JJ Abrams do a re-boot. Can we just pretend this was a bad dream? With all the creative Force in film, it's disheartening to think that this is the best that could be developed for this treasured franchise. Yes it will make money and yes it was optically stunning a few times--but so was The English Patient. Just looking cool (or sounding cool, in some scenes here) is not enough. ""All that glitters is not gold."" The studio should have demanded more creativity and prohibited character assassination. A half dozen fan boys on Reddit wrote far better story lines than we received here. Help us JJ Abrams, you're our only hope.",0
2487,"This is a terrible movie from any perspective and a farce of a Star Wars movie.  The director jettisoned everything JJ had built up, destroyed the legacy characters, added numerous new superfluous characters, failed to resolve/truncated several key plot lines without any satisfactory resolution.  Luke, Snoke, Phasma, Rey’s parentage all wasted.  The casino and code breaker thread was a silly waste of screen time.  Leia’s Superman routine... The chase/fuel plot was contrived and just plain dumb.  This was bad storing and bad choices.  Add in a very heavy handed socio-political slant with numerous brand new strong/flawless female leads interjected into an already crowded cast while simultaneously and turning Poe into an unlikable moron and you get a movie with an agenda.  Laura Dern was very good though.  Rose was painful to watch and the forced relationship with Finn was worthy of a groan and eye-roll.   My enthusiasm for the series is gone.  Hopefully JJ will be able to salvage the trilogy.",0

2493,"This movie has some good moments: the lightspeed destruction of a starcruiser, the throne room fight scene and Adam Driver's performence as Kylo Ren. Mark Hamill got his acting on point. With that being said, poor choices made the rest of the movie unwatchable. The pacing was out of control. Rey is apperantly already a jedi master, because she can defeat any obstacle: in TFA she beats Kylo Ren while she didn't have ANY training, she is one of the strongest force users luke has seen, she defeats luke in a fight, she defeats all the guards in the throne room and lifts tons of rocks easily for the first time. Rian Johnson made Rey a powerhouse, while she should have been a jedi rookie, a student. The story writing was bad: luke was way less powerfull than he should have been, snoke was killed while he was the most hyped chracter and we had zero backstory on who snoke was and what the knights of Ren are. Jokes killed almost every tense scene, with forced slapstick humor. Plotholes are everywhere, although these aren't the reason it made the movie bad. Rose and Finn story should have been cut and Finn should have been able to sacrifice himself but Rian ruined it by taking away Finn biggest moment that could have made him a hero. So they kill snoke, but let Finn live. Bad, bad choice. Good reviews talk about the ""surprise factor"", but a sudden plot twist does NOT make a movie good if it is not done correctly. Disney should've let multiple directors sit at a table and and let them create a good story for all sequels, so it doesn't feel the direction of the movie goes everywhere but a logical line.

2497,"This movie was a big disappointment. I went into this thinking it would be one of the best 'Star Wars' movies. I was wrong. This is the worst 'Star Wars' film that has ever landed in theatres. Let's begin with the positives: (The list is short.) The soundtrack is phenomenal and sounds like a Star Wars film should. The special effects also look amazing. That's where the positives end.  Let's start with the negatives: The Characters. These characters are horrible in every way. Rey, (The main hero) could not be more Mary Sue. She bests Luke Skywalker, the son to the most powerful man in existence (Anakin), and who has gone through so much training, after using the force for a week. WHAT? Last week she didn't even believe in the force! Rose Tico is a useless character. If she was taken out it would really not change a thing. Except make the movie better. Luke Skywalker is one of my favorite characters of all time, and he just sucks in this movie. He hates the jedi and almost killed a kid, is the literal opposite of the Luke we know and love. Some people say this ""subverts our expectations."" No, it is stupid. Luke went through three whole movies to become a jedi knight, to stay calm at all times and to always have hope. But he just throws his lightsaber off a cliff and forgets all of his training. Leia Poppins is stupid and messes with the lore of Star Wars. Enough said.Admiral Holdo is a quote-unquote ""EMPOWERED WOMAN"" who can't tell anyone her plan because...? The movie is filled with bad jokes and pushes a political agenda that nobody wants to see because of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. Please fire these blokes and hire someone that actually cares about Star Wars.",0

2502,We all know this movie is crap and ruined the series forever. There's nothing else to say about it.,0
2503,This movie and the Force Awakened (basically anything made by Disney) is utter trash. Movie also contradicts basic Star Wars rules and is social justice warrior crap fiesta.,0
2504,"The effects were pretty good. I will give them that. Visually the movie was pretty stunning.But the rest of it from the characters, the way Luke was treated, and just throwing out everything established so Rian Johnson can pat himself on the back for ""subverting everyone's expectations"" was terrible.So I give it a 1 because of the effects.",0

Anyways.Among the military commanders waiting to lose 90% of the troops until the great idea comes (suicide teleport? better watch the ram into Scimitar from Star Trek:Nemesis), cute animals inserted into pointless space chase, and politically correct division (one girl, one African-American, one Asian, all-female ship commanders yelling ""yo pitiful male"" to the only military (Poe) able to do or at least try something, and two mandatory white evil guys - too bad the older characters are already whites, so nothing to do about this...), what else remains? (Sorry, I forgot about the casino gratuitous scene and the space cow milk - wat?).If the future is based on a former storm trooper (wonderful idea to cast John Boyega into a Waffen-SS of the future role, perfect fit, that is) that looks high-school confused all the time, a mechanic turned navigateur and second-hero-in-command, grumpy old Jedi's and stupid villains, then no thanks. I'd rather watch Cylons battling real military humans in Battlestar: Galactica - at least there is sense, seriousness and logic (at least sometimes).Is not even abysmal. It's Disney making a movie for kids and/or mentally challenged, not sure if is a some sort of Madagascar 3 in space or so. And the future of the francise is bleak. I don't see A New Hope.",0

2508,"This was a poorly directed and written film. I say this not because I was upset with any huge twist in the plot (there isn't one). I say this because the film basically crammed in too many side plots and unnecessary sequences so that the actual story arcs are too shallow and predictable. There is little suspense. I never felt like the characters were in any real danger. And when one character that I did care for seemed to be gone forever, it was brought back within a few minutes. The only mildly interesting scenes were the ones with Luke Skywalker. The film does answer our questions about what happened between Luke and Kylo Ren. But the film doesn't really provide any deeper insight into our characters. Who is Snoke? Where did he come from? Why is he Supreme Ruler? How did he begin to seduce Ben Solo to the dark side? How in the heck does the New Order have so much resources after the Empire was defeated? Why does the New Order want to bring the end to the Republic? Why is the Republic so weak even after destroying the Star Killer or whatever it's called? Why is Rey so invested in the Force and her destiny? Why does Kylo Ren want to be the next Vader?None of these questions are answered, and they probably never will. Instead we are just taken on a roller coaster of side sequences around the Luke-Rey-Kylo plot that are repetitive and do not invest our emotions. Most of these sequences are just dumb and without consequence. They are just meant to carry the film because the actual parts you care about are maybe 20 minutes of the movie.This was a wasted opportunity. Let there be no mistake. This is not our generation's Empire Strikes Back. Not even close. This is a Marvel superhero movie dressed up as a Star Wars flick. Tons of dumb headache-inducing sequences with a thin plot and new characters without any depth. This film will not stand the test of time by any measure.",0
2509,"1 from a SW fan5 from a non-SW fansince its SW movie I go with first- Filled with pathos, every single time when something real started, some stupid pathos or joke ruined it. I laughted only one time. Well lets summarize it:- Trying to be different, new and not to copy previous episodes doesn't mean that You put in so much nonsence which doesn't feel natural. Leia throwed to the space, ruined with superman power and then colapses. What the hell was that? I mean sure, bring something new, but small portions with some developments in the SW world, don't throw sudden force gains and new powers which are just not feeling true to audience.- Building up nice villain Snoke and then screwing it totaly up (like why Rey even went there? why Snoke even care to talk to her if he would want to kill her)...I mean yeah, if You want to make it as an illusion of Snokes death, that could only make some sence. But these illusional projections and plot twists are just not working in this movie. - Rose and Finn absolutely useless characters, nothing is working here...even waste of my time to say more about why .)) - Poe nice entry, useless mid and end time- General Hux, his essence from EP7 was ruined, an Imperial Jar Jar Binks now....WE DONT NEED TO LAUGHT TO STUPID JOKES, we would like to have some strong dark characters!!!!!!!!!!- Captain Phasma failed again, total waste of screen time, I mean if You want to insta kill all interesting characters from the negative side, I am not buying it. You are making a movie for 10y old kids, not fans.- Kylo Ren, I had problem with Kylo in EP7, but this time...its worse. I understand that he might be divided or even just playing out divided character, but ....so much nonsence in his behaviour...its really too much to absorb.- Luke. Forget it. In this movie there is no Luke Skywalker. This character is just some pathetic attempt to get Mark out from next movies. I don't know if Director of Disney are behind it, but its over. This is one of the major fails of the movie.BAD WRITING, USELESS SCENES (Casino line), UNLOGICAL moments (which are even for SW too much).NO, THIS is NOT a SW Movie. This is an error. R.Johnson is nice guy, but please don't touch SW again please. I am done. I can't say more.....what a disaster.",0
2510,Not going to go into the spoilers too hard but still tagging.I honestly believe this movie is one of the worst in the entire series.  I'm not big into the expanded universe nor do I care for the integrity of the lore but for **** sake how do you take potential plot elements from the first movie and completely toss them out the window.  Ya that Snoke guy who cares about him.  Rey's Parent's nah **** not interesting or important.  What you really want is a bitter old Luke trying to seclude himself while also succumbing to half assed jokes.  It's gotta be the blue bird/seal milk thats made him so demented.  Maybe all the Porg meat he has been eating.What really did it in for me wasn't the peppered in jokes that fell flat on their faces during serious moments.  It was the numerous sub plots set up only for NONE of it to matter.  The only character that got any growth was Poe and that can be argued if it was genuine or not.I think this movie can best be summarized as jumping off a cliff and not hitting the bottom.  There is still time to pull the chute and save the Trilogy but the speed in which they have accelerated to the bottom leaves little room left to pull the cord.  I can only hope Episode IX realizes its failures and really pulls something out of it's ass to close alot of these plot holes with something other than another Death Star.,0
2511,"I can't even call this a star wars movie, just like Mark Hamill said, Disney doesn't care if it's good, it's there to bring money. The movie lacks any continuation to the previous one whatsoever, has more plot holes than a good yellow cheese, made by SJW's for SJWs. Everyone normal should stay away.",0
2512,"I wish I could unwatch the movie.  The story and writing was abysmal, though the action and cinematography was good.  The way this movie made Luke act and do things that he would never made it not feel like Star Wars to me.  The way Snoke went out like a punk with no backstory was terrible was well.  Too much forced humor that felt out of place.  New characters are all bland and boring except for Kylo.  When I was leaving the theater I realized I have no interest in what happens in this story next.  This will be the last Star Wars movie by Disney I watch.  Star Wars ended in 1983.",0
2513,"Terrible writing, bad character development, thrown together with what seems no thought was put into it, and an insult to the Star Wars universe. I'm not sure how this movie ever made it through production. If it were a stand alone movie then it might stand on its own but being the 8th in the series with no real connections and writing that just spits in the face of fans.",0
2514,Ive never been so incredibly disappointed by a movie. Honestly it seems like Disney is just trying to make money off of the franchise and doesn't care what people actually think of it. I would have been much happier if they hadn't continued the franchise any further. At this point it feels like Disney has tarnished the entire star wars universe with this garbage.,0
2515,"For many people Star Wars opens a door to a world of escapism, full of dynamic action, loveable characters and great settings. But at it's core many will tell you that Star Wars is more than that. The movies incorporate important morales while using a refined and effective structure to its story, which is often a high point of the performance. But sadly The Last Jedi touches upon so little of the above while continuously tripping and falling over the tripwires of its own faults. The movies Plot can easily be summed up in a few sentences, this might appeal to some people but for years it seemed Star Wars tried to tell a compelling story whether it was complicated or not. But there are too many head scratching moments in the film on top of a basic and uninteresting story. There also includes a side plot involving Finn and newcomer Rose, but this side plot is ultimately pointless and changes very little. The plot also highlights what would seem to be a disregard Rian Johnson has for the Force Awakens. For example it is made clear in Force Awakens that Luke Skywalker left a map to his location so that he may be acquired in times of need, yet in The Last Jedi he has bitter opinions on fighting with the resistance. Rian Johnson also seems to disregard the many triumphs of JJ Abrahams in Force Awakens. Supreme Emperor Snoke was built up to be an intimidating and mysterious villain but Johnson allows him to die pathetically with the audience knowing nothing of his past. But one thing the plot does excellently is build the relationship between Rey and Ben, by having them connect by the force and share dialogue they can better sort out their differences and find answers for questions. This means they can build their relationship together before confronting one another on the battlefield.  But to put it lightly The Last Jedi has an unstructured, unfaithful, simplistic story with confusing elements. One area that it is difficult to critique is the action, so allow me to praise it. The Last Jedi is at it's best when resistance pilots are gracefully wrecking havoc on First Order ships or when infantry are dodging the blasts of the towering Imperial Walkers. All of this is set against a triumphant soundtrack which suits the Movie oh so well. There are also a great many light sabre battles that are carried out with such fluid movements, energy and suspense that I have only appreciation for the Movie's cast. As is typical with any Star Wars the GCI is a sight to be held with the Action taking advantage of the valuable resource provided by such a talented team. Lastly I would like to touch upon what many would consider the most controversial subject of the Last Jedi, that being the Character of Luke Skywalker. In previous Movie's Luke is a symbol for optimism, kindness, hope and confidence. One of his most compelling moments involved a life risking mission to the emperors doorstep because Luke was convinced he could change his Darth Vader's ways, he believed in the good nature of one of Cinema's most infamous bad guys. He was successful and thus proved the message of the franchise, that being that People can change. Now Rian Johnson has completely gone against that. In the Movie Luke is a typical grouchy, unpleasant and cynical old man for about two thirds of the film. His death in the film is also somewhat anti climactic. So side with Mark Hamill on the basis of Luke's character and ""I fundamentally disagree""This review does not at all affect any opinion that you might have of The Last Jedi and you can still enjoy more than I did, it is just my belief that a franchise so groundbreaking and so fascinating needs to be handled with delicate care and consideration towards future instalments. This is something that Rian Johnson did not deliver on in my opinion.",0
2516,"Corporate movie with a pointless plot, character developement is very minimal and the pacing and timing of poorly place humor allows for little tension during the film. essentially its a summer block buster transformers movie in the star wars universe. And of course the complete disregard for the previous movies setup and premise... its a series of very long slow boring car chase sequences, with some other plot lines that are ultimately pointless, and the message is no one is a hero, there is no point.",0
2517,"I have no idea how half of this world can give this movie more than 1 point. This is by far the worst star wars movie i've ever seen. I'm a big fan of the saga and i was left literally heartbroken. During the movie i buried my face in popcorns twice out of shame.Ok, let's say just a couple of things about tlj. Are you a fan of the saga? If the answer is yes, this movie will **** all over everything you have ever loved about star wars. They took everything that was meaningful in the star wars universe and twisted it, changed it, made it into a pathetic pre made cartouche of banalized philosophical little thoughts for masses. This one was the first issue for me, but let's put that one aside for a moment and let's try to be as objective as we can.Let's say i've never seen a star wars movie. The film opens with one of the worst exchange of jokes i can remember of. Throught the movie, the humor stands on the same level, and sometimes it get even worse. The screenwriter must have been drunk.The plot is so messy and makes little to no sense. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the movie is too complex for an average person to understand what's happening, as in the case of movies like Naked Lunch. It's simply a collage of incompatible subplots which scatter the movie focus all over the place. The banality of these subplots is sometimes so blatant that i could have closed my eyes and imagined a better story with thomas the tank engine as rey, spongebob as finn and a rock as rose.You know what? I could honestly keep going for half an hour, but i would be wasting time. The reasons why this movie is a terrible pile of crap is so obvious that its score should be already underground if not in the reign of the negative dimension. The fact that it isn't means that there is no point in staying here and discussing why it was bad. I mean, it's like asking yourself ""would Hitler be a good president for the United States?"". Why would you even need to do that? The answer is CLEAR AS PURE WATER. Critic score for this movie made me question the true nature of reality. I live in an illusion and i'm the only one seeing that. May the force be with me, and may star wars be as far as possible from me. ""I don't know who the producers at disney are, but now i'm sure they're the true bad guys of the serie""",0
2518,"By far the worst Star Wars movie.Story was absolutely terrible, new characters were mostly useless, a completely unnecessary, anti-capitalist, subplot, forced romance between characters that make anakin and padme look good, good characters being absolutely ruined.Good effects though.",0
2519,"The Last Jedi has a lot of shortcomings. It totally screws up two character transformation arcs (Finn's and Ren's), doesn't follow up on J.J. Abrams ideas from Force Awakens, has a lot of unnecessary humor, overflows with inconsistencies with itself and other Star Wars movies, reduces Finn to a comic-relief PoC token character with a token partner. A the same time, any good ideas introduced in TLJ feel like the director lacked guts to really deliver a bold vision; instead, he offered a shy, weak compromise.",0
2520,"I'm giving this a 1 only due to the special effects. That's literally the only thing this movie had going for it. The script was awful, the characters had no progression, Luke would never act that way (even mark hamill did not like the script). I did my best to filter out all the disney propaganda pushed into this film (it is the MOST preachy star wars film to date), even then there was nothing there. Who is Rey? Nobody. Who is The Great Leader Snork? Who knows. Do bombs fall in space? Yes. At least Luke got to drink himself some green space walrus **** milk. That's what we've waited 40 years for, a crazy hobo Luke who failed to accomplish anything who dies from a force stroke.. or constipation.. or whatever tf happened at the end. Maybe if Mark Hamill in real life was a minority they would have let him be less of a loser. 90+% on rotten tomato, yeah we should all know whats rotten about that site. These critics are bought and paid for. I'm sure they'll delete half of these reviews claiming that it's all bots by the 'evil alt right'... full of **** Everyone I've talked to, all the youtube reviews i watched, at least 90% felt it was meh to total crap. They killed star wars (again) with this turd, the director should never be hired again. In fact i'm going to go out of my way to NEVER watch another film by that prick. I hope they dont screw up their comic franchises next or I'll be about done with disney. What a mess.",0
2521,"I remember watching my first star wars Movie at the cinema with my father in the earlier 80’s it wars the Return of the Jedi and, as you may supose i was al pumped up with Luke and all his poise, confidence and power.

2527,"Watched the movie just yesterdayIt was so ""meh"" that I will not give my money to this s**t next time.Seems like nobody in the team watched a Star War before.Space-jesus-leia-poppins is awful, not for the choice to make her use ""the force"" but because the scene is laughable.I really think that they are killing Star Wars to keep doing only fanservice and selling action figures.If you think at ""cinema"" as a form of art, entertainment or story telling, just stay away from this.",0
2528,"Sections of the press would seem to believe that I am incapable of forming a coherent opinion about why this film is bad without frothing at the mouth and failing my arms in some sort of uncouth misogynistic rage so lets have a go shall we.The film is composed rather unconventionally of a 1st half followed by a 3rd act. Suspension of disbelief is obliterated in the fist 10 minutes before the typical narrative structure gives way to several barely coherent threads that eventually result in everyone turning up at the same place, at the same time, but are otherwise entirely unrelated.Luke doesn't seem to know what his own motivations are, nor Ray her reason for seeking him out other that he is apparently space Jesus. The ticking clock set up to give other characters a sense of urgency is so woefully contrived it has you wondering how the first order could conquer their way out of a wet paper bag. Vice-admiral ""I'm in charge here boys"" was played as a super **** for the sole purpose of the ""but she was right all along"" moment, except she wasn't, and could have eliminated a full 1/3rd of the movie by taking 20 seconds out her time to explain her plan to the one senior staff member who bothered to ask.The film is plagued throughout with people just kinda showing up where they're needed. The sort of things that niggle at you ""how did he get back on the ship"" etc, and could easily have been cleared up with 5 seconds of footage but nay that was too much like coherent story telling. The disparate threads that make up the bulk of the movie veer from being far too vague and hand-wavy to being overly specific and come off as badly written fan fiction. The author only seeing fit to focus on the bits that interest them personally and glossing over the bulk of the actual story telling.The third and only act is a great visual spectacle, with genuinely high stakes, although the whole setting it up as Hoth 2.0 and then lampshading the same just came off as trying too hard.The only saving grace is that Kylo ""petulant emo kid"" Ren is by far the most complex and interesting character the series has seen for a long time, and is for me at least now the main box-office draw. Also the visuals, which are exactly as flashy and expensive as you expect them to be.",0
2529,"This review has been shortened for the character limit. You can find the full review at my blog (Fluctuating Thoughts on Films)If you know me in person, you’ll know that I enjoy Star Wars. It’s because of this that I was rather nervous for the upcoming (and since arrived) Star Wars movie. The Force Awakens had left a poor taste in my mouth, and nothing else Disney had done with the property was giving me confidence. That isn’t to say I didn’t want it to be good; I wanted it to be great. In case the past tense didn’t give it away, this wasn’t the case after viewing the movie.Following the iconic, almost ‘jumpscare’-like introduction and credits, I found myself nervous. I found myself laughing at weak performances from various Extras. This opening action sequence also highlights a primary issue with the movie: There is very little to be invested in. Aside from the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia Organa, and Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron, all characters are strangers.This time around, I found John Boyega’s portrayal of Finn to be far less grating. The acting was toned down a little, and he became far more bearable. Of the returning characters (besides Carrie Fisher) I found him to be the most improved. That’s unfortunate, as his entire subplot could be deleted from the film. Finn and Rose are on a mission to find somebody capable of disabling Snoke’s (Andy Serkis) ship. In the end, however, they fail. Instead, Admiral Holdo (portrayed by Laura Dern) sacrifices herself while going into hyperspace, aimed directly at the aforementioned ship. Star Wars as a franchise is no stranger to humour, but yet again, they overdid it. It seems as though Disney is imposing a joke-per-minute rule. If it isn’t up to par, it won’t be made. It happened in the MCU, and it’s happening here. I can’t take scenes seriously when the characters themselves don’t seem to, and that really hurts the film in the long run. The writing of this film was, quite honestly, abysmal.There was many baffling lines from the film, though one of my favourites was “You murderous snake!” howled by a furious Daisy Ridley. I don’t feel her acting has improved from the last film, which is an enormous shame. She continues to overact, shouting almost every line in which she is impassioned.The poor script, coupled with weak performances from actors, made this film feel closer to a fan project than an official movie.One actor who didn’t seem to falter, much to my relief, was Mark Hamill. Though at times I felt he struggled with the poor script he’d been given, he was relatively consistent throughout. Luke’s character had the most depth portrayed on screen, only rivalled perhaps by Kylo Ren. Adam Driver brought a believable sense of vulnerability to the failed Jedi.Speaking of Snoke, he was one of the weakest elements of the movie by far. That isn’t to knock Andy Serkis’s work. The voice is fantastic as always, but the character was almost entirely pointless. He gets killed in what feels like the end of the second act. It isn’t a dignified death, either. The film seemed rather confused about it’s rating. There was full on decapitation during a fight in what I assume is a kid's film. I’m certainly not complaining; if anything, i’d like more amputation and the like. It just seemed odd how literally thousands of people died during this film, and we’re never given a moment to dwell on that.The pacing throughout the film is non-stop. You never get time to appreciate John Williams’ score, or enjoy the cinematography, or anything. There’s always something happening. In a shorter movie, that could be fine. When you have a 155 minute running time, however, you can notice a problem. It might have simply been because I was taking notes, but by the end of the film I was exhausted. Finally, I shall quickly talk about the settings. There’s bland spaceships as expected. Luke’s island has some natives. The Porgs, and some odd maid-like beings. They seemed to live to uphold the temple. Finn and Rose also go to a casino, but it’s terribly boring. Apart from the various aliens, it looked like a building from Earth. Snoke’s ship seemed rather odd. There was a pure red background, causing each character to seem terribly out of place. Whether it was a greenscreen or not, I don’t know, but I am quite sure it was a terrible design choice. Finally, there was the planet of Crait. While, for the most part, it was a barren wasteland, it had a few shining features. One were the rather adorable crystal foxes which actually served a plot purpose, unlike the Porgs. Second, the decision to have the surface of the planet be white salt, with red earth beneath it, led to some fantastic visuals.To close, I feel the film, though showing potential, fell short of it’s mark. If you liked TFA, I'd check it out. If not, I’d suggest saving your money, or wait until it’s on DVD.",0
2530,"My intellect felt molested. Unfortunately, it cannot be unseen. This movie is the perfect analogy of Gold wrapped ****  I left the theater confused and almost felt guilty for not liking it. It took me a day to process, weighing the facts, trying to make sense of this experience.  I am an easy going type of guy, I can appreciate the simple things, I don't care if it's from Disney, who's the producer, I sure expected this movie to be on part with the Franchise but trust me it's not. At this point I don't understand the critics, it's all very fishy, to say the least.  Anyways, it's so bad I cannot imagine how on earth they were not aware it would not receive this kind of review from the public. Even Mark Hamil thought so.  So what is the point, is Disney that retarded? Are we?  And what is next?  Can we please have JJ Abram back or Christopher Nolan.  I am going to give this movie 1/10 point for Luke drinking unpasteurized green space cow milk, jeez it was awful.",0
2531,"I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life. I eat drink sleep Star Wars. I own every Star Wars film up to this point. This movie has no place in the Saga and will most certainly not be added to my collection. This movie at its core is poorly written! This is a complete insult to Star Wars fans and the mythos. This film opened up major plot holes in every film with disrespectful continuity mistakes. Character development was horrendous. This was a divisive film, an absolute insult to the Star Wars lore. If this movie was a stand alone film it would still be horrible. There is just bad inconsistent writing everywhere. Major plot points are entirely irrational. I no longer care about this new trilogy and could care less what happens in 9. They don’t follow any of the plot points in 7. Absolute garbage, makes the Phantom Menace look like a masterpiece. The shroud of Disney has fallen, dead Star Wars is...",0

I'm not one of those hypersensitive starwars-fanboys, im just a regular guy who wanted to see a cool science fiction adventure...but aaarggh this was terrible. Like, i didnt gave a **** about any of the characters. In some cases (Finn) it wouldve even been better if they had died. Furthermore the characters i actually gave a **** about were totally ruined and didnt even act like themselves.The entire story of this movie seems to have no point at all, it feels like one of those anime filler episodes where theyre just running down a hallway for 20 minutes.Even though a friend invited me to see this movie, i felt like Disney owes me 13 bucks.Oh and by the way, Rian Johnson? Who had the Idea to hire that guy? I looked him up, and it seems like the only notable things this guy directed were two Breaking Bad episodes and ""Looper"". Looper was really cool, but how can you think that the guy who directed Looper would be good to direct StarWars?To sum up: Star Wars TLJ is just another ****ty sequel, and is not worth to watch.",0

2534,"(Contains SPOILER) We watched The Last Jedi, as a group of 6 friends and 3 out of 6 loathed after seeing it. I am one of the loathers. One friend, who was not a SW fan liked it, found it visually entertaining without caring who Luke is or remembering any other SW movies. It was the worst Star Wars movie for 3 of us, 2 of us didn't like the most parts but enjoyed some moments. We went to see TLJ, 5 adults and one kid, our ages between 12 to 55. Our little one, 12 years was extramly heartbroken, so upset with Luke's approach to his nephew and found him creepy sneaking on Ben Solo while he is sleeping. Luke's approach was a Sith way, reminded us Palpatine telling Anakin that one apprentice killed his master in his sleep (Palpatine himself), also like Anakin in RoTS, episode III, killing younglings. Luke had anger in him but he was nothing like Anakin/Vader or Palpatine, that's why we loved him, he was all about Love & Hope. Luke sensed the light in his father Vader and challenged him to turn to the light side almost sacrificed himself while doing so. Luke would not think of ending his nephew's life because he has turned dark, especially while he is sleeping, without giving him a Jedi talk.He has an experience turning Vader to light side, he wouldn't run away and disappear like a coward? Plus, Jedis don't give up! He faced his father when he was young, why would older and wiser Luke would give up on his nephew.Luke's character was way off, badly written for a cheap twist. Rian Johnson turned Luke a marvel or DC character, hero turned bad, a cliche. The whole TLJ script and story was poorly written. A lot of ideas were from earth, dropping bombs like there is a gravity in space, whole casino scene, weird creatures horse race, frog face temple nuns (Why would there be Jedi Temple caretaker/nuns in space, and also wearing headscarves, LOL), Holdo says Godspeed, just like earthlings, Luke fishing and drinking green milk (ohh how creative, milk is green, radioactive, icky), Rey and Kylo's FaceTime / Skype Chat (Snoke Chat) and etc. Seeing Leia flying like Marry Poppins/Superman was weird, it didn't feel right. Poe talking about General Hux's mother was so low, in fact the whole dialogue between Poe and Hux was dumb and waste. Luke's intergalactic force projection reminded us Han Solo & Finn's dialogue in TFA, ""That's not how the Force works"".The Last Jedi was complete let down, it wasn't like watching a Star Wars movie in a space, it was like watching a SW parody movie, The Spaceballs.",0
2535,"This is my first metacritic post.  I am not a troll.  The Last Jedi simply failed to deliver on all the interesting cliff hangers from The Force Awakens.  Make a list of the most interesting foreshadowing from TFA, the answers don't come in TLJ.   I am a lifelong Star Wars fan and this movie has seriously wounded my Star Wars love.  I feel near heartbroken.  This movie feels like a quality mix of Transformers and Marvel.  It is absolutely not Star Wars.  Where Episodes 1-3 had serious acting issues, the acting is good in episodes 7-8.  It is just the plot.  It is crap and, worst of all, the movie creators failed to deliver on their own plot developments.  The high reviews from critics is confusing.  The social issues touched in this movie are B-grade at best and soooo out of place here.  There is a reason so many people don't like this movie.  If you follow star wars you will be disappointed in this film.  Bet on it.",0
2536,"With the release of episode 7, I was front in line to at the premiere. Although thrilled to see a SW movie I was disappointed in what it turned out to be.... My enthusiasm had wained. Needless to say that I was not at the premiere of the Last Jedi. There were little to no issues I was looking forward to seeing in this episode. Also I did not feel/have a connection with the main protagonists. Having now seen the Last Jedi I am at a total loss of where this trilogy is going. The storyline was poor and at times totally illogical ... certain subplots were ridiculous and proved to be totally superfluous for the storyline and could have been left out. Episode 8 did not follow thru on the many questions left to be answered from season 7. The the Last Jedi was a lot of unexplained 'hocus pocus' to me and sometimes a 'mumbo jumbo'. I would say this movie is more of a Disney fantasy film than it is a Star wars movie. I still have no connection to the main actors and am not looking forward to episode 9. I have been a fan of Star Wars since it's first release ... I was then 17. Much to my regret I will be stepping of the wagon here.",0
2537,"This movie gets a 3 mostly for the visuals. The story is garbage fan-fiction. The writing is simply bad and cringe-worthy especially the dialogue.  There are just simply too many WTF moments. I am not a die-hard Star Wars fan but what they did with this is just wrong. I gave them the benefit of the doubt after disliking EP 7 The Force Awakens, but they delivered nothing on the setups in that movie, it is like it never happened.So why should I care what happens in this movie and in this trilogy when you negated the point of the Original Trilogy (Ep.4-6) and destroyed Luke as a character? With this movie and this whole trilogy you are just demonstrating that you will just create more and more future movies without care for the universe that exists. Dumping the entire extended universe demonstrates the lack of care for this. They could have started a new trilogy set a few hundred years into the future or even a millennia later without destroying what was. The whole point of the Original Trilogy was the restoration of the Republic and the destruction of the Empire. What happens a few decades later? The Jedi are practically extinct. The Empire is simply morphed into the all powerful First Order. The Republic seems to have never been restored and the Rebels morphed into the resistance that by the end of the movie is practically nonexistent. There are a ton of questions left unanswered and will likely not get answered.Lets not forget the stupid setup for a kids movie trilogy in the Star Wars universe that killed the pacing for this move.",0

Not going to waste time on how many ways this movie is a colossal failure as the countless meaningful reviews here already spell it all out.  Its pathetic how the paid critics lined up in praise. This was not a good ""Star Wars"" movie, nor any other kind of movie for that matter...",0
2541,"God I hate this movie. I can't really say or point out anything that hasn't already been done by other critics hammering this (no story arc, no payoff after dramatic moments, too many jokes for jokes sake, Rose, Kylo sucking, Rey being too powerful, Luke and everything they did to him...). Just, avoid this movie, it will leave a sour taste in your mouth for weeks afterwards.",0
2542,It's as if the director actually hated Star Wars and Luke's character.

2546,"Bad plot, bad characters. But worst of all the ruined Skywalkers character. Why is it necessary to depict the old heroes as total failures in every regard in the new trilogy? Retroactively destroying their happy end is really sad. Han and Leia a failure as a romantic couple and an epic failure as parents. Luke a selfish, pathetic depressed wimp, and potential kinslayer who want's to burn down everything he's believed in and basically hand the galaxy over to the sith.  1 Star because i really loved the porgs and Chewbacca.

Bad characters, bad dialog, horrible tone shifts, idiotic scenes, moralizing. Every non-technical dimension is a disaster.",0
2548,Wow - This was a waste of time and money. All the build up for nothing. No character development and terrible sub plots that held little meaning. All the 'critics' and 'journalists' must be on the take because this was not a good film. This was a disservice to the Star Wars name. It felt disconnected from the first and I have to say the prequels are better by a long shot. Rogue One is the only contemporary film of note in the series as Gareth Edwards cares about the lore and characters.,0
2551,"Fortunately there was enough decent CGI, flashy lights, and amazing actors/actresses for this thing to pass as an entertaining movie. Other than that I thought it was on par with ""Spaceballs"". Did a twelve year old write this movie? Where was the quality control in the development of the script?",0
2552,"This film played more like a critique of Star Wars than a genuine Star Wars movie, and while I understand that a film could be both, I don't believe Last Jedi succeeds.  Like most modern superhero movies, anything can be destroyed and anyone can be killed with little fanfare or emotional impact.  Things blow up and the cast moves on without really looking back.  Nothing is ever really at stake.  This felt more like a Harry Potter or Hunger Games movie than Star Wars.  The story effectively killed any interest I have in where these characters are going, and has all but killed my interest in the franchise.",0

They bludgeon the legacy of the original trilogy so thoroughly I can't even look at Luke at this point - how in Christ's name did that milk scene get greenlit?? The story completely non-sensical and sloppy. Disney can pretend a bunch of ""trolls"" are to blame for hating on this movie - nope ... this is what happens when you **** all over a universe that brought joy and love to millions over decades.Aside from Kylo (and even that's a stretch) there isn't one compelling personality in the bunch. And I'm sorry, but, while she's a perfectly likable protagonist in some respects, Rey is a ridiculously over-powered Mary Sue ... she is ... at no point do you ever feel she's going to deal with real adversity, take a hit, have to dig deep ... she's handled with kid gloves and that makes it BORING. Good movies connect you with the character - make you feel their highs and lows.I didn't both going to Solo. I won't go to the next Star Wars either. I won't buy their merchandise anymore - not out of spite but because it's just tainted. The things they could have done to revivify this amazing franchise! I write all this out of sadness. Sadness that I probably won't be able to hand this to my kids one day or larp it up at a premier.So - to Disney : you ****** this one up. You should be ashamed of yourself.

2567,"There is just so many Things done wrong with this Movie, this Review could go on forever, so let´s make it short. It was more about pushing Genderpolitics, than telling a story. The Characters that I liked to know more about from the Force Awakens, were written very flat and had no character developement and if so, they just srewed it. Killing off the main villain WFFS? Also there was way too much humor, which really felt out of place. Another Point is that Rian Johnson obviously hasn´t treated the old Characters like Luke and leia with the respect they deserved. I understand that the Movie needs to have it´s dramaturgical means, but you didn´t have to make old loved Characters like Luke an alientit-sucking wimp. It really felt like forever watching that film. Every introduced Plothole from the previous Movie has being ignored. Will definitely not watch the next episode.",0

El problema es que la película es irreal, para nada creíble. Y no me refiero a que haya naves espaciales, alienígenas y poderes ""mágicos"", de esa base partimos como algo normal y creíble en la ciencia fición. El problema es que los personajes toman decisiones estúpidas de forma repetida, ocurren cosas inexplicables continuamente, y se contradice en muchas ocasiones con lo que se había establecido como cierto en las películas anteriores.Como película sci-fi estándar ""esta bién"" y ""es entretenida"" (tampoco nada del otro mundo), pero como película de Star Wars es una AFRENTA.",0

2573,"The Last Jedi is by far the worst Star Wars movie yet. It has more plot holes then all the other movies combined, it treats old characters with unfair treatment and fails to develop the new characters enough to compensate, about half the movie is filler, and most of it acts as TFA never happen and the possibly as if any of the other movies never happened, it leaves subplots untouched and answers nothing, any thing E7 brought to the table is quickly squandered hear and forgotten, even if one was to look at this independent from all the other movies it still has to much plot holes, filler, and cliche/unnecessary character that pull this movie below E2. It ruined the characters, the lore, space battles, and brought nothing to the table, no interesting characters, no explanations...nothing. One thing it did do was make me like Kylo Ren which i hated in the last movie but thats not enough to save this movie, the fact the this Ryan Johnson is getting his own trilogy is a testament to how much Disney does not care about this franchise.",0
2574,I critic all the Hollywoodian system. It is clear that all the 10/10 were given early before and after the first days of the release by paid reviewers in order to maximise the hype and money earnt in that garbage. This is a dangerous time where the manipulation of medias is at its highest stake.,0
2576,"Mr Johnson decided to create his own Sci-Fi adventure by using the Star Wars platform. The film, on its own, is decent. Despite some terrible CGI scenes. Awkward humour and ridiculous plot twists and directions. The trip to the gambling planet was laced with the same terrible CGI and pointless alien characters found in Episodes 1 to 3. Yet if anyone likes the original Trilogy or any of the characters prepared to have them destroyed. Apparently, he has been given free reign to create a new Trilogy separate from the original characters. Why he decided to character assassinate one of the heroes in sci-fi film history is beyond me. A complelety nihilistic take on anything related to Star Wars. I'm not a fanboy. I grew up with the originals and loved those films. I thought episodes 1 to 3 were absolutely terrible. I liked The Force Awakens and I thought Rogue One was excellent. This film has killed the franchise for me. Really don't care what happens in the next. If you like Star Wars, save yourself the money and time.",0
2577,"Simply put... They ruined Luke Skywalker... That is a sad thing. No glory for the legend. They made Luke a grumpy fool. No lightsaber battle, no glorious return, no love for the hardcore Star Wars fans. I am done with these movies.",0
2578,"Remember how the last movie was about finding the map made by Luke so that he is able to be found in case the galaxy needs him? Yeah well **** it Luke decided he just doesn't care and wants to die. Remember how it's supposed to take years before jedi even attain the rank of padawan and then BEGIN training with a lightsababer? Lol please, Rey's got that skywalker blood, she basically takes on Luke (the most powerful force user ever) no problem with zero training. Remember how the good guys win (although being at a huge disadvantage) by outsmarting the bad guys? Nah, no need for that lets just make them oblivious to anything resembling a logical thought.Let me summarize how the movie should have gone, if it made any sense. The first order attacks as resistance is evacuating, resistance manages to get away but the first order tracks them, resistance gets attacked again moments after escaping from first order but first orders big fleet is too slow at keeping up with resistance's smaller fleet, after seeing how Kylo and about 4 Tie fighters manage so blow up the command section of the resistance's main ship they decide to send in more of their smaller ships and everyone dies, the end. If you've never seen any of the older movies or have any previous knowledge on the star wars universe, this could probably pass as an okay movie. But if not save your money, this movie literally just says **** it to all the previous lore.",0
2579,"Bright got called bloated and the worst movie of 2017, but honestly, while not the worst movie ever, The Last Jedi was definitely more bloated. They could have cut out around 40% of the content and it never would have hurt, especially the scenes like the casino that feel like diseny not like star wars, never did a scene so badly need a Hutt and there wasn't one to be found anywhere. The whole thing felt like it was preparing for a disney themed ride. They could never be satisifed with a one off witty comment, but had to include multiple joke beats back and forth beating a dead horse. The highlight moment of the film quickly palls as Kylo Ren goes from being actually scary and interesting as a Sith back to being a whiny little tantrum throwing crybaby. Luke's entire acting felt uninspired and I can understand why given that it was basically a deconstruction of his original character. This movie went through three directors, and it really really shows, as the conflict between 'don't believe in past heroes' and 'listen to your elders and betters' waves back and forth so hard it gives whiplash.That said, it had some amazing action sequences, pity they were so few and far between because they were by far the strongest points in the movie.All in all, this movie was strongest, sadly, when it felt like it was directly reskinning parts of The Empire Strikes back. The planet where the battle goes down with At-Ats and such is so close to Hoth that they literally had to have some guy lick the white ground and say 'it's salt' to make it clear this wasn't a snowy frozen world. This thing copies Empire almost scene for scene in places, with new characters and a new skin, and but has completely changed the underlying message of the story while keeping the same general plot structure.I can't say it was horrible, but it was definitely not starwars, and it's left me sad for the ending of the trilogy. Maybe if they could get a single director to stop **** around and just run with the old 'saturday morning matinee' flair the originals had, it would work, but directly copying the plot structure without the inherent techniques will never make this work.",0
2581,"Even if you are not a massive Star Wars fan meaning you read every book and know every little detail about not only the movies but the Old Republic and so forth.  Or lets you are just a fan of the movies, meaning all seven then you should still disagree with the choices made for this episode.  Only people I see liking this movie are those who never seen Star Wars or know absolutely nothing about the cannon.  Sad cause this director took years upon years of not only a great series but beliefs that have been developed for some people most of their lives and basically through it out the window.  I'm surprised Disney allowed these type of changes. After all of the work put into tying the cartoons like Rebels and The Clone Wars alongside the movies, THEN to allow this tragedy to occur is ridiculous and sad.  The excuse of stating we are trying to get away from the Skywalker era is poor, you can easily do so and make still make it interesting.  I mean even Star Wars Rogue which was a hit had only one Sith appear and was only for a short time and was done so in order to tie it in with another movie.  I honestly just do not understand why this was allowed to happen, shame on you Disney and thanks Rian you are now part of JJ Abrams, I am here to destroy legendary hits.",0
2582,"Rather than re-iterate the astute observations of those of us who disliked/hated this poor excuse of a movie. It should be pointed out that The Last Jedi seemed like a bloated, fragmented assortment of poorly connected scenes and little else. Furthermore, the ham-handed attempt at diversity and inclusion was so poorly executed and serves only to saddle TLJ as a movie that wanted to make a statement about social justice and not tell a good story. If Johnson’s vision was to kill the past then he has indeed succeeded. The deconstructed script effectively cut any ties to the episodes that came before and it was helped along by Disney’s filmmaking by committee, which appeared more interested in marketability and not in character and story development. If this were a relay race then Kathleen Kennedy, J. J. Abrams, Rian Johnson et. al. have dropped the baton.",0
2583,"I have to say I was surprised that I came out of the movie theater really conflicted about whether I liked the movie or not. I really wanted to like the film, but I just wasn't entertained like I thought I'd be. I believe the beginning of the movie was the most entertaining.Luke shouldn't have acted the way he did. Mark Hammill(guy who plays Luke) himself doesn't really like the film. Most of of the movie is suspenseful and has you wondering what was going to happen next. Whenever the suspense died, I was underwhelmed. The fight scenes were not very entertaining and  didn't like a lot of the character development. I think The Force Awakens was better. I hope the finale of the trilogy is way better.",0
2585,"There are good movies and bad movies all the time, in all the franchises, no one its safe, even episode 2 was a disaster, and it was made for Lucas himself, i want more star wars, with these characters with new characters, expanded universe, etc, but good movies, made with the head and the heart, I love, see and consume everything from star wars since a child so i have the right to manifest and demand a good star wars movie",0
2586,"This really was about as bad as one could possibly have feared. I'll keep this short because so much is written elsewhere. This film was extremely well-shot and looked great. Furthermore, practically all of the performances are excellent. However, the plot, inconsistency, total absence of character progression or even any characters, the misplaced humour, the lack of any meaning whatsoever in anything that's happening, the disregard for the entire universe, the previous film, even basic physics, is just astounding. This is the future of Star Wars people, it's a cartoon. It's Transformers, it's Marvel, it's meaningless. This has done it for me now. I'm simply not interested in seeing another Star Wars film. As a fan of nearly 40 years, I think that's about as big a failure as there could have been.",0
2587,"Just better than TFA.... Just.Lazy plot, look a big bad ship followed by a even bigger badder ship. Lazy plot why do the new order (empire) not just jump a few ships ahead of resistance to cut them of? Master hacker only one in galaxy, argh just bad.For a film series with poor grasp of physics this one takes it too far. Amongst many others concept of bombers having to be physically above big bad ship in space before they can drop, mind blowingly bad.Character arcs for old characters do not fit with any previous films.The force no longer makes any sense, Leah? Rey super with no training.Understand fans have high expectations but rogue one proves making a good STAR wars film can be done. This new trilogy is so far awful!",0
2588,"This is not a Feminist attack or any of that crap. But it isn't a good movie either. The whole plot is based on a plot hole instead of a plot point. The main tension device is just silly.  Additionally, any tension that is built by the other plot lines is instantly and repeatedly deflated with slapstick comedy. Every time the movie is about to take a risk or do something interesting, it turns around. Everyone (who lives) winds up right back where they started. The very basis of a story, especially Star Wars, is the hero's journey, with the final piece being 'and then they returned, changed.' Nobody changes. Why would they? The bad guys are all goofy friendly cartoon characters who are in no way intimidating.  I have no idea what they were thinking when they wrote this.To put it another way, it feels like the first draft of a script that needs to be cut down, followed by a rough edit of that script that, again, needs to be cut down and fixed. What a mess! Don't give The Mouse your money for this one. If you see it 'just because it's star wars,' then they'll slap the title on anything without any fear of failure.I know the originals weren't perfect. I know episodes I II and III were a mess. That is no excuse to make objectively stupid decisions when plotting out new movies.",0
2590,"This movie had some stunning visuals, and some truly great moments. For the most part, the acting was very good, and even great at times. Unfortunately, the script was a complete train wreck. It had so many plot holes and felt so contrived. Huge sections of the story didn't make any sense, couldn't the First Order just hyperspace in a ship in front of the Resistance? nobody in the First Order thought of that? And what's up with those resistance bombers? It's like they were designed to be the least effective military vehicle (even ignoring the whole gravity issue with the bombs). Basically they're weak, slow have to be so close to their target that when they deploy their bombs they're guaranteed to get blown up in the blast... Sign me up! Torpedoes did exist, much more practical. Oh and if we get into the whole hyperspace Kamakazi trick then all of these are essentially pointless anyways. Just make fleets piloted by droids to hyperspace into stuff. Problem solved. It's not that my expectations were cleverly overturned, it's that I expected the characters to behave like rational people (or irrationally in an internally-consistent manner), and the script subverts those expectations, not by being clever or throwing in some brilliant twists, but by having the characters do stuff that makes no sense at all. That's not ""fresh or subversive,"" that's just inconsistent, sloppy and disrespectful to the characters and the universe in general.Admiral purple hair was an especially worthless character. She added nothing to the story and didn't grow in any meaningful way. Rose was also awful. Maybe her character could have been salvaged if they had replaced the stupid casino garbage with a better subplot, but if we're being perfectly honest, we didn't need more new characters, we needed to see the existing characters get developed in interesting and meaningful ways. Phasma was a waste of a very talented actress.I didn't care for Snoke in The Force Awakens, but the way he dies in the one is just dumb. The thing is, I don't really care about most of the new characters. I don't know enough about any of them really have an emotional investment in their triumphs and losses. When Purple hair crashes the ship, I didn't really feel sad / happy for her (although I was a little happy that an obnoxious character wasn't going to return in the next one). Were her children taken by the First Order? Was her family murdered by the Death Star 3.0? It wouldn't take much in the script for the Audience to feel a connection with her but nothing. As such there are no emotions. What a vapid and soulless piece of cinema... In one of the most visually stunning scenes in all of Star Wars we can't find a reason to care. I'm not even going to get into what they did to Luke's character, how >90% of the humor was bad, tonally deaf, and not delayed or the problems that making Rey a Mary Sue leads to for the franchise's future.",0
2591,"Long awaited and what a let-down.  Star wars isn't supposed to cram a political agenda down your throat. I can't get myself to sum up all the gripes and terrible decisions but well done, you ruined starwars.",0
2592,"The Disney Trilogy thus far not only looks off our OT heroes, but does so in was that ruin their legacies.

2593,"I'm very upset, this movie is a real and sovereign crap wherever you see it. It does not respect the story, the epicness or the characters that gave life to the saga. There is no remedy. Unless you remove the numbering and title ¨Battlestar Galactica 8: garbage in space. GROSS!",0
2594,"This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie, it's a bad movie overall. In terms of bad aspects, it's got it all: a boring story, plot holes, badly written characters, weak action, a lame musical score (especially compared to earlier Star Wars Episodes), forced humour, and uninspired sets. On top of all of that, the movie really seems to have been made as a giant F*** you to star wars fans. There is ZERO payoff to what was set up in The Force Awakens. I wish I could give this movie a zero, that's how much I dislike it, but I can't. The Last Jedi does earn some points because from a technical standpoint, it's solid. Also, some of the actors give decent to good performances, considering what they have to work with.It's funny to see how proud and pleased Rian Johnson is with himself. I wonder if he honestly believes he created an awesome cinematic achievement. He seems arrogant enough to believe it. And don't get me wrong, I'm not against something different and new. I like interesting changes and surprises in a movie, but that's as long as they work. None of the changes in The Last Jedi worked. They were all steaming turds that served to ruin this movie, and to destroy the story and characters that came before it.Anyways, I could go on and on about how they ruined Luke Skywalker, how Rey is perfect at EVERYTHING, how lame Snoke is, how bad the subplots are, and all the logical inconsistencies... but I won't. I'll just say that the one good thing about this movie is that it feels like the end of a trilogy, and has a finality to it. Therefore, this will be the last Disney Star Wars movie that I see. For me, Star Wars is Episodes I-VI. Yes, I like the prequels, and they are so far superior to The Last Jedi that it's laughable. Too bad George Lucas ain't around anymore...So, thanks Rian Johnson. Thank you for convincing me that I should save my time and money, and simply not watch any more Disney Star Wars.",0
2595,For me it was so like episodes 5 and 6. And new moments were just bad and had no SW-atmosphere in them. Yet the plot is stupid and doesn't make any real sense (you'd like to forget the ending).,0
2596,"You know it's a bad movie if it makes the prequels look good. This movie is SJW trash and they totally messed up the old characters. The story was uncreative with bland heroes and villains. Luke Skywalker is now scared of Kylo Ren. That is way outside his character. How could they screw up Luke Skywalker? I swear that Disney is bribing the critics to give it high scores. They need to repay us fans by writing two more actual movies. They should just let an autistic two-year-old write Star Wars. It would end up better that way. F*ck you Disney.  This isn't even an opinion. This is fact. This movie is objectively bad. Do not waste your money on this. This gets a zero. I've never trusted professional critics and will never trust them ever.To the ""people"" who submitted the 2,424 positive user reviews, I genuinely hope you either kill yourself or get some medical attention immediately. My opinion on this movie will not change, no matter what Rian Johnson or my liberal parents say. Case closed.",0
2597,"Utterly bad cinema experience. That's the first thing, the shell. The second thing is the complete subversion of a glorious work of fiction that is Star Wars. This is not a ""reboot"". It is a smudge, a stain, a wreck, a catastrophe. This is a completely artless science fiction movie. It is an a la carte DIY movie put together in a way that must have seemed just neat or cool to somebody. A series of strung-together scenarios that must have seemed really good as a storyboard at some point. Or a bunch of clipped-together comic books.And the tone is all over the place. There is levity, then there is supposed to be some gravity, then there is supposed to be some fancy. The problem is that these transitions occur not just within the movie but within *individual scenes*.",0
2598,"I left the Force Awakens feeling quite pleased despite its obvious plot rehashing. I liked the new characters and was very excited to see where this story was going. I left the Last Jedi feeling confused, and angry. Everything that came before it was ignored. The humor was out of place. The pacing was terrible. There were some nice scenes with Kilo and Rey, but all in all, too many un-answered questions, unnecessary and highly unlikeable new characters, and just bad storytelling. The entire casino side plot was an eye-rolling mess. And what was the point of killing Admiral Ackbar (one of the universe's most beloved characters) offscreen? Its a tragedy this had to be Mark and Carries last film. So horribly disappointing. I wish I could un-see it.",0
2599,Completely ruined. Doesn't make Sense. Killed Luke Skywalker after so long a wait??? NO plot. Soo many plot holes. Who are these new characters? Noone knows. No development at all. No Jedi training??? No triumphant comeback for Skywalker after so many years of waiting? What a shame. Shame on you Disney for destroying this beloved franchise and universe. There is no more Star Wars. RIP!,0
2600,"Just a bad movie... It was saved in the box office because it's a SW movie. If the name was ""Lost in space""....146mil worldwide!",0
2601,"What a wreck this movie is, so many bad points I would need to make a 10 minute youtube video at least.  Most importantly though, it just represents everything star wars is not.  Luke Skywalker as a character is assassinated and we are presented with a freak, same with Yoda.  Way too many ""diversity"" characters add way too obviously, it just comes off as nasty in an Antifa/agenda way.",0
2602,"This movie is a disappointment.The highlight of the movie for me, was the appearance of Yoda.Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with the plots and sub-plots.  I disliked the character development or at times lack there of as well as missing backstories. There is also an awkward humor that ensues throughout the movie that at most times I didn't realize was supposed to be funny.I thought the plot between Holdo and Poe was just silly.  Frankly, I thought Holdo was supposed to be a bad guy who was actually working for the first order. When she sacrificed herself, I was confused why the hyperspace jump like that wasn't done sooner.  A female in charge doesn't bother me, but the bad story line for this character does.  It could have been so much better if she had say there was a spy on board, or if she was a spy on board.  I really found her leadership lacking in the way the movie portrayed the character.The Canto Bight portion could have been completely skipped.  In my mind it really didn't add value to the movie and ended up being virtually pointless other than to offer Fin and Phasma the chance to square off, but wasn't worth the time put into it.  I would have like Rey's character if there was more development that could happen.  One of the things I enjoyed about Luke in episodes 4-6 is the growth he undergoes.  Rey comes to her abilities too quickly and I don't feel really faces challenges that grow her into her powers.  Instead she seemingly is able to get herself out of every situation without failing.As a whole, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  The overall Plot and Sub-Plots were lacking in detail and arc development.  As a whole, this is not a movie I would recommend watching or buying.",0
2603,"The Last Jedi is easily the worst of the entire Star Wars franchise. It takes the decent content from The Force Awakens (Rey’s Parents, Who is Snoke, Who are the Knights of Ren…) , and promptly douses it in gasoline whilst replacing those charred remains with poorly written characters and boring story arcs.Luke Skywalker was handled worse than imaginable and is completely contrary of his character in the Original Trilogy. Leia meanwhile felt cheaply manipulated, and dumb (Especially in a certain Mary-Poppins scene) . With Carrie Fisher sadly passing away almost a year before the film was released, you’d think it would make more sense to let her die heroically and keep Luke for the final movie, but not for Rian Johnson or Kathleen Kennedy apparently.Meanwhile, the new characters introduced such as Rose and Holdo felt completely out of place and useless to the story. Both of them feel unneeded, and crowbarred in to fill the diversity quota whilst being unbelievable and cringy (Rose) or tactically inept and unnecessary (Holdo). Similarly, all of the characters introduced in The Force Awakens are held back by the writers.For example; General Hux is a tactical imbecile, acting as a punchbag for low rate jokes that make him feel more like a dumb Superhero baddie for children rather than the intelligent Grand Moff Tarkin, or the intimidating General Grievous. Similarly, Captain Phasma is poorly utilised (especially considering the acting skill of Gwendoline Christine) and should have had a far more meaningful role in the story.Rey, Poe, Finn and Kylo all feel held back from their true potential. Rey feels unstoppable; as she is constantly shown to overcome every obstacle rather than have any meaningful struggle or show character development in any form. Poe and Finn seem to be used to quick audience laughs and to have their role stolen by other characters (namely weak characters). Kylo Ren feels too unrelatable and many intriguing ideas (What if Luke turned Kylo good, but Snoke turned Rey evil?) seem to have been thrown out because the writers feel like they don’t care.This movie is pretty, which gets it the 1/10, but its sets lack the imagination of past Star Wars’. Ahch-To is boring and could have been so much more interesting and steeped in mystery; but all we got was a bunch of stone age huts and some milk giraffes. Other sets just feel jammed into the story for no reason (Canto-Bight) or ripped without thought from previous films. The plot is as perforated as a cheese grater, as well as feeling long and braindead. Disney are using this franchise as a cash cow and are milking it drier than the Atacama.TL;DR: If you wanted to experience what a crap fan fiction sequel of Star Wars written by a bunch of people who’ve only watched it once and see far too much through the eyes of a crazed feminazi AND you also want it to be a weak Superhero gig then this is the film for you.",0
2605,"Effects and cinematography (but if you throw enough money at it, it's an expected outcome) were nice, but now to the bad: Poorly written characters new and old. Hhuge plot holes throughout. *SPOILER* a one-dimensional space chase - 3 slightly faster ships vs a galaxy controlling empire - seriously I thought better of Rian Johnson (Looper was an okay time travel movie and just shows how lazy he's been with this one). Very poor pacing and shockingly bad humour that just doesn't work, it's not smart and a lot of it's out of character for the tone of scenes it's in. This is a marvel-like money-making machine, where's my refund? This is not a finished or competent movie. EA/Disney destroyed Battlefront and now RJ/Disney have killed Star Wars. RIP Jedis",0
2606,"So my mind is open and I will say that this was not a good installment. The bad moments far outweighed the few good moments in this film. Also I am all about a different story and the unexpected. However the different story and the unexpected needed to be good. In this movie, that was not the case for most of it. It was underwhelming, all over the place and zero character development. A few scenes were good but a lot of things just felt out of place.",0
2608,"PREDICTION: The second week of this movie will see a big drop off from the first week.  No wonder they wanted us to avoid reading the user reviews (NOT PAID Critics) before viewing, Pathetic movie.",0
2609,"Other users have basically hit on all the major reasons on why this movie was a complete waste of time, and fails to set up Ep 9.   I think we are even further behind plot-wise than we were in TFA? No major villans, no old characters, no exciting new characters..I'll add that I especially disliked Han's golden dice, which were never introduced previously and never explained in this movie. Looks like I need to see the new Han Solo movie if I want to have any chance at understanding this movie! I can't wait to see how Han gets those dice... maybe at our favorite casino planet, where he will win the Falcon?  He will likely win at last minute and fly away just in time, leaving behind all of the slave children just like our heroes in this movie.",0
2610,"Frankly, if you care about the Star Wars canon, consideration for the history (even just movie based), character backgrounds, reasoning for decisions...then I would call this movie ""disrespectful"" to all of that. I'm really just disappointed, not because it wasn't an entertaining film, but the further away I get from seeing it, the more upset I get by how flippant the writing was. ""The Last Jedi"" has taken something I found joy in and gutted it.",0
2611,"Stars Wars is now not a SciFi film, but a hard left fantasy film.  It's more political propaganda than movie. First, White Men are not good people.  They are definitely not heroes, and humiliated and erased.  So, Han becomes a failed father that ran away from responsibility, and was so awful he was killed by his own son.  Luke is a miserable failed Jedi master that runs to a hiding place to die.  Too afraid to join the battle himself, he dies sending a projection instead.Second, any new White Men characters must be evil, weak, and stupid.  So, the new generation White Men are on the dark side, but they are not scary.  General Hux, the whitest of White Men, is the joke of the new Star Wars.  He's a buffoon that is easily tricked, and made fun of, and snivels and grovels to those in power.  Kylo Ren is supposed to be dangerous; tall, physically strong, and strong with the force, he also has years and years of training.  However, a skinny homeless girl with no training at all easily defeats him, and has to save him in this film.  His primary character trait is temper tantrums when his White Privilege doesn't work out for him. Finally, true heroes in our Leftist Star Wars are a diverse group of people devoid of White Men and led by the new saviors of the galaxy, crazy powerful and wise White Women.  Leading this group is the untrained and skinny (yet beautiful) Rey.   She is all things good to the left; no family, homeless, and poor (yet beautiful).  She can easily defeat the greatest killers in the galaxy... just cause.   She is surrounded by her diverse group of comrades.  A wise older and powerful White Woman mentor in Leia (dare we say Kathleen Kennedy).  A daring fighter in Hispanic fighter pilot Poe Dameron who is taught to temper his fight by wise White Women superiors.  A freed black slave in Finn, who learns to stand for something because of his love of a White Woman.  And now, an Asian woman has been added to bring balance (and someone to fix their electronics cause... you know... she's probably real good a math and stuff).  The reason the movie is either loved or hated depends on if you're far left SJW or not.  In the echo chamber of Hollywood, I'm sure they don't understand why everyone doesn't love this film.  However, I went with two millennial women, and they didn't like it either.  Go figure.",0

2617,"This is my first and probably last review, simply because this was the only movie franchise that i truly cared about.  After seeing „The Last Jedi“ i felt  compelled to say something,  to give a „heads up“  to anyone who wants to go and watch it. Don’t. Don’t go.  Don’t give it any money.  Wait for it, wait for it when it’s free.  I fell ashamed for paying for it, for feeding the beast.Everything  in this movie  the „Plot“ ,the characters, the „humor“ and the porgs, all of it has a  singular purpose –money.  The entire film seems to be made of unconnected ideas that were approved by „would you pay to see this“ polls after which they tried to connect it all by adding  confusing and implausible scenes between them (including force Skype and improved force Skype at the end),   because of  this plot holes pop up  every single time any of main characters try to do anything . I won’t  list them all, there is simply too many, instead i will only mention the most important one, the one that the entire story hinges on.- The inability of the First order armada of Star Destroyers and the Capital ship of „Supreme“ Leader Snoke to catch one rebel ship because it’s  a little faster than them, this being said one minute after the entire armada drops out of Hyperspace at light speed. Again... Light Speed. That is it. That’s the plot. The characters have no development, some don’t  even have any importance, Fin and Rose can easily be removed with little or no consequence to the „plot“ , but they do have importance money wise. A lot of people say that Disney is being too PC,  i guarantee it has nothing to do with political correctness, only money,  characters that pass the „would you pay to see this“ polls get screen time, and those that don't  get killed off.  Captain Phasma the  commander  of the First Order's legions gets maybe  60 seconds of screen time more than the „porgs“, one is for story purposes and one is merchandise. Guess who gets killed off.All this being said i am not opposed of movies earning money. I simply think that movies should earn money because they are good.Movies  shouldn't  be good just because they bring in the money.Ultimately i left the movie theater disappointed and confused and with the wish i didn't see the thing a saw.This is the last Star Wars movie i will ever pay for.",0

2619,"Oh god what happened here?   The last movie and it's similarities to a new hope we're excusable and it was a fun movie regardless.  It also setup some good questions that caused people to speculate and come up with various theories for the last two years.Now here we are and The Last Jedi is out...and is awful.  There is some really out of place humor delivered by characters that shouldn't be delivering it (Poe for example should be the funny 1 liner guy and that's it, nobody else except maybe Luke talking to his sister) and the dialog in general plus the ""slapstick"" moments are seemingly prequel level quality.Everything else aside the worst thing this movie does is not answer a single question raised by the last film.  It's no wonder Mark Hamill doesn't like either of the movies and speaks as poorly about them as he can get away with.This movie fails as a star wars film and a film in general.  Quite honestly this could have been a series of 3 10 min shorts or webisodes that led up to the movie.  It just didn't feel right in any way and as a fan it leaves you feeling empty.Once the hype dies does 90% of the people who claim to love it will likely rank it as the 2nd worst movie right behind phantom menace...bit at least that had Darth Maul and awesome light saber battles...you really won't get (good light saber fights) hereEven if you are an absolute die hard fan I suggest waiting to rent it...I know that's a hard pill to swallow but it's the truth.",0

Rogue One, while beating you over the head with nostalgia, was still a passable movie. The Force Awakens, while plagiarizing the original trilogy, still had craft behind it; true skill, and an adherence to the structure that not only made these movies great, but also recalled the films that originally inspired Lucas. While The Force Awakens wasn't perfect, The Last Jedi honors that movie, and the task undertaken by it's characters, by crapping all over that it. It effectively throws everything from that TFA out and replaces it with vapid nonsense. The FAR TOO MANY jokes don't land, characters are not who we know them to be, and the many plot holes you could fit a Star Destroyer through.There are some great visual effects and some nice explosions and fights. But frankly that's it. Oh and by the way they COMPLETELY destroy the character of Luke Skywalker, one of the greatest characters that movies and literature have ever had.

Why are no questions answered?  How did Maz, Leia, and Han all seem to know Rey for some reason in TFA?  Who was Snoke?  Why was Yoda acting like he did when he first met Luke on Dagobah, when he was originally only trying to trick him into thinking he wasn't Yoda-- at no time in the prequels or after Yoda dropped his act did he act like a giddy laughing weirdo.

Knowing that reading reviews can taint the experience I've deliberately stayed away from any Star Wars related publications. After the excellent Rogue One, I went in with great expectations. Unfortunately I quickly realised what a bad decision I made. This is without doubt the worst Star Wars movie to date. Think Phantom Menace was bad ? I now think back to that movie with fondness. 30 minutes into the movie, I was wishing I was back in the dentist chair. But I kept watching, hoping that it will redeem itself. It didn't. Without going into spoilers, the story was a daft drawn out affair. There was none of the comradery and banter that made the original such fun to watch. There were attempts at humor but nobody in the cinema was laughing. It all felt fake and sad. There was also no build up, the whole movie felt like it was stuck in second gear. While watching it I kept thinking that there is nothing original here,  nothing that hasn't been done before. Just a badly executed rehash of Return of the Jedi with a bit of Empire Strikes Back thrown in. The director somehow managed to make a three hour movie with no actual story tell and no emotions stired. It is the only Star Wars movie where I couldn't  wait for it to end, wishing that they just put all the characters out of their misery and be done with it.If there is one advice I could give is to save your money, buy some popcorn and watch the original trilogy instead (or anything else for that matter).",0

I  do not regret my purchase, because I was extremely curious because of the huge gap between critic reviews and regular jane|joe reviews. In this particular case, there is most certainly some **** going on, like usual people want to keep their ability to get early copies/showings. First off, going into this do not view it as Star Wars and the Star Wars universe and from a galaxy far away, but a political propaganda piece about the U.S.. I'm not going to go on about which ever side is correct etc, but simply say that instead of viewing something interesting, they attempt to gorge you on political references throughout the entire movie which I assume, is to assuage one into believing that this is some deep, relevant movie(if it's indeed not trying to manipulate you into thinking a certain way.); in exchange for anything of potential interest. This is a propaganda movie, and I say that objectively with no preference or interest in either side. Every plot, every scene, every character is analogous to some ridiculous stereotype leaving the characters two-dimensional as hell, with ZERO character growth as if none of the incredulous, PTSD inducing events had any effect on these characters, like they literally went through the whole first movie and the second movie with blinders on. The characters are static and flat. The settings are absolute **** with barely any variance from the first to the second movie. There three settings. Some random small piece of land on some forgettable planet, space, and on a space ship. No variety, hardly any wow moments. The ONLY vista/scene that I was in awe of was where Luke faces down several AT walkers, in some triumphant one-person army kind of scene and the shot is so epic that it hypes you up to think ""Skywalker is about to go ham on these space-nazis."". HOWEVER, that scene is undercut with garbage and fails absolutely, into which I will not go into detail because it is so rage inducing. This movie is bad. The most powerful character in Star Wars is reduced to a Force Fart after exerting his geriatric self too hard supposedly, the second most powerful/trained force user with powerful lineage who is reduced to a whiny brat again who did not learn anything from his balding, sequin body suit mutant leader is beaten by an untrained, so perfect she's not believable fantasy Nobody. That Nobody, Rey, doesn't grow, doesn't learn yet uses her feelings so often she might as well be the Dark Side already, and reduced to some bull**** too perfect fantasy character that no one can relate to or even look up to because she never ever in a million years fails. There is no ""why"" in this movie, just ""is"" to prove a point that only the paid are interested in. The Rebels are forgettable, uninteresting, and not important to the franchise. AND WORST OF ALL THE LIGHTSABER BATTLES ARE TERRIBLY CHOREOGRAPHED. It's like the saber wielders have lost all sense of ability and form and now are just randomly swinging their sword cause ""feelings"". That's a huge problem in both of the newer entries of Star Wars is it focuses too much on feelings. And that may be because the directors or whoever are trying to pander to women (wrongly), and assuming that fans that are women are more interested in emotional outbursts than an epic space opera. This movies attempt at pro-feminism absolutely does injustice to that realm of political thought making out strong women characters to be both **** incompetent, or outright fantastical and unrelatable. This movie is a real disappointment. You are probably safe to assume the last installment will be ****e also. Happy Holiday season, etc etc.",0
2651,"While visually stunning and exciting, on a story-level a severe disappointment and a downgrade of the whole star wars saga. It's worse than the sequel and it will be hard to recover from in the next movie. Let's hope the ""next trilogy"" will be made by competent filmmakers and not as marvel/disney version of star wars.",0
2654,"I had to see this twice, just to be sure it was this bad.  I really wanted to like it.  There's something in this movie for everyone, but there are parts so bad that they stick with you.  None of these characters matter.  Stuff is just happening to them.  I think there's a great ""phantom edit""-style cut coming someday.",0
2660,"So bad so sad.It was all said before so i will just skim:1- Bombs in space.2- Hyperspace kamikaze move that basiclly negates any reason to build big warships in star wars univers since they can be hyper rammed3- Rey who can beat everyone Luke included without any training,4- Yoda as force ghost bringing lighting.The old geezer must have been napping in all the battle times when his side could really use some lightinings.5- Destoying  Luke Skywalker character6 - Im normally far from SJW conspiracy theories, but here it was so blatant it smacked you in the face. Wise, heroic women and silly men.7- The whole Empire ships pursuing Rebel ships in normal space and cant catch up.. What was that? So this huge empire fleet had not enough fighters/bombers to oblitarate the rebels?It had no smaller escort ships to catch up?9- The weird childish humour...10- Snoke i barely knew you and you are already out..:). Seriously the super powerful evil mastermind killed that way?the list could go on and on...Basically there was a quote in the moive which said something like ""To build a new world you have to burn the old one"". I felt like it was what Rian And Kennedy vision for this movie:Destroy all the symbols and continuity of the old serie so they can stuff their silliness.Oh and also to  all poeple saying "" the old 30-40 years fan should stop  crtisising this is new Star Wars"".Well done, mission partly accomplished in my case, im done with New Star Wars, Im not going to the next one.",0
2661,"This movie was, as always with Star Wars, visually stunning...but... The story was so generic and not in the true spirit of Star Wars. This movie ruined the Star Wars universe. Fuel? wtf? You can just hyperspace a ship into a mega Star Destroyer to kill it? would have been nice to know that during like every other space battle in every other star wars movie.",0
2663,Beautiful special effects. Horrible plot and writing. Also no respect for any Lore that was established in prior films. Seems like Rian Johnson did not even watch the Force Awakens.,0
2665,"Guess the people who rated the movie negative wrote enough about why the movie is bad. i did not any read of them, but they are all have right.In my opinion Episode VII was somewhat ok.Rogue One beside was great!After watching Episode VIII i just say no. No to this, this new trilogy is not a part of the Star Wars Canon. If i had the power i never would let this movie go into the cinema. if i had the power i would scrub the next Episode. It feels bad Hamill and Fisher were part of this.",0
2666,"1) Kylo sucks, he's a cry baby of a villain not intimidating or respectable. He was defeated by the new Goddess of the saga, Rey. 2) Snoke sucks too, he got killed off by the cry boy Kylo Ren... So there are no respectable bad guys...3) Leia can now fly?!?! Since when? She has ZERO training... 4) ALL male characters suck. I'm fine with Luke dying, but the way in which they did it and the way in which his character was represented is nothing short of DISGRACEFUL. He didn't even get his own Yoda moment when we were like WOW! This guy is actually a great warrior or anything.. Instead, we just saw him create an illusion and then dying off.. 5) Luke got beat up by Rey?!?! Seriously?! If Star Wars would've been respected at all Rey would've stood a snowball's chance in hell to even hit Luke at all. 6) Disney **** on the history and lore of star wars and disrespected us fans by portraying Luke like an idiot and killing him off like an idiot. F*** Disney, I'm done with them. Not a SINGLE dollar more I will give them.",0
2667,"I dont think I have ever been so disappointed in a film  I really enjoyed Rogue One and The Force Awakens but the director Rian Johnson totally ignored everything that Abrams setup in The Force Awakens and decided to make his own movie with jokes that dont work, major plotholes and a whole scene with Rose and Finn that has nothing to do with advancing the plot",0
2668,"Garbage movie! Very inconsistent with its own plot from the first movie much less the entire star wars lore. I am sure the director never heard of the star wars movies much less watched them. Next time you have a new director create a sequel, have them watch the previous movie and read up just a page or so on the lore. OR, get a few of the millions of fans to come in and give feedback on your plot line. Synopsys: Luke an old emo Grinch that has no real power and can’t see the good in people any longer; Leia is an immortal flying wizard super woman terminator; Rey is a force god (with two weeks of inexperience under her belt); Kylo is a barely force sensitive snot nosed millennial with daddy issues and a bad temper; the emperor really has no power and only serves to display a return of the jedi moment; the entire galaxy forgot about force field shields; there is now gravity in space; single fighters can take out entire giant battle ships (see shield reference); death star laser cannons can only make tiny holes in giant doors, ginormous ships can be taken out by ramming others ships into them (see shield reference again), the first order now controls the entire galaxy, the rebel alliance is only made up of a few hundred people.",0
2669,"Rian Johnson could have done so much with this story and didn’t. The plot is useless and character development horrible. When I can honestly say that George could have done better, means that I think Rian is the worst director of our day.",0
2670,"It's also ridiculous how biased the ratings it gets are. Universal acclaim when so many people have problems with it feels like Hollywood shills can influence generations with their money and power.I'm a star wars fan not a huge one but one none the less. I having seen clone wars. I didn't love tag but I liked it's setup and world building and hated its cornyness and nostalgia which is a similar feeling I have to tlj. I loved the original trilogy it's witty and corny at the same time. The prequels I also loved with their newscope and backfilling of the universe we had known. This movie had so many potholes that couldn't be glossed over and took me out the film. The cgi and filming was top-notch as was the soundtrack mostly. The corny lines were kids movie **** without the adult connotations that some kids movies do so well. The characters are dull as **** Rey is a lame duck but master fighter, kylo was better but doesn't seem to be growing, prepubescent anger, odd clumsy standard **** who reaches the same endpoint as ep8 by the end.I think I hated this movie most because of the constant twists that are explained as plot points by the characters, good movies don't tell the viewer what's going on they show you through natural dialogue, emotion and leave some ambiguity. Bad movies have characters that literally real you what were doing now and next. There were million examples, will kylo kill his mum no he won't o wait she is killed anyway but wait she's alive and is now mary poppins but wait shes not strong and is now in a coma in 2 minutes of screen time wtf. Rose professes her love for fin after no onscreen chemistry or sexual tension and they kiss, and then he drags her back to base quicker than the FO walkers over massive distance past the obliteration of Lukes ghost. I have so many more yet I still liked some of it.I don't like the direction Disney is taking this series and I need them to move on from the old characters quickly. Adding simple man's **** at every step to appeal to the largest audience is tarnishing one of my favourite franchises ever and I don't know if I can take it anymore. It starting to feel like fast and the furious in space.Also I didn't read or talk about one fan theory except jarjar snoke and had no spoilers, I limited my exposure to the hype and only saw the trailer twice. I expected a return for the franchise and waited three days to see this movie which was less time than the last two. I was shaking in anticipation, something not normal for me as I lined up beforehand.Also as a sane individual I didn't purchase battlefront 2015 or 2017 after pkating the ****ty betas and I've barely played a star wars game ever so maybe I just feel too strongly towards the film's.",0
2671,"Awkward humor and pointless side stories completely tank the awesome Rey and Kylo scenes. Mark Hamill was absolutely right when he said this wasn't his or George Lucas' Luke Skywalker. Half the time he's what you would believe he would be as an old man, the other half he's doing slapstick comedy that belongs in a Space Balls movie. Finn and Rose (the most obnoxious character since Jar Jar) have a pointless story that accomplishes nothing. Poe's story ends up being worthless. It's like one good story you care about spattered with cringe worthy humor, sandwiched between meaningless boring stories that don't even feel like they're taking place in the Star Wars universe. Some people are overcompensating for their rage and saying it's a zero, but it is honestly objectively a bad movie. At least Phantom Menace had Darth Maul. This movie has nothing.",0
2672,"Justo go and watch on Youtube the last interview with Mark Hamill, ""this is not my Luke skaywalker, he never would do something like that""This fits perfectly with the feelings of all the true fans of SW universe, Disney destroyed SW.",0
2673,Disney is a pretty smart company. I fully expect budget cuts for the next sequel.,0
2674,"Leia floating thru space revived by The Force(TM) accelerating back to the ship, going thru an airlock that gets opend and she just falls to the floor getting medical help? WTF!!!I am so happy I did not bring money to the cinema. I just went thru the last three money grabbing bs films on kInOx.To. Don't make the people anymore richer who buy IPs to rip open the consumers that are just wallets to them. Disney pissed on all that was good about Star Wars, which wasn't really that much, and now bring us Bomber in space that don't shoot rockets, but drop bombs on ships in space like in WWWII on a planet!!!SW is SciFi-Fantasy, but a tiny rest of standard physics should be respected! The Force always was a very restricted tool and even Yoda could lift only so much, but this film broke everything. It left us with broken characters, story telling, laws of nature and good taste. Hollywood is a SJW mess now. ALL good characters are women and ALL a_s_s_h_o_l_e_s are male. And this white entitled female knows to use THE FORCE(TM) without any training. Of course she trains herself! A male trainer would also make the feminist audience this trash caters too go on a Twitter s_h_i_t_s_t_o_r_m spree and we don't want that!? NO.Star Wars is long dead. Drop the IP and forget it. It's time!",0
2675,"Not a bot because I feel Poe slapped! I give it 1 because I got to see Rey's calves. Nice! Man bad, woman good, don't eat meat and drink milk.  Be afraid for the Solo movie and everything after. A sequel picks up and hands off, TLJ didn't do that. New characters went backward. There's 40 years of Star Wars--This ain't 'Nam-there are rules. Disney making fun of capitalism ? Okay.   I hope Quentin Tarantino gets to direct ""Sleeping Beauty"" someday and takes that in a ""new direction""",0
2676,"Bad Idea of Disney, showing a Luke Skywalker weak and foul. everything looks like a rebels episode in amovie bad thing and they dont even follow the original movies history is just another scifi movie. hope in the last one they will be able to recover any of the history and stop making jokes all movie and lost time with casino scenes. very very disapointed of Disney and how they twist the history of Star Wars.",0
2677,"There is much to dislike here. But the main problem is Rian Johnson doesn't seem to realise he is making the 2nd movie in a trilogy, or that he is making a Star Wars film.None of the character arcs from TFA were dealt with in a meaningful way. Rey's background: there is none. But she is very competent with the force (bested Kylo in TFA having just picked up a lightsaber). Without training. granted she might be another Anakin type figure who comes from no where. But even the chosen one needed extensive training. Snoke: TFA looked to be setting up a good vs evil battle between Snoke/Kylo and Luke/Rey. The premise of TFA is the search for Luke whom Snoke is genuinely fearful of. Sounds like a classic Star Wars story arc to build the new trilogy on. Nope. Snoke is dispatched with no new information about him.Luke: this is not the same Luke. Granted he may have changed over the years. But to believe that the guy who put it all on the line to go against Vader & Palpatine, because he believed there was some good in Anakin, would even consider killing his nephew is nonsense.I could go on. The buffoon Hux, flying Leia, the kiss, animal convservation, the rebellion reduced to standing room on the Millenium falson, blue milk etc.   It seems like Disney is destroying all remnants of Lucas's Star Wars to build their own version. They should just be careful they don't destroy the fanbase in the process.",0
2678,"If this was a normal Movie it would be a 4, 5 based on the bad plot and overacting by bad actors. But it's not. This is STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII.There's 40 odd years of backstory and tons of literature to incorporate.And Disney decided to throw everything out of the window.https://www.change.org/p/the-walt-disney-company-have-disney-strike-star-wars-episode-viii-from-the-official-canon",0
2679,"Last Star Wars movie I'll be going to. It was every kind of awful. No character development, ridiculous story full of plot holes, childish dialogue and inconsistent with the previous movies. It would be easier to forgive if it was just a bad movie. But the franchise has so much potential after the groundwork of the original 3. It's just sad to see it ruined like this.",0
2680,"The more time I have to digest this movie, the more I hate it. This movie did something the prequels couldn’t, ruin Star Wars for me. I don’t need to rehash everything wrong with this, I slapped my head at least twice, and Rose....awful character. PC/SJW tones throughout, got it, super Leia...ok... But they completely trashed Luke. W...T...H. Did I just watch? The audience in the theater? Dead silent. They were as stunned as I was. The best part? When I could put on my jacket and leave.But...I can fix this for you Disney.  Are you ready???Make the movie.... A DREAM SEQUENCE!!!It would be less ridiculous than what you just released.",0
2681,"An opportunity to create something very special was missed. Luke Skywalker's character was rewritten to fit a poorly contrived plot. Carrie Fisher is pushed to the side lines and under used in what should have been her final moment to shine. The humour is forced and falls flat, completely missing the mark. I came away from this film feeling insulted and angry that such an incompetent director had been allowed free reign to create his own personal version of star wars. The fans are what have made the franchise so lucrative, and this is how Disney rewards them. George Lucas should never have sold out. So so sad. I will not be going to see any more Star Wars movies. It really is time for the Jedi to end.",0
2682,"This movie was written by social justice warriors. if the character was male he was deemed incontinent or traitorous.  All the leaders were female, for the good guys and the bad guys were just your ""patriarchy."" This movie was an OK movie if you do not know anything about Star Wars.  This was a well-done B rated movie, not an A category by any means.  This was embarrassing.  The movie lacked any common sense at all from tactics to character development.  It is worth watching just to see how far the Communists are taking over our country.",0
2683,Extremely poorly edited and was clearly made for an audience with a sub 80 IQ.  They had potential with the main story arc (Kylo Ren and Rey) but ended up completely ruining it by copping out.  The humor in the movie was out of place and they shoe horned in a critique of the military industrial complex which seemed completely unnecessary.  Disney needs to pretty much hit reset on the series because the only way i'll watch the next one is if it's free.,0
2684,"Terrible movie, not just bad Star Wars, just a bad movie in general. To the point. Those comic relief moments, my God I died on the inside. I cringed so many times I started to nervously laugh and I was not the only one. People at the cinema were laughing in serious moments. Then I started to treat this film like a parody. Luke - they destroyed this character. Ok I understand that he felt bad for what happened, I can understand his bitterness but I thought he will be back in action. Nah, let’s make him look weak several times, then let’s make the audience believe that actually he’s back and will fight, but right away with a really ridiculous scene let’s destroy the hope. That „taking dirt of the shoulder” move made me really dead inside. Somebody watched Goldeneye scene with the tank when James Bond wrecks the city and afterwards adjusts his tie like a boss. It was cool, but it is not cool in Star Wars final battle for God’s sake, it’s cringe.   The finale really makes me believe that Mark didn’t know what is going to happen with Luke, and that he hated the script. Rey - again she knows everything, Mary Sue style. I actually hoped she will turn to the dark side. It would save that movie for me, but well I don’t really care for her. Kylo - a little better than in TFA, I actually started to like this character. I also hoped that him turning back to the light side of the force is an option that would be quite cool. Imagine Kylo and Rey training together with Luke’s guidance to defeat Snoke. Not in my dreams.Finn and Rose - what was that about? 45 minutes of an unnecessary plot with the casino that was not completely Star Wars vibe. And this message „capitalism and gambling is bad”. Seriously Disney? Hypocrisy is strong with you. The final battle…well done Rose, you almost destroyed the Resistance because you had a crush on Mr Useless Character. I laughed hard when she said this cringy line about love. Snoke - what a wasted potential. We still don’t know anything about him and that makes the whole film even more stupid. I don’t care if they explained in the new books. You won’t see my money. Leia - Mary Poppins scene was stupid looking and she lacked logic when being in charge. Poe - the only person that had guts but at the same time they made him look like irresponsible child that needs spanking from mama purple hair and mama Leia. Men suck, don’t we? BB-8 - loved him as before, but it’s really not enough to make me give a better rating Chewie - didn’t do anything basically, why is he even still around?Resistance and First Order’s leaders - oh boy oh boy. Disney, you made them look like a bunch of kids. This purple hair lady was the worst SW character ever. And why was she wearing a ball gown? She should’ve been dressed in a black funeral dress, that would be adequate. Ah and now only women are in charge, yeah cool. First Order’s leaders also weak, noncharismatic. You remember Tarkin, Veers, Piett? I respected them even if they were the bad guys. Alliance’s generals Dodona, Riekaan, Maidine, Ackbar (why is he dead? Really?), Mon Mothma - all cool characters also developed in EU. I know it’s not the old trilogy, I know people need new things and we need to move on, but at least make them charismatic and strong. So yeah cool, because of your decisions Rebellion is like 10 people now. I cringed so hard and I just wanted them all die, didn’t care for them anymore. The whole space chase was the stupidest thing. I didn't know the shields on a capital ship are that strong lol, they've been firing all the time at it and it seemed that it was invulnerable, but earlier during the battle it wasn't? What about the fuel? Capital ships had reactors from what I remember. Oh what a bad luck that you ran out of gas. Jumping to hyperspace? Nah, they will track us. Why not jump closer to the planet, disembark on a smaller carriers set the autopilot or leave a frikkin droid to ram the star destroyer. I felt like watching Prometheus. I cringed because of crew's lack of common sense there too. So I guess I’m done with new Star Wars. Will watch Empire Strikes Back as an antidotum as I really feel bad after watching TLJ.",0
2685,"Aside from some epic space battles the movie is a study in character assassinations, plot holes galore, forced humor and whole sections of unneeded parts.  I wanted them to go in a different direction but with good execution and a lack of utter laziness.  That's ultimately what this movie feels like, utter laziness and lack of imagination.",0
2686,"Honestly seems like those involved were determined to dismantle the entire legacy of the original trilogy while at the same time stealing as much as they could from those movies to try to sell their new 'vision'. Bassically a combination of zero respect for preexisting fans or source material combined with a total lack of original ideas, good acting or decent writing. Throw in some very blatant political agendas (anti-Trump, radical feminism) and you have something that will retain its lukewarm appeal only as long as the sociopolitical agenda that drove it remains in play. Normally it would be hard to justify a zero rating for a movie (surely it has some jokes or action scene to give it a few points?) but in this case the deliberate effort to debase the characters, story and basic tone of the previous movies makes it more than suitable.",0
2689,"Movie ratings are inherently subjective. You might agree on some points (cinematography) and disagree on others (plot, character motivation), but how those individual aspects weigh into the overall impression of a movie can be completely different from person to person.Initially, I glossed over many things I didn't like about this movie, because of the few things that I did like. But the more time passes, the more those few things fall apart upon further scrutiny. One example with a little bit of added detail: I liked the way Snoke manipulated both Rey and Kylo through their force connection, which he himself orchestrated, and how he baited Rey to go into the belly of the beast. When she realizes that she was played, it's too late. So they are in this situation, in the throne room, how can it be resolved? I don't think there are a lot of options (Rey dies, or Kylo decides to save her and fight Snoke and they try to escape, etc.). What happens instead is that Kylo kills Snoke (this seemingly omnipotent and omniscient being) in a way that simply seems cheap given Snoke's previously established strength in the force. Rey and Kylo both got played and the consequence? Nothing. Encounters like this feel scripted to a point where all that counts are aesthetics and furthering a certain plot point. It doesn't matter that Snoke is extremely powerful and his plan succeded. What matters is Rey and Kylo, so everything else needs to fall in place, whether it makes sense or not. This was a recurring theme in the movie.Liked:- Yoda scene- R2D2 playing the Leia clip to convince Luke- Force connection scenes- Cinematography- Most of the principal acting- Luke questioning the Jedi code- A few other things that slip my mindDisliked:- Entire Canto Bight subplot- The main plot which only served one purpose: adding a sense of urgency; but was devoid of logic in most parts- Rey fighting off several Elite Praetorian Guards, having gotten almost zero training by Luke (yes, I only say that because I can't handle a female Jedi protagonist /s)- Character motivations don't make sense- Gaping plot holes- Leia shoud've died or that scene never should've happened- Irrational lines that are supposed to evoke emotions (Rose to Fin: ""you win by saving who you love, not destroying what you hate""; just after you prevent him from saving what HE loves by sacrificing himself in what would've been a great arch for Fin; and btw, how? By crashing into him in high speed mere meters from the front line of the First Order, what? What?!)- Space is not a vacuum (several instances of this)- Luke, the dude who believed in the good in Vader and was willing to die for it, is going to kill a child (his only nephew) because of a premonition.... yea, either flesh that change in his character out properly with more backstory or something (I get that they tried to rationalize it by having him say that it was an instinctive moment which he immediately regretted, but at least for me, that didn't work)For most of the time in this movie, I was just not invested in the story or the characters. Not because I didn't want to be (quite the opposite actually: I like the characters established in TFW) but because so much of what was happening just wasn't making any sense to me. And you start realizing: nothing matters, there is a starting place for a few characters and they need to end up at a particular place by the end, but how that happens, everyhing in between, is of minor importance.",0
2690,Garbabe Disney money grab!  Story is very lame.  All the new characters are boring and uninteresting.  Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher (RIP) acting is so bad and i mean so bad.  The big lead up/mystery of Snoke was a joke.  He literally dies before anything interesting is revealed.  Same goes for Rey's heritage.  She's just a daughter of drunken parents that left her for booze money.  Kylo is just a mental mess that needs anger management.  There is nothing for this franchise to go forward.  Basically Kylo wants to rule and Rey doesn't want him to rule.  I will not watch another one.,0
2693,Sigh......Star Wars made by Disney to alienate true fans of the franchise. Enough said.,0
2694,This movie is the most hideous piece of star wars related garbage in the galaxy.  I'm surprised,0
2695,"Terrible movie, jokes every minute, but it's the same Marvel formula over and over again, you can even predict when there's a joke coming. Also I couldn't care less about the characters, they feel so empty and cliched. The animal-care scene (casino), the way Poe is a stubborn guy which learns a valuable lesson after confronting Leia and the pink haired lady from Jurassic Park, those orphan kids from Annie, and the romance between Finn and that terrible, awful, Rose character are SO Disney, I don't think I could handle the third film but I can't wait for this nightmare to end.",0
2696,Garbage....Franchise Killer....did I say garbage already?  I wonder how much Disney payed all the critics for good reviews....,0
2697,"Insulting trash,  abysmal casting and acting.  SWJ fest.  Star wars is dead.",0
2698,"First, the positive. This film looks amazing. The visuals and effects are to notch, as one would expect from a Star Wars film. But that's where the positive ends. The film commits so many atrocities on the story threads and characters that were established in The Force Awakens, that I no longer care about any of the new characters. Opportunity to build on fan favourites Snoke and Phasma were completely thrown away. The plot opportunity of turning Rey to the darkside was missed - how much cooler would that have been. Leia was grossly underused in what would sadly be Carrie Fisher's last Star Wars film, giving way to flat characters with cringeworthy interactions, eg Finn and Rose (with their pointless ventures on Canto Bight) and Poe and Holdo (seriously, the Leia from the original trilogy was a far better example of an empowered female character than the ""I have a plan"" Holdo). There are other weird choices like the WW2 inspired bombers and world-altering ideas like hyperspace jump abuse. But the worst irreversible offense that this film commits is against the character of Luke Skywalker. I thought Han Solo's treatment in Force Awakens was disappointing, but wow, what a sad treatment of one of the greatest most positive characters in Star Wars. I felt really sorry for Mark Hamill. I don't know how they can recover Episode IX from this garbage.",0
2709,"So we now have the home release for the last Jedi, interestingly this only hurts the film imo, in the cinema many people no doubt got caught up in the hype and visually the film delivers that classic star wars spectacle.In the months since release this film has continued to divide opinion and some of the cast have caught some flak, which I think is uncalled for not only because it's morally indefensible but also because the cast imo, did a good job, In each case I am convinced that the actor on screen is portraying the character to the best of their ability, the writing and direction is what lets the film and the actors down, for that reason the 2 was given as the spectacle remained and the actors delivered their performances.Rian Johnson wanted to ""subvert"" expectations and that he did unfortunately the expectation that was subverted was that this would be a good film.At the most basic level there is 0 development from the prior film, snoke? X Rey's origin? X, Within the film itself we begin with rebels on the run and we end with rebels on the run, Rey is portrayed as some sort of force savant in the first film but unrefined, still unjustifiably gifted but raw, in this film we see no real training or development and yet she is incomprehensibly gifted, again we have a lack of development, Leia miraculously has force powers again when did that happen? luke has lost all faith in the teachings that led him to the redemption of his super evil father on some really flimsy justification, clearly characters can change but you have to show that change which wasn't done.There are moments like the hypersapce ramming which are visually stunning but a few moments later you find yourself questioning hang on if you can do that and you have droid pilot systems why not create hyperspace missiles and just fire them at any target of a certain size? Luke claims he didn't wish to be found but left a map of how to find him? Finn and Rose needed a super hacker code breaker who could be found on a specific planet, don't find him but run into someone just as capable, The conceit of the chase is only one ship is tracking, well the rebels have multiple ships and based on Rose and Finn can dart back and forth with little issue why not slowly trickle people off the ships until all the bad guys are chasing is empty vessels? or why not load the people onto the other ships they started with and then ram your big ship into the tracking ship and hyperspace away. Similarly we have the justification Luke is disillusioned because of Kylo, what we are shown is Luke felt darkness in Kylo and immediately jumped to the kill option before regaining composure, but too late and Kylo sees the intent and events playout as shown, now knowing Luke risks his own life to redeem has father and masters his own emotions in the final showdown of ROTJ makes this whole sequence complete nonsense.The take away point is the more you sit and think through this film the more you realise how absurd the points are and how badly it undermines certain in universe rules.A lot was made of the representation of Male Vs Female etc. honestly those injections will certainly date this film as time goes on but ultimately it is not these inclusions that condemn this film.Clearly some people disagree and are willing to overlook some pretty glaring plot holes, that is their prerogative, however if you want a film that is consistent and follows the internal logic of its' own universe then look elsewhere as this is not the film you are looking for.",0
2710,Terrible and distasteful movie. To a real fan I felt like the movie was a slap in the face with some B rated scenes. Leia floating in space! are you kidding me! Luke dying to a force projection? Are you kidding me? Movie was a mess with a BS agenda. When did movies and t.v. start being more political and less entertainment?? Get that out of here.,0
2711,Luke Skywalker trying to murder sleeping son of his sister and one of his best friend. I dont need to say more about this blockbuster. Leia Poppins is just a topping on this cake full of **** First time i left cinema totaly disgusted after subtitles. Ryan Johnson became the 1st author who i realy hate. Im not sure thats the feelings you should take from a Star Wars movie.,0

2717,"Pero que puta mierda es esta. Peor que la 1, que la 7 y que todas. Un puto truñaco, sin sentidos, sin motivaciones de los personajes, UNA MIERDA. Disney se ha cargado star wars, esto no se parece en nada a lo que hizo george lucas. NO VAYAIS A LA 9 BOICOT A DISNEY.DONT GO TO SEE THE 9. BOICOT DISNEY!!",0
2718,"This is carefully calculated marketing research by Disney--it should be applauded for that. But as a film, it should not exist. All of the PC boxes are checked. Much of the story feels like filler and the plot from FA is hardly advanced. It is clear that the director has no interest in Finn's character and is mostly cares about Rey/Kylo/Luke. Skip this film and watch the original Lucas films instead.",0
2719,"If I ignore all the other Star Wars movies the plot of this movie is still contrived.  The entire second act of the movie only happens as a result of using the ""idiot plot"" trope.  The plot is not driven by characters motivations, instead bizarre scenarios are concocted solely to get characters to act in certain ways.In the Context of the previous 7 movies this film makes even less sense.  No context is given to explain how the characters we are supposed to relate to got themselves or the republic into this situation  Episdoes I-VI are made irrelevant in the opening crawl  ""The FIRST ORDER reigns. Having decimated the peaceful Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke now deploys his merciless legions to seize military control of the galaxy.""  Episode VII turns out to be a giant Red Herring.  Who is Snoke?  Why did Lukes light saber reach out to Rey?  Why did we hear Obi-Wans voice in Rey's force Dream?  The entire plot of TFA revolved around a Map to Luke.  Why did this map exist?  Why did R2-D2 have half the map?  Why did R2-D2 wake from his coma when Rey showed up?  Apparently none of that mattered.I understand making an attempt to subvert the audiences expectations but this movie just seemed to go out of its way to trash everything leading up to it.",0
2720,"Se parece en mucho a Empire strike back's, solo que de fina  principio, primero tenemos a Luke y a Rey en un planeta distante en una isla, donde Rey busca respuestas, Luke parece un anciano decepcionado de la vida y dese terminar con los Jedi, después vemos a la Rebelión sufrir muchas bajas y llegan a un planeta de sal donde hay una base rebelde que todo es muy similar a la batalla de Hoth, al final sobreviven muy pocos. Leia debió morir en el espacio y por la ""fuerza"" regresa del vacio del espacio a la nave y se convierte en la única sobreviviente de los altos mandos, ya que también muere el almirante Acbark, Luke muere de la forma mas extraña y sin sentido que eh visto, Phamas es un personaje extrañamente parecido a Boba Fett, es decir, es una inútil, que habla poco y tiene aspecto mas de Bounty hunter que de Stor trooper y también muere, Snoke es un CGI que también muere por Kylo Ren, el cual lo mata en 5 segundos y le ofrece a Rey se una a el para conquistar la galaxia (algo así como el ofrecimiento de Vader a Luke), Rey lo rechaza y Kylo toma el control del Firt order y orden matar a todos y a todo, sin dejar nada vivo. Por lo que me da la impresión de que Disney desea matar a todos los personajes clásicos para meter nuevos, seguramente por la edad de los actores. Considero que no es la forma de matar a los personajes, pudieron hacerlo mejor, toda la película tiene momentos de humor innecesarios, se deja en claro que los Skywalker ya no importan porque llega una nueva camada de héroes para venderte nuevas figuras de acción. Si crees que Episodio I era mala, esta le arrebata ese lugar.",0
2721,"First the good - Rey and Kylo's scenes up until the predictable ""join me and we'll rule the galaxy"" and the predictable ""no"".  Also, Rey's dark cave scene.Now the bad, which completely overwhelmed the good scenes, starting from least important:First, terrible humor right out of the gate (felt like a mediocre snl skit) - set a bad tone from the start. Second, the major reveals of how Kylo turned dark, and Rey's parentage, were completely underwhelming and contrived.  Finally, the entire way of handling Luke was a travesty and I've only gotten more upset about it the more I've thought about it the past few days.  Starting from his throwing away the lightsaber, to the weird (and again terrible humor) of the milking scene.  And on to the rushed and contrived Kylo Ren turning bad story, and finally to the stupid hologram fight scene.  And if all of those things weren't bad enough, they decide to go for the grand finale by killing Luke off in the least satisfying way possible. The only emotion I felt was anger towards Rian Johnson.  The Luke in that movie was not the real Luke by any stretch of the imagination.Rian Johnson wanted to be edgy by killing the past, but he killed off Star Wars completely.  What I watched wasn't Star Wars, it was a mediocre film in some other galaxy. It's almost as if 'The Last Jedi' is a prequel to Johnson's upcoming non-skywalker trilogy.I tolerated the Force Awakens because at least it felt like a Star Wars movie, but now I think this entire trilogy was a huge mistake.  It's going to take a miraculous episode IX to save this mess.",0
2722,"It was meh, I enjoyed it because it's Star Wars, but I was underwhelmed, I get the where the director was trying to go, out with the old in with the new. But it could have been done so much better, delivered so much better, all the jumping around, unsatisfying answers to TFA questions. I wasn't even that big of a fan of TFA for ripping off ANH but it still felt like Star Wars, I was intrigued with the new characters and where'd they go. TLJ, just idk what it is, but it just didn't sit right with me. I'm hoping Ep. 9, can pull it all together, but really TLJ felt like an ending not a middle, so its over all tone, continuity, etc, just felt off.",0
2723,"Episode VIII: Revange für George LucasWer die Episoden  I bis III unübertrefflich furchtbar fand, wird nun eines Besseren belehrt. Episode VIII ist mindestens so übel die die Prequels. CGI-Snork: lächerlich. Rote Klapperpowerrangerninjas mit Elektropeitschen: unterster B-Movie-Style. Dialoge: atemberaubend dümmlich bis kitschig (der Schluss sieht aus wie ein Weihnachts-Heal-The-World-Musikvideo und vergleicht einen Besen mit einem Lichtschwert- ""klasse"" Anspielung auf das arme Star Wars Kid) und gespickt mit Zitaten der Episoden IV bis VI, als hätte während des Drehs jemand in regelmäßigen Abständen in einen Hut mit Zettelchen gegriffen, auf denen die OT-Sprüchlein standen, die es dann wie beim Impro-Theater galt sofort irgendwie einzubinden in den blutleeren Klamauk. Chewbacca (frisst ein Hähnchen und grummelt eines dieser Glotzviecher an), C-3PO (soll nicht 'so ein besorgtes Gesicht machen' -hahaha- und gibt wie immer fatale Wahrscheinlichkeiten zum besten), R2-D2 (piepst und projeziert mal wieder Leia in die Bude)... einfach mal aufs Tapet geworfen ohne Sinn oder irgendeine Emotion. BB2 steuert einen gedoptwirkend, laufsaurierartig rennenden AT-ST, der wie ein VW-Käfer passenderweise die komplette Karosserie verliert, um das Innere zu entblößen. Die Rebellen kämpfen mit dünnblechigen, verdecklosen, auseinanderfallenden Seifenkisten gegen verkrüppelte AT-AT-Verschandelungen. Dennoch hält eine hauchzarte Blechdose dem offenbar nur handwarm temperierten ""Todesstern""-Wurstgeschütz-Strahl stand... Die ""Handlung"" scheint von einer untalentierten Schülergruppe auf sagenhafte ermüdende 2 1/2-Stunden zusammengestümpert zu sein unter Aufbringung aller denkbaren Steckungsmittel wie einer Stampede, Meerestiermilchmöpsen, einer Actiongame-Oma (Maz) oder einer Super-Leia als Zombie-Mary-Poppins.  Dazu noch hier eine Verfolgungsjagd, da ein neu benötigter Schlüsselmeister, hier ein Lehrer, der nicht will... furchtbar. Der Falke massakriert ungehindert eine komplette Tie-Fighter-Rotte im Alleingang, ein einfacher X-Wing schießt einen ganzen Sternenzerstörer Stück für Stück zu Schrott beobachtet vom rothaarigen Vollhonk,der anschließend noch per Scherzanruf (!) veralbert wird, der neuerdings schlafende Neffen mördende, weinerliche, griesgrämige, Superfeigling Luke versteht sich auf nicht detektierbare Holografie und Rey und die hässliche Emofratze haben eine Telephatie-Skypenummer am Laufen. Im Weltall gibt's nun Schwerkraft für amtlich analoge Kugelbombenteppiche und der Hyperraumsprung als nichtbezwingbare Kamikazewaffe zum Zerstören beliebiger Raumschiffe wird just neu erfunden. Da ist keiner bisher drauf gekommen mal eben ein paar alte Schiffe auf die Gegner zu fliegen mit Autopilot und voll Stoff, soso. Männer sind durchweg Idionten, lilahaarige und hexennasige Scheusale sind weiblich und schlau. AUsnahme Rey: Mary Sue in Reinstform. Ein Farbiger, eine Asiatin, ein unrasierter Europäer, ein stotternder (!) Lando-Verräter, jede Menge unnütze Handlungsstränge und Nebenschauplätze, degenerierte Waffenhändler auf dem Casinoplaneten, amerikanische Namen, Bügeleisen in Startreklogo-Form, Snoke, Luke, Chromeimertrooperfrau: alle tot. Yoda wieder mal da, Imperium ist ein dumme Kaspertruppe und das ständige Hinterhergereise erinnert an Kampfstern Galaktika.Rogue One war mies, schlecht gestaltet und öde, Episode VII ging als dreist-satirische Zitate-Schleuder durch, aber Episode VIII hat sicher nur einen echten Gewinner hervorgebracht: George Lucas, der jetzt gewiss sein sein, dass es eben doch schlimmer kommen kann als bei seinen Prequels.EInzig das Star Wars Holiday Special ist natürlich noch ein wenig mieser.

2724,"Truly a low point in the Star Wars saga. It felt more like Spaceballs than Star Wars with the introduction of juvenile humor.

Any hope that the Star Wars sequels would become something as good as the original trilogy is dashed in this movie.  Other than the few Luke scenes, nothing works from a dramatic or a logical perspective.",0
2734,"Not only The Last Jedi is a bad movie and by far the worst Star Wars, but it actually succeeded to make The Force Awakens even worse than I initially thought it was.I tolerated the lack of ambition of episode 7, thinking it was just here to introduce a bunch of new characters and factions, but episode 8 just took a big dump on it, destroying all the potential of this new trilogy.Unlike what I've read, there is nothing bold or brave in this movie, unless you think destroying this saga is a brave thing to do.As most people here, I thought the writing was poor, the humour was stupid (and not in a good way), bad dynamic between the characters, the casino arc was childish, Luke, Snoke, Phasma and even Rey were wasted, etc... And what's up with people breathing in space like Rose's sister ?? No idea were this trainwreck of a trilogy is heading, but I honestly don't care anymore - I'm out.These movies had so much potential because the Star Wars lore is so rich, and yet TLJ felt like any other sci-fi movie addressed to a generation of entitled kids that expect the own the whole world without any training or hard work.",0
2735,"One Star....Half for the score and sound, it was amazing.  The other half goes to the visuals, again it was amazing to watch.That's where I stopped liking it.  Not a fan of some of the forced humour.  The Slow speed chase?  Leia Poppins was very creepy to watch.  Luke Skywalker deserves better than this, did the writers even watch the original films.  I get that the old characters need to make way for the new ones, I just wish they didn't make them look like fools while doing it.I'm not sure how JJ is going to finish the saga...most of the plot points he set up are dead now.Save your money, watch it on Netflix.",0
2736,"While this film was a visual spectacle that even occasionally managed to make me laugh, it was not a good film by any objective measure. Nor did I like it very much. In my opinion, the core problem is that the film suffered from horrible writing. The overall plot was ridiculous and failed to produce any meaningful pay off at the end. The whole plot could have been avoided, if certain characters would have acted normally at certain plot points. This created unrealistic conflicts. The key characters had hardly any development during the film, while I was left with the feeling that deus ex machina was the favorite tool by the writer/director to solve conflicts. The main character, Rey, continued to be extremely badly written (but I did not have problems with Daisy's acting itself). While other two leads, Finn and Poe, were reduced to irrational characters in favor of several new characters that did not not add anything substantial to the story or to the setting. In addition, the Star Wars setting, that has been established rather comprehensively over several films, was forgotten as the writer/director needed to change the rules in order to write himself out of idiotic plot points (and still failed) or in an attempt to give the audience cheap gags. Star Wars always had humor, but it was mostly tied to the context of the scene and character interaction. While I could continue to write on and on about different problems I had with the film, suffice to say the it fails badly at three elements of good story telling - setting, characters and plot. This baffles me, as Disney seems to be able to pull off these things a lot better in their animations and even many of the Marvel films, but somehow fails so utterly when it comes Star Wars.",0
2737,"This movie was awful, I am a star wars fan who watched and liked all the previous 6 movies and played games like star wars the knights of the old republic but even then I couldn't find myself liking this movie at all. It's very questionable when big actors like Mark Hamil have given up and are willing to admit it's basically crap but even just watching the angry joe review on youtube reveals several horrible problems with the movie. They have unlikeable characters shoe horned in like finn and rose who progress the story so little and have the typical relationship of true love in under 12 hours of knowing one another. There's problems for start to finish whether it's the sith becoming ever more encapsulated into stereotypical roles (like the sith apprentices becoming angsty and senseless, sweaty teens along with the old masters being ugly, old and decrepit megalomaniacs, both with no real logic or personality past being crazy selfish) or even the Jedi being short in number but having no interesting characters either. Luke is all over the place (no wonder Mark Hamil seemed depressed) and becomes an indecisive mess who does very little throughout the whole movie and pulls out one trick right at the end before disappearing. Rey has more skill and capability with no training than Luke ever did, random love scenes, terrible sub plots and sadly the direction of the movies leaves little hope for a quick resolution to all this. They have really run the old series through the mud with Luke being the polar opposite of what he should be, powers coming out of nowhere and being illogical and so many other issues. I am sad to say that even I (a complete shill who normally buys anything to support series he likes) won't be buying this movie when it comes out. Even phasma, Kylo Ren and Snoke have poor performances with nothing to lead you to care or want to see what happens next. I feel Disney have really upset the balance of the force here.",0
2738,"Stars Wars is dead. Disney and Hollywood have absolutely ruined this. The stupidity of those in charge of making this film in the way they have is astounding; the movie and the franchise is ruined by contemporary cultural politics. Two words: ""It sucks!""",0

All the pretty visuals in the world still can't mask the piss-poor storyline, hateable new characters, obnoxious SJW propaganda, plot holes galore,  and some downright bizarre decisions in pushing the lore forward in the most stupid way imaginable. Star Wars truly is dead, and Rey is still a perfect woman who don't need no man. What a joke.It also shows that critics are just politically-motivated sell-outs that like anything that's ""provocative"" or ""unpredictable"" without thinking twice about the awful screenplay. Worse than the Star Wars Holiday Special, 'cause at least that was made with passion!",0
2740,This movie was completely disappointing and the political messages do not belong in my Star Wars. I'm dumping the Star Wars brand until this gets a hard reboot with a different person in charge that isn't going to shove politics down my throat.I don't need star wars.,0
2741,"The movie was a massive waste of potential.As a stand alone movie is poor at best, but as a movie in the saga is just a terrible episode.The story is a mess, Rey plot was for nothing, Finn plot was for nothing, Poe plot was for nothing.I wish to see a meaningful movie, but every theme in this movie is wortless, get to nowhere and is so meesy that even a child get a confused idea about it. Like for example, rich are bad, then why we do? Break the casino and terrorize them, and free the animals too, that sure will help.Snoke, Chewbaca, Phasma, Ackbar, Hux, Poe and many other character were so useless in the movie.The movie should deserve a 2/10 or 3/10, but the specialized critique make me vote 0, to compensate for their lies",0
2742,"One of the few movies I went to the cinema to watch. And one of the few movies I wanted to walk out from. Basically three, extremely long action sequences and what there is in story, is a complete rehash of the other star wars movies. The action scenes were frankly just boring. I almost fell asleep. Extremely annoying is also the raving review by the press. Seriously? You give this move a 85 on metacritic and a much cooler space movie such as Valerian or guardians of the galaxy 1 less?",0
2743,"About a third of the way through this I stopped caring about the pointless plot and just let the film wash over me as a pure audiovisual experience. A hollow experience without substance or emotional engagement.

This one is poorly written, bland,and without soul.",0
2744,"I give this movie 2 only because of good visual quality. Its the only thing good in this movie and honestly its not very important for me. There are few key things for Star Wars stories: charismatic characters, force mystery, confrontation of light and dark and adventures. These are things made Star Wars so attractive and there are non of them in Disney's episodes. They made a typical story about superhero like others of Marvel. But this is not what I expected.",0
2745,"You ruined it. Pretty much. KKKennedy and Rian Johnson, the duo of Hollywood nightmares. To think they have more roles in the Star Wars frachise, yet, is shocking...The only positive thing to say is how beautiful and lush the CGI and film was.K Kennedy should resign, and Rian should not get that Trilogy.

2748,"It pains me to do this. I've always loved the Star Wars movies, but this can barely call itself that. While the Force Awakens was by no means a great movie, it did set up some interesting plot and backstory questions moving forward. Then this movie came along and completely destroyed any hope this new trilogy had. It ruined the backstory questions surrounding both Rey and Snoke, though I can't say how or why without spoiling the movie. The Last Jedi succumbed to every bad trend developing in modern movies. Painfully awkward nonchalant humor? The Last Jedi has it. A useless story arc with a social justice message? The Last Jedi has it. While Daisy Ridley once again does a fine job in her role, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and just about everyone else deliver subpar performances. Neither Mark Hamill nor Carrie Fisher are anything to be amazed by in this movie, though they aren't as bad as some of their co-stars. The plot starts where the Force Awakens ended, which was in a decent place, and completely destroys everything about it. Story-wise I seriously don't know what they're going to do with the final episode. The writing seemed so unbelievably lazy that it could be considered borderline disrespectful. There were scenes that made me die a little inside at how either badly written or poorly executed they were, including a space scene in which something so unbelievably cringe-worthy and ridiculous happens that you want to get up and walk out of the movie (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). The worst part to me is the fact that these movies aren't done like Star Wars movies anymore. The writers and directors seem to have no respect or care for the history of the saga and what its many elements mean. The way the characters use the force, pilot ships, and just generally act feels less and less like Star Wars every time one of these movies comes out. I would NOT recommend this film to anyone who values their money and time.",0

After this, I will NOT be giving my money to LucasFilm as long as Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson are employed there.  I'm only giving this movie a 2 because, according to the math, 0's do NOT count toward the average score.  If they did, this movie would be a 2.8-2.9, and NOT a 4.6.  At appears 1 does count towards the score, but nothing is certain, but 2 and above definitely count.",0
2752,"I have been reading a lot about this movie since I saw it about 2 weeks ago. I avoided all the hype leading up to it and never managed to see it in theaters. I didn’t pay attention and didn’t even know that there was this whole back and forth about this movie with trolls, backlash, etc… and I certainly didn’t have a “fan theory” to apply to this movie. Oh, and I am not a bot or overzealous “fanboy” either.I grew up on Star Wars original trilogy as a kid. My brother and I had (and loved) the Star Wars action figures and other toys, it was part of our world back then.  I saw the prequel trilogy and was generally a bit disappointed, but now I see that everything, including disappointment, is relative. I actually liked more about Revenge of the Sith than I disliked. So, onto this movie: I hated it, flat-out. To me, it was a combination of cop-outs and cringeworthily moments.  I’ve read a lot of reviews from professional movie critics and have seen the same thing over and over: something along the lines of “this movie bravely went in a new direction and did not feel ‘constrained’ by the past”  . Pause right there: this is not a good thing in and of itself, especially when the tradition established by the prior movies create the coat-tails that this movie is riding on. It reminds me exactly of how I thought about Peter Jackson’s treatment of “The Hobbit” after he did such a good job overall with “Lord of the Rings”. Seeing the bar drop so low can make one with standards become very cynical. The fan reviews appear to be written, for the most part, by people who saw something that frustrated them so much that they felt compelled to vent about it, as the only avenue open to them. That’s where I stand, even knowing probably no one will read this. And, yes, I opened this account solely to write this one review for this one movie. Other reviewers blasted so many holes in the plot that I don’t feel the need to do a similar laundry-list of what is wrong with this movie, and honestly there are a few re-occurring complaints that I don’t find to be a problem.Cop-outs:Who was Snoke, where did he come from, why was he so powerful, how was he able to build the First order out of the defeated Empire. No explanation and no plausibility offeredHow did the Rebel Alliance go from victor to diminished band of outlaws?What is the backstory with Luke and Ben Solo? Too much is glossed overIt’s like the Rebel victory at Endor and Jakuu didn’t even happen. Kylo Ren: not a convincing villain at all, reminds me of Edward from Twilight Cringe-worthy moments:Prank phone call from Po to Hux- this really set the bar so low right from the start…Porgs.. and interaction with Chewbacca.. culminating in one of them wearing a ^&%$ porg-sized headset in the cockpit of Millennium Falcon The Rose character… out of place in the Star wars universe. Too preachy and naive and forced relationship with Finn (who I thought was supposed to be involved with Rey ?). Casino scenes. Over the top CGI characters plugging coins into BB8 lot a slot machine, then he (?) shoots them out like a machine gun at some guard Of course, princess Leia’s using the force to suck her back into the ship.. jeezus that was one of the worst moments in cinematic history right there. Re-hash of battle of Hoth : it had some good points, but too much like a re-occurring sequence from Empire Strikes back. At least there were no salt tuan-tuans… but the crystal coyotes of salt-world were one of those out-of-place childish elements that were used because, you know, we have CGI and can place anything in a movie. BB8 hot-wiring a scout walker on board Star Destroyer.Rey not needing any real training to become bad-ass force user able to levitate rocks that Luke couldn’t even do.Wasted scene with Rey going into hole on Luke’s planet wasted time where nothing profound is uncovered or learned.The whole way Luke was. Obi-wan also “lost” Anakin to the dark side, but he wasn’t the same grouch that they turned Luke into. Agree with others that the whole idea of Luke leaving a map to his location is in direct contradiction to the way Luke was when he was found. The defenses of these departures from the established Star Wars universe have been described as “brave” or  “visionary” or whatever by the professional critics I have read, but many other fans, think they suck. If the only measure of quality is if you go against all tradition and continuity that came before you, we could all write stories where water flows uphill and the critics would be singing our praises because we were so brave to go against tradition (and physics) and do something “new”. I’m glad that I don’t feel the need to be as attached to this as I did when I was young and impressionable, but Star Wars is now dead to me, I won’t bother with Episode 9.",0
2753,You know this movie is sh*t when it can't even break in to the top 100 on the torrent sites. ROFL what a pile of sh*t.Keep your SJW BS and crap Politics OUT OF STAR WARS  Boycot all Disney Star Wars,0
2754,"This is Spaceballs 2, not Star Wars: Episode VIIILike someone else said (Hamill?), this is a space comedy for kids.  I don't like it, but can understand why Disney think it would be a good idea. It's all about money in the end and they don't really care about us older Star Wars fans.  I just don't get why they had to ruin all the SW lore of the previous movies, and why be so disrespectful about it? In many ways this movie is much worse than The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. They were at least made by the creator of the SW universe and even if it was targeted towards children, it was still felt like it took place in the same world.  If you take away Jar Jar, some cheesy CGI and a few questionable ideas (Jango Fett clones), it's at least ""Star Wars movies"", even if I and many other Star Wars fans didn't like them.I thought The Force Awakens was ok. Yes, it was basically a scene-by-scene remake of Episode 4, but it brought Star Wars back in a respectful way. I also enjoyed the great visual story telling by Abrahams and Mindel.I really loved Rogue One. Sure, nostalgia had a lot to do with, but it was also respectful to the universe.On a personal level I thought the slapstick comedy was awful, not to mention the casino scenes... The Empire acts like they are led by ""Dark Helmet"" in Spaceballs. Finn was a great character in TFA, but here they just throw all his character advancement away.I feel really sorry for Boyega, Fisher and Hamill. Their characters are totally ruined in TLJ.To me, this movie is a parody of SW. It would be more appropriate to call it Spaceballs 2.",0
2755,"The only reason it's not a flat-out 0 is that the photography, the visuals, the sound, and the CGI were on point. Otherwise, it's regurgitated garbage, a fun sci-fi adventure for people who are watching SW for the first time, but ultimately boring, inconsistent, and carries a severe absence of death in conversation and plot-points to make way for Disney-esque one-liners and simple visual ""entertainment"". Null character development, horrid illogical deaths to characters that deserved better, slow story, and little to no development.",0
2757,While the acting for a star wars movie has never been better the plotting has gotten worse. The amount of plot holes or people just making stupid choices makes this movie hard to watch. Anything set up in 7 has been undercut by this film. If you like the characters then or are a fan of star wars then maybe 9 is worth watching otherwise save yourself the money and don't go to this or 9 when it comes out.,0
2758,"This entire trilogy is an interesting Star Wars spin-off/fan fiction. Almost everything taken from the old series have been twisted and perverted, the deeper struggles and moralities have also been replaced by Disney-style, good>>>bad, one-dimensional baby plots.The original trilogy, which was specifically designed for kids, has more meaning to this junk, which we can only conclude that it was designed for 2-year-old toddlers.",0
2759,I felt they movie destroyed Luke Sky Walker's character. I wish I could a get refund for the two tickets I had pre-ordered.The movie inexplicably dismissed some intriguing plot points about several of the character's back story. I am very disappointed. At least the special effect were good.,0
2760,"I started with a zero, but changed slowly up, then down to a reasonable score.  This is indeed the ""Beautiful Mess"" that one critic called it.  The scenes are BREATHTAKING.  There were literally gasps of how beautiful the imagery was.  If I were to want a cinematographer, it would be Rian.As a WRITER, he's a complete mess.  The narrative goes in one direction.  The meta-narrative goes in a completely different direction. Neither going in a Star Wars direction.  Rian had some nods, but they were all visual (as expected from such visually focused director).  There is NO adherence to the laws of the Star Wars universe and is a giant middle finger to the whole series.  Then, if there was any doubt that this was intentional, Kylo blatantly states it in the movie.  This movie literally washes away all that would constitute the IP we know and love.The plot holes this movie opens up are gargantuan and the contempt for the property is clear.  The overt heavy handed push from above is evident.  Kathleen Kennedy has killed this universe and is trying to rewrite it to fit her own ideology.  This will be made evident when Star Wars IX opens to the worst since Attack of the Clones.I know I'm not going to see it.",0

It actually managed to utterly ruin well established characters with the pathetic social justice infused script.Shameful display.",0
2763,Cheesy AWFUL badly timed humour which meant you never connected with the characters or the emotion. Meaning I just didnt care. In fact it felt so tonally incorrect at times I winced and squirmed in my seat. Like you might do whilst watching a really bad stand up comedian or your uncle twerk dancing with your auntie at a wedding. WTF!The opening scene with Poe and Hux felt like a Christmas Pantomime. All tension evaporated the moment he pretended to be on hold. DREADFUL! I didn't mind the Porgs or BB8 but serious evil and heroic characters should be just that. Luke seems to have been replaced? Mark Hamill was playing a guy called Luke. But it wasn't Luke. I didn't mind him being a recluse or grumpy. The trailer looked moody and cool. When he appeared in the film he was an unlikeable douche. AND HE MILKS A SPACE COW!! He is LUKE SKYWALKER not a bloody dairy farmer! I feel sorry for MArk Hamill. He has been betrayed. I can see why he disagreed fundamentally with the script. AND WHAT was with him chucking his lightsaber over his shoulder. It felt like a blooper they decided to keep in! I think that one moment is a brilliant metaphor for what Disney and Rian (Comedy) Johnson have done to the Star Wars legend.  Jedi Training!? Rey received NO training. I get more training at my Monday night Yoga class in Peckham than she received. Yet all of a sudden she is a Jedi Master WTF. I LOVED Empire Strikes Back becuase as a little boy I got to learn how to be a Jedi. How to use the force. I learned through Yoda about the dark side and light of human nature. Here Luke makes a lame Joke about reaching out! UTTER garbage. Train the girl. I wanted Rey to prevail from a struggle. Zero character arc and as a result I dont give a Monkeys. SPACE WALKING LEIA! Did no one say anything to Rian! Not one person pointed out that that was a crap idea. No One mentioned Mary Poppins! O........M........G that was bad. Visually it was great. But the writing and the characters was awful. Get Garth Edwards back!  At least he understood the Star Wars Universe. The last 3 minutes of Rogue One were better than the entire Marvel-esque gag fest that was Last Jedi. Why not get Get George R. R. Martin to write it! He'd do a fantastic job. At least he'd understand the human condition and struggle. I liked the political message! I liked the diversity. But all that has been flushed down the pan with the most expensive SNL skit in history. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO,0
2764,"I don't normally write reviews. It's been a week since I've seen it and I am still confused as to what the director was trying to achieve. He hoped that people would be surprised by how fun and funny the movie was, but the humor was just awful and misplaced and took you out of the seriousness of the scenes and the situation.I thought the Luke and Rey stuff was ""alright"" and I just wish there had been more screen time given to them, instead of that stupid casino scene which was completely pointless to the plot. I think they're absolutely brilliant actors and they didn't utilize them enough. I felt like they could have done more with the already established and meme friendly characters as well. They could have added way more emotionally traumatizing scenes using those characters, I was almost ready for that. I don't mind them ending the old stories and reinventing Star Wars, I was ready for that as well. But what I ended up seeing was this hollow mess of a film. Like they wrote 7 different stories for the film, cut the scenes up into strips mixed them up and glued them back together and said ""that'll do!"". I didn't think any of it was clever, I didn't wrestle with my morals, I didn't feel any emotional resonance with any of the dramatic things that happened. It was just frankly ridiculous to the point in being comical in places (Leia). Most of the important scenes are just copy pasted from the old films but done way worse. There are continuity errors ALL over the place. Huge swathes of the plot were pointless to the point I was left exhausted 2/3 of the way through the film, I was ready for it to be over before the last act even started. Some of the random plot props they through in also made no point or sense (the books in the tree, we'd never seen them before so it made no impact). I think getting this director on was a complete mistake. He wasted so much potential. The GOOD parts of the film were the Graphics, the start was a pretty good space battle. I wish there were more interesting and visually appealing scenes other than the Casino, but the plot left no room for that. A couple of interactions between Rey and Luke were funny or interesting and left you wanting more. I really wanted to enjoy this film or feel something for this film, but the only thing I felt was disappointment. I'm quite jealous of the people who did enjoy it and don't judge them in any way, but now I'm really worried for the future of films in general if this is what critics think is a great film. Valerian had more of a star wars feel than this was, it had more charm and characters and great opening scenes and establishing shots that made it a believable universe and was in general much, much better. Not perfect and a bit long but it was still coherant and none of it was pointless. Oh well..",0
2765,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE CRITICS —I am shocked at how poor this movie is. It ranges from dull to the absurd, and at times bordering on comedic for all the wrong reasons. Both the action and comedy fall really flat. At its best the movie is mildly entertaining in places. The Force Awakens was not perfect but was a largely decent film, with some standout great moments that you would be happy to rewatch. I cannot think of any part of this movie I would want to rewatch, no scene was that great. The plot? What plot..? Nothing really happens. Nothing is really explained or explored in any depth with regard to the characters, you are largely left with the same questions you had at the end of Force Awakens and some new ones. Want to know who Snoke is? Not gonna happen. And it generally goes that way.Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker are briefly given tiny plot reveals about their past but nothing greatly significant, and for a 2.5hr movie, it begs the question WHY? The story does not advance in any meaningful ways, and subsequently feels like a wasted opportunity. Much of the film has you trudge through painfully familiar territory, space battles, chase scenes, light saber fights etc. But none of it felt particularly exciting or necessary. It’s like the plot could be condensed into a 10 min video and then the rest was just Star Wars filler. It’s easily one of the worst films I’ve seen in 2017. It’s was dreadfully average in every way.",0
2766,"It's quite simple really, all you got to do is imagine if EA started making movies...",0
2767,"Visually it is awesome, technically too. It is a shame that the characters are so stupid and without any development except for a disgusting version of Luke. It is not feminist in either way, it is a movie where women are empty and men are evil or stupid. Not really a good effort to create compelling, complex and engaging female characters. And there's a really boring story full of loopholes.",0
2768,"well i came out i like it and hated it, their where positives (the action ) and the negatives (the social justice **** ) when leaving the theater i mostly focused on the negatives even though i was trying to focus on the positives. no matter how hard i tried the negatives were just to bad to forgive. the female social justice **** was just to much when you see the movie look at how much the females come out on top by actions and by what they decide is best for them all. dont even get me started on Luke Im not going to see it again",0
2769,"Pros:    Space-battles, light-saber duels: Lots of nice eye-candy    Mark Hamill. It is almost as if he had waited for decades for playing in this movie. Which makes me feel a bit sorry for him.Cons:    More plot holes than you could shake a space cruiser at, held together by ridiculous coincidences.    One-dimensional characters who talk about but show no emotions and who, when discarded, leave the audience indifferent - other than established characters who are discarded for no discernible purpose.    Characters whose behaviour seems to serve no rational goal.    Entire plot lines that severed absolutely no purpose but to have the characters pontificate.    Serious breaks with the sagas' premises to allow for developments that again leaves the audience puzzled.    Scenes as absurd as a flying English nanny they made me wonder what Disney thinks about its audience.All in all, Disney seems to go the same path with the Star Wars franchise as Sony went with Ghost Busters: Forget the hitherto loyal fan-base, clean the slate - and then play silly games with it.A New Hope was the first movie I ever went to twice. I count observing my kids as they watched episodes IV to VI in wonder to my fond memories. After the prequels and The Force Awakens, Rogue One seemed to be a turn to the better. But now, I think Disney is on spot with its message of The Last Jedi: Leave the past behind you.",0

I Won't buy another theatre ticket to any movie with this 2 individuals having something to do with a movie again.",0
2775,"This movie was definitely underwhelming and, ultimately, disppointing in regards to the expectations fans had after The Force Awakens (which was not perfect but set up what should have been an incredible sequel).In spite of some curious choices by R. Johnson and a completly useless subplot, what I believe to be the main problem is the complete lack of internal coherence within the (soon-to-be) new trilogy, as Ryan goes out of his way to reverse everything Abrams did, with sometimes complete disregard for the stories and characters presented in the previous movie, or even the logic of his own movie.",0
2776,"Fails to deliver on what was promised with The Force Awakens. It truly seems like it was written by new writers that had no interest in continuing the set up from the previous movie. This led to a movie that created nothing but plot holes in the overall story. I am no longer interested in watching any more Star Wars movies (Was never a Star Wars fan to begin with, so no big loss) and will stick with movies/series that try to be well written and cohesive.",0
2777,"It is actually very simple. This movie has nothing good in it. It has OK visuals, OK sound and that's it. EVERYTHING else is bad. It is bad not because ""it ruins SW"", it is objectively bad. Bad characters, bad dialog, horrible tone shifts, idiotic scenes, moralizing. Every non-technical dimension is a disaster.",0
2778,"Disney did something even Lucas couldn't do and that is destroy Star Wars. Except for the original trilogy, I'm done with it.  I guess if you could separate this from the rest of the Star Wars movies then this would be watchable but for those of us who have been in love with Star Wars since the first movie, this movie is an abomination.  How does Rey know the force so well?  How can you destroy a whole fleet of ships with warp drive?  What point was there to the Asian and purple haired woman?  Why didn't she just tell them their plan instead causes a mutiny? Why is Luke portrayed as such a defeated man? Isn't he supposed to be a Jedi?  Who is Snoke?  How did the defeated empire build a planet sized death-star? Why didn't Luke just fly to the battle instead of committing force suicide?  None of this adds up.  Whoever wrote and directed this pile of crap should be ashamed.  The only thing that could possibly fix this is to take the movie back and start over.",0

Characters do totally irrational things and whole plot threads have no reason for events or character behavior. I left the theater not knowing who was alive and who was dead because it was so ambiguous and without logic. This movie is worse than the prequel trilogy. There is a light saber duel in the middle of the movie that is OK, although it is over-choreographed and some actors miss their mark, making it look like a silly dance in places. I don't think they can undo the harm in the next sequel, I wish they could retract the film and make it again properly.",0
2786,"Universe-UnknownThe Last Jedi Movie started with a strong beginning with amazing graphics, action and beautiful visuals but then 30 minutes past we all can see the cliff closing in and wow its a fall. This movie shows that it was newly directed and rewritten, characters have been recreated to fill a another roll to make small attack on crowds of people and force political views that are not needed. And to make Luke Skywalker character look so small and powerless makes the movie unbelievable. True Star Wars fans know who Skywalker is and to see him give up is unreal. Unfortunately this movie will go down as the worst Star Wars movie in history with its broken story and sad character development. Luke would be honored to train a worthy apprentice like Rey so to think that he would just ignore her and drink green space milk while the galaxy is under attack by the darkside is ridiculous.",0

My wife and kids treat me well...but I would trade it all if doing so meant that I could un-watch The Last Jedi.History will probably remember this film as ""The Star Wars with a reenactment of the O.J. Simpson chase as the main story"". And that's if they're lucky.I can't believe I'm typing this, but in the first 10 minutes of the film, the rebels successfully disable an enemy warship by flying straight up to it in an X-wing, calling the ship's captain directly - and being patched straight through to him, then feigning a bad audio connection to distract him while they blow up all the cannons on the deck. It's an astonishing early indication that Rian Johnson made this film using roughly the same process that a 7-year-old might use when he starts talking to other 7-year-olds without thinking about what he was going to say first.For the next 2 hours and 32 minutes, the audience gets punched in the intellectual balls over, and over, and over again. Then the movie ends.The budget was well spent on visual effects, but everything else about the movie from the script, to the plot itself, to the dozens of wildly useless scenes and characters was flat out stupefying.So bad.",0
2797,"I'm very disappointed as a Star Wars fan. I left the theater feeling numb. The franchise has been officially ruined by Disney, and turned into a Marvelesque movie where jokes abound, and nothing is taken too seriously, especially the bad guys. The Star Wars mythos is dumbed down, marginalized and made fun of; nothing really seems to matter or have gravity anymore, as Rey says of the force, ""power . . . that makes things float."", gone are the wise words of Obi-wan Kenobi, and Jedi Master Yoda. I long for the wooden acting of the prequels, for at least they kept true to Star Wars. The Force Awakens made me optimistic for the new trilogy, and The Last Jedi ended my optism while ruining the character arcs that were set up in the in number 7. In the opening scene we have an inappropriate use of humour from Poe Dameron directed at General Hux which makes the villians comical and make them less menacing. Imagine the same happening to Darth Vader in the original trilogy. Following the humor Poe makes fun of General Hux's skin color, calling him pasty. Imagine if the same was said about a black person? It's okay to make fun of white males today. Everyone else is off limits because you'll be accused of racism or sexism, or some other ism. I typically wouldn't care about such a comment, because I'm not that sensitive, but it infuriates me because of the double standard.As I said, the character arcs were destroyed from The Force Awakens. Rey who I really enjoyed as a character in the first movie turns out to have been sold off by her junk dealer parents. This removes all the mystery from Rey, and makes it impossible to accept how perfect she is. She knows the force extremely well and can use a lightsaber without an ounce of training, but there is absoloutely no reason for it, it just is. No where in the Star Wars universe does that occur, even with the virgin brith of Anakin Skywalker; he himself had to learn before he became a great Jedi.I liked Rey so much in the first movie, and now I no longer care where her story ends up. They did nothing to advance the character. Following that failure, Kylo Ren kills Supreme Leader Snoke before we have a chance to learn anything about him. This character was set up to be super powerful in the TFA, and here in TLJ we have him show his massive power by knocking Hux to the ground as a hologram, and he plays with Kylo and Rey, yet he can't feel Kylo Ren moving and preparing Luke's lightsaber next to him to dismember him. It's amazing. What's the point?The characters go nowhere in the movie, and neither does the story. Finn is another character who has wasted potential. They send him off with the new character Rose to the casino planet to find a code breaker who will help break the tracking device the New Order has on the Resistance's capital ship, which allows the fist order to track them through hyperspace. This mission is pointless, and feels like filler. It didn't feel like Star Wars to me, and there was commentary on animal abuse, and child abuse which also felt out of place in a Star Wars movie. The way Luke was handled was aggregious. Here is the man who went on a suicide mission to turn his father Darth Vader in the Return of the Jedi, but here we find out he was thinking of killing his nephew because he felt the darkside in him. This is the same man who was a new hope in the original trilogy, and here we find him turning his back on his family and friends, wanting to destroy the history of the Jedi, and being bested by Rey because feminism now rules in Disney Star Wars, and all males are idiots.There is so much wrong with this movie, that it's hard to keep it short. The final stab in the heart is the Leia giving up on her son, Luke projecting himself and the dying from exertion did me completely, and Rey moving rocks to save what's left of the resistance when Luke said earlier that the force isn't just about moving rocks, but there you go. Wouldn't it have been nicer if he at least trained her to move the rocks and we had a payoff, and he raised his x-wing from under the water to show up in the last battle instead of using this new force power of astral projection. I don't know where this trilogy is going, but I don't care to see this movie again nor the next in the series. I'm sure we'll see the same agenda applied to Solo and Episode 9. Han Solo won't be able to get anyting done unless a small attractive female shows him the way.I guess fans like me are old news. This is now the age of politically correct, feminist, Disney marvel Star Wars. It's time for me to move on.",0

2801,"This film really gets better after a second viewing. It's a good movie - just not necessarily a good Star Wars movie.Disclaimer: I am not a bot. Nor do I hate diversity - I loved it in this film and TFA. I am, however, a ""fanboy"", but not a misogynist racist neo-Nazi like some of the critics out there would have you believe.This film has been discussed ad infinitum all over the Internet, so let's get straight to it:THE GOOD:Plenty to like about this film. George Lucas was right that it was ""beautifully filmed"" - breathtaking vistas, Crait, Holdo's lightspeed jump - the excellent filmography continues from Rogue One. The acting was good too - Mark Hamill gives the performance of his career (even if his Luke wasn't true to character) and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver have improved tons from TFA. I loved Yoda - puppet Yoda being silly was still in character, in my opinion, and his lines make sense. I have no problem believing that the most powerful Jedi ever can call down lightning even as a Force ghost. Also Luke Force-projecting at the end wasn't new - Yoda did it first in the animated Star Wars Rebels. And even though I have complaints about Luke, that final duel was badass.THE BAD:Let's do a little thought experiment. Go rewatch the throne room scene in Return of the Jedi. Watch Luke slice Vader's hand off and then catch himself. See him throw his lightsaber away and tell the Emperor ""I am a Jedi, like my father before me"". He refused to kill the second most evil man in the galaxy - and that faith turns Vader back to the light side. Now watch TLJ. Can you really believe that this same Luke would raise a lightsaber against his sleeping nephew, Leia's son? Now you have the reason most fans are disappointed about Luke's portrayal - TLJ Luke isn't Luke. He would maybe mope about for a while, but there's no way in Jabba's arse that he wouldn't come back to help Leia. Rey and R2 knew it too - they used Leia to try and persuade Luke, and the Luke of the original trilogy put his family and friends over everything else. Him dying at the end, while poignant, also could have been better written - I felt an iconic character like Luke Skywalker deserved better overall.Wasted villains are a cardinal sin to me. Snoke was wasted - I understand he had to die, but that could have been done so much better. Completely unrealistic how he is built up to be such a powerful Force user and doesn't see the betrayal coming even though he is LITERALLY READING KYLO'S MIND AT THE TIME. Phasma appears on screen, is badass - then dies unceremoniously after forgetting how to use a gun on Finn. Hux, once actually menacing and ambitious in TFA, is reduced to Monty Python levels of comedy here. And the entire First Order appears incompetent - how did they even conquer the galaxy between TFA and this film? At least Lucas did proper worldbuilding in his prequels.THE VERDICT:Perhaps the most chilling thing about The Last Jedi is how well Disney can control the media narrative. Film critics are a finicky bunch - it's suspicious how they have all unanimously lined up to sing praises about The Last Jedi. This has not gone unnoticed - commenters at The Guardian have asked why their usually picky film critics left glowing reviews without any faults, the Angry Joe Show recanted their criticism after posting a 2-million-view video ranting about TLJ's problems, and for every article correctly pointing out that TLJ is underperforming for a Star Wars movie, there are 10 more saying how it's raking in billions at the box office and how it's God's gift to cinema, etc etc. Even The Phantom Menace got some good reviews initially - so when ALL the critics line up in one choir to praise a film to the heavens, you know something fishy's going on.In the end, it's our right to like or dislike a film - and just because some people dislike this one doesn't mean we should be ridiculed or talked down to, especially not when we've supported the franchise for decades.",0
2802,"What a let-down sequel. I modeslty enjoyed The Force Awakens, I tried to believe something good and new could have be done but all I got was some sort of Marvel-like movie with dull characters (some exceptions) and a poorly written plot. I know it's Disney but, c'mon, show some respect to the true fans.",0
2803,"I went into this movie expecting a lot more than ever was delivered. Going in mostly blind, it was easy to tell that this wasn't done by the same people who did Episode seven. I walked about about two thirds way through the movie and met up with friends who saw it all the way to the end. The movie plays out like a check list of modern day stereotypes rather than the grand science fantasy epic that is Star Wars.While the movie has some epic quality visuals and some awesome moments the poor story and butchering of already established characters outweighs it. Many opportunities are shunted aside for the sake of one liners and what I can only figure is a ham fisted social justice agenda behind it-- On that note I am most sure that this movie would pass the Bechdel test for what amount of good that is worth.There are moments of absolute gold quality in this movie and are worthy of being in a Star Wars film, but they are short lived and often followed up with a punchline that doesn't need to be there. If the movie were written by the previous team and directed by Abrams, the movie would have been the epic sequel to Episode 7 as this movie wants to be.Call me an 'Alt Right Troll' or some kind of Bot, I've been called worse things before. I'm sure plenty would have been upset if rather than the 7th Harry Potter movie we got an adaptation of the Fan Fiction 'My Immortal'.TL;DR This is a Star Wars film played like a bad social justice fan fiction trying to hit every part of an ideological check list as possible.",0
2804,"Star Wars is dead... Disney has killed it. I didn't think it was even possible to make Star wars Films worse then Episodes 1-3. This film makes Episodes 1-3 seem like master pieces. Lets start with the characters. They all suck and not one of them is likeable. Rey is a annoying Mary Sue, Finn who was the only likeable character in Force awakens is now a bore, Rose is annoying and the actor who plays her sucks at acting, Po is a tool, Kylo is a pathetic Villian and is more of a whiny pathetic beta cuck. Nothing about him feels threatening. When you are coming off of great Villians like Darth Vader, Darth Maul, and The Emperor. Then Poor Luke Skywalker oh dear god what have they done to you. A once great Jedi is now reduced to a pathetic whiny old man. The story is pure crap. Nothing about this Movie is fun like the older Star Wars films. Then they kill Luke with a moronic death scene. The running theme of this movie is kill off the every thing that is old and great about Star Wars and make way for the new. If this is the New Star Wars, Then just let it die now. In fact Kylo even says this.Its over people. Star Wars is dead. This film was so damned bad that i cant even go back and watch Episodes 4-6 any more. Maybe in 10-15 years if i can hopefully forget every thing about this movie and the last 2 i might be able to go back and enjoy them. There is no way they can fix this in the next movie... Nothing at all. The best they might be able to do is stop making any more Star Wars movies for 5+ years and make sure who was ever involved with these abominations is never allowed near these movies and get some Talanted writers and Directors and try again from scratch.",0
2805,"Steaming pile of garbage.  Avoided seeing this in theaters due to hearing about the death of luke.  Finally broke down and watched this and it was even worse than I expected.  This movie single handedly throws away everything about the star wars universe.  It destroys characters that were created and loved by many, all in the name of what?  So many pointless idiotic scenes.  So many poor attempts at humor that fall flat and are out of place.  The plot holes are laughable.  Sure star wars movies aren't rock solid in the plot department, but this one just throws that rule book out the window.  If this movies critical reviews aren't a sure sign that reviews are bought and paid for by disney then I don't know what is.  This is NOT the star wars movie you are looking for.",0
2806,"This movie was a pointless, ugly, and plot-hole-riddled mess. All it served to do was crush all hope and destroy everything that remained of the Original Trilogy. An absolute waste. Do not watch.",0
2807,"As many here I only created an account to say how much I hate this movie and Rian Johnson. If the purpose of this movie was to kill Star Wars it was a success. I find hard to believe that anyone would like the story, the silliness of the plot and the ending. There is almost nothing good about it.",0
2808,"The Last Jedi is nothing more than badly written fan fiction with a massive budget. Only worth watching so you can make your oiwn mind up about this divisive movie.However I wouldn’t recommend paying to see it because there’s a 50:50 chance you’ll feel like you’ve been robbed of your cash, time and the fond memories you once held for a dead franchise.",0
2809,"This was the biggest slap to the face to real star wars fans. They took a huge crap on Luke Skywalker.There was so many parts in this movie that didn't belong, and there was so many parts in this movie that just ruined star wars as a whole. That part with the animal was so disturbing in fact I wished I have never seen it. I'm Boycotting the Han Solo movie because I'm fed up with Disney ruining my favorite movie franchise. Its sad when the Phantom Menace is better than this film.",0
2810,"I was really looking forward to The Last Jedi after how much fun the The Force Awakens was despite its problems. Instead of finding a creative way to play with the viewers expectations and take the universe into a bold new direction, The Last Jedi treats us to 2.5 hours of dumb characters doing dumb things that are ultimately pointless by the end of the film. Returning characters are underwritten and never find their footing while new characters are uninteresting and annoying. Rose just might be the Jar Jar Binks of this generation.1 star for bringing back muppet Yoda.",0
2811,"What’s wrong with Disney? Why isn’t there a good film director to find?Last Jedis Plot is rather a comedy than a real Star Wars movie. Even worse.While watching the movie I felt like being brainwashed in a Propaganda    Camp in North Korea only from Globalists/Capitalists/Leftists/Gender Sheriffs. But worst, I even paid money on that!! The Last Jedi is literally the last Jedi, at least for me watching their movies.",0
2812,"I don't think I have ever given a zero to anything. This will be the first. The acting is poor as usual, it feels like it was written by a committee of low end writers trying to imitate Lucas and after about the first 45 minutes I was waiting for the fart jokes as the writing was on that level. I can just assume that every paid critic is well paid by Disney to give an 85 average score. Much like the slightly better episode 7, this was just written as a bad fanfic almost entirely mimicking ep5 as ep7 mimicked ep4. Not helping anything the main cast have no charisma and virtually no acting ability.",0
2813,The worst film of Star Wars. Disney and Ryan disrespected Luke and the work of JJ at ep VII. The death of Snoke and the projection of Luke was the worst of the film,0

2816,"SOCIAL JUSTICE WARS: Episode VIII- THE WORST JEDIThis movie is a complete travesty. The writer/ director had no idea how to please the legions of Star Wars fans across the globe or perhaps they just didn't care. The heroes are hard to root for and seem made to please every liberal and minority possible, never  mind the majority of the viewers. The villains are weak and uninspiring. The film basically urinates on all of Star Wars history. The way Luke acted AND died was unforgivable. The ""Force"" was not with this movie.",0
2817,"Here are some quotes from Master Yoda, just so you know how much this movie FAILED!!!""Difficult to see. Always in motion is the Future""... and so Luke thinks about killing Kylo because...""Anger, fear, aggression: the dark side are they"". ""Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering""...  and so Luke goes on about being afraid after seeing Reys powers.""Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned""... so Luke was like, yeh, no can do.""Luke, when gone am I... the last of the Jedi will you be""... well that can't be right, said Disney.""A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind"".... not if you're MaRey Suuueeee!!! Aaammmiriiigh gurlfreeeenn??",0
2819,"Movie is really, really bad. I don't mind them trying to change somes aspects about Star Wars, I actually liked it. What I couldn't stand was: -The utterly unnecessary cassino subplot with moral lessons coming from Disney.-Space Leia-kylo Ren's motivation is less consistent than Bitcoin price-Fat Asian girl is in this movie only because she is a fat Asian girl. -Their terrible timing in jokes-Their total lack of common sense (fuel as plot device in star wars, really? The resistance is down to 11 guys, so it is for all intents and proposes DESTROYED, which makes the stakes at the last battle totally pointless)At this point Star Wars became Guardians of the Galaxy but with slightly worse humor.",0
2820,"I am not a fanboy. I do not want to MAGA. I do not suffer from “toxic masculinity.” I am, however, a lifelong fan of Star Wars. I also want to see fantasy movies to, you know, engage in fantasy, not be reminded of modern life’s ills. Unfortunately, TLJ is thinly-veiled allegory for American politics that pushes a SJW agenda. It also plagiarizes The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and has absurd plot holes. Allegory and the SJWs:* All the bad guys are white guys (except a few quisling Asians and the female silver Stormtrooper, who is in costume). No major protagonists are white guys, except Luke, who is surly and unlikeable and gets killed off at the end. *Men - both the good guys and bad guys - are depicted as irrational, emotional, and childish. The First Order rules the universe, but all of its officers are seemingly incompetents who throw a fit whenever things don’t go their way. How is that?*Women, on the other hand, are depicted as noble, calm, and mature. Women occupy all positions of leadership in the Resistance (with the exception of some token aliens). There are no men on the bridge of the rebel flagship. *There are no white male protagonists in the first two installments of this trilogy. So far, the protagonists are: white female, black male, Latino male, and Asian female; apparently, white males can only portray the bad guys.  Of the three holdovers from the original trilogy - Luke, Leaia, and Han - the two white males have been killed off. *As the hero of an epic, Rey is supposed to undergo The Hero’s Journey. Unfortunately, she does not, because to do so would require that she encounter setbacks and temporary failures before succeeding. This, of course, would be misogynistic, because it would depict women as weak. Therefore, as other reviews have more eloquently noted, Rey displays no weakness. She flies the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo. She experiences no moments of self-doubt. Her only “journey” is to know the limits of her seemingly limitless power. Girl Power, indeed. *Capitalism is bad. War is bad. Racing animals is bad. Eating animals is bad. Love conquers all. Plagiarism and Plot Holes* Two key scenes shamelessly plagiarize Empire and Jedi. Lucas was excoriated for plagiarizing scenes from other movies for the middle three movies. It looks like Johnson isn’t above a little plagiarism himself. I was waiting for a Tauntaun to show up in the final scene. *Most absurd of all is the whole premise of the movie. The First Order has figured out how to track the Resistance through hyperspace, so the Resistance leads them on a low-speed chase through space with shields on full in the rear until they can figure out how to jam their signal and escape through hyperspace again. Are you kidding me? The entire premise of the movie is...the OJ Simpson White Bronco chase? The First Order can figure out how to track the rebels through hyperspace, but they can’t figure out how to pass them and shoot them from the front of their ships? Really? I know movies require some suspension of disbelief, but give me a break, people.",0
2821,"Visually it's a beautiful movie... thats all good I can say. The character development are null, the humor it's bad, the villains are pathetic, the plot it's poor and Rian Johnson took the Luke's character and totally destroyed. Worst Star Wars movie ever.... probably they killed a saga for many fans, or at least for me.",0
2822,"This is the worst Star Wars movie to date. I'm not particularly demanding viewer (I even like the prequels), but this movie is truly bad. Characters are weak, story is illogical and it does not fit within the Star Wars canon. I do not see how the next movie can improve anything.",0
2823,"Dropped most plot points, most of the excellent work J J Abrams did is wasted or ruined by Rian Johnson and his writers. Sad.",0
2824,"This movie is an absolute disgrace at almost every level.  Things that I liked - the visuals are stunning, with only a few minor cgi issues.  Cinematography, lighting, set design, costumes, all of it was incredible.  The music is a step up from The Force Awakens, and I enjoyed it.  There is some good acting, mostly from the older cast.  Now for the negatives.  The story and plot, from start to finish and without a single exception, is horrid.  Logical inconsistencies are everywhere, from stupid reasoning and decision making by main characters to a complete inability to explain obvious questions, ie. why the First Order doesn't simply send a couple ships a light speed ahead of where the fleeing ""resistance"" is heading and cut them off.  Then there is the tone, which is all over the place.  Forced, horrible humor cut in the middle of life and death situations.  Levity from characters like a dejected, defeated Luke that goes completely against what we are told his character has become.  COMPLETELY useless subplots that render certain characters pointless.  Finn, Rose, and to a large extent Leia might as well not even be in this movie.  Also, Rose is worse than Jar Jar.  I would rather watch an entire Jar Jar solo film than endure even another minute of Rose's horribly overacted, useless character. Also, they destroyed Luke.  Completely, utterly destroyed him.  He is a shell of his former self, making stupid jokes, not caring about anything, SHOWING A WILLINGNESS TO KILL HIS OWN NEPHEW JUST BECAUSE A LITTLE BIT OF DARKNESS WAS GROWING IN HIM.  Oh I'm sorry, he had an entire trilogy about forgiveness and seeing the good in even the darkest figures in the galaxy, i.e. Darth Vader, yet the boy he grew up with, the son of his sister and best friend, shows he has darkness in him and Luke, in some pathetic showing of weakness, considers ending his life.  Pathetic writing.  Pathetic story telling.  I would give this movie less than a zero if I could.  All of this is without mentioning Leia's superman/mary poppins act out in space, where she should have been burned, hit with debris, has the liquid freeze in her body, and have been deprived of oxygen for what looked like several minutes, despite having shown zero inclination of how to use the force at all previously besides little feelings here and there.  Oh, and Rey is just as much of an all powerful Jedi god again despite no training.  She can do no wrong.  She is an angel.  There are zero stakes at play for her, because she is perfect.  Oh, and then there's the bomber run at the beginning, where gravity apparently exists in space, and someone can be exposed to the vacuum of space and still breath.  There's Luke milking an elephant cow thing and drinking it's blue milk...just what in the actual f....  There's the forced political crap, like the Admiral's purple hair, the animal cruelty messages, the obvious diversity just to check boxes.  I am a liberal, but don't you dare infect star wars with political statements.  There's the Admiral herself, who is set up like a villain for LITERALLY NO REASON OTHER THAN THEY WANTED TO MAKE POE LOOK LIKE A FOOL.  Seriously, I challenge literally any fan of this movie to explain why the film did everything it could to portray her as a villain when in actuality she is self sacrificing and heroic, a close friend of Leia's.  Why she wouldn't give her plan to the only commander she has left.  If you can't trust the military leader of your remaining...what, 250 people?...then who CAN you trust?  So dumb.  Then there's Luke projecting himself across the galaxy - fine, you want to introduce new aspects of the force, I'm ok with that - only to have him DIE ANYWAYS?!?! WHAT WAS THE POINT OF HAVING HIM PROJECT THEN?!?! Just have him go there if you're going to kill him.  Have him fight, go out like a hero, take out a bunch of the First Order with him!  Oh, I'm sorry, you wanted to have him die while echoing the twin sun shot from A New Hope.  So you twist the plot around to make that happen, when the logic makes zero sense and it's just a ""gotcha"" moment for the audience.  So dumb.  Then there's Rey lifting the entire mountain of rocks when Luke couldn't lift the X-Wing after a bunch of training.  Wait, what about Rey's backstory being entirely pointless?  Even though YOU THE FRANCHISE built it up as some great secret?  In the same vein, how about building up who Snoke could possibly be, building up his all powerful command of the dark side, only for him to monologue like every other villain and for some reason not sense Kylo betraying him then dying without a shred of backstory or importance?  This movie did so many things wrong, spat in so many faces, that I refuse to see it as cannon.  It is a fanfic, a piece of imaginating from a politically motivated teenager.  It is pathetic in every way, insulting, ridiculous, funny for all the wrong reasons, and a disgrace to fans.",0
2825,Another modern sequel that destroys the soul of the previous 6 films.  Pretty much set the nail in the coffin.,0
2826,"I don't write movie reviews, but after watching this, I had to at least throw in my opinion.Star wars as a whole is okay. For me, it's a good space drama with a solid and mostly coherent story, until now. This latest movie assumes that all of a sudden, fans don't care about plot holes or lore. Some character motivations are outright stupid. Technology/physics in the universe all of a sudden changes and becomes stupid to serve the silly plot. Characters gain powers suddenly that they didn't have before. And other characters just don't act like they used to.Even with not being a fan of the series, I was able to pick up on all of this, and it gave me a ""wtf is this crap"" vibe by the end of the movie.I'm amazed that such a production was possible. Did no one have issues with the script? Was everyone involved incompetent? If I was a fan, I'd be outraged. But I'm not, so I'll just remember this movie as another one of hollywood's forgettable failures (of which there are many).",0
2827,Holding onto hope that a second watch would eliminate some of the problems I had with this movie I decided to rent The Last Jedi over Easter Weekend and  rewatch it in the comfort of my own home. I was somehow even more disappointed the second time around. What a mess of a movie.,0
2828,"Awful film. Have given it 3 as there is some merit for the younger children. In my view, it is astonishing how Lucas / Disney have destroyed Star Wars. It is also astonishing how the critics are too scared to talk this film down. The facts are : Cinema would be no more if the studios did not have Star Wars films to hype people into theaters. I'm so glad I waited until dvd. When you compare to the episodes 4,5,6 obviously the film would never have any chance, but even 1 (yes 1),2 and 3 are better in my view.  The stupidity of this film is taken to new highs and yes Sci Fi can be done sensibly. Star Wars has now invented the long range / hyper space video conference call. Space Travel now all blue like if in Doctor Who Tardis.  The usual trend of introducing pointless characters and then killing them, expecting us to care. The big bad cheese looks like out of Tom and Jerry. General Hus looks and is played as if should be in a Harry Potter movie. I could go on, like the film. Awful.",0
2829,"I have to admit, I actually enjoyed the movie the first time. The jokes were funny (altough they were a bit too numerous), it felt more like Star Wars than TFA and I liked the little details which saluted the original trilogy.I also admit I turned my brain off completely during that movie for reasons I still didnt discover.After I saw the first critical review of it on Youtube I was going: ""Oh. Oh... Ohhhhh... OHHHHH! OMFG!!!11eleven"". This movie seriously makes no sense at all in the Star Wars universe. I thought they messed up the Star Trek universe so much that Roddenberry rotated in his grave so much that he flew to the gamma quadrant, and TFA was bad enough, as if I was watching a parody of Episode 4, but this movie destroyed Star Wars that much, that it made me being disgusted of myself because I liked it at first. Well, not liked it, but at least I found it entertaining. After I whipped myself as punishment, I watched more critical reviews and found even more unbelievable stuff I didnt notice. So I whipped myself some more.Then I found out Abrams is doing the next movie again and I wanted to drown myself in the toilet, but thankfully my dog drank it dry before.But still, I was entertained at first, and so I will be fair and give it a 3... point 4.",0

2836,"Erratic story telling, giant let downs and an unnecessary low speed space chase. It never felt like a Star Wars movie. The Casino scene was unnecessary, Luke Skywalker wasn't Luke Skywalker. The porgs were oversold and Chewbacca was a set piece. Everything that wasn't Luke's story felt like time filler to the already bloated running time. ""Well, we need something for Finn to do... Hey, Casino Royale"" Poe needs to be a rebel so let's not make him privy to our plan so he can mutany. It made no sense why he wouldn't be included in the plan. And what the hell, Rey and Kylo's scenes were forced, they had to figure a way for them to share screen time. Essentially, the previous movie became irrelevant and all it's set ups were ignored. If you're telling a 9 episode story, why disregard the previous 7 so you can have the last one start all over? In the over-all arc of the saga, this one is a strange outlier.",0
2843,"This is at the bottom of the abyss. Worst film I've seen yet next to Hancock and Howard the Duck. This is what happens when Disney is led by corrupt individuals with an anti-moral agenda contrary to the majority of the people that populate the nation. Control of Disney and Hollywood needs to be more diverse and NOT led people by with immoral ideals. Make the damn movies for their plot lines and not inject stupid anti-religious, certain ethnic guilt propaganda into them. The same goes for the Marvel films. Disney is only going for it's racist bigoted agenda, not for good wholesome family films as was in past times.",0

Like the first movie this is just one action set piece after another stitched together with little regard for story or character.  Another installment of modern Hollywoods lust for mediocrity, jamming undeveloped characters and plot in between glitzy CGI action scenes.  If you asked 100 liberal arts graduates to write a Star Wars trilogy I believe nearly all of them would be better than this bland superficial pile of crap.  In almost every scene I could practically hear some obnoxious salesman writer/director/producer pitch the scene to corporate executives who are barely listening.

2848,"I grew up watching Star Wars.  I've seen the original more than 50 times.  I've played the games, collected the comic books and read about a dozen of the novels.  I've got about $300 worth of Star Wars: Armada ships in my book case and even though EP1 and EP2 were not stellar (they were good though..), EP3 was amazing.  I listen to the sound tracks and when I ran a marathon years ago, I listened to the ""Throne Room"" track when I crossed the finish line.  I've built models as a child of X-Wings and other ships, I've bought easily $1000 worth of Star Wars legos and sent them to my nephews.  I've seen the Clone Wars cartoon series all the way through twice and I'll probably watch it again someday.  My youth, my imagination, my heart all belonged to Star Wars.Not anymore.  I never will watch Episode VII or VIII again.  Horrible garbage that craps on all the lore of the past, changes all the characters and story for the worst and has killed any interest I have in Star Wars ever again.  I didn't see Solo and I will not be seeing Episode 9.  Star Wars is dead to me.  It's a liberal crap fest of silly men and purple haired over arching women.  The men are all stupid and the women all are just so smart.  The force is silly and the Jedi are meaningless.  I didn't care if any of them lived or died.  I'm still not even sure what happened in this movie or why I should care.  The magic is gone, Star Wars is dead.  I wish these movies were never made (Rogue One was ok, but not worth the crap that is 7 and 8).  I will watch the original 6 until I die, and just pretend Disney never got involved.",0
2849,"Pros: The CGI was great.Cons: Here's a list of major plotholes.    The Empire has been fighting the Rebels/Resistance for 40 years now and 3 capital ships (one of which is the Emperor's flagship) are completely and utterly defenseless against a single X-Wing?? The Supremacy, the largest ship in the First Order, and the one containing the Emperor, can't take care of one single X-Wing? Why doesn't the Resistance just send 30 X-Wings to take down all 3 capital ships then?    It takes under 5 minutes for this one X-Wing to destroy all the cannons on the surface of one of the Dreadnoughts. Somehow, the shields and armor of the Empire's capital ships are totally torn apart by one lone, tiny, single-pilot fighter, even though the giant cannons on the Dreadnoughts are unable to pierce the shield on the Raddus. Why exactly does the Empire build these ships?    Why does Holdo stay on the Raddus? The plan was to evacuate everyone on the transport ships while the Raddus continued it's course in order to distract the Imperial fleet. Why does she have to stay on the ship just for it to continue flying the same direction at the same speed? At this point, it was unknown to them that DJ would betray them, so there was no reason for a pilot to stay on the Raddus. Also, why does the person staying on the ship need to be a senator and the acting-admiral of the fleet, as well as one of Leia's oldest and most trusted friends? You couldn't put a droid on there? Or anyone else?    Two torpedoes with explosive payloads go off right next to Leia. She survives the flames, the shockwave, and the (millions of pieces of) shrapnel. She gets knocked unconscious in the vacuum of space, but manages to hold the oxygen in her lungs and survives depressurization and freezing. And when she flies back to the ship, they open a door to the vacuum of space on a moving ship without any sort of depressurization or suction at all. What? This is B-movie level bad.    Finn and Rose took an escape pod from the Raddus to the casino and back. If the escape pods are equipped with hyperdrives, then why don't they use them to escape instead of the transport ships?    The hyperdrive weaponization. There's about a million posts on this so I won't go into it.    How does Rey know how to use a lightsaber and force powers? How can she stand toe-to-toe against Royal Guards? She has had zero combat training whatsoever, and next to no force training.    Rose's sister gives her life for the Resistance. She uses a stun-baton on her personal hero because he was trying to abandon ship. She goes on what is most likely an insane suicide mission for a chance to let the Resistance fleet get away. She gives up the one possession she has left over from her family (her necklace) to complete the mission. Why, then, does she risk the lives of literally everyone remaining in the Resistance in a last-ditch desperate attempt to save Finn from giving his life to stop the cannon? The cannon that's about to destroy the last line of defense that the Resistance has. This makes no sense for her character. After she rams Finn's ship, why do the advancing AT-ATs completely ignore them? They are literally right in front of the AT-AT line. How are they able to cover all that distance back to the base without being shot or captured?    Why are the FO capital ships unable to see or fire upon the transports before DJ tells them? If they were cloaked, how are they suddenly able to see them once they know about the plan? Why do they not chase them down with TIE fighters since they know that the ship containing all the Resistance's fighter ships is now empty?    There is a period of time when Kylo Ren is unconscious and Rey takes Snoke's escape pod to leave. Why does she not kill Kylo, the (now) most evil person in the universe, the one who killed Han, the commander of the Supremacy, and the Emperor of the First Order? She could nearly end the war right there!",0
2850,"A weak story with glaring plot holes and I mean really stupidly unnecessary ones. Hollow and vapid and worst of all boring, I've forgotten what I just saw it was that unengaging. The characters were banal, the story trite, the villains bland, the sanctimony grating. The dreadfully stupid joke at the start sums it up for SW. It's finished.",0
2851,"Why not a fanatic, I have always been a Star Wars fan and was really looking forward to the Last Jedi. I avoided all spoilers and went to screening just a few days after it was released.Unfortunately, despite trying to remain positive throughout the viewing, ultimately I was left hugely disappointed. For me the movie was totally superficial. A good looking movie that  lacked any real soul or depth in either the story or the characters. That was the real problem for me, Star Wars or any good movie has always been character driven for me. I feel a connection to the characteristics and become invested in their story. The Last Jedi had the opposite affect on me. Characters that I had been interested in like Rey, Finn and Poe and even long time favourites like Luke Skywalker came across as quite plastic and to be honest almost unlikeable. By halfway through the movie their story had little suspense because I no longer cared what happened to the characters.After watching the movie I was quite interested in others opinions and was quite surprised by the positive reviews that it received from critics. Especially reviews that praised it for it’s originality and for taking chances. I know it tried to shock at different stages but it came across as being cheap and gimmicky rather than anything of real substance. In fact I wished that they had followed through with some of these scenes. They could have made some of these characters more compelling maybe even making Kylo Ren a formidable villain.Overall the movie was just disappointing or as some of my friends put it a ‘lemon’. i do realise that half the viewing population loved the movie and to those people more power to you in fact I feel a bit jealous because I wished that I enjoyed it as well but I can’t recommend this movie as anything more than a B movie time filler.",0
2852,"A great disappointment. So far the worst Star Wars movie. Weak plot, shallow characters and except from a few CGI moments completely forgettable.",0
2853,"It is absurd that the ""critics"" across the web are giving such good reviews. This is not only a really terrible sw movie (they take a **** on the lore and The Last Jedi does not feel like sw movie at all) but it is genuinely a really terrible movie in general (as a craft in the least). I am very distrustful of ""critics"" since The Force Awakens reviews. And now it is beyond obvious - critics are either dishonest and bought, scared and self-censored or just plainly incompetent and stupid.I don't need to spoiler here anything and write what wrote dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of people before me - check youtube channels, google the ""what is wrong with the last jedi"" or...just use your OWN brain when you watch it. It is not a ""toxic"" fandom, nazis, fascists, alt-right, manbabies, misogynists or whatnot (as the media and Disney call us) - this movie is simply dumb. The plot is dumber and worse than the screenplay for the remake of Ninja Turtles or Power Rangers - seriously..it is that bad, nonsensical, filled with plot holes, filler side quest with a null outcome and consequence (30+ minutes of scenes which could be cut from the movie and it would steal absolutely nothing from the ""story""), lore/world breaking stuff (how they let this happen?), abundance of so called ""twists"", really BAD and inappropriate humor and once again to emphasise: plot holes, plot armors and deus ex machina everywhere (people getting from point A to point B even when the enemy is everywhere and pointing guns at them with magic I guess)... On top of that there is criminally mistreated character of Luke Skywalker...just god awful treatment.There is so much wrong with this excuse for a movie so that there are hours of rants on the internet...go and look. The movie is long (nothing is happening there for almost 3 hours!), feels empty, it's boring, the antagonists are complete jokes - literally (mama jokes, prank ""phone"" calls...). And the protagonists are either dumb, they are acting irrationally to serve a ""plot"" or inexplicably overpowered and plain. No character development, no struggle especially for Rey - Yes, she proved herself as a textbook example of Mary Sue yet again... Story is sooo lame and stupid that a twelve year old boy/girl could think it of on his/her way to the school.... And you can hate Jar Jar or George Lucas for the prequels but those movies had the beginning, a middle and the end (each of them) and they had an overall arc. George's movies are an example of a consistent and meaningful storytelling. And most importantly they built and extended the sw universe - they give the viewer a feeling that the story is happening in a big galaxy with a bunch of planets and worlds... I was thrilled to read at night the wookiepedia, the books and play the games in that wonderful world George and others created: Thrawn saga, Jedi Outcast, Academy, Kotor 1-2, Force Unleashed...That all is gone now - Disney killed it and cooked a cheap and dumb movie with Star Wars logo to make money but without any Star Wars ingredients. I did not like VII (basically lot of similar problems and complete rehash of IV - again, go and search internet what is wrong with this one if you need someone to pinpoint it for you) but I went to the cinema after the horrible VII to see episode VIII for the one and only reason they left me - I went to see VIII only for Luke Skywalker, I wanted at least this fan service...I wanted the Jedi Master which he should be...but we've got a clown, a joke of the character instead... This trilogy lacks the SW soul.You think I am a butt-hurt manbaby (the insult J. Abrams or Rian Johnson calls the fans?) - then why is the director Rian Johnson every day on twitter posting stupidity and trying to defend his creation?? Because he, lucasfilm and disney sees the huge hate but not from some few weirdos like media tries to sell - but from across the fandom and the audience. He tries to blame everything and everyone (even gamergate omg) but himself. Go and laugh at his twitter account... That guy is PATHETIC.I am not seeing the episode IX. There is nothing to bring me to the cinema for the next episode - it is not just some ""childish"" boycott - I am just genuinely not interested how this trilogy ends.P.S. And thanks to the bad taste they left in my mouth I am skipping any other SW movie from their social-justice labs. If they want to push agendas - let them embed it in a good movie at least... The leftist propaganda is too forced and off putting. Movies like SW is a form of escapism...they just tainted it.P.P.S. To Disney: Solo flopped and you may try to fix this disaster but you cannot undone this money-grab. When you try to reboot this mess I have an advice for you: hire some REAL storyteller who has some talent and will invest at least one afternoon for the screenplay. He should be a real fan with a good taste and respect to the established lore - for now just let this garbage die and be forgotten.",0

The movie suffers from SJW nonsense and disregards what was the basis of Star Wars since the beginning of the series - the concept of the Hero's Journey. It hurts to see your childhood heroes end up like thay did in this movie. Disney, just finish the trilogy and leave Star Wars alone to die in peace. You've made enough harm.I'm literally more excited for more Expanded Universe books re-released than to see another Star Wars movie as bad as this one. This is the end of Star Wars.",0

I've read film school scripts that are more cohesive and coherent.  Rian Johnson should stick to what he's good at, directions, and leave the wiring to someone who knows what they are doing.",0
2873,"Usually giving a movie a 0/10 is an over reaction, but I don't think I've ever seen a more disappointing, cynical, disgusting film in my life. It was so depressing seeing a franchise I adored so much as a child be so soullessly corporatized by Disney in the Force Awakens only to be lulled into thinking that this one would be different. This one would expand on the last one, explain more, and take the series in a new direction. I was foolish for thinking so.Not only was everything set up in the previous movie completely ignored or just lazily forgotten, but this movie went even further and decided it would be a good idea to ""let the past die"" and cynically ""deconstruct"" things, making Luke, the hero of the original trilogy, look like a fool and a coward. They even undermine the central conflict of the movie (first order vs resistance) by introducing war profiteering as the real evil, but never expand on it at all. They do all this but leave nothing in it's place, so by the end of the movie you're left wondering what's the point of this conflict anyway? Why are any of the characters motivations the way they are? Why are the bad guys even bad,? and how does this even connect with the original trilogy? They tease Kylo becoming a ""good"" guy but then he just goes back to is old ways and it doesn't matter. So they purposely tear down the central conflict and your expectations but expect the endgame to be the same as it was at the beginning of the movie? There's no cliffhanger, nothing to look forward to or care about. Never before have I felt such non-feeling at the end of a movie.Even if we look past all that and look at the movie as a stand alone it's still incredibly boring and broken. There are about 3 simultaneous side plots that all end the same way they start. The main plot has a ""good-guy"" ship slowly being chased by the ""bad"" guys. There's no real sense of urgency felt by the viewer and it's easy to forget that's central to what's going on in the movie. About 1.5 hours could've been shaved from this movie with nothing important lost. There's a reason this film only lasted 2 weeks in China, a place where ""Star Wars"" has much less cultural significance.Star Wars movies are traditionally character driven and all the characters are very bland. None really seem to have chemistry with each other. It leaves you wondering which ones have even met one another. Has Rey even met Rose? There's also a staggering amount of blatantly forced diversity and feminism as far as the characters go. Diversity is relatively commonplace in films and in real life, but hamfisting a very heavy-handed, progressive agenda and characters in your film is usually pretty obvious and takes you out of the film. It's also not even progressive. Being an Asian female isn't a character trait and treating someone as a token like that is frankly pretty racist. Finn, who is black, was built up to be a main character but he is completely inconsequential to the film. His character effective became ""minority with screen time"". Star Wars films have always been remarkably diverse, but here they seem to completely ignore all the species and creatures used in previous films and sacrificed good characterization in the way of agenda. I would challenge anyone to identify a single personality trait any of these characters have.It's been almost two years since I've seen this movie and dread and cynicism it has personally instilled in me is still there. We live in an era where all big-budget blockbuster movies are ""safe"", corporatized, and only succeed because they ride off a previously established brand. They are void of any creativity or wonder. This next movie will inevitably disappoint and drive the popularity of Star Wars even further to the ground. It will probably lie dormant for a few years before being dug up by the grubby hands of Disney, who will lure you in with nostalgia and familiar brand imagery only to deliver an equally empty movie. And the cycle continues...",0
2874,This movie was just awful af.. I hate rian Johnson and Disney do so such a bad job on a so good story line from star wars,0
2877,"This movie is not just the worst Star Wars movie ever created, if you can even call it that, it is also simply not a good movie. It has a completely pointless side plot that doesn't fit neither in style or tone to the rest and just drags the movie out way too long. The pacing is awful, the dialogue rivals Attack of the Clones levels and the humor is atrocious. Not that the humor isn't funny.. it is for the most part. But it is used in the completely places, almost every time taking all gravitas and emotion out of a scene. And on top of that it is the kind of Marvel humor that often even breaks the 4th wall that just does not belong in a Star Wars movie. But as mentioned, even in a normal fun movie it ruins a scene and emotion every time in this one.The characters have almost no progression or arc except maybe Kylo Ren. The others either don't progress at all, are suddenly completely different from what we saw in TFA or even regress and undo a lot of their development we saw in TFA.Someone at Disney obviously didn't like a single thing about TFA because Ryan Johnson got a green light to basically destroy everything TFA achieves, from character establishment to entire plot points. Half the support cast is completely discarded. The way Luke Skywalker is portrayed is absolutely appalling. For a casual movie goer at least the performance of Mark Hamill is very nice, even though even his at times great performance hits rocks on the road whenever he's forced to deliver an absolutely stupid one liner or milk alien **** apparently Disney's way to bring nipples into a Star Wars movie..  otherwise his performance is very good, maybe the best of the movie. But at no time does he actually come across as Luke Skywalker. Maybe at the very end in one scene.. but even that scene has the problem that he comes across as Empire's Luke.. not as a Master.. even Return of the Jedi's Luke was more progressed as a character, so he's yet another example of this movie's tendency to undo character arcs.The movie is basically resetting the galaxy to the state of Empire Strikes back without achieving any of the drama or emotion of that original era. The claim this movie did anything fresh is also completely without basis. This movie copies scenes from Empire and RotJ left and right. but unlike TFA which copied a lot from A new hope, this movie fails to get the tone and gravitas of any of these scenes right. TFA only failed with the new ""death star"" scenes. The rest worked. This movie can't get anything right. The Jedi training doesn't work, the ""joing me, we'll rule the galaxy together"" doesn't work. Rey running off to redeem Kylo is an entire movie too early and makes no sense for her at this time in her development. She literally called Kylo a monster after she watched him kill Han just two days or so ago. The hoth scene is the most insulting. The hoth-copycat maneuver is so obvious that they actually havea  soldier lick the ground and make sure the viewer knows the ground is white from salt and not snow... apparently thinking this made the obvious copy and better... and here again the movie fails to even remotely capture the drama of the battle of hoth. Nothing is achieved in this battle. We attack, we get blown up, we retreat without having achieved a thing except for an awkward kiss out of nowhere that just makes you go ""ewww"" because it is THAT unbelievable.And finally this movie also throws in useless and damaging SJW propaganda that is so painfully obvious it hurts. Diverse cast on the rebel side, white males on the first order side. female leaders on the rebel side, male leaders on the evil side. All men, both good and evil, are cowards, idiots or insubordinate machos, the women are all cool headed and holier than though, better at everything without any stablished reason how they got their skills. Add to that out of nowhere comments about the military industrial complex, capitalism, animal rights and veganism and you got the mix. But this movie is even too stupid to pull this off, by making the black lead the biggest idiot, a coward and repeatedly mentioning that he was a janitor that wiped the floors. But only a couple scenes later he suddenly pilots a speeder when in the last movie he needed a pilot because he couldn't fly a ship... and why is an engineer or whatever Jar Jar Rose was supposed to be fly one of those as well...which brings us to the next problem of this movie. way too many people are good at everything for no reason while the first order is shown as incompetent clowns.I could say a ton more about the failings of this movie but let me finish with almost the biggest shocker that I only realized after a while... even John Williams lets you down in this. The score is copy and paste from TFA and OT and not a single new memorable theme gets added to the mix. And not just familiar short themes: An entire OT track is hijacked and played in an action scene.In short: This movie is awful.",0
2878,"Went to see episode VII and thought it was alright, played a bit safe, but could potentially add something to the lore.But this one has no substance.

If this movie has an agenda it utterly failed at that agenda because the writing is TERRIBLE.  The plot goes no where the 2nd act is utterly disposable (but then the others are too really).

Then there's Yoda going and destroying ancient Jedi texts, which would not only never happen, but they also would not be books.

2895,"I grew up the biggest Star Wars fanboy  and sadly I just watched one of the best films of my childhood get completely ruined. There was WAY too much time spent on useless and/or annoying scenes. The humor took away from the more serious nature of the movie and that pretty much explains the feel of the entire film. That it just isn't taken seriously. Sadly, I dislike most of the characters, Snoke was not only ill conceived but also killed without truly ever having a moment in these last two movies where he felt like he was the Sith Lord. He gets very little scene time, and monomim background and is eliminated in such a way that felt unworthy of a story antagonist. Then it's followed by a scene that makes no sense in Star Wars which is the ""Emperor's Royal Guard"" wielding all sorts of weapons (a sword like whip, a  staff that turns into 2 axe like weapons, and so on) These baffoons took Rey and kylo too long to eliminate not to mention no force powers were used and from the looks of it if there were about six more of them they could have defeated both Rey and Kylo from how much they struggled with them. Considering he is taking over as Sith Lord (or Supreme Leader) and Rey as The Last Jedi this is simply another very small piece that adds to the whole film simply missing it's mark. I love how J.J. Abrams remade Star Trek and again, I grew up liking Star Wars not Trek and to be honest I feel that J.J. Abrams ruined Star Wars and there is nothing I liked about this movie from start to end thus I gave it a 0. I could explain so much more but I feel that the movie was so bad that I simply cannot spend any more of my time on thinking or speaking about it as it is actually wasting my life.

Luke has been destroyed, Rose is a totally pointness addition that adds absolutely nothing to the plot and is only there to make the movie as diverse as possible (nothing wrong with racial diversity, just a little much when e v e r y new non-evil charachter must not be a white male). Rey seems to have no character flaws and is a complete Mary Sue. Every character (accept Luke) undergoes no developmental changes and is the exact same as they were at the beginning of the movie. Sometimes I wonder if Rian Johnson even watched TFA, because every single valuable plot point from TFA was completely ignored or destroyed, especially Rey's Parents, which I thought had so much potential but was completely thrown away. Kylo Ren is no longer a intimidating bad guy like he was in TFA, he acts more like a enraged 6 year old with scizophrenia in the movie more than an actually Sith. Such a shame. TFA was okay and it gave great openings for a potentially amazing Episode 8. Unfortunately, any possibilities for a good sequel trilogy have been completely squashed by Rian Johnson and his band of money-hungry SJWs. Absolute abomination.",0

It was all so disconnected, the lack of passion in the direction and in the acting was so clearly visible. Nobody cared for this movie when it was being made. I have a feeling that a lot of actors in this movie, just like Mark Hamill, disagreed with the direction the movie took under Rian Johnson and they just went through the motions, like ""good professionals"" would.The only likable characters are that no-nonsense First Order admiral that dies in the first 5 minutes of the movie, Poe Dameron and Finn. They are the only ones that have passion and make it look like they are willing to fight for something they believe in. For a movie that was supposed to be big on feminism that movie does not have a single likable down-to-earth female character. Rose Tico was supposed to be that character, but she was thoroughly butchered in direction. Which brings us the the biggest fault of this move: incompetent directing. There are a lot of arcs and scenes in this movie that on paper were epic and profound and were utterly ruined by Rian Jonhson and instead came out stupid, pathetic, laughable or annoying.Poe growing as a leader - awesome on paper - ruined in execution. Vice-admiral Holdo - a gentle leader of great wisdom - ruined in execution: Mr. Johnson - there is a huge difference between projecting strength to keep everyone calm and behaving like you are too stoned to care. Finn willing to sacrifice himself and saved by Rose - awesome on paper - so completely and utterly ruined in execution. This scene would be so hyper-epic if Rose sacrificed herself ""not out of hate but to save the things she loved"" and then she would get the a funeral of a hero. Instead she ended up looking like a selfish you-know-what, willing to risk everybody's life to get what she wants for herself.And so on and so forth. Every single thing in this move could be epic, instead it fizzled down to nothing.",0
2902,"Some good ideas, cinematography and solid performance from Adam Driver. Everything else is a tonally  confused, misguided mess. Lazily exposited 'moral of the day' a la every Disney movie ever. It trades in anticlimax as though that is cleverer than climax; in actuality it's just less satisfying.New characters are largely bland and uninteresting, with performances worse than in the previous film. Mark Hamill puts in a good shift with a highly questionable storyline. John Williams puts out, unfortunately, his most uninspired score yet, with literally no new pieces worthy of listening to. Certainly closer to the prequels than the OT.",0
2903,"This movie is an insult to all the fans. They take every chance to destroy anything from the Star Wars past in the most incoherent way. Who they think would watch the movie? Kinder garden kids? Everything, from the plot (it there was any) to the characters an the ""jokes, is as superficial and disney-like! ¬¬ I hated it!",0
2904,"Didnt do justice to the star wars characters. Snoke, Ackbar, Luke  and  Phasma all deserved more. Stupid Rose and Finn storyline went nowhere and was forced.",0
2905,"A fundamentally broken film that boasts stunning visuals, a peppering of great action and a few scenes of tense drama but ultimately requires audiences with any prior knowledge of the Star Wars universe to disengage their brains completely. The film's treatment of legacy characters comes off as disrespectful to long time fans and yet also fails to deliver any compelling character development for the new cast outside of the main antagonist. Established plot points and mystery set up in J.J. Abram's The Force Awakens are squandered for the sake of shock value and the film compromises the integrity of its characters to hold together it's flimsy plot. In The Last Jedi's few moments of brilliance, it is on par with what audiences have seen in the Original Trilogy. In between those few moments of greatness, The Last Jedi struggles to gain a leg up over any of the films in the Prequel Trilogy.",0
2906,"When I left the theater, I couldn't understand why it was I didn't love the movie.  I sincerely wanted to love it.  I've been a Star Wars fan as long as I can remember, and Luke Skywalker was the hero of my boyhood.  But this movie was heavy handed with the political views of its creators.  It was the most 2017 thing I've ever seen.  Four days ago I was so excited to see it... now I am just heartbroken that the movie was so poorly written.  Star Wars is something we have loved for a very long time, and much of this movie is dedicated to destroying all of the Star Wars that came before it.",0
2907,"The worst Star Wars film of them all! I do not mind that this movie was about destroying the past to make way for the future, but the way it did it was just terrible. It was just terrible terrible script writing. Furthermore, I’d be surprised if the writers knew anything about the universe because they added so much ridiculous stuff that was just idiotic. Some examples include - Leia flying through spaces (she gets back in the ship without any sort of depressurisation and everyone’s fine and dandy), Yoda using his powers (why doesn’t Yoda, alone, destroy the first order then?), gravity in space, the ATAT’s land on that planet faster than Finn can get there (where did the ATAT’s even come from if the fleet was destroyed?), only one brief lightsaber fight scene, the ships run out of space fuel for the first time in the franchise, Snoke is just randomly killed (could’ve been done so much better), Luke is a whiney bum, Luke’s death is unbelievably unsatisfying and pointless, and for some reason the secret plan was held back from Poe (and therefore the audience) for no good reason... this is by no means an exhaustive list of all the things I hated about the film either! It was just trash. Horrible.",0

2910,"Last Jedi is somehow worse than the one that came out last year. It felt like I had paid to get punched in the brain for 2.5 hours. Fisher looked so different due to age and whatever she's paid for in her time falling apart I thought the ""I changed my hair"" line was their way of explaining why Leia looked so different in the universe when it was a new actor (then I saw in the credits it was actually her and looked it up because I couldn't beleieve it). New Han Solo ""Popo"" still comes across as the dorky loser that followed the cool kid everywhere (Han Solo) and then as soon as the cool kid fell out of the picture copied all his traits because they didn't have their own personality, and copied it so poorly it wasn't just a traditional ""fraction of"" the cool kid, but a performance so poor it ends up going into the negatives.Kylo Ren has some early-puberty mustache growth going in several scenes. Adam Driver can do proper facial hair so I don't know if he just forgot to shave for those takes and they were like ""who cares nobody will notice"", or if it's supposed to be an extension of the immaturity of his character.Mark Hamill seemed like he was reading right off the page after waking up for almost all of his material. He's more lively in interviews about Last Jedi than he is in Last Jedi.The movie itself is like some trash internet fanfic got picked up as an official screenplay for some reason. I went with people which is the only reason I saw it, and the only reason I didn't walk out. The guy that called me a ""negative nancy"" for saying it probably wouldn't be very good when he asked before it started, ended up needing to be woken up at the end because it was so bad, he fell asleep.I feel bad for these new actors knowing their greatest acting achievement will be starring in the worst Star Wars movies (to date), and then I remember how much they were probably paid.The best is definitely over though... walking out of TLJ, I felt the same way I did when I heard Trump won the election. At least Trump prepped me for other life disappointments... if not for that, who knows what I might've tried doing to myself when I got home from TLJ.",0
2911,"This movie is a dumpster fire of a bad movie. Faulty logic, poorly handled characters, plot holes that are too many to count, no synergy with any of the characters (except Rey and Kylo), and lazy terrible writing. Not to mention shoving down our throats political messages galore.Let's start with the start of the movie. The beginning space battle is a case study on how NOT to portray a space battle. If you want to see how it is really done right, go see Rogue One. That ending space battle was fantastic. Not only was it visually exciting, but it was fairly accurate on how air battles are run. The notion that you would ""drop"" bombs...IN SPACE is patently ridiculous. How stupid do you expect the audience to be??? There are viewers who are above the age of 2. And let's take for granted that there is some type of tech that allows objects to counter act the void of space and produce some type of gravity/magnetic ""bubble"", it STILL makes ZERO strategic sense! Poe had cleared the dreadnought of surface cannons (which I find AMAZING for a single X-wing fighter), why take the chance of continuing to put your people and bombers into harms way??? You are telling me you can affix that payload onto missiles that can be launched from a safer distance away? That whole scene is just stupid all all around.Secondly, who in their right mind believes that they handled Luke Skywalker in the proper way??? Luke Skywalker, a hopeful and optimistic man, was able to see a sliver of light in a Darth Vader (his father Anikan Skywalker) who for decades has committed genocide and atrocities. And he believed that he was worthy of being redeemed and saved!!! But for an instant saw some darkness in his own nephew, his SISTER'S and BEST FRIEND'S son, and thought he deserved to be struck down...MURDERED, at the swing of a lightsaber. That is the dumbest bit of writing for that character and clearly demonstrates how little Rian Johnson and Disney understand how to handle such an iconic character.Third, that space chase was long, boring, illogical, and the story arch went NO WHERE. OK, let's give them that they have the tech to track them through hyperspace. Fine. The chase at sub-light speed is on. You can't send a second contingent of ships or fleet to hyperspace in from of their trajectory to form a pincer movement??? Again, VERY lazy writing to try to force a plot that sucked to begin with. Flying Leia?!? No, JUST NO. And where she came into the ship on, there aren't any air locks? Everything else about that scene sucked, I guess why not. The ONLY thing that worked was the scene where Kylo hesitates to fire on his mother but then the other tie fighters in his squadron does so in his stead. This scene clearly cements the seeds of hesitation in him (It had been planted in him long before). To just have Leia die at this moment would have at least furthered Kylo's story arch. But no, we get Harry Potter Princess Leia. Vice Admiral Holdo. WHY WAS SHE IN THIS MOVIE?!? Just to have another female heroine? And her character STUNK!!! Not telling Poe what her plan was is just dumb. This of course forces Poe to conspire with Finn and Rose in what would be the crappiest amount of filler that amounted to NOTHING FOR THE OVERALL STORY in the Star Wars Universe. ""Was it worth it"" Lord, epic stupidity strikes again. You go through all of that to save alien space race horses, but I guess it's OK to let those slaves remain slaves. Look I am not for abusing animals, but did we have to be lectured on this in a Star Wars movie????? And the answer is, NOOOO it wasn't worth it!!! Your mission was to find a code breaker to get you onto the First Order ship to deactivate or destroy that tracker so that you could save the Resistance! It was to help make Rose's sister's sacrifice meaningful and to help save Rey if she came back! That whole Canto Bight story arch was a total disaster.Forth, if Luke Skywalker really does teach young padawans the ways of the Force like he did with Rey, it's no wonder Kylo said, ""Screw this, I'm out of here to find a real teacher!"" and destroyed Luke's Jedi academy! ""Just reach out with your emotions."" Oh man. Brutal. The writing totally stunk! It took Luke weeks, perhaps months on Dagobah with Yoda, physically training, mentally training, spiritually training to become a Jedi. Who in their right mind believes that even with talent, that without hard dedication, perseverance and training that you can ever realize becoming ANYTHING much less a Jedi????? That notion simply spits on everything we know to be true. Rey has no character growth. She's instantly great at everything! What a boring waste of a character. And YES!!! She shouldn't have been NOBODY, but the daughter of LUKE!Fifth, Killing Snoke like you did. WTF! You build up this character like you did in TFA and give us ZERO??? HE was the new Darth Vader! He had gravitas. He struck fear in people and made people believe was a real threat. Not Kylo.It Stunk!!!!",0
2912,They destroyed SW universe. Forever. With an agenda that uses nonsensical writing.,0
2913,"RIP SW universe, you will be missed. It is the end of the legendary story, became an empty shell for money grabbing.",0
2914,"There's a way to go your own way without giving a giant middle finger to your fan base. Heck, I didn't consider myself a star wars aficionado at all and this movie still made me irrationally angry about the treatment of the characters (specifically Luke). *rant begin* If this was anything but Star Wars the critics would have taken it to school over the lack of consistent tone (weird and off-putting humor abounds in what are otherwise supposed to be significant and awesome moments. And yes, there is a ""your mom"" joke in the first 5 minutes), the lack of character growth, the lack of physics/ any real rules in this universe now, and the overall disjointedness of the plot (Watch Disney shoehorn in a completely useless subplot to take a shot at rich aristocrats. Look, I hate rich aristocrats as much as the next person, but it comes off as hypocritical when Disney is simultaneously beating small theater owners into submission with new screening demands.). Every critic's newspaper that published a glowing review of this mess is trying to divert attention and say that all the bad reviews are from the alt-right people who can't stand feminists. But hey, the alternative would be to admit that they are really just in Disney's pockets. I guess the alt-right boogeymen story will have to do. I voted for Hillary. I didn't vote for Star Wars to turn into a ham-fisted attempt at social commentary. These movies were supposed to be an escape. A chance to take your mind off of the bitter division in today's politics and believe in real heroes again. Sadly, the only escape you will get from this movie is when the lights come on and you can move on with your life and accept that these movies aren't for you anymore.",0
2915,"I am a bit late here, but here it goes.Big budget film, huge franchise owned by a company known for making classics. Just, the plot. I have to talk about the plot.My first issue with the plot is based around character development. This is in the fact characters get better as you go along the lines of the series. We understand their weaknesses and strengths and become familiar and that we can relate to them, however instead, Rey (she already seemed abnormally good at flying, could even be better than Poe without even having experience), has beaten KYLO REN for the SECOND time through the force. One, we don't know who Rey's parents are, and thanks to Kylo always telling her she's nothing we just eventually become uninterested, and two, Kylo Ren... THE GRANDSON OF ANAKIN SKYWALKER, WHAT? You don't expect embarrassment to catch up on a scale like this. Snoke is killed in the second movie, so not only a young Kylo Ren is just been stripped of his proper potential but a character we were so fascinated by has just been killed by Rian Johnson. Despite this surprise being well played, it was better for it to be saved for a later time. Vice Admiral Holdo was not only introduced in this movie, but died on this movie too, an absolute shame. I'll list replacements from the originals if you want:Vice Admiral Holdo (Admiral Ackbar, war hero and loved by all fans) (Lando Calrissian, a real showman and also loved dearly as a friend of Han Solo and Leia Organa).We didn't know who this woman was, and I do wonder how she was not in any of the originals if she was Leia's FRIEND. Admiral Ackbar died AS A BACKGROUND CHARACTER, and Lando wasn't even IN the movie. Rubbish, these two are so dear to my heart, personally.Second point: Comic Relief. The command structure of the First Order seems drastically unprofessional and a four-year-old could see that the Resistance were so cramped together in that space battle that one ship flying down would've sent another tumbling. It's not a matter of who's smarter (Original AND prequel series) whoever wins is simply who's less stupid and incompetent. C3P0 is loved for his stress-releaser for Han, Chewie, Luke and R2-D2 on the Falcon, but really the humour now seems so forced. Luke drinking the green milk was disturbing, he's LUKE SKYWALKER. Not only that but he takes the mick out of the force. Leia and Holdo seem so harsh on Poe it's not even chuckle-able anymore, and the scene with Finn shooting water all over the place when he wakes up could've been executed better. General Hux (who in the Force Awakens I could say deserved to be the successor to Tarkin) is the centre of abuse even by the Resistance, who are not afraid to CALL this dude just for laughs. If anything, Hux has been ruined just for the sake of laughter, he doesn't deserve to be the sequel version of Tarkin anymore. Nothing quoteable in this new trilogy and he literally is even more of a joke than Rose and Finn's relationship...I've got to say, Captain Phasma did some cool stuff in the movie, including the fight with Finn. It was not only well made, but we know for sure Finn is able to, as he was one of the best people in the FN corps. Phasma shows determination and ability, but we see weakness in her selfishness and desire to always live. EXCELLENT CHARACTER! She's presumed dead, but I do hope she'll come back on the finale, as she's pretty cool and very unique.I would say Kylo had little improvement, and not only that but since he refused to become good again and killed off both Snoke and Skywalker, his potential is capped. He will NOT learn anything, or very little, and despite him being my favourite SW character EVER, I feel very sad that this is the height of his power, simply inferior in almost every way to a scavenger on Jakku. Adam Driver's performance was yet again stunning, MUCH MUCH applause to him for his talent.In conclusion, it's quite clear switching directors midway through a trilogy isn't a good idea. Not only were ideas, concepts and theories thrown away, but characters were wasted at basic developing stage, but Disney doesn't know there's only one more movie left. Where's the development?I thought Rey would be a relatable and revolutionary hero. Nope. Basically putting out a message that some people can just be good at anything (her) and others have to improve (Kylo, Finn, Phasma) is pretty much a demotivation for young people looking up to any sort of hero. If you're looking for a hero to look up to, Luke Skywalker, Jyn Erso, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn are obvious examples from Star Wars. Even mention Biggs Darklighter, Yoda, Anakin. They represent Sacrifice, Knowledge and Learning, and Determination and Ambition to me, and their flaws made them great characters with huge development.There's me out. I suppose I could talk more but, overall, the work put into this movie is good, yet the plot destroyed around 6 points in this movie.",0

2922,"Shallow, dumbed down, weird tone for a Star Wars movie, boring/nonsensical plot with Luke Skywalker, the greatest hero of one of my favorite universe's being relegated to a paranoid, possibly mentally ill, alien breast feeding mountain hermit. Speechless Disney - I am still in shock I think. All of the answers to interesting questions and cliffhangers from TFA were completely ignored in favor of introducing worse than JarJar - Rose and a plotline to talk about animal cruelty. What.... what... seriously? The fate of the galaxy is supposedly at stake here, but we need to take a random segway to watch people we don't care about ride donkeys and learn about why rich people are evil and animal cruelty is bad? It was so forced and cringy and out of place and a waste of screentime it felt like a saturday night live skit. The only reason this gets one star is because of the throne room fight scene, which was great. There were some other decent fight scenes, but they are forever ruined by the cringy humor and awful plot decisions i.e. fight with finn and phasma... ruined by cheesy deus ex machina finn saved by the elevator and bb8 piloting an ATST??!?! Wow, that was actually one of the worst things I have ever seen i.e. fight scene on salt planet ruined by cringy luke brushing dirt of his shoulder and rose rescuing finn who was trying to save the rebellion because she loves him after spending 5 hours with him?!? i.e. kylo ren fighting his way to the front of the rebel ship and blowing up the command center but then leia becomes superman?!?! Worst of all the entire plot was pointless. There was virtually no character development or interesting developments for the resistance except for the fact that we learned they are completely useless and now down to about 20 people that can fit into the millenium falcon. Possible the worst star wars of all time.",0

There is clear social manipulation going on when there is such a disparity between critic and user reviews. This film is horrendous in a vacuum, but within in the context of the SW universe its a giant middle finger to every fan of the franchise. Sad times ahead for Star Wars. Like most, I will have to do with the memories of the first 6 films and the quality extended universe cannon that has already been written into books and comics long before Disney took a dump on Star Wars. The 2 is for the music and acting (and so this review is counted in the average user score), both of which while top-notch could not save a horribly written and edited film.",0
2933,"There's a lot of heroes, and they all have journeys, but you know what Star Wars doesn't have? The Hero's Journey. How can you ever feel a character's triumph if it's not even earned? There are NO stakes to Rey or any character in this story. Everything is ""HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!"", I don't know, I must be this good. It just reeks of narcissism. Is it any wonder that the fans are divided? This has nothing to do with the Star Wars Lore. It's telling a good story. We were setup from the first film to find out why Rey has these great hidden powers and that she would have to train in the ways of the force. She was going to find out who were her parents. This could have been a great character arc. But no instead we were given characters that wins, and achieve the highest powers without trails, tribulation, and no sense of earned victory. Hense Mary Sue. Good Characters don't just achieve greatness because they are so great, they BECOME great through challenges, real dark confrontations, and it's only when they overcome them they are REAL heroes. Why do people love the old Luke? It's because he had to face so many obstacles and tribulations like that his family was murdered, he had to deal with the truth that his greatest enemy was his father. To face Vader meant he had to face himself. He would have to overcome fear all the way to turning to the dark side. He was the only one to believe that there was good in Vader, all the way till he even convinced Vader himself that he was right. All the side plots suffer this point and I don't need to cover them because the end result is the same. I liked some of the character's personality, but personality is not enough to carry a story. Good character development does.",0

2937,"This is the worst Star Wars movie of all. The second worst is Force Awakens. These new Disney films are not even Star Wars movies in the real sense because they completely depart from the 9 part screen play written by Lucas. Aside from this nitpick which is very important to Star Wars fans and probably much less so to casual viewers, Last Jedi is a bad film in its own right. Most of the issues with Star Wars 7 and 8 stem from Disney allowing JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson to direct each movie as they saw fit, with no regard for a cohesive story from one film to the next. For Last Jedi, Johnson either ignored or marginalized everything Abrams did in 7, which ignored or marginalized everything in the saga that preceded it. While Johnson did this in order to carve out his own vision for Star Wars, which was a self-centered motive, he would likely say he did so to subvert viewer expectations and surprise them. In my view Johnson tried too hard to be Hideo Kojima and missed the mark by a mile. Kojima is a master of turning a plot in a direction you did not see coming, but only after making you invested in the characters. Johnson subverts expectations so often that it leaves the viewer apathetic about the characters and the general outcome of the movie. Without including spoilers, Last Jedi leaves you wondering why certain characters were introduced, leaving most viewers unable to even name these characters after seeing the movie multiple times. Other characters who are supposed to be significant, die or otherwise leave the story without explaining who they were or why they mattered. The Last Jedi cultivates apathy like no other movie I have ever seen. It creates the type of apathy that makes even a hard core Star Wars fan get up to go get a slice of pizza during the movie and not care what they missed because it doesn't matter. Between Force Awakens and Last Jedi the story has been so thoroughly butchered that nothing can be done to salvage the final episode. The worst part of all this is the disservice it has done to Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, and Mark Hamill who were forced into scripts that were well beneath them and ended their story lines in unceremonious and apathy-inducing ways. Hamill himself is a well known critic of the Disney Star Wars movies and I'm sure would say far worse than he already has if he wasn't such a gentleman. In the end I regret having seen the Last Jedi and Force Awakens. These movies are not only just not enjoyable to watch, they undermine the feeling I have about the whole Star Wars saga and make the previous movies less interesting. I have spent the last couple of years trying to train myself to think that this is not what happened to the characters. This is what went on inside the minds of JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson and is totally unrelated to the Star Wars universe. If you have not yet seen the Last Jedi and are a Star Wars fan, I recommend not seeing this movie.",0
2938,I gave this movie a 0 because they totally deserved it!  They ruined all the characters!  The action was just silly for Princess Leah to float out into space and come back into the ship?

2939,"This was a movie that I had been anticipating for a long time and what they did to the whole Star Wars franchise was just shocking.Racism and sexism were apparent throughout the film - against white males. You have all these women in roles protecting men from danger, while the men sit around and let the women fight - not a biblical picture of Godly men stepping up at all. Dave Shilling from Birth Movies Death has a great quote, ""The series’ millennial good guys are a young white woman, a black man, a woman of Asian descent, and a Latino man, while its millennial bad guys are two white dudes.""The jokes were so bad. There was so much unnecessary humor that was so uncalled for. Throwing the lightsaber off the cliff. That wasn't funny at all - I knew the movie was ruined right from that moment.They have ruined the Star Wars that was so happily ended in Episode 6 Return of the Jedi. They killed Han Solo and made his and Lea's marriage disappear (more progressivism) in the last movie, and if that wasn't bad enough in this movie they make Luke, one of the most humble characters in Star Wars, into a jerk who hates Jedi. Mark Hamil even when on a rant after filming about how disappointed he was with his character Luke and said he was manipulated into someone he never wanted to be. And WHY ARE FORCE GHOSTS SO POWERFUL??? I am a true Star Wars fan and let me tell you that fans of the FIRST Star Wars episodes that were so good (4-6) did not enjoy this new movie.So much for fan theories. They killed off Snoke without telling us anything. They made Rey's parents into nothing and ruined all the hopes of fans. They do not care in the least what we think.The part when they went to the gambling planet was so unnecessary and I was completely lost.They made Poe, one of the best characters, into a really mean person who is outdone in character and wisdom by...you guessed it, a female commander who he is a jerk to.",0

The director Rian Johnson does not appear to understand what made Star Wars work. Childish humour was never a strength of the series and Johnson not only overuses humour, his intended jokes misfire one after another. Worse, like the prequels, TLJ has no sense for tone. One goes from tragedy to the most daft humour and back again. The best explanation for the mess that is TLJ is that Rian Johnson is having a whale of a time trolling all genuine SW fans. In any event, SW has been killed for good.",0
2944,"As a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy I hated this movie.Especially all the bad attempts at being ""funny"". I don't want a Star Wars movie that has jokes for little 3yr-olds.Just stop all this stupid slapstick nonsense when it isn't even funny.Also don't introduce characters like Snoke or Phasma wenn they are just killed without knowing anything about them.And stop casting actors only to make the movie more ""diverse"".Nobody wants a ""diverse movie"". What people want is a ""good movie"" instead.Also the movie didn't give a s*** about the last one (which itself was also not very good).Basically it is a Return of the Jedi ripoff that has a stupid Hoth-like scene.The movie is way too long for it's content.I never thought I would hope for George Lucas to return. Oh my god that's how much I hated it.Everything that Luke does in this movie is stupid.",0
2945,"TLJ is terrible, the writing is atrocious, there are plot holes everywhere, Unanswered questions like who made the Map to Skywalker? How did Maz get Luke's Lightsaber? Who are the Knights of Ren? Who is Snoke? Why are the good guys the underdogs again? Why is Rey so unbelievably OP?, Rose is a **** who will infuriate anyone who watches her with her ""Save the Animals!"" malarky, TLJ Luke is an assassination of who Luke Skywalker is, Admiral Holdo couldn't just tell everyone something that would have stopped a lot of conflict from happening in this movie it's almost as bad a plot hole as Luke not immediately asking Rey how the hell did she find him when Luke was oblivious that there was a map to him. oh god **** this movie. Then there's Superleia, other people say in this movie the force gets mystified again but i don't know why if anything this movie created so many plot holes regarding the force i can't it seriously anymore. It's just for plot convenience now, it's not a struggle that characters must train to learn anymore, literally anyone can do it without training even though Luke needed training and he's Darth Vader's brat. It makes no ****ing sense and it ruins the force for me. Like the force apparently space doesn't have any rules in star Wars anymore, i saw WW2 bombers in the movie drop bombs in space that need gravity to ever work. Also Canto Bight Casino feels like we're back in the prequels again, this entire section of the movie can be cut because of how pointless it is. Don't watch this movie, it sucks donkey balls.",0
2946,The Last Star Wars movie I'll ever see has zero story-telling and it doesn't want to build off of the hype episode 7 had initiated with JJ Abrams as director. They made Luke skywalker act like a frightened child and so out of character from the original Star wars movies. Luke went from being a heroic masterful jedi to a character who hates himself and those around him. It's never explained as to why the jedi must end when Luke says it. How the hell is leia alive after floating and freezing in space from being blasted out of the mothership? Yea there's mentions of her having some sort of abilities with the Force in previous movies but this movie doesn't care to explain it. Snoke was hyped up to become equivalent of Palpatin but kylo kills him in a flick of a finger. Nothing else is brought up of him. No one knows where he comes from or how strong he really is. Will he be brought back? Who knows and at this point who cares. For the love of god if you're gonna kill Luke one of the strongest Jedi to ever live and with the original actor still alive bless him to play the whole please make an EPIC **** SCENE instead he's too distressed from using the force to astral project. He died from intense meditation. This Star wars movie might have potentially killed the franchise as a whole we'll see in the coming years but personally I couldn't care less for Episode 9.,0

2955,"I do not understand what the critics are smoking.  This movie is not good.  Not good at all.  I expected it to be a bit campy and maybe not ""film"" material given that it is star wars but I watched on an airplane and I really wish I could have my two hours back.  It's heavy-handed with its messages, its jokes do not land, and it really fails to make one care one bit about its cast of characters.  Oh, and it starts with a drawn-out ""being on hold"" joke... yes, in a universe with no telephones.  I know everyone hates on the prequels and, yes, the prequels are worse than the original three movies (well, maybe, if we're honest, worse than the empire strikes back and about as good as the other two) but these recent three abortions cannot hope to hold a candle to the prequels...",0
2956,"I can't believe they ruined Star Wars. I have never heard such terrible dialogue, never seen so many holes in a plot, and have never been so let down in a big budget movie. Oh but the director did quite well with letting us know that women will be taking the lead in this film, though. I guess that's why rotten tomatoes gives this film a 90+%. Don't listen to it folks it is terrible (from a standard of story, dialogue, character development, and saga consistency)",0

Too bad no one though of that in any of the other movies...- Maz Kanata's reality show - who's filming this?- Delivers on ZERO promises from TFA- Flimsy plot points ('secretly' escape to the ONLY planet around?  That's your plan?  I can't believe THAT didn't work...)- He First Order, why not bring in another ship?  or use any of those ships ON YOUR CURRENT SHIP to head them off?  This movie is so dumb...- Luke won't fight Darth Vader (the 2nd most evil guy in the universe), but decides to slaughter his nephew over...a nightmare?- Ridiculous jokes- There's more.  This is just a rant.",0
2961,"So disappointing. Way to ruin a franchise. While the special effects are beautiful, everything else is rotten. The story is nonsensical and Luke Skywalker as Mark Hamil has pointed out is ""not my Luke Skywalker.""

2963,"Disliked this movie enough to write a review, which is a first.  Irrespective of the lack of plot (only ne actual meaningful thing happened which is that Kylo killed the forever enigmatic Snoke), the movie does not respect the intrigue that was set up in the film that preceded it.  Force Awakens was by no means a perfect film but respected the source material and captured the essence of Star wars.  This clunker arrogantly dismisses all of the interesting questions raised by that movie including: who is Rey?  Who is Snoke?  How did Maz Kanata acquire the lightsaber?  Who are the Knights of Ren? etc.  Luke was made into a helpless joke in this one.  For God's sakes they spent an entire movie in Force Awakens trying to find Luke and he refuses to help the ""good guys"" in any meaningul way.. Decoy?  Gimme a break.  How many decoys were in this movie lol.  At least the ""space horses"" were set free.  Heads should roll over this, starting with Rian Johnson.",0

2966,"Lazy story writing and more plot-holes than an average movie experience. I just don't see anything bold about this story. Lets see bad guys have new tech that has a single weakpoint? CheckDeath Star related weapon? CheckNew Heroes in safety bubble while everyone around them dies? CheckCute aliens to sell toys? CheckHoth like battle on sand instead of snow? CheckSpace chase like episode 5... well not as exciting but CheckOk now explain bombs that fall in space. Leia surviving space long enough to force pull back to the cruiser. Dj learning about the shuttles. Rose being portrayed as a strong female character, yet throws the survival of the resistance away for a fangirl love of Finn. Phasma was a complete waste. I enjoyed three moments in the film if I am being honest and the person next to me fell asleep in the middle and started snoring. When the movie ended no one clapped we all just sat there thinking WTF did we just watch.",0
2967,I agree that this film is a SW universe killer. Disney must be willing to destroy and rebuild to make something that fits it's needs so they can make a film a year for decades and not care how little sense make compared to the originals. If you like SW you will not like this one.,0
2968,Worst Star Wars ever. It has no star wars soul. Writers and producers failed to give the previous moves a worthy sequel.,0
2969,"Nothing really matters... except what we tell you.Plain and simple, the movie suffers from identity crisis.They dont want to be constrained with the setting but they want to profit on the same universe.

Lazy writing in general and capitalism at its worst.Bad:- Story/plot/script/ plot holes/ inconsistent (force gets reworked and such)- Flat main actress (not her fault though)- Humour- Destroyed legacy (dont count this if you arent a fan)- Too long/ pacing/ dynamic issues- Political correctnes/pandering to minorities/forced feminism (all males are functionally retarded)/propaganda/characters made up just for toysGood:+CGI/effects+Mark Hamil (if youre not a SW fan, otherwise makes you wanna cry)",0

I had hope after the Force Awakens, but this film seemed to intentionally spit in the face of series fans or really any cinema-goer with any amount of critical thinking, as the plot is meandering and ultimately pointless. The main theme of the film was about how the past needs to die and other hamfisted messages daisy chained together to slap viewers in the face with 'this aint yo daddy's star wars'-type schlock. Also Luke Skywalker had his character completely assassinated in such 180-degree ways that can not be explained as 'he got old' or 'he made a mistake and now feels super guilty about stuff'. I hated this film.",0
2975,"The worst Star Wars movie so far. They don't care about classic trilogy, extended universe or even Force Awakens. Just another money-grab from Disney with horrible never-ending jokes, gaping plotholes and butchered characters...Avoid at any cost!",0
2977,"Dumb scenes, weird humor, characters lacking of motivation and charisma, lots of new characters/creatures that are completely forgettable, scenes in the space lacking of every kind of sense (I'm not talking about sound traveling through space but a squadron of bombardier ships seems pretty difficult to miss in a screen).To sum up, a completely mess that blows every mediocre try of building a interesting story for the trilogy made in the prior episode.",0
2978,"Terrible entry in the franchise. It is not that hard to make a good Star Wars film, yet somehow the creative team behind this movie seemed to have trouble. Luke didn't feel like Luke at ALL, we still don't know who Snoke is and now he is dead, Rey received zero training of any kind yet is still excellent with a lightsaber and the most powerful jedi (clearly done because Rey is a female), Kylo Ren is a weak baby, Leia flying in space..??, and an anticlimactic death for Luke Skywalker who really should have been showcased as the most powerful Jedi because he EARNED that position - Rey didn't.

2988,"I had had high hopes when I was entering the cinema for Last Jedi. Upon leaving I wasn't disappointed or upset. I just felt really, really sorry for what Disney did to Star Wars. The Last Jedi fails both as an individual movie and, even more so, as part of a series and is one of the worst films I've ever seen.First and foremost it seems that the screenplay was written by somebody who was unhappy to make a movie which is the middle part of a trilogy. This is kind of understandable: second movie out of three means that your film will neither have a real beginning because it picks up, where the first movie ended, nor an ending, because it is a lead up to the third film. JJ Abrams built up a lot of potential, shrouding important pieces of the plot in mystery: Who is Snoke? How did he become the leader of what essentially is the ne Empire? Who is Rey? Where do her powers come from? Who were her parents? How do those characters tie in into the ""Skywalker Saga""? Rian Johnson decided to set all those carefully constructed pieces of the plot on fire and throw them out of the window into a dumpster. Snoke? Random guy, dies a random death, so who cares who he had been. Rey? Well, she's just a random Mary Sue. Skywalker? Johnson seems to hate him.Luke Skywalker's return was the very dramatic peak of Force Awakens, the entire plot of the first movie was building up all the tension to leave the audience with a cliff hanger, for finally, old Master Skywalker was found and the new main protagonist gave him his old light sabre back. What happens in Last Jedi? Luke throws the lightsabre away, in a manner which brings to mind the cartoon Coyote rummaging through the contents of his ACME toolbox. Funny? I think not. What's more, Luke's new personna doesn't seem to have anything to do with the old Luke Skywalker we'd known. And sure, people change. But considering that half the audience was eagerly awaiting the return of their old hero, turning a character, who literally is a pop culture icon, into a clown seems thoughtless.Unfortunately, such thoughlessness accompanies the events on e screen all the time - tearing down any respect we used to have to both the protagonists and antagonists in a failed effort to make the movie a Marvel-like goofy comedy. Where Marvel managed to make us both laugh at the antics of the superheroes and supervillains and at the same time like them Rian Johnson failed, and left the onscreen characters looking like unlikable idiots. And just like The Force Awakens was a build up for the rest of the trilogy, how are we supposed to care about what is to happen in the third movie? The only previously interesting villain, Snoke, is dead. General Hux and Kylo Ren are idiots and aren't scary at all. Same with protagonists. Rey is a Mary Sue, she wins at everything and is therefore boring. Same thing with Finn, who is only there to kick Phasma's arse time and again. Poe is an idiot. Carrie Fisher is dead. Mark Hamill is alive but his character is dead. So why care what happens to them in the next movie? To be honest it's perplexing how Johnson didn't plan ahead for the third installment in his own excuse of a movie.What is more, such lack of planning is the movie's biggest fault not only when you consider it as a part of a longer series, but also as its' own film. Even if you look at the film without the context of the ongoing plots, it is a mess. The whole plot with Finn and Rose travelling to collect an idiotic McGuffin from Random Place of Danger is totally irrelevant to the rest of the plot, its' outcome is null but takes half an hour of the onscreen action. The main villain dies randomly halfway into the episode. Luke Skywalker does all kind of random stuff and then all of a sudden he dies for no obvious reason. Johnson seems not to have had any idea for a plot but instead just filled the entire screentime with his stream of consciousness, improvising on the way.And if this wasn't bad enough, there's this one scene which goes completely against Star Wars canon. Those of you who are only reading this to fuel your own rage at Johnson's inaptitude know what I am about to write about. Faster than light travel. In one scene trumping all the previous idioticisms general Holdo rams her ship into the fleet of the First Order, destroying the flag ship. If you can do that, why hadn't they just light jumped a few ships into the previous Deathstars and Starkillers? It would have been a cheap, easy, instawin solution. In the next movies, when Resistance are trying to destroy the nextgen Death Stars I expect them to do just that. Get a ship and Press the Win Button!I could continue about other faults of the movie, but since I'm about to reach the 5000 sign cap, and I wouldn't do all this onscreen stupidity justice anyway, I'll just write that I've only covered most of the most ridiculous crap and left out the so much more that there is in the film. Congratulations Disney, 0/10.",0
2990,"No spoiler review. The last jedi's biggest problem for me, is that the over all tone just doesnt feel like the adult star wars bad ass movies we have gotten, even through the prequels. This was a little kids disney movie complete with so many poorly timed jokes and slapstick humor you lose track of the actual plot lines. My second biggest issue is the plot holes. George Lucas is called many things, but his team did a good job covering all of there nerdy plots because they know that nerds and fans love to debate star wars. And they did a pretty good job minus some things here and there. This movie was made by people that either are very out of touch with its fan base, or they are trying to change there fan base from nerds to more general public. Because this is not a movie meant for nerds. They dont even try to make the science make sense. They dont try to make the plot line up with the cannon of star wars at all. This is a movie for the general public to laugh and have a good time. If thats what disney wants to make star wars then so be it, but myself and the long term fan base is probably not going to stick around for another movie like this one.",0
2991,"ESB, ROTJ and ROTS are my favourites in that order. But seriously, I would rather have Jar Jar in every single Star Wars movie than watch the Last Jedi again. Stop defending it. It's not about theories, or about Luke Skywalker dying or about Rey and Snoke being nobodies. It's just that the movie sucks. End of story. The plot is not well written and it hardly develops throughout the movie. They build up the hype in TFA for nothing! If you want your characters to be no one, don't make it look like they are related to somebody we know! Besides, half of the movie is about two characters, one of them we don't know, and what they do is completely pointless. Finn and the asian chick could have just sat at the corner of the screen waving, because they entirely made the movie boring, as NO ONE cares about them. The script is just ridiculous. We understand that they want to make a new saga, one I won't be part of (I consider that without Skywalkers there isn't more Star Wars, as Lucas said Star Wars was about the Skywalkers), but they completely ruined it with this movie. They insulted our favorite characters and made their new ones look like invencible gods, aka REY, that without any training she is capable of besting Luke Skywalker... WTF PEOPLE. This movie is **** bad written and completely insulting. Its becoming another Avengers: the plot is not interesting but it has good visual effects and we can sell lots of **** **** Disney, I hope you crumble down to the ground like the Empire did. And thank you Mark Hamill for always supporting the fandom, even if it has cost you your character's life in this new garbage movie. People can say what they want and try to lie to themselves, but this movie has no redemption at all. What they did to Princess Leia... left me speechless. But what they've done to Luke? **** insulting. I'm out of this saga, but at least I have the Original and god, even the PREQUELS are better than this BS.",0

2993,"1st part - movie problems for movie fans2nd part - movie problems for movie/legends fansMovie:1. The very opening. We go from a Republic though with problems it has been established. The fringe group would be the First Order. We SKIP over the entire story of the downfall of the Republic to where we started off in 4/5/6.2. Where did the First Order get the money to pay for stuff AFTER the catastrophe of losing their death star? I know it wasn’t a death star but come on… it was a death star. They did not have financial outreach like the Empire did when the actual first and second death stars were built.3. No character development = no story4. Additional pointless characters – the vice admiral to name one5. **** on every dramatic moment with comedy6. Copies story lines from 4/5/67. Take the first scene with Poe and replace it with Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, or even Hann Solo and you have the exact same scenes we say 2 – 6.8. Leia’s powers were not established nor was her ability in the movie to move through space explained. You have to have read legends to know what is LIKELY what power she used.9. Luke’s battle with Kylo was like the Obi Wan and Vader fight with it ending similarly. This may have been for dramatic effect but it was undercut as well and just lazy writing. A new way would have been more powerful.10. They **** on the Jedi with disregard to all of their teachings.11. Luke’s reasoning for giving up on Kylo and then everyone else makes no sense for his movie character.12. Snoke was built up to be some super powerful being and then is just easily killed. You do realize they flex his ability in the force to show his strength and then undercut it by him not sensing Kylo’s betrayal right? Sidious was about to sense Vader’s changes in nearly all encounters when it happened. Sidious used a blade because of it being a crap on the Jedi but he himself was a force user primarily like Snoke supposedly was. The movie made Snoke so weak, and subsequently Kylo, that it is easy to argue that Sidious or Vader or maybe even Tyranus could have defeated Snoke with little effort. Legends:1. The Death Star was actually IN CANON established with Tarkin and Thrawn of costing a LOT of money. It was established that Grand Admiral Tarkin, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and Lord/Darth Vader were all fairly against it. Tarkin did take over and come to the side with the Emperor on it. If I am remembering it all correctly. For sure Thrawn and Vader were not for it. Why? Because it weakened the overall Navy because it cost so much they had to deviate from building other vessels like Star Destroyers and Super Star Destroyers which could cover more of space. Then it cost a LOT to build the second Death Star. So I ask you, WHERE did the First Order get the finances to make their own when the Empire struggled to pay it and they had a near entire galaxy paying for it?!?!?!2. The ability Leia used could be a force meditation which I found in Star Wars Specter of the Past and was used by Luke. It explains why she couldn’t open the door to get.3. The little fat animals are similar to Jar Jar. I liked Jar Jar and everyone hated him. They love the little ****. This bothers me.4. In the novels you get to learn what brought the downfall of the new Jedi, the New Republic, and the fall of many heroes. Why was that just hopped over?5. Why did we get literally near scene for scene and/or plot for plot 4/5/6 and some from 1/2/3 when there are so many stories to tell? My username is a call to a character in one such novel. You could talk about Bane who was made canon which likely means the old Sith are canon which could have been talked about. What about Plagueis or his master Tenebrous? What about stories that made Maul the actual character he was like Maul Lockdown? What about the Old Sith Wars, Mandalorian Wars, or the Yuuzhan Vong wars? What about exploring the good in the Empire by its soldiers like in Twilight Company? So many ORIGINAL stories and yet we got a copy and paste update.6. By weaponizing the hyperspace jumps etc it severely hurts or gets rid of the importance of some features of the Super Star Destroyers and the ENTIRE LINE of Interdictor – class Star Destroyer. Furthermore, why in the movie was an Interdictor – class Star Destroyer not used to simply trap the rebels so that they could only use their fuel on their ships and have no way of entering hyper space at all? This would have made what the Vice Admiral did not able to happen. (‘-’)/ if we are going to give them a Death Star then I cannot see why a much cheaper Star Destroyer would be out of the question in the movie logic.I am sure there is more that I am missing but at the moment these are the key things I could think of and remember.",0
2999,"I had huge hopes for this movies as I thought it wouldn't be as bad as everybody has said it would be. I liked Force Awakens maybe it had similarities with New Hope but I liked it nevertheless.So the beginning was good actually the best part of the entire movie. Poes call to Hux was funny I had to admit that I laughed to it. But after that I felt they were trying to make joke at every scene possible. There were many plot twists that were good and unexpected but they also rised a lot of questions, like Snokes dead. Special effects were amazing. All explosions and the battle with those red quard guys looked good.The best way to express this movie is wtf. It had so many weird and bizarre moments. Finns and the god-knows-who-little-asian-kids side adventure in the casino planet was boring and stupid. Also the rebel ship had 18 hours to fuel so the First Orders plan is to keep shooting at them. Why didn't they just board it? And what the actual **** was Leia flying in space? Care to explain??? Ok no. How can anyone track someone in lightspeed? Seriously how? ""Oh you know they have this thing in their ship so we need to call to this random old lady who tells us to go to this random planet to find this random guy who does something random."" Also when the stormtroopperwannabes showed up they decided to drag them on this huge open area full of them and kill those two as slowly as possible. It was so stupid.Reys ""training"" wasn't any better. She just swung lightsaber few times and closed her eyes so now she is supposed to be the greatest jedi ever. Also the fact that Reys parents were nobodies is also really stupid. I mean atleast Anakin was made by midichlorians but Rey is just nobody.Last battle in the salt planet was also really stupid. They had atleast hundred soldiers there first and then suddenly they had like 10. And the best plan they have is to fly with those old speeders with no cannons. And it's actually reaaaaaaaaaalllly great coincidense that out of 13 speeders the 3 that survive are the ones with the most important characters + that one kid. If Finn would have died it actually would have been lot better. But again we have this annoying kid who no one cares about. And the worst part was that she didn't even die. No one ever asked for stupid love triangle with Finn that kid and Rey. It's so stupid and idiotic. It is supposed to be star wars not twilight. Also the way they found way out from the base was also so stupid. ""Yeah there is no way out from here, oh wait there is haha.""Luke surviving the attack was cool and I was sure he was using some badass forceshield or something but no. He is kind of ghost but then he is not ghost. How did he do it and why did he do it and why did he had to die? It's so confusing.So overall it was decentish movie. But star wars movies aren't supposed to be just ok or not that bad. They are supposed to be the best movies ever made. So maybe Force Awakens and Rogue One weren't as good as earlier films but atleast they were watchable and enjoyable. But anyways Im still watching the next one and Disney gets more money so its win-win.",0
3000,"Ok let's talk about episode 8.  First I would like to talk about the good things that were done.  Good#1: The characters.  Never before have I seen this level of depth in characters in a movie. We get to see Ray go through rigorous training with our beloved hero Luke Skywalker. We get to see her struggle...her failures...and her growth in the force.  We finally see why she had visions when she touched Luke's lightsaber.  Or why she was wearing a gold leader helmet in the force awakens. Or where she came from.  And she is a very compelling character thanks to Rian Johnson's writing, even if these things wouldn't have happened.Kylo Ren finally receives his training from Snoke.  Again we see his struggle and growth as a character while he undergoes rigorous training from his master. And i love the ""I have to kill my parents"" aspect of his character. Very dark!  I am so glad that he took his helmet off and broke it btw because his character is much more compelling without it on.  I was sick of the mystery and fear that his helmet was providing us as an audience.  Now i can really relate to him!Poe, Finn, Rose, Purple hair lady...wow.  Not only am I glad they chose to introduce such new and engaging characters to the franchise, I am also glad that they were so pivotal to the story.  Without them...The Last Jedi would have surely failed. Luke and Leia:  They were great.  Got to see Leia's new force powers which were awesome!  She is truly one with the force.  And Luke really showed off his teaching ability while smacking Ray on the hand with grass.  I would have never thought of that technique.  But it clearly worked, because she really seems to know what she is doing!  And stop hating on Luke cause he almost killed his nephew.  Stop!  He loves him.  And remember in the Return of the Jedi when Luke almost kills Darth Vader?  He stops right when he has the advantage.  Good old Luke back to his old ways!Ok let's move on to the plot:Plot:...umm...ok well?...where...should i begin...hold on i'm trying to think about the meaningful events that took place in this movie...oh yeah!  Now i remember!What an amazing chase sequence...I mean...movie!  Wow I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering if the First Order would catch the Rebels!  And the casino side story?  Excellent choice.  I learned a lot about animal cruelty and how casino's in space have a wide variety of alien life.  That was awesome!  Ray and Kylo's connection is so amazing and mysterious.  It truly is the backbone of this movie.  Every time they had a connection i was like ""wow, this is an important moment.""  And i was never let down. Well that covers the main plot elements...Visual effects/Sound:Visual effects SUCKED BADLY!!!  Music was TERRIBLE!!! Thank the maker the rest of the movie carried all the weight!Writing/Dialogue/Pacing:Perfection.  Rian Johnson really proves his writing skill with The Last Jedi.  He is a genius, and anyone who doesn't respect what he did is clearly not on his level. Nothing seems forced, especially not the comedic elements.  I was laughing my butt off during this movie!  What great timing he has, and comedic wit.  This did not feel like a piece of fan fiction with an expensive price tag.  I never felt like ""wow...this part is really...dragging on with nothing to drive the momentum forward...so...why is this happening???""  I never felt like that!  And speaking of momentum...Momentum into Episode 9:It's all there!  Thanks Rian Johnson!  I can't wait to see what happens in Episode 9 when...umm...well?...we finally see what happens to...?  I guess i'm looking most forward to the resolution of...actually...wait.  Ok let me start over.  If they don't resolve the conflict between......wow i'm not sure why i'm struggling to put this into words i loved The Last Jedi!  So when Finn...uhh...actually Poe.  When Poe finally...yeah...I must be drawing a blank here.  Ok when Ray and Kylo finally kiss that will be awesome!  And when Luke...oh he died...but Leia!  Yes when Leia...is also dead...whoops.  Oh boy.  I must look like an idiot writing this.  Snoke!  Oh my gosh when Snoke finally reveals who...he...is dead too...Well i still can't wait for episode 9!  Which should take place three days after episode 8.",0
3002,"Very, very disappointing.I went into this movie after reading glowing reviews from critics, calling this the 'best Star Wars movie since Empire'. The Force Awakens was a decent outing, but just teased us with the Luke Skywalker appearing in the very last scene of the movie. The credits rolled before he even spoke a word. This film picks up from this point exactly.We wait nearly 35 years for this moment only to be let down monumentally. We see his character throw his fathers light sabre off a cliff, as if to say he does not care of its significance. A metaphor for how this movie does not care for the characters and lore of the previous films in this saga. The characters in the movie actually clumsily state repeatedly how the past must be 'killed' The treatment of Luke's character is bemusing. Mark Hamill himself stated on more than one occasion how he fundamentally disagreed with how the character was written. The writer/director Rian Johnson chose subverting expectations over consistency and good storytelling.The tone of the film is totally messed up - every serious moment is undermined with a bad joke. No-one laughed at this poor jokes at my screening.This movie looks gorgeous, the effects are fantastic, some of the action is great to watch. BUT it disregards how the universe works, the characters do not seem consistent with the previous films, it has very clunky overtly political tones.I left the cinema very disappointed, and did not return. This is the only Star Wars  movie I did not see multiple times in the cinema, the only one I did not buy on Blu Ray. After seeing this I could bring myself to watch Solo; I just did not want to be let down again.",0
3003,"One of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life, and this is completely ignoring what it did to the franchise. The characters are a series of unlikeable buffoons, that act in such a stilted, and unrealistic manner that even 6 year old who just learned to write think this is stupid, the only two exceptions to this being a metal ball and a hairy beast, both saved by the fact that they're not subtitled and you can just imagine them cursing at the other characters.The same goes for the rest of the movie. Story, places, background events, jokes, you name it.The one point I gave it is for ILM which should be freed from the tyranny it lives under right now, and set onto working on good movies. That said, the effects were good, not that there was any logic to what those effects portrayed.",0

Mais comme dans le précédent épisode, le plus gros souci réside dans le casting des ""nouveaux"" personnages qu'on retrouve naturellement ici... On a en effet rarement vu une telle galerie de tronches de cake au charisme d'andouilles périmenazes. En fait, à part la petite Daisy qui s'en sort à peu près, tout le reste n'est qu'une triste bande de cons.Or, on ne construit pas, on ne continue pas une saga avec des tanches pareilles parce que c'est trop gênant et trop embarrassant de voir ça. Malgré les effets spéciaux tip-top, malgré une réalisation tout-à-fait appréciable ma foi ! et j'allais presque dire qu'on ne s'ennuie pas (trop)... mais c'est faux : avec ses deux heures et demi, ça tire vraiment sur la corde de l'ennui et d'une lassitude certaine.Les deux retraités sont quand même revenus faire leur baroud d'honneur, très anecdotique pour Mamie Leia Nova Organa qui peinerait à faire vendre deux paquets de yaourts mais impressionnant, oui très impressionnant pour Skywalker (ton papa serait fier...!). Il apporte un peu de grandeur à ce film rempli de blaireaux et pour des instants, pour des instants seulement, on y (re)croit encore. Bravo Mark et merci.Pour le reste ou plutôt pour les restes de ce remake, on pourra mentionner l'excellent Del Toro qui est venu faire coucou pour la gamelle et... c'est tout.

Sure the resident evil movies are horrible but the resident evil franchise is not star wars, the last predator movie actively ruined everything that was established, same with Alien covenant, sure you can find many other examples, but in proportion to how beloved the original trilogy was, for how horribly they mistreated the old cast in this one, there has never been a precedent, this is the worst possible movie to have ever existed, period!",0

There are no good shots.  I give some points because of the strong female leading character which is refreshing and unusual. Unfortunately she has had zero development as a character and the acting is uninspiring, I don't feel any connection to her whatsoever, or to any of the other dumb characters. The dialogue is embarassing and the jokes ruin most scenes. The whole film is an embarrassment.",0
3015,"This move just killed Star Wars for me. Luke Skywalker especially had his whole legacy invalidated. Rian Johnson may not be a bad filmaker but  I think he is just not suited for Star Wars. Because of this,  Episode IX sucked as well, trying to fix the damage THIS film caused.",0

3018,"This movie is just a complete abomination to everything Star Wars. It is not only a terrible in and of itself but craps all over everything that came before. No setups from the Force Awakens are addressed. Luke is degraded into grumpy drunken uncle, Adm Ackbar tossed out the window offscreen(literally), long pointless subplot to casino planet, slow chase through space while running out of gas, weaponizing hyperspace like it’s “super easy, barely an inconvenience”, Rey can do EVERYTHING with no training, Finn wasted as a comic relief sidekick, any sort of meaningful plot and character development pushed aside for the sake of identity politics....I could go on and on here but you get the point.

Я не знаю, зачем меняли режиссера, но сажать в это кресло человека, который не только не поклонник вселенной SW, но как мне кажется даже преыдущих фильмов не видел! Это надо уметь, за 2 часа смыть в сартир всю историю Люка Скайуокера (на минуточку основателя новой академии джедаев, легенды новой республики, учителя и наставника Джейны и Джейсена Соло, ах простите режиссер про них и не слышал, поэтому просто выкинул на свалку). Люка представили как дурня какого то, который сломался на первой же неудаче со своим учеником. Тоже мне легенда!

3031,"A zero might be an exaggeration. It's more like ONE (1), maybe a two but I'm sticking to one here. Is it entertaining? Kinda. Almost. A bit too long even for a bad movie with a couple of interesting scenes. Is it flawed? Terribly so. This movie is awful, and should've NEVER been made. Forget the charm of the original trilogy: the Last Jedi follows the MARVEL flick formula of throwing in supposedly funny jokes and gags every 5-10 scenes. There's a lot of techno-babble filler talking, a lot of poorly developed characters you won't care about, a lot of bad BAD dialogue in general. I don't like it, to say the least. In fact, after they're done with this, I fully expect a reboot (just as awful).",0

I was soooooo looking forward to watching this movie but it was so god awful and **** it was like being back watching the Phantom Menace and walking out and thinking how could a Star Wars Movie be this **** At least the Phantom Menace FELT like a Star Wars movie, come back Jar Jar all is forgiven! Theres all of these people saying The Last Jedi was amazing, really???? - apparently good story isnt high up on the directors to do list, all i hear is it had good 'visuals' and its 'well made' and its 'bold' - bugger right off - how about GOOD STORY!!!!! and the fan boys all blindly saying its amazing and imagine anyone having the audacity to say it was **** - calling people haters or trolls etc - bugger off - if you read enough of the Negative comments including this one these negative reviews are written by REAL people, stop trying to excuse how **** this movie was - makes you look retarded and sad that your grasping at straws, your tiny little minds cant comprehend why the hate - if you loved the movie good for you, i really wish i saw the movie you saw or perhaps you were drunk or high on pop corn or sugar or something - was going to see this a 2nd time, guess what? - wont be happening! Star Wars The Last Jedi 0/10 for wasted potential and bugger your visuals - p.s.

3034,"Terrible. The color scheme should've been darker, the dialogue was too campy, and due to those factors the movie never found its identity. This movie felt like it belonged next to the Jarjar binks disaster. I'm not sure why the little birds were included at all, Chewy was cut in for nostalgic purposes and had zero effect on the plot. Or why Leia was able to fly through space??? Are you kidding me? Or how about when Luke told Rey at the end of the first lesson that he couldn't teach her anymore and she didn't resist the dark...and then literally 2 minutes later and with no dialogue in between or forward plot movement he goes ""Lesson 2..."". Felt like I was taking crazy pills. The movie bounced in between terrible cheap jokes. The lone bright spot in the movie were the scenes of Rey and Rylo connecting, the suspense and tension were at their highest during those scenes. Also, why did the flying go karts need to drag an antenna on the mining planet at the end, why would that help them fly better??? So there could be more useless distracting color added to the screen? The entire scene looked like it was manaufactured for an instagram photo shoot.",0
3035,"Star Wars has hit a low I never thought was even possible. I saw this movie twice and watching it a second time just made it even worse. As a huge Star Wars fan, I tried so hard to like this movie, but it failed in almost all categories. The movie is driven on continuous plot conveniences and has countless plot holes. All of the characters were lazily written and uninspiring. There was no satisfying ending to any of the plot points and some plot points from episode 7 were completely ignored. The movie continuously contradicts the rules and lore in the originals and prequels. Even worse, it contradicts itself a few occasions. The writing of the script felt childish. Words like ""tooling"" and ""unfindable"" have no place in Star Wars. The numerous attempts at comedy failed miserably. They felt so out of place and ruined the immersion. Honestly, I don't understand how Lucasfilm allowed this.",0
3036,"One of the all time worst Star Wars films, ranked above Phantom Menace and Attack of Clones, but that is it.  The fact that the critics loved it is evidence of Disney's terrifying control over the media.  1. Too long, 2. Poor acting by most except Driver and Hamill (Ridley okay), 3. Canto Bight, 4. Out of gas space chase, 5. Luke is portrayed as a confused coward.  Better he would have just been the villain.  6. The Porgs/obvious merchandising, 7. the replay of Hoth at end, 8. Superman Leia, 9. Ackbar dies off screen, and 10. Admiral Purple Hair (great actress) awful character, and 11. Do not even let me discuss the atrocious Rose/Finn plot line and the Phasma atrocity.  At least Phantom Menace knew it was for kids.  Last Jedi has such cringe worthy kiddie moments combined with over the top Star Wars violence that it makes sense who this movie was targeted at other than reviewers paid off by Disney.  There is no honest review that says this is a good film.  If you are not a big Wars fan, you may not hate it.  There are a couple beautiful shots and some of the special effects are great.  (Canto Bight a MAJOR exception).  But no one would call this a classic or even remotely compare it to the originals.  My son summed it up best in two short sentences: ""There was no big sword fight. That was boring dad.""  Rian Johnson should never be allowed near a script again, but shame on Kathleen Kennedy and everyone at Disney who thought this neophyte should be trusted to draft the second installment of a major franchise.  Zero credentials as a script writer and dubious credentials as a director.  As much as Johnson is being slammed and deserves to be slammed, most of the blame must fall on the executives who green lit this buffoon and allowed this travesty to hit the theaters.  Yes, it made a fortune because we all loved Star Wars.  No, I will not see the next installment and would prefer a complete reboot of the series rather than suffering through the Rey/Ren trilogy once again.",0

Turning Luke into a coward was a filthy; Yoda in a clown, was a filthy; In fact, everyone is a comedian in this movie. LEIA FLYING IN SPACE. Come oooonn!!!!!!! Hux became a ridiculous one (where is that tense dispute with Kylo??); Snoke became a nobody, just like the Rey's parents; Finn, before he was a born rebel, was transformed into a dazzled by the casino; Maz Kanata in a fight for the union's command?

Snoke dies with zero character development in the most pathetic ending to a villain in cinematic history! The graphics are nice! Who cares that the plot makes no sense and that Luke Skywalkers character was destroyed just before he dies?""Nope...my denial has cracked. This movie is pure garbage. It is WORSE than the Star Wars prequels by a longshot. I never thought that was even possible, and Force Awakens and Rebel One was damn fine improvements. This movie takes a huge steaming **** on all of them. Laughable camerawork, terrible progression and the worst character development ever. Now Luke Skywalker, the hero of the galaxy is a whiny emo pessimist who **** and complains. Yoda doesn't give a **** about him burning down the Jedi Temple for no reason. Leia gets shot into space and somehow uses the Force to save her own life, but doesn't know to use to Force to prevent the Rebels from walking into a trap? ****ty pointless scenes everywhere, like the stupid casino scene which has pointless moralizing and substandard characters. All the characters are downright awful. The worst offense is Snoke, this character that was hyped to oblivion is completely useless and is betrayed by Kylo Ren in such anti-climatic fashion, untoasted white bread that is eaten on mayonnaise and stale rotting ketchup remain less mediocre in execution. The ending is god awful, what exactly does Luke Skywalker die for? So that his apprentice who gets force powers with no effort can fight the boring Kylo Ren? **** Kylo Ren, he is a terrible character who is a travesty compared to the might of Darth Vader. Did I mention how boring and disjointed everything is?! Transistions occur out of nowhere and you have no time to adjust to any scene before the director farts out another useless transistion in your face to another filler scene which goes nowhere!Bottom line: The Last Jedi is the WORST Star Wars movie ever made. It is so awful it defies all logic and any sane comprehension. Avoid this monster of a film at all costs and boycott future Star Wars installments unless the entire directing team is rebuilt from the ground up. When Mark Hamill himself says he hated this movie, you know that you have officially RUINED Star Wars. Shameful display Disney...shameful abomination. Worst movie of 2018 BY FAR.",0
3041,"As big fan of the Star Wars saga, who grew up watching the other two trilogies, I was very excited about this ""new tone"" that TLJ would bring to the galaxy.Rian Johnson's Lopper was promising and JJ Abrams had already quite successfully created foundations for the next instalment of the saga. Characters have already been established and stakes have spiralled. A new, mysterious and exciting villain came to the stage, Kylo Ren was supposed to finish his training and Rey was supposed to start one of her own with the only surviving Jedi Master.And the expression “supposed to” defines this movie. What plotlines have been established in TFA were almost immediately dropped in TLJ. There would be no harm in that but the way it was done did not do the characters justice. Without getting into too much detail Snoke feels complete pointless to the overall plot. Luke doesn’t even resemble the Luke we used to know and without any proper backstory there is no reason ROTJ Luke would do the things he had done here. Not to mention the slap-on-the-face joke. Comedy in this movie is altogether tasteless, tactless and completely immersion breaking to a degree it requires a separate section.Furthermore, the mystery surrounding Rey’s parents has been just thrown out the window. And with all of this missing what are we left with? The Disney Jedi Cinderella (or DJC) is one of the worst major characters in SW that I have seen so far. Even Jar Jar, however annoying he can be, had a better story. Like with Rey, Kylo Ren’s, Finn’s and Poe’s characters have been totally wasted. Not to mention Maz Kanata’s cameo which looks like it was shoehorned in there. What are we left with? Holdo has a huge part to play but the conflict which arises do to the role of her character isn’t just pointless, it’s completely illogical. I won’t even mention Rose who is just a complete waste of Diversity/Inclusion and only Social Justice Warriors can be happy about her character. Not only is he poorly written, drives a 20 minute pointless plot line which ultimately has no impact on the story at all. Again, like many other things in TLJ, it feels like Disney is trying to reprogram our minds instead of producing a good movie.Time to change the topic a bit and let’s talk about comedy/comic relief. TLJ tries to do what Marvel has been so proficient at. Deliver an exciting story, sometimes dark and serious, with little drops of humor which remind us that at the end of the day Iron Man is just a comic book hero. It not only provides relief but also creates a feeling that the Marvel movies are comic book adaptations and shouldn’t be taken too seriously. They are made for fun. Star Wars on the other hand, even though a bit of humor has always been there since the original trilogy, it never took centre stage and would never, I repeat NEVER, break immersion. To say the least and keep this text short the scene were Luke casually throws away the light sabre is nothing more than a slap on the face for the audience. Regardless if you are a fan of SW or not. With this we have arrived at the biggest issue I have with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Its plot just doesn’t make sense. The conflict is only crated for conflict’s sake and doesn’t make any lasting impact on any of the characters. They all survive, besides Luke, but do we know what the state of the galaxy is? What has really happened to the Resistance, where are they at now? And what about the Jedi? All throughout the movie we are told that the old must day, Jedi have to end. And do they? Of course not because Ray saves the ancient texts even though Yoda in his little cameo destroys the tree and the books. So are the Jedi gone? Should there be a new way to follow the force? No, because in the end Ray saves the books? And Why? Judging by where the story goes it won’t even be explained in the final movie.So are there any good things about the movie? Yes there are. Visuals are stunning, fights are amazing but, the Space Opera feeling the previous movies had is completely gone. Fans have been left mistreated and I honestly don’t see any reason why new fans should appear. I walked around Smyth’s Toys in Ireland the other day and found almost none of the toys. And whichever were left had discounted prices less than a year after the movie was released. This just speaks volumes about how successful this movie has been.And finally, as I am no critic, I think critics are wrong about this movie. Not because they aren’t fans but they completely miss the point exactly how this movie did. It is just a poor movie. Is it worse than The Attack of the Clones? Just ask the fans and you will see, hear and know what the answer is: It is just a poor movie, hollow shell which everyone will quickly either forget or want to forget.",0
3042,"Late review, decided to submit since solo is gonna come out soon.Personally not a hardcore star wars fan, but has seen the original trilogy and the prequels.The force awakens was okay, would give it 5-6, but this movie, I would say the directors completely ignored their fans and focused on expressing their own political views instead of actually telling a compelling story. IMHO this is an incredibly bad move regarding the marketing of the movie, what the studio should focus on should only be on its fan base, anything other motivations should be kept at a minimum, yet we have all these social justice stuff that the old fan base cannot care less about. What's more is that the directors even said in interviews that they do not care about their fans, compare this with infinity wars and you can clearly see the difference between the attitudes of the leaders of the studios.Two points goes to visual effects, its a 200 million dollar budget film after-all.Would not go to see any new movies from the studio until they realize which is more important: fans or politics",0

I'm looking at you Rey/Finn/Poe. The three of you might be fine in the three stooges but in SWs......And the **** is Rose doing? The lame gags and infantile humour might belong in a kids version of SW or the cartoons, but it has no place here. She is basically a Vietnamese Jar Jar binks eating up screen time.I just get the feeling Disney went with a bunch of young bad actors so that they could keep the fees low and squeeze the Franchise for all it's worth since the kids will be around longer and can be spun off into more side stories.TLJ felt less like a Star Wars Episode and more like a marketing movie for Star Wars written by big data analytics to pander to as many market segments as possible without actually delivering anything of substance.Well done Disney. I must say that you have hit a brand new depth of low when you make me pine for George Lucas and I hated episode 2.",0
3051,"When i saw TFA i felt anger because it was a copy of episode 4... When i left the theater after watching TLJ i felt sadness because how they treated Luke Skywalker character, i can overlook the slapstick humour, the cheap death of Snoke, Rose & Finn filler mission and leia's ridiculous travel in the vacuum... What i cant overlook is Luke trying to murder his nephew un full sith mode like palpatine killed plagueis, giving up and not even caring for his sister , not going to fight one last time against kylo ren and dying in the battlefield like the hero we all knew and love, instead of that we get a ridiculous force projection that by the way is by no means a cool force power or a interesting one, its a cheap desicion made by rian johnson to make something different but in a terrible way. RJ craps all over we knew about the force ...Yes, this movie is different but at the expense of butchering more than the half of the lore of Star Wars",0
3052,"This movie has so many problems, it is difficult to know where to start. Let's start with the fact that it completely invalidates not only everything that happened in the original series, but also everything that happened IN THE LAST MOVIE!! (Which was equally terrible, by the way). So much for destroying the Empire and restoring freedom and peace in the galaxy. And Luke's character assassination in this movie is borderline criminal. They took one of the most iconic characters ever created and turned him into a cynical loser who's behavior makes no sense whatsoever. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say I am no longer interested in any new productions in this franchise. I regret the time I wasted watching this movie.",0
3054,I feel so sad for all the Star Wars fan because they deserve so much better. This film is just so bad it's hard to know where to start... worse than justice league. How will JJ save the trilogy? Rian Johnson should never be allowed behind a camera again.,0
3055,"It's a shame, there's the potential for a good trilogy somewhere in this politically correct mess, but it gets lost with Disney's ploys just to sell tickets like throwing in obnoxious poorly written characters acted by minorities (Rose) and -insert jumping the shark- moments like Leia's space flying shambles.The villains are also poor - General Huxley is about as cliche and lame as you'll get. There wasn't much point to Snoke... Ren is not threatening, Rey bested him in the first one easily.The humour is misplaced, when there's some good tension it's immediately ruined by wannabe 'Marvelesque' humour, it lacks any class, finesse or flow.The two movies attempt to throw in nostalgic moments to drum up those old feelings. I remember actually loving the start of the first movie, then once it settles down and Disney's ticket-selling ploys come to light, it just turned me off, the exact same happens here.",0
3059,"I don't want to say what is wrong with this movie but I will point out what is right:-Mark Hamill.-Oscar Isaac.-Daisy Ridley is cute but nothing more.-The first space scene, the first 5 minutes of the movie.-The scene with the bombers.-The CG, in general, is top notch.  They CG team did a nice job.-The scene with the AT-AT.",0
3060,"This movie is an absolute mess. The plot makes no sense. The entire story of the resistance amounts to a slow motion car chase with a pointless side quest tacked on for the sole purpose of filming another funky star wars theme planet. The few decent battle sequences we get are brief and simplistic, and every hint of a true fight between the main characters either becomes a giant fake-out or simply gets interrupted by EXPLOSIONS before anything interesting can happen. It's like the writers were determined to make the answer to every mystery from TFA ""nothing"" as if that would make the movie interesting and mysterious, and instead it just makes every reveal a big let down.So many characters are absolutely wasted. Luke is reduced to the role of cowardly hermit who refuses to do anything for the entire film, and even when you think he has finally joined the fight it's really a mirage, just like this film. It's all snoke and mirrors with no real substance.",0
3061,"no emotion , nothing explained , who is snoke , how snoke turned kylo ren in to the dark side , why rey is that powerful , why luke is such a crazy old man when he was brave as **** ... disney has destroyed the franchise , since the revenge of the sith all is bad ...after a second time watching the movie , i must admit it improves a lot , perhaps i had too much hype , is better than episode 1 or 2 for example",0
3062,"We all knew that this new trilogy would be desinged for today's viewers to succesfuly sell it. But for god's sake when the population of US turned into anti-white fashist femininsts? Why a ten year old boy or girl needs to see stupidly bad white males as villians and brown/black people, dumb women and ultra powerful droids must be accepted as heros? All the characters are either idiots or cowards. In the old movies all masters light or dark earned their places in hardship, and they fought epic duels in front of our eyes. In these new movies both old masters and heros are shown as cowards and losers also they do not stand a chance on the camera. This time Luke did not even actually fight against any one. In the old movies both villians and heroes had pure causes while on the new movies noone has a real cause to struggle, this effects the value of the movies. The Last Jedi will not end the SW Saga, it just renders the importance of SW Saga as if all the doings of both the Siths and the Jedis, the Imperials and the Rebels were invain, pointless, meaningless. As if that little boy called Anakin never ever lived. All the fun was the small group of people working shoulder to shoulder to stop an evil presence. Both humor and stress was about that little group in all the scenes. Han, Leia, Luke, Chew, 3Po, Artoo in the older trilogy. Qui Gon, Kenobi, Anakin, even Jarjar, 3po, Artoo, Padme in the newer trilogy. They briefly tried Rey, Finn, bb8, Poe but it was destroyed in this movie, Poe just pilots, Finn and bb8 does stupid things with that girl, Rey flirts with Kylo. This is the main reason I guess, not Luke's ending or other plotholes, but the absence of a ""close group"" having a ""journey"" while fighting, running whatever, makes this movie not feel like a SW movie :( I understand they want to sell toys and as the resistance finished in this movie we will see all new toys in the next movie but without a soul and without any good plots to actually have fun while watching it, it is obvious that the frenchaise gonna perish in front of our eyes.  For the technical part:1- If hyper jumps work against enemy vessels why the hell nobody used it back in the old six movies?2- Why you killed Ackbar instantly, he should have been the last captain sacrificing himself to cover the abandoning crew?3- If Yoda was able the strike lightenings as a force ghost why the hell no jedi force ghosts ever helping to defeat the dark side?4- How the hell Rey can be so good in being a jedi on her own?5- How Rey would claim herself a jedi by her own?6- Ok Snoke is dead but if he was who he claimed to be, with all that visdom and power how the hell he fell to that stupidly easy move?7- Why Luke told Kylo that there will be more jedis when he was so sure that jedi order was wrong and had to be destroyed?8- What is the point of resisting against this stupid First Order morons? 9- Why we watched Finn and that idiot resistance girl go all that long to bypass the tracker when the remnants of the fleet should already jumped while secretly sending the forces to the planet?10- How with all those resources the Fist Order can't bring the ""totalitarian peace"" upon the galaxy?",0
3063,As a Star Wars fan I never imagined I will ever say this but I am profoundly disappointed by this movie. This movie was the las nail in the coffin. RIP Star Wars!,0
3064,"Took a dump all over Star Wars and the character with the most integrity in all of popular fiction: Luke Skywalker.I appreciate so much how the prequels boldly introduced a deeper and more rich, expansive world/universe.This was quite narrowing. At least have Luke adopt Rey as his daughter to continue the Skywalker lineage/legacy.",0
3067,"Pelicula entretenida que puede estar bien como película fuera de la saga, nada tiene que ver con la saga star wars, pierden la esencia totalmente.Tampoco contextualizan mucho de lo importante de la anterior película ""el despertar de la fuerza""  (snoke, rey, luke en la isla...). Decepcionante en cuanto a star wars y entretenida como película.",0
3068,"TLJ: The most illogical plot i have seen in a while, void of any nuance and epic feel that characterizes STAR WARS. Ok, its hard for me to write this review. Its really hard for me to dislike a STAR WARS movie, i am somewhat positively biased against STAR WARS. The first time i saw the movie at the premiere i was stunned, and shocked on how poorly written and how ridiculous the plot is. In my second viewing i noticed much more writing and creative decisions that dont´t make any sense, story-wise, character-wise, logic-wise, STARWARS universe-wise. Lets start with the good things.THE GOOD: The technical aspects of the movie are really great, the cinematography and the visual effects are incredible. This movie plays with the color palette and its balance, to a beautiful degree. Also the score its amazing, JOHN WILLIAMS is awesome, and it shows. The way sound mixing and editing blends with the score is ear-dropping. THE BAD: ALMOST everything else. The story is beyond LOGIC for me. Its like if MILLENNIALS teens were behind ALL the story decisions in this movie. Its incredible the amount of forcing a viewer has to do to make SOME sense out of the illogical storyline.Right in the start they show you the tone of the movie that will be along the 2.5 hr feature. Its unfathomable , for me at least, that a FIRST ORDER ""GENERAL"" will not engage fire on a ENEMY fighter in attack mode, possessing the highest and most skilled pilot of the RESISTANCE. I mean in FA they did blow up planets with millions of innocent people just to decimate the resistance, and in here you hesitate to BLOW UP the highest and most skilled pilot of the resistance. no, no just no. Then, right after that, why in the world (or galaxy) would they not put any SHIELD to the MOST ADVANCED AND DEADLY attack ship in their arsenal, it just doesn't make any sense. Other aspect, is how they characterized LUKE SKYWALKER. I don´t mind him being and old and scared, and cowardly against everything he stood up for, JUST GIVE ME A LOGICAL EXPLANATION for this. Right off the start, he throws his DAD´s lightsaber to a cliff, WHAT?? Does this play in the same universe emotionally and logically??? It was his DAD´s lightsaber, the one he heroically saved from the EVIL SIDE and died in his arms. Wouldn't he at least show some interest on the memento of his father´s main piece of history. Why throw it for a laugh? its really cheap and bad writing, PRACTICALLY ANYTHING would have been better. WHY in the world would REY be capable of beating LUKE with the force and throw him to the floor. I mean she of course force grabs the lightsaber, and then LUKE force grabs an antenna?? WTF. It just doesn't make any sense. LUKE character is really miles off of what he should represent, and there is no logical explanation behind it. The poor explanation is that he failed his nephew student because he sensed ""some"" weird darkness in his sleep and hesitated to kill him. WHAT? Its just lazy and poor writing all around, it has no emotional resonance or anything. Before, he saved his EVIL DAD against the odds and faced the most evil person in the galaxy just to vindicate his FATHER, he was willing to sacrifice himself and face death just to see his dad becomes who he once was. Here, he tried to KILL his nephew because he sense some darkness in his dreams? ( i mean everyone from time to time, dreams about darkness). There is no in between, if you sense darkness in somebody, you open dialog with them, talk to his parents, but no, the only explanation in TLJ is to avoid talking any sense into the other person, and TRY to kill him. Its just very messy storytelling.The space chase is also very thin and ridiculous, time will give people the opportunity to really question RIAN JOHNSON logic behind this. Its just shows the cartoonish incompetence in the first order, its almost like a parody on how to do everything wrong if you want to eliminate your enemy, the problem is that is not funny. They really do not want to kill their enemies, they just wanted to let them go. There are INFINITE ways the FIRST ORDER vessels could have managed this situation better. There were are at least 3-4 ships, added to that of SNOKE´S planet sized ship. and why in the heck, do not they simply allow a single STAR DESTROYER to warp speed ahead of the resistance convo, and attack from different sides. I dont have a problem with REY being from nowhere, in fact, i think is BRILLIANT, it would have been one of the greatest story parts of the new starwars saga, if it wasn't handled so POORLY here. Anyway this movie is an incoherent mess, where logic goes to die, and story telling is thin and without emotion. I am really torn on how this movie turned out to be. There are many other things i didn't like, there are some things i did like. But its appalling how ultimately bad it is.",0
3069,"What a strange and ultimately pointless film. Only the briefest moments of interest; quickly deflated. Yet so many opportunities! Who do these writer/directors think they are? Rian Johnson must have one hell of an ego to have so flippantly taken the Star Wars legacy to these new lows. No surprises I guess given his poor track record as a filmmaker. So why give him the job? Cheap, I suppose. Star Wars - R.I.P.",0
3070,"Pathetic and utterly disappointing. How can you make a movie as bad as Star Wars Episode 2? Terrible acting, stupid jokes, a boring and unconvincing story line and full of plot holes.",0
3071,"The Last Jedi is an insincere and meaningless nonsense of a Star Wars movie.  It is a sad day when it can be said that the Jar-jar trilogy was better than this vapid and pandering commercial “success”.I am glad I missed this one in cinema, and I will be certain to stay away from this Pirates of the Caribbean rebrand in future.   If I had the time, I would check to see if the same writers contributed to this one, but I cant be bothered, and I will definitely not be surprised.If the next installment is going to be the same, they should rather, seeing as we don’t have a Disney channel where I’m from, do a direct to Nickelodeon release instead.They should also bar everyone who worked on the movies, and their families, from making “reviews”, so that I can actually see what the one person who actually liked it, liked about it.",0
3072,"I dont know what to say other than say it was a big mistake for Disney to kick George Lucas to the curb like they did. George needed to remain as the creative oversight for the sequel trilogy. It would've been okay to give directors and writers creative control with the anthology films since they're just small stories in the larger universe, without George this franchise cannot survive, there is no outline or map of where this is all going, just remastered films of the originals. TLJ is a true showcase of what's wrong with Disney's Star Wars, a franchise which rides on nostalgia and not world building and interesting characters. TLJ is written in a way that disregards everything built up in the last film, it doesn't move the story in a meaningful way. I just hope there's a real course correction before they turn Star Wars into this soulless thing of what it once was.",0
3073,"I'm not a ROBOT & posting only once.  I frustrated the narrative in the news is that these negative reviews are false.  This is a real review.   ** SPOILERS AHEAD** I saw Star Wars in 1977 with my dad and I was 10 years old, so I have loved Star Wars for 40 years of my life. What I liked:The battle with Kylo and Rey in Snoke's thrown room. I like how Snoke was assassinated sort of like what would happen in Ancient Rome. The problem is that Kylo is not a fully developed character toward total evil to lead the First Order. Perhaps Ep. IX will save this movie. I hated the following:1. Luke: Disney ruined the legacy of Luke and what Lucas set up. Luke deserved better. Luke was a grumpy old man who has trashed the Jedi order. Then he becomes a coward and does a force astral projection and dies of exhaustion. Wow what a waste. Why not let Luke go out with a more epic way (i.e, have Luke in the flesh and Rey be ambushed by the Knights of Ren). 2. Plot-holes: Rey is a ""Mary-Sue"" who can do everything with no training. Finn -- a sanitation worker -- can take on Captain Phasma who is a trained soldier. Bombs in space; Light speed ships as weapons; force ghosts (Yoda) using lightning (why not have all the force ghosts take on the First Order?) 3. Casino story line: Waste of time and went know where except to introduce Rian's new trilogy in the future. Self-serving. Disney had to go all political with animal cruelty. I'm on the side against animal cruelty but it just didn't fit and I felt like I was watching the Disney channel sitcom. 4. Bad/Forced Humor: I felt like I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy or Avengers. They work in those films, but not in Star Wars. Luke throwing his dad's light saber over his shoulder was a huge slap in the face to everyone who loves Star Wars. It was not funny. These criticism only scratch the surface how bad this movie is. I'm sad to see Disney trounce on the legacy of Star Wars like this. Again, I'm a true fan and not a robot writing this review. Go see this movie form your own opinion. But I hated this film and I feel like Disney has just trashed everything to start over with their own thing. I'm open-minded to go in new directions. That's cool, but this just seemed so much in my face. My only hope is that JJ Abrams can rescue this pile of trash. Give some background to Snoke. Have it so that Kylo lied about Rey's parents and that she is truly the daughter of a legacy character. Redeem Luke!!! Have him so he only teleported away-- not died-- near the end in TLJ. Let Luke in the flesh take on the First Order and then die in an epic way. Have Kylo full evil and not conflicted as he rules the First Order in a heavy handed way. Have Rey get training by Luke.",0

3080,"I watched this movie and was annoyed by several things, but on the whole had an ""ok"" time. After leaving the theater though, the more I thought about what I'd just seen, the less I liked it. It has lots of problems.... it doesn't give depth to any characters. It goes on completely irrelevant story arcs. It intentionally goes out of its way to destroy the franchise's pas characters and almost seems like it's mocking audience members who are/were fond of them. It has cute cgi creatures, but they're totally random. I can't get behind kylo ren as a villian, but he's somehow better than the heroine of the story who is simply a complete blank through her first two movies now. And it's very clearly trying to force women and minorities into roles for no particular reason. .... and then the studio is going out and accusing people of being sexist and/or racist if they can't get behind the film? I assure you I'm not either. I'd probably even consider myself a feminist. And I certainly have no objections to women or minorities in films. But shoving them in just to have them in... I don't know exactly what to rate this movie. A 0 would be hyperbole, but a 0 is definitely what I want to rate the studio's approach to any criticism they've received. As far as the film itself goes, I can say without any hyperbole that it was pretty disappointing. And that's disappointing to someone who wasn't hyped for it and had no particular expectations. I waited weeks before getting around to seeing it, even. I think a 3 or 4 is probably fair. I'd give it a 3.5, but will round down to 3 based on how the studio responded to anyone who didn't enjoy their work. I don't think many/any people will actually read this, but I'd strongly encourage anyone who feels at all like me to not watch the next in theaters. Or, at least, to make sure to not watch it for the first few weeks. They won't change without box office punishment, and the idea of having starwars turned into a tent-pole graphics fest that sells out on name alone like transformers or something makes me very sad.",0
3081,Disappointing. Normally I complain about a movie having too much fan service. This one didn't have enough.,0
3086,"What a mass. Characters are bland, the story is dumb and predictable, pacing is all over the place. Humor is out of place at some times. Many characters are wasted, literally and figuratively.At the end you just sitting there, and thinking: ""What was even the point of that movie?""",0
3088,"This is a very bad movie with a few decent parts that are interrupted by some of the worst attepts at humor I've seen in awhile.  Anytime this film gets into serious star wars territory it seems to stop itself with the equivelant of a momma joke.  The jokes would be more at home on a late night talk show than a Star Wars movie.  The is some solid acting, but a lot of films do some things right. So what?  This is Star Wars we expect more.  This is a prime of example of Hollywood pandoring to the audience.  It was trying to please people rather than create an artistic and entertaining movie.  There are parts that are clearly scrapes for the true fans, but amount to no more than nostalgic nonsense.  This makes for a tonally imbalanced film.  Jumping from serious to goofy.  It tries to attract demographics rather than just people.  Aside from tone, half the plot is worthless and wouldnt be out of place in the prequels.  There is little character development that is riddled with plot holes.  Some of these problems are simply a hangover from TFA such as Rey's abilities, but majority are new.  Stars Wars fans wanted was a continuation of the OT, but what we got was terrible characters with disjointed development if any.  The problems began in TFA and continue throughout this movie. Disney thought they could buy us off with a few scenes of nostalgic imagery, but even those were usually ruined by an out of place goof.   I could go on and on with why this is an aweful movie, but this will suffice.  This is not Star Wars.  This is corporate Star Wars.",0
3089,"It's really bad... I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I'm actually sad now after seeing 'The Last Jedi'. It's so much missplaced jokes and the plot is meaningless.

3111,Complete cinematic disaster. Focuses so much on *subverting expectations* that it completely forgets about being a logical coherent good movie. One of the most clear-cut cases of a Mary Sue main character. Completely destroys many aspects of the Star Wars universe. The last three movies made by Disney and the terrible directors should not even be considered cannon.For all the reviews that say the negative reviews are wrong... not only do you not know anything about Star Wars you also have terrible taste in movie at all. Literally the only good thing that could be said about this movie is the special effects. And effects are expected to be good in this day and age especially with the budget this movie had.

Finn became an annoying, obsolete character. Rose was introduced and she was also annoying and unlikable - no offense to the actress though. Anyone with common sense should know that the actress had little to do with what kind of character Rose was, and I do not blame her in the slightest.Rey was OP. Cool. Sigh... I think Rian Johnson was a terrible choice for this movie. I don't know who in good conscience said it was a good idea to have a trilogy directed by different people with no already planned out story? Like wtf, seriously. Disney, you messed up big time.This cannot be undone, but Rise of Skywalker and even The Force Awakens were much better movies than The Last Jedi, and had all three of them been directed by the same person, with an overarching vision for where the story and characters would go, we Star Wars fans might have gotten a decent trilogy.I don't wanna blame RJ for this mess, but he did kind of **** on a lot of beloved characters and lore, and so yeah, he did a terrible job at Star Wars.

It isn't a completely terrible movie, but it isn't the amazing story the reviews would have you believe. The plot is . . . terrible. As my wife said ""there are so many plot holes you could fly the Millennium Falcon through them."" Finn's plot is worthless and his love story is idiotic. I mean they knew each other for 8 hours or less. Rey trained for what, two days and she is an uber powerful Jedi. The movie disregards all previous movie, book, and EU content in terms of what the force can do and how hyperspace works. I mean 70% of the movie was made up of Star Destroyers chasing the Rebel . . . I mean Resistance capital ship. This is dragged on because the Rebel ship is smaller and faster. There are a half dozen Star Destroyers with full compliments of fighters, shuttles, and bombers. They could have swarmed the Rebel ships. It makes no sense. Other just egregious plot holes: The force lets Leia survive in vacuum even though she never trained as a  Jedi. The bombers rely on gravity to drop bombs. I don't think any of the writers understand how space works on even got a B in any science classes.  A master thief is found in a jail cell that he immediately walks out of . WHY WAS HE IN THE CELL! Rey is a light side Jedi, but she constantly is angry and clearly is fighting like a dark side Sith. They never call this out. On and on and on.Many of the characters are just unnecessary. Captain Phasma has to go down as one of the worst characters of all time. Rose is terrible. She exists to 1) appease the Chinese market and up the movie's diversity quotient and 2) add in an unneeded love interest. She professes her love to Finn after knowing him for 8 hours. There are some very good elements; Rey and Kylo's conflicted nature with each other is very interesting. I think all of the actors did fine with what they were given, but the writing is terrible. The movie just isn't that good. It is thoroughly average if a little below average.",0
3133,"Lets start with its better than The Force Awakens.  It has some surface twists and turns which keep you watching.  But it has very poor payoff.  Conflicts get resolved too easily.  We have no sense of peril.  The story is allowed to meander off to a completely unrelated planet by a cheap mechanism of buying time for the doomed rebellion for no valid reason, then conflicts just resolve.  What's most important: to be a member of the First Order the first criteria is to be incredibly dumb.  Dumb villains eliminate any sense of danger.

3155,"First of all, I’ve been a star wars fan (not hardcore but I really enjoyed all the movies since I watched the return of the Jedi when I was six); this movie is just bad, the there’s a lot of characters that are just out of order (pun intended) the Asian girl, just why? To make Rey jealous and turn her in to the dark side in IX? Because of Finn? And then turn Ben to the light side? With the assistance of Ghostly Luke? The purplish woman that light speed the ships like it was a bullet (that epic ending would have been perfect for Leia/Akbar) and then some more, paraphrasing a friend of mine:The thing went like this: (in the mind of the director/scriptwriters): let’s explain who the knights of Ren are... Nah, no one cares... Let’s explain who Snoke is... Nah, who cares? Let’s kill him the stupidest way possible! , Rey parents, lets reveal who they are, Nah, they are piece of **** drunks that sold her... OK! Let’s show Luke as the great master Jedi he is... Nah, he’s an old piece of **** coward that in all the movie does not clash a damn light saber against anybody, because, the fans did no wait decades to see that, no, one that projects himself far away and then dies from exhaustion??? WTF, Let’s give an epic ending to Leia, in memory of C.F. Nah, make her flight and develop super powers from the thin air (well in space there is no air so, from thin nothingness) and make her fly like superman just because…, let’s make Chewie throw away perfectly fine food, to what end? It was already cooked! I mean, it’s a message you want to give anyone? Don’t eat animals? Chewie, go vegan!, then in the middle of the movie, let’s make a remembrance to the cantina-ish, but let’s give it a casino royale vibe and throw a high grade actor in the mix that will give a speech about how bad wars are… what a disgraceful way to treat Benicio del Toro… and let’s not forget: the comic relief, I can’t be sure, but I don’t know if there more than 3-4 on the old movies, there’s one every 3-5 minutes in this one, WHY? It’s not a comedy… I could go on and on, I did not like at all what they did with the movie and I dread where is heading, I used to love star wars, I still do, but not this Disney crap we are getting.",0
3156,"Spoiler ahead: I was in complete and utter shock at how bad this movie was. Let me sum it up: A TV show caliber story line. Throwing in 3 random, and I mean RANDOM, side characters to keep the story moving. Disney ""comedy"" thrown in EVERY 10 minutes. The weakest ""evil master"" in Star Wars history. All the negative press Star Wars fans were worried about after Disney took over, came true in this movie. I left SO sad and disappointed...Horrible story. Horrible new characters. Big plot holes. Worst ending of all time. And, Princess Leia now flies through space like Super Girl.",0

I could tell the movie was different from the start but wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and let a few weird or **** attempts at humor slip past. As the movie progressed I got more and more irritated with it. Once i realized this was how the movie was really intended to be I couldn't help but feel extremely disappointed. This movie was a slap in the face to the fans and like Mark Hamill said, hollywood will sacrifice quality for money. Looks like Disney will make a killing off of stupid **** Furby looking owl aliens dolls, which got more screen time than Chewbacca... Spoiler Alert! They make force Skype calls in the movie now and Princess Leia is really the goddamn silver surfer",0
3170,"A lot of visual and production effort utterly wasted on a story that isn't just poor, but actively stamps on the original movies. So I've been thinking. What was the point of this movie? Other then stomping over the mystery boxes of JJ Abrams. I mean they spent 4 billion dollars on just buying Star Wars, let alone all the other costs. How the **** does Disney not have a ****ing plan? This is supposed to be three movies to cover a story. I expected, the TLJ to expand on characters and explain events in a cohesive narrative that sets up the next instalment. But instead it explains nothing and doesn't advance the ""plot"" at all, just meanders around for 2 and half hours.So let's look at the character arcs.Finn. When I mentioned in my first post How I don't hate any of the characters, other then Rose and Luke, just pity them, Finn was chief in my mind. But of course it wasn't just this movie. Across two movies he has been criminally mishandled. So the core concept is great. Brainwashed Enemy Soldier that switches sides and fights for the good guys. But they immediately just trash it. I think one of my core reasons why I hated Rey so much more in Force Awakens that this, is because she and Finn were seperated. They seem to bring out the worst in each other. Finn acts like a cowardly moronic comic relief character while Rey is a turbo **** to him.Finn Is Better in Last Jedi. But he clearly had nothing to do, so they give him a completely useless sub plot that is hamfisted and gets more rebels killed. And a tacked on romance, that I felt zero chemistry from. One that ends up throwing him literally off course from saving the rebels, to be smashed into the ground to be told done trite **** by Rose. **** Rose.So what was the point? He had no character growth. Getting a girlfriend isn't character growth. Having another rematch with useless Chrome Lady Stormtrooper isn't character growth.Poe. So he had a character arc. Too bad it was a ****ing stupid one. What is his lesson? Don't worry if your commander sounds like a moron in a evening dress who has no idea what they are doing and is just bleating trite nothing ****. No just obey orders and go like a sheep to the slaughter. Or that the rebellion is so ****ed that trading a collection of the worst bombers ever and a few star fighters for a massive ship is bad.Poe seems to be largely rooted in having nothing much to do with him. Hell I'm not even sure if he was supposed to survive the Force Awakens. It felt like he died, and then was written back in at a later point because we need a cocky rogue.The Mutiny is pointless ****, that could have been solved by anybody ****ing communicating. Hell the movie seems to love abusing him. Leia slapping him. Getting mocked for being demoted just for asking if they had a ****ing plan. Then Leia ****ing stuns him for a laugh from the audience. Why? He clearly idolises her. She could have just said ""hey I have a plan, stop your mutiny"".Of course the movie also contained a perfectly arc that they squandered. Simple. Have Leia die. Boom. The hot headed flyboy, used to commanding a small squad in battle is now left in command of the rebellion in retreat. Every instinct screams turn and fight. But he can't. He struggles to command. Everything seems doomed. And then Leia appears as a force ghost to give a small Obi Wan in the trench style, advice in time for him to pull a way out.Now Rey. The Mary Sue stuff is still there, but she and the writers are being less ****y about it. But she doesn't have a arc. She has parental angst in a mystery box, and then lol nobody drunks . Which isn't a bad idea in its lonesome ( but does ruin her defenders 'Muh secret force training' defense). But it isn't a arc in itself. Then she has weird connection with Kylo and force. But what. We are told she is tempted. Not shown it. She doesn't give in and do anything bad. She doesn't really do anything. She was just a pawn between Snoke and Kylo. Snoke thinks he is using her, but actually she was being used by Kylo to slay Snoke and kill his guards.Kylo. He started the movie conflicted, freshly humiliated and why he was dabbling in the dark side unanswered. And he ends the movie conflicted, freshly humiliated, why he was dabbling in the dark side unaswered and in command. That isn't a character arc. He isn't going good. He isn't getting worse, as he couldn't take out Leia. He isn't less conflicted. Maybe he is a bit more conflicted.The main hint of a arc is taking his Vader hero worship with the helmet, and smashing it to bits. But that was one scene, and It felt more winking at the audience then coherent plotting. Hey look this guy is still crazy and out of control. Lol.But where are they supposed to take him? Redeem him? Kill him?Hell What does he want? Why is he a Space school shooter? What is he even going to do with the first order's fleet?",0

This film does very little to properly advance the plot, mishandles Luke Skywalker's return in the worst way possible, squanders major characters from the previous installment giving them things to do which has nothing at all to do with the overarching plot and does nothing in any way to advance it, and takes major plot points that were being build up to and shuts them down as having been nothing all along, clearly trying to suggest they're 'subverting your expectations' but instead it comes across as lazy, horrible writing.This movie is a travesty - The 'Phantom Menace' of the Disney trilogy and will forever be a dark stain on the Star Wars franchise.

This film made every single previous Star Wars film worse and George Lucas couldn't even pull that off.",0
3243,"I don't intend there to be any spoilers but they may appear:The core takeaway from this movie is it's disaster of a plot. Star Wars hasn't every had really stunning plots or story telling. But fundamentals of writing and viewer engagement is ignored. Combined with the plot requiring character assassination of everything we knew from previous installments.The biggest flaw with The Last Jedi is it's director deciding that this film (the second in a trilogy) will end all story arcs created in The Force Awakens. The inherent problem is that this is in fact a trilogy and therefore story arcs need to continue into the third chapter to bring the story into completion and give you time to build satisfying endings. By choosing to do this the director irreparably harmed the future installment(s) as the third chapter has nothing real to build on. In this regard The Last Jedi is a complete narrative failure.The start with the centerpiece of the movie. The space chase, a manufactured and entirely unnecessary plot device and source of tension through the movie. This creates the side plot to create the character Rose who is essentially without any substantive meaning and appears to be thrown in for some form of diversity quota. Rose's love interest to Finn character is also out of nowhere and entirely unnecessary. The space chase also creates the second side plot of Poe vs the Commander which is entirely unnecessary as Poe being the commander of her fighter squadron is of rank to be included in their strategy discussions. This results in Poe staging a ""coup"" that fails even though by narrative there was no reason for it except extra tension in an otherwise emotionless situation.Adding onto the space chase is the gutting of established canon of the franchise. Lasers arcing in zero gravity as if they had gravity. A person in space essentially frozen flying themselves with the force they were never trained with back to safety though by all accounts they were dead. Military forces on both sides acting as if they have zero military background is basic tactics.The character assassination of Luke was by far the most appalling in that they committed it but he had the most intriguing plot device that wasn't used. Luke attempted to murder his nephew to prevent the darkness from rising. The same Luke that ignored Yoda and Obi-wans suggesting to kill Vader and to go above and beyond to redeem and save him. The Luke full of compassion becomes old, cynical, and places himself into exile ultimately deciding the Jedi order needs to end. This is by far the most compelling plot device because it essentially sets up a Luke vs Snoke comparison and story that's never acted on. Snoke mentions the failure of the Sith (Emperor & Vader) and that it was good they failed. Luke thinks the Jedi need to end because they inevitably bring ruin to the galaxy. However both Luke and Snoke have very different beliefs in the force and what it is and how it should be used. This is by far the most wasted plot device of the whole movie.The most visually stunning scene (the hyperspace jump) is created by again showing the supposed strongest military order in the galaxy is incompetent. After looking back at this movie it makes me irrationally angry not that the franchise was damaged by this (which is was and continues to be) but that it's writing is so bad I talk to people about it and they can't remember core details of the movie except that it exists.I watched this movie back when it released and I haven't watched Solo and don't plan on watching Rise of Skywalker. I can say irrevocably this movie was a narrative disaster in writing regardless of how you feel about other controversial subjects regarding it's characters.",0

3299,"Grand, sprawling, chilling, complex and painfully misunderstood, The Last Jedi is perhaps the most unnecessarily despised family film ever made. I've never before seen such a shocking amount of intensely over-the-top and often extremely childish rage against a movie assembled by an array of very talented, passionate and caring people whose intentions were completely good-hearted. And yet despite this, The Last Jedi has recieved an astonishingly colossal amount of black-hearted hatred from people who clearly have absolutely no grip on reality when discussing this movie and no real argument beyond ""It was different to what I expected, so it's bad!"". The entitled fanboy tantrums are so incredibly embarrassing.Now, allow me to defeat four of the biggest accusations made against this movie:1. ""Rey is a feminist Mary Sue!""That couldn't be farther from the truth. Rey is - and I'm 100% serious in saying this - not only one of the best Star Wars characters, but one of the best film characters ever. Sure, she may strangely excel at a few specific things, but the sheer mystery of who she is and how she managed to acquire such a strong connection with the Force is so beautifully told. And inside, she's lost, broken and needs help, and when she fails, it breaks her even more. If she were a Mary Sue she would have succeeded at convincing Luke to help her from the beginning and would have defeated Snoke without Ben's help. She would do everything without any effort, but instead in this movie and The Force Awakens she DOES put in the effort even when things are tough, and that makes me root for and love her. And as for her parents being no-one special? That's a GOOD thing because it proves that not every heroic character needs to be connected to another character. It makes Rey and her future status as a legendary heroine unique. This movie does such an wonderful job of showing her struggle with the Force, with her identity and past, with trying to talk some sense into Luke and remove his inner darkness. Which brings me to...2. ""They ruined Luke! Luke wasn't a killer! He was a hero!""I strongly disagree and argue that the filmmakers IMPROVED Luke. In the orignal trilogy he was a great character indeed but his arc ended in an admittedly pretty simplistic way: He becomes the hero. We all knew he would. But this movie shows that even heroes have some darkness inside them. Even heroes make terrible mistakes. And even heroes can feel as though there is no hope left, that their life has hit a dead end. And watching Luke gradually grow from a cynical and depressed old hermit back to the confident and kind man he once was is really emotionally satisfying. I love Luke in this film, and if he had been portrayed as a flawless, boring old wise man, it would have made the film so extremely predictable, and his return to the saga would have been just pointless fanservice instead of something brand new.3. ""SJW POLITICS!""Seriously, people? The entire Star Wars saga is and always has been about politics. In fact, it was the prequels that featured way too much of this aspect. I'm NOT sorry by saying this - if you cannot enjoy this movie because the film touches upon a few real-world societal issues that some vile alt-right conspiracy theorist jock told you don't actually exist, you're pathetic. Yes, extreme capitalism, animal abuse and child slavery ARE BAD. This is common knowledge to anyone with a brain and a heart. And don't you dare complain about the inclusion of a few minorities or claim that this movie bashes white males. Star Wars is set in a vast galaxy home to a limitless array of races and creatures, and you're complaining that there's an Asian in it? Yeah, clearly this movie is a declaration of war on white men!...In your warped mind, that is.4. ""They killed Snoke! What a waste!""This is another thing I love about this movie. Just like with the unexpected potrayal of Luke as a sad man longing for death, I love that they opted to kill off Snoke in this film. In doing so, it showed Ben Solo/Kylo Ren's anger and desire to take full control of his life after being exploited and used as a puppet. It shows just how fragile even the most terrifying villains are and how they don't need to be these overpowered badasses who die right at the end of a trilogy in a cliché battle. Killing him off early and without a boring scene where you find out his entire backstory revealed to us that the true villain of the trilogy is the Dark Side and how it can severely corrupt people (Luke, Kylo, Poe, hell, even Rey at sometimes) and make them do selfish and/or destructive things. Simply put, Snoke was always a clever deceptive red herring, and we all fell for it in The Force Awakens.In my opinion, The Last Jedi is a daring, challenging, emotionally powerful, beautifully constructed and suitably action-packed middle chapter of the sequel trilogy, and the final film is bound to be just as fantastic, if not more.",1
3302,"""The Last Jedi"" delivers terrific twists and moments to elevate the Sequel Trilogy, although it fails in setting up Episode IX.",1
3304,"Yes, there is a lot of strangely placed humor, and I can see why Rian did that, but he can't quite master the way George pulled it off in the originals -- balancing humor with seriousness (making it a fun adventure). Nothing bad happens to Rey. She always overpowers or bests Kylo. There's really no danger. I'm not that excited for the finale. I will say that the space battles were awesome, and the filming style was absolutely spot-on. Poe Dameron is made to look like an idiot in this one (over time), and literally .... there are no white male leaders in this rebellion. I think they just vanished! No, but it was painfully obvious -- especially when almost all the First Order's leaders were evil white males. Luke is in this one a lot more than I thought, but his appearance wasn't completely satisfying either. Rian takes a bold step in this one with Luke's now infamous line, ""It's time for the Jedi to end."" This movie continues with that thought, so it's very contrary to the ending of The Last Jedi (unless you interpret that the Jedi aren't needed since the Sith were destroyed). What Disney fails to realize is that we want MORE LIGHTSABERS. It seems that in stepping away from the Prequels Disney has gone too far in the opposite direction. In this movie, the Resistance is made to look very small and weak. I honestly don't even know how Disney will set up the 3rd movie. There are good things about this movie, but they mostly revolve around the technical side of it. If you at least see it with an open mind you might not be completely disappointed. This movie also contradicts itself! You'll see near the end. Luke's line may not be true after all!",1
3308,"I totally agree with critics. I have really many things to say about. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was the second best Star Wars film. However, I will start with two major problems of this film. First, Rose was not very successful character. She is the worst Star Wars character with Zaza Binks, and it ruined a bit of basic settings of Star Wars. I think almost everyone will agree to those two things, but this film was so spectacular because of these following reasons. First, it gave a huge breath to new characters. While The Force Awakens made huge impression of old characters and didn't really give actual focus to new characters, The Last Jedi really made them really impressive. Kylo Ren was like a nerd villain at the first time who just didn't like his father, but it all makes sense now and why he keeps saying 'Let Everything Die' and tries to keep convince Rey. Rey really grew because of Luke but also she finally understood what hope meant. It's also interesting to remember a quote in The Last Jedi from Leia, 'Hope is like the sun. If you only believe it when you see it you'll never make it through the night.' It forms sort of confrontation structure between Kylo Ren and Rey. Kylo Ren is the one who completely lost the hope and tries to rebuild the world and REy is the one who lost hope once and betrayed by Luke, but managed to learn hope and got the strength to lead the rebellion. Secondly, Luke was amazing. Original Star Wars was a story of Darth Vader and Luke, and Star Wars 8 was a story of Luke Skywalker. People say that this is not real Luke, but I think this is exact Luke Skywalker. Everyone makes a mistake, even Luke Skywalker. Luke was actually the one who had pride and was self-confident, but sometimes too rash like fighting with Darth Vader without being prepared. Luke made a mistake and suffered a lot. When Luke met Rey, he finally saw a real hope and acted something out. His force was beyond everyone and I was satisfied with the action even though he wasn't there. He teased Kylo Ren completely. Also Mark Hamill had done really amazing job acting and I got a goosebumps from it.Third one is convention and cliche. people might think that this is not a pro, but I think it is. This film completely broke convention and cliche just like The Empire Strikes Back did. Finally, The ending part was so good. I think it was good as Inception and The Dark Knight which I gave 10. The two suns are from Ep 4, especially binary sunset scene. I think the meaning of the scene is also significant. A little sun was bright once and it was going down which means Luke himself who made a sacrifice, and then a bigger sun rised which is Rey who inherated the role of Luke Skywalker and will become 'the new hope'.Also I wanted to mention John Willaim's amazing score. I think it's good as original scores. I really like REy's theme and march of resistance. Thus, I really enjoyed this film and got goosebumps like million times. This is the first film that I watched three times in theater 'in IMAX'.",1
3309,"However you feel about the direction the saga is going in, this is still a really good movie, as a standalone and as part of the series. While there are some low points about this movie, mainly storylines that didn't deserve to be so integral... The high points of this movie are some of the best in Star Wars history. The sound, visual effects and editing are the best and most meaningful they have ever been. I am definitely toward the critic's view of this movie, while still reserving some grievances as a fan.",1
3310,"I'm not sure why this movie is getting so much backlash from viewers while the first movie received so much love. I certainly saw some problems and plot holes, but nothing more than were clearly visible in the original three. Thankfully, at least this movie decided to make all it's own plot holes and mistakes. It brought life to lifeless characters and gave a good death to Luke. While some are clearly upset that it did not meet their predictions, I was thrilled that it met none of mine and left me wondering often just what would happen next. IF this is only a trilogy I am very curious to see just how they will resolve this conflict between two totally rudderless force newbies in only one more film. If it goes more than that, well, I wouldn't mind it at all if they are able to keep things fresh like they did in this instalment.",1
3311,"This isn't a bad Star Wars film, it's just not a great one. There are as many high-octane moments as glaring plot holes & too many storylines that have no bearing on the film. Some threads just aren't followed and others take up too much time making the film drag in the second act. The Empire Strikes Back, it isn't. But hey, it's no Attack of the Clones either. 7/10",1
3312,"I loved it the second time after I got all the crying out of my system and took it for what it was, which to me now is amazing. The first time was a lot to take in and my expectations (one of the important themes in the movie) seemed to have not been met initially. With a closer eye and a little more attention, in the end the movie really did meet all my expectations, just not how I envisioned them. The movie masterfully manages to balance humor and fun with failure and disappointment, summarizing it all beautifully with the scene between Yoda and Luke. Afterwards things start turning around as characters begin to look past themselves and their failures to come to terms with where they are now, what about themselves must change or be left behind, and what must be done to both atone and move forward. Unbelievable movie.",1
3314,"It's different, there are good moments, but there are bad moments. I recommend watching Vinesauce's review of the film as it gave me some insight I didn't think about. Action was great especially Luke vs Kylo, and Kylo + Rey v Snoke. I didn't really care about Snoke, but I'm really pissed off on how they handled Captain Phasma, she had so much potential to be the next Boba Fett, but she barely gets any screen time, wtf. CGI was okay but you can clearly tell that all of the creatures showed off in this movie were made clearly for merchandising, this may sound weird but we need more disgusting, ugly creatures in this movie, we need a new Jabba. The Leia space scene [kind of] makes sense but the execution of the scene was bizarre, uncomfortable and just **** stupid, probably one of the worst Star Wars scenes ever. The Finn & Rose subplot was filler, you could literally remove the subplot, hell, you could also even remove Rose from the movie and it would barely be different. The best scene of this movie for me was the light speed ramming, Holdo at first was an unlikable prick, but she redeemed herself when she went out in one of the most badass ways I've ever seen in a movie, ramming the Star Destroyer at light speed and the audio went completely silent, while this movie had one of the worst scenes in Star Wars, it also had one of the best. Yoda is also in the movie and he doesn't feel that forced, and he states to Luke that failure is the best teacher which would end up being a subtle theme throughout the whole film, everyone fails at one point in this movie. I found the movie enjoyable, and I would recommend watching it if you wanted to see something wildly different from Star Wars, this film felt like an experiment by Rian Johnson to me. I think this is better than The Force Awakens because of the amount of risks and experiments Johnson took making this film, it's a different from any other Star Wars movie I've seen, and I welcome that, especially in the current state of these types of movies.Here's where I rank this film compared to the others from best to worst, keep in mind this is just an opinion.Empire Strikes BackA New HopeRogue OneReturn of the JediThe Last JediThe Force AwakensRevenge of the SithThe Phantom MenaceAttack of the Clones",1
3315,"The Last Jedi was different. As usual, the visual effects are great. Many people have debated if it was a good movie, and if it's hard, then it's not a good movie. The plot was good, not great. The problem with The Force Awakens was it left people too many questions and much confusion. Nobody was like that for the original trilogy, and everyone enjoyed it. Also, some of the major points don't make sense. For example:-Why Did Luke Die?-Why Did Luke Change His Mind About Training Rey?-Will the Jedi Die?-Why is Rey so Good with the Force?-Is Snoke Really Dead(like Darth Maul)?-Did Yoda Use Force Lightning?-What was the Point of Rey's 'Cave Mirror'?-Couldn't Finn have used R2-D2 instead of Code Breaker?-Why wasn't Poe told the Plan to Escape?-Since When Could Leia use Force Powers?-Nobody Told Rey Size Didn't Matter when it's the Force.-Why are Porgs there?-Why Did DJ Betray Finn?-Was This Movie Just Copying the Original Movies?",1
3316,"Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) gets a pivotal role, as he works with Rey (Daisy Ridley) to realize the title, Meanwhile, the Resistance is in a deadly encounter with the First Order (headed by Adam Driver, who once again shows the depth of his abilities). The narrative jumps among several related plots, alternating fights and battles with moments of emotional drama. There are enough interesting effects and cute new creatures for the series to maintain its place as an innovator. Writer/director Rian Johnson has continued the legacy of compelling storytelling that keeps the films in our cultural spotlight. Those outside the fan base may be entertained, but those who love the Star Wars universe will find plenty to enjoy and cherish.",1
3317,"This movie fails on every level.  Rian Johnson should be ashamed of this product.  The story makes no sense, the characters revisit arcs already completed or have nonsensical arcs.  Admiral Holdo is an abomination of a character only set in the movie to give Poe an antagonist that has no reason to be an antagonist.  The story fails at a fundamental level.  The conflict is manufactured so heavily that, even in a make believe universe with magic space wizards, it still felt forced.  Its honestly the biggest pile of trash to disgrace the Star Wars universe.",0
3320,"No idea why this movie is getting review bombed ( snowflake metldown season? ), it's a great Star Wars movie, it isn't perfect and it has plot holes, but being a Star Wars watcher from childhood, having seen the original trilogy with starry wide eyes as a kid, then the prequels as an early adult and finally this latest. I see no other reason than perhaps self-entitled pissed off Star Wars fans nitpicking and just not sitting back to enjoy the show.Do yourself a favor, ignore the snowflake meltdowns, watch it, enjoy it for what it is, a space action flick, that's it.Cheers!",1
3324,"Fist off I just want to say, this movie has balls, and I appreciate that.  Rian Johnson un-apologetically changes the status quo of the Star Wars universe, and this is a good thing, despite the outraged longtime franchise fans who are mortified by the sudden death of Lord Smoke, felt that it wasn't their Luke they saw on screen, and were terrified by the change of pacing.  All this though will pass, and it just proves to me that Abrems made the right decision on hitting the delete button on the old expanded Star Wars universe, which is a blessing and a curse here, it gives Johnson a clean slate to work with however the SWEU fans will refuse to forget. Now, I will be the to say that this is not a perfect movie (the could've cut the whole Finn/Rose story line, and not only would the whole outcome of the movies story been the same, but it would've cut about 45 minutes off the movies overly long run time which would've been for the better.  Johnson has a bad habit of being more than a little heavy handed with injecting his politics into his projects and this is no exception, while I don't believe this to have been the appropriate time and place for him to have done so, I didn't let it ruin my experience however I could easily see how it would impact some opinions. The mix of CG and practical effects was well done here, though I felt the casino planet was pointless in terms of effecting the plot it did impress me, especially with the opening shot of the camera moving forward through the casino showing off how great of a job the make up department did here.  The acting here was well done, and I must really give props to Mark Hammel who performed perfectly as a disgruntled Luke, seeing him with the Yoda puppet onscreen practically made this movie for me. If nothing else Episode VIII proves something I theorized years before its release, that is is possible for a movie in a franchise to be a technically speaking a great movie, but a bad movie for the franchise, even if (again technically speaking) the movie is one of the better movies of said franchise.",1
3325,One of the best Star Wars movies in the saga. Don't mind the negative reviews. They are made by toxic and nostalgic fans.,1
3326,"Please do not listen to people giving this movie terrible I acknowledge that the movie has a horrible pacing issue with its scenes on the Casino. But I do enjoy this scene. I always laugh when Disney tries to critique capitalism. But the stuff with Kylo, Rey, Snoke and of course Luke with his best appearance since Return of the Jedi is great.",1
3327,"This film is an incredible achievement. Not only is it my 3rd favorite Star Wars film, after Empire and Return of the Jedi, I also think it's probably the best blockbuster movie since maybe The Dark Knight? Stunningly beautiful cinematography and effects, excellent acting, especially from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver, and great storytelling. I've never understood the divisiveness around this movie. I literally think you're an idiot if you can't see why this is such a good movie.",1
3328,"It is a bold and innovative film. It works both structurally and aesthetically. The few flaws I can identify in the movie do not change my opinion that this is the best Star Wars movie, along with The Empire Strikes Back.",1
3329,"I almost can't even sit through this movie, it's just so boring and dumb. I'm not a fan",0
3330,"Last Jedi doesn't continue the story, it torpedoes it with new tones, new ideas, and numerous orgasmic sci-fi sequences, that it never seems to catch its breath... Episode 8 impresses and invigorates us with high-caliber craft (perhaps even moreso than Force Awakens), but its potential of producing a genuinely strong, engrossing narrative gets squandered by a Resistance Storyline that nearly suffocates the film. And it begs the question: What happened to character and story in modern, mainstream entertainment? Last Jedi is trying to be so many things at once, that it refuses  to let us connect with what it really is... and kins the reason why so many people struggle to process this movie. But as a movie, I can still appreciate and enjoy Episode 8 for what it is:  a rowdy, explosive, leave-no-prisoners Star Wars experience that wows and wonders the senses, even if doesn't entice it's vision the way you want it to.",1
3331,"Non Spoiler section:The best Star Wars movie since Empire. Not perfect, but Rian Johnson nailed it considering the material he had to work with. It's well worth buying a ticket for.Spoiler Section:In my review of TFA, I complained that JJ Abrams and Disney did not take any risks. It felt almost like a clone of the original movie and none of the new characters grabbed me. Rey felt very much like a Mary Sue. It suffered from being average.Rian Johnson on the other hand had the courage to take risks, and he made some decisions for the plot and characters I wouldn't have done, but he also made some choices I loved. I'll start with what I didn't like. I'm not too fussed on what was done with Luke. It made sense he would be embittered after what happened, and I agree with his assertion that the Jedi need to end. The problem is his ""death"" (joining the force like Obi-wan did) at the end of the film. Apparently the effort of projecting his image with the force to fool Kylo Ren took all he had. I can understand him being very drained, but dying? It's not enough to break the film though, and I'm convinced he will appear again as a force ghost. We've been shown that force ghosts can use the force to interact with the real world, and not just have a talk fest.Killing off Snoke without explaining his backstory bothered me, and I'm kind of hoping he survived by transferring his consciousness or something. Rey still feels like a Mary Sue, albeit not as much. At least she's had some proper training in the force now. I would have liked to have seen Chewie play a bigger role. There wasn't enough about him dealing with his grief for Han.One more thing. No Chiss and no Thrawn. I wasn't expecting it, but gee it would have been awesome. Now onto the good. This movie has made the franchise mature somewhat. I really appreciate the move towards ""balance"" of the force being a yin and yang like balance between dark and light. The idea that balance is the light side destroying the dark never sat right with me. The casino planet act also made some social commentary, which I enjoyed. Many people feel like it was filler, but for me, it fleshes out the universe more. Seeing Yoda again as a force ghost, and that force ghosts are able to physically interact with the real world through the force was great. It's probably my favourite scene of the film. I suspect in the next film we'll see Luke interacting with Rey in much the same way.Kylo Ren is the star of this movie for me. His character has developed so much from the tantrum throwing emo kid in TFA. In typical darkside style, he waited for a good opportunity and turned on his master. The way it was done was brilliant, and the fight scene afterwards was possible the best in Star Wars yet. The relationship between Rey and Kylo developed in a really interesting way, leaving me interested to see what happens next. The misdirection in the trailers and movie itself were welcome. Poe's character was fleshed out quite a lot, and I enjoyed seeing him in action. Fin still didn't grab me much, but his interaction with the new character Rose was nice. Snoke was cool while we saw him. I'm not convinced he's really dead and I really want to learn more about him.As I wrote earlier, Rey is still a bit of a Mary Sue, but Rian made a good effort of improving her character. I still can't say I like her, but I at least don't dislike her anymore. Overall, Rian told a really good story, and he sets some very interesting groundwork for the next movie. Some of the decisions made haven't gone down well with a big chunk of the fandom, and I'm not 100% happy with them myself, but they don't make the film bad. People are giving low scores because they didn't like Luke dying, Rey being a nobody, and Snoke being killed off so early. These aren't good or fair reasons to give a film a low score.",1
3332,"Whilst not a perfect movie the twists and surprises for the most part work for me and make it a far more interesting star wars film than any other Disney star wars film and definitely merits a second viewing. Far more original than TFA, beautifully shot and some amazing battles (Snoke's throne room).First the negatives. The film is half an hour too long and the start drags and is quite slow and choppy. The Finn and Rose story is overdrawn, Phasma is wastes, Hux appears to be a bit too incompetent, and Leia using the force didn't work for me.Plus why else is nobody saying that Admiral Ackbar deserved better.However the rest of the film was extremely surprising entertaining and emotional. Most complaints I've seen are about the lack of snoke backstory, the way luke was handled, Rey's parental reveal and Finn and Rose story.The fact snoke was killed so early was to me one of the best moments of the film. I like many others had speculated on who he was and how he rose to power and was looking forward to answers to these questions. But I found his death surprising and showed how unpredictable and powerful Kylo really is, and whilst we still don't have any answers I'm certain we will get them eventually through a book, comic series, episode XI or maybe even a standalone film, we just need to be a little more patient. In 10 years at most this will no longer be any issue.A lot of people were disappointed with how luke was shown. A lot expected him to be a great majestic hero with immense power able to destroy an entire fleet of first order star destroyers. I think that he was made to seem lazy, disconnected and uncaring for a reason. His failure to the jedi order and Ben solo has really taken its toll on him and so he has retreated into exile through depression and shame, whilst this may not have been the heroic luke people wanted to me it makes sense and makes him a better character. I thought his force powers worked really well the revelation he was just a projection made sure that the force didn't seem too overpowered and him just crushing entire fleets would have seemed a bit too dark side and not something luke would have trained himself to do during his time before Kylo. I it also showed the intelligence of luke to deceive Kylo and the first order and heart to see leia and save the resistance. The main cause of frustration with luke was that we got a luke that we didn't expect and I think with time people will realise this and perhaps begin to accept and maybe even enjoy this luke.Rey's parental reveal was good for me I don't like it being only skywalkers or secret children of other powerful jedi being the people affecting the galaxy or having great strength. Plus this may not be true anyway because why would Kylo ren know anything about rey's parents. So the mystery is still there.The finn and rose story is the most valid complaint as it was too long and ultimately fairly pointless but did show how the good guys aren't always right and don't always make the best decisions.In conclusion I think most of the issues with this film will fade over time, maybe not completely but somewhat and I found it emotional entertaining surprising (in a good way)and my main issue was a lack of a proper send off for Admiral Ackbar, how can people hate the way luke died but not comment on Ackbar.",1
3333,"Now that the experience is over I’m plagued by various thoughts and emotions that fluctuate between disappointment and appreciation.The Last Jedi tonally struck me as a movie similar to The Godfather III, where the central character passes the torch, because now is an old man who has lost faith and his way, it's rare to make a comparison between two films that couldn't be more different but honestly the Luke Skywalker that I saw in this movie felt very similar to the Michael Corleone that was seen in the conclusion of the Godfather trilogy.Rian Johnson is a better director than J.J. Abrams and he shows it, even though there's not a very obvious change in styles, The Last Jedi does have a different vibe, however he does not seem to know how to structure the film and both the script and narrative rhythm are problematic, the film soon takes the same path of Empire Strikes Back but what it was interesting in that film, in this one it feels incredibly boring. I'm sorry but seeing things right, the film should have been focused on Luke and Rey, especially taking into consideration all the changes that the film introduced to the mythology and the powers obtainable by the Force.All the action that takes place outside Rey, Kylo Ren and Luke is practically irrelevant. It's clear that the story needed to give the other actors something to do, but their story was completely unusable, they even wasted Benicio del Toro in such a simplistic character.The Last Jedi redefines the Force and that is perhaps its greatest achievement, besides giving a hard but incredibly necessary blow to the fans, the decision to let go of the past, something they hated so much with The Force Awakens when Han Solo died, they will hate it much more now that Luke dies in this installment. It is worth asking if some kind of agenda of inclusion and diversity had something to do with the narrative direction of the film and it's not that I have something against it, it's simply that the path marked by George Lucas ends in this film, after all who will bring balance to the force and the galaxy will no longer be an Skywalker, it will be those who come along with Rey who as revealed in this film is simply a nobody, without an spectacular or striking lineage, Rey is just a common young woman who is involved in something huge and yet she's ready to face it.Other problems I have with the film have to do with the enormous ability to discard narrative lines and their characters, mainly those who seemed to be quite relevant at first and I refer clearly to Snoke, it's incredible that after the release of The Force Awakens for two years I read all kinds of crazy theories about the character and it turns out that he was also a nobody and they got rid of him very badly. Also, what the hell happened with the Knights of Ren? Also it aonly gives a small glimpse of what happened between Luke and Kylo but it feels so shallow that even in his final battle the emotion feels empty and Luke's farewell does not become as resonant as it should have been.But making those elements aside, essentially The Last Jedi stays sharp, is a solid entertainment film and a decent addition to the franchise, the duration is somewhat excessive, especially for the rhythm problems I mentioned and also for me it wasn't the movie it promised it would be but in the primordial elements the film fulfills its mission, there's space action, lighsabers battles, tension, emotion and entertainment but as I said before, a lavish and updated show is no longer enough, the stories also must improve.But it goes without saying that the new road is paved and the future of Star Wars is in the air and I don't mean in the air like uncertainty, I mean that now from this point on everything has changed and everything is possible, it's true that with this franchise both Disney and Lucasfilms will never take risks, but I hope that with the constant exploitation of the franchise that now seems to be an annual event, good ideas will remain in a safe place. **On a smaller note I just have to mention that if in Episode IX, Kylo gets redeem like Vader in Return of the Jedi, I will be very upset, because that is choosing the easy road and this film hints towards that.",1
3334,"I have to say: I was a little disappointed. This movie manages to stand a bit more on its own than The Force Awakens or Rogue One, but it still riffs pretty heavily on the old trilogy's story beats, and is a mixed bag in terms of characters, story choices, and tone. That last part might be the biggest problem. It pulls a Marvel at times and undercuts serious or important moments with ill-timed humor. The movie does little to develop Finn despite plenty of screen time, and Captain Phasma and Snoke are as lame as ever. Good riddance to both. Kylo Ren is still a compelling villain, and his, Daisy Ridley's, and Luke's storyline is the highlight. I know some fans have a problem with his motivation for leaving, but I just happen to think it was a bit on the weak side, rather than ""destroying the character"" as some have said. The movie is less slavish in its callbacks to previous movies than TFA was, but what this lays bare is that the new stuff has comparatively little to offer, from the world building to the young male leads to the action (awesome throne room fight aside). The movie gets more impressive in its latter half, and the major new character is a solid addition, but I had hoped to be much more impressed by Rian Johnson's take on the Star Wars galaxy than this.",1
3335,"I created an account to enter this review... When I see the bad user reviews, they remind me of the political posts one sees online. They seem to be written by people living in an alternate reality. A scary alternate reality I'd never want to visit. I loved this film, but I can see easily why some don't but to hate it with this passion makes no sense. Like the sad uncle who keeps posting on Facebook that Obama was the antiChrist or Trump is being targeted the FBI for assasination, you feel both contempt and pity for them. One thing I have learned is that there is a small vocal minority that can't tolerate having their expectations subverted. The film is just fine, a bit draggy in the middle and did zig a few places it should have zagged, but overall it's an excellent film and I can't wait to see it again.",1
3336,"The Last Jedi was not my favorite Star Wars movie (still Empire), but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It had emotional and philosophical undercurrents that we've yet to see in a Star Wars film, yet it also featured some of the most striking visual moments, to date.   To be fair, the plot and acting had some uneven moments.  Without giving spoilers, there was a long-running plot thread between the First Order and the Resistance in space that seemed to drag on too long in order to allow some other plot threads to catch up in order to tie them all together.  The tonal and tension shift between different threads felt conflicting, at times, but I also recognized the film-makers' intent to avoid an emotional palette that felt too monochrome.    I felt that Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren was greatly improved from The Force Awakens, yet Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey felt flat, at times (although that might have been a product of Ren's darker and more mercurial material compared to Rey's earnest hero journey).   Note that my score is an honest 8, not a 10 to try to balance out the negativity of some other reviews.  If all the outraged users on this site were to score the film reasonably the average user score would certainly be higher than 4.9 (at the moment).  Unfortunately, many viewers apparently felt they had some ownership of the film and, it not being what they wanted it to be, have childishly given the film a '0', bringing the average down considerably.    If anyone wonders why the critics' score is higher, it's because they write their reviews after consideration and not out of a knee-jerk reaction to a few points here or there that they allowed to ruin the whole experience for them.  This film is not 'The Room'- for the craft that went into it, alone, it would be worthy of a 4/10.    Again, this is not a perfect film, and I absolutely understand that different people may like or dislike different aspects of the film for their own personal reasons.  I find it telling, however, that most people who disliked things I liked about the film resort to cheap hyperbole ('the acting is awful'; 'the writing is terrible') that doesn't really explain to anyone what was wrong or how it could have been better.  Further, anyone who feels the need to bash Disney as part of bashing the film obviously went into the theater with a predisposition to dislike the film.",1
3337,"Alright, It is definitely a flawed film. It's not perfect and you might not like it. I won't spoil anything, but some parts seem like filler, the porgs obviously serve no story purpose and the pacing and some choices seem a bit odd at times. I enjoyed watching Star Wars Episode 8 though, I will see it again without a doubt, and I look forward to episode 9. The film is fun, some jokes don't land but oh well; there was moments when I was genuinely shocked, sometimes the shocks are cheap and have no actual meaning but I still had my mouth open at more than one point; and finally there is some genuinely good themes and scenes in the film, some themes are shoehorned, but others were relevant and you can hate me but I think a lot of the big choices and twists were good ones and I enjoyed watching them unfold. Go check out the film- but don't think it's gonna answer the universe's questions or anything. (also I forgot to mention but the film is gorgeous)",1
3338,"With all the hate-reviews, I began to wonder if it was actually going to be bad, inspite of the 50+ professional critics that loved it. Before I went, I contacted 3 avid Star Wars fans who had seen it, and they LOVED it. So I had hope. Overall, it was quite enjoyable and a solid addition to the Star Wars saga. Sure there were things that weren't perfect, but it's just a movie - one to enjoy. Unfortunately, for me, the middle of the movie was ruined by the guy next to me who was eating popcorn out of a crackly bag and I was pulled out of the movie for a while. Will have to see it again. I recall not really liking the Force Awakens with the first viewing, but saw it 2 more times in the theater and each time liked it better. I expect that may happen with this one as well.",1
3339,"Star Wars: Episode VIII- The last jedi, is a good movie. Is not the best of all, but is good, and there are some things that are interesting. Even that the movie is 152 minutes long, it doesn't´t feel that long. I like Episode VII more than this, but this movie feels a little more epic. Rain Johnson is a good director, not only let us see the characters developed in the way they do, but also visually, is stunning. The performances are amazing, specially from Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill, not saying that the other actors are not good, because everyone is great, but Daisy and Mark gave the best performances of their careers in this movie. The issues of this movie, at least to me, is that the movie takes some decisions that they were not good for the movie (like the direction of a character, and the fact that the movie could be 20 minutes short) I would love to explore Laura Dern character a little bit more. Also, the movie could use some more dark moments. Leaving that behind, the movie was entertaining and has some epic moments, that in the future, Star Wars fans will look up to.Not the best Star Wars movie, but it´s a good one.",1
3341,"I'm a die-hard Star Wars fan. The Last Jedi is not what I expected. At all. And it's all the better for it.Rian Johson has decided to approach the character of Luke Skywalker with shades of gray; gone is the hero that we remember from the original trilogy. In his place stands a man who has been broken down by experiences that have caused him to question the hubris and claim to moral authority that defined the Jedi Order. He's reluctant, skeptical, and everything in between. In short, he's more interesting than he's ever been.Likewise, Johnson and company have summarily shattered our expectations of how things will play out in the traditional good vs. evil battle that has defined the Star Wars universe since... well... forever. I don't want to give too much away, but there are some plot turns that unfold here that were--for me--totally unexpected. For the first time in a long time I was kept on my toes throughout the duration of a Star Wars movie.In short, this latest entry pushes the lore and mythos of Star Wars in new directions. It challenges preconceived notions of how it should all play out. That will (and apparently has) make some people angry, but I loved the unpredictability of it all. Still, The Last Jedi isn't perfect. The way Finn and the new character Rose are handled feels a little flat and diversionary, and I wish there was just a bit more pay-off in some crucial moments. Still, the freshness of this--and the sheer awesomeness of the various conflicts as they unfold--makes this one of the best Star Wars entries. There are some fantastic call-backs to the original trilogy that I don't want to give away, but they carry as much emotional weight as the new and unexpected revelations.",1
3342,"A refreshingly new take for a Star Wars film. Beautifully shot, great performances across the board. I can understand some peoples issues with it, but don't get the outright hate for it. Like Luke said in the first trailer ""This isn't going to go how you expect""",1
3343,"I'm glad they went in a new direction for this movie, that's something we were asking for since The Force Awakens. This movie expands the mythos of the Star Wars universe, the Force and the characters we thought we knew. It has its issues that's totally true, time will tell if this movie lives in infamy or high regard from the public, but personally I enjoyed it a lot.",1
3344,"TL:DR Should you go out and watch it? Yes! Is it the masterpiece I hoped it would be? No, sadly it is not.First of all: I won't spoil anything in this review! Now for the Movie, I came into this with massive, probably to massive, expectations. The Force Awakens (TFA) was alright - a good introduction into a new era of Star Wars but also borrowed to many plot devices from A New Hope. So, for me, in order to fall in love with this new trilogy, The Last Jedi (TLJ) had to really become a new Empire, a Movie that embraces all that's great about Star Wars and expands on it while also surprising the audience with new and unexpected twists and turns. And while the movie succeeds at the latter tasks, by really delivering some memorable and unexpected scenes, TLJ managed to really mess up the ""Star Wars"" part of the movie. It just feels like a fan film at times. A really good one, that comes close to Star Wars but never actually manages to create the same atmosphere and tension. This is mostly due to some questionable story decisions (that straight up make no sense at times), too many characters (its hard to get involved with a ""core team"" like back in the original trilogy with Han, Leia and Luke. TLJ has a tone of characters but that means each them only gets limited screen time) and the Movies tendencies to make scenes unnecessarily funny. You will know exactly what I mean after you've seen the first 10 minutes. Many scenes are just dark, serious and in their essence really good - until the awkward joke moment. I don't want to spoil, so let me give you an unrelated example: Imagine you watch the Vader scene in Empire, and just after the "" I am your father"" line Luke would respond with a little wink and a ""Oh really?"". A little tiny moment, that would change the whole movie. TLJ is full of these little moments, that are forcefully funny and sadly just don't work for me. They destroy otherwise really amazing moments for no apparent reason. And then there are some moments of magic and a long and really unnecessary ""safe the animals"" subplot adding salt to open wounds. But enough complaining, there is also a lot to like about TLJ . Its really well made. The visuals are stunning, the creatures are great, the Worlds amazing and the space battles intense and beautiful. The Soundtrack is on the expected level, meaning really, really amazing and just everything about the production is almost flawless. Also certain characters are really well developed, Kylo and Ray have some great moments and some of the stuff I don't want to spoil is just really amazing. Overall this is not a bad movie, nor ist an unenjoyable one. But I wanted to leave the cinema with a big smile on my face - and I didn't. As a movie this is a solid, enjoyable 7 out 10 - a really good movie, but not a masterwork. If this wasn't a Star Wars movie, I would be happy with it. But as a Star Wars movie, it did sadly disappoint me overall.",1
3345,"Amazing movie, though I understand why some hardcore fans  are upset. The direction they took with Luke will be controversial but I personally liked it. Best performance was from Adam Driver. Also a beautiful final performance from Carrie Fisher. This felt like the end of the trilogy, despite being the second movie. I am curious as to what they will do for IX.",1
3346,"Don't go into this thinking it's a 'Star Wars' movie, because it's not. In fact, this is film is actually a eulogy for the franchise. 'Star Wars' is dead, and Disney killed it. That said, they killed it in the most brilliant and spectacular way possible. I'd be lying if I said I didn't just enjoy watching the franchise die, and I feel a little bit guilty for saying that. Why?It shatters every expectation anyone had for what the movie was going to be. Aside from not being a rehash of 'the Empire Strikes Back' as many people feared it would be, it does so many new and unexpected things so well, that it's hard not to be in awe. Characters you didn't think would die bite the dust, new concepts and ideas are presented beautifully to the audience, and plot threads that seemed predictable at first are suddenly usurped. It's a spectacle to behold and utterly brilliant. This is also it's biggest problem. The whole thing feels like it was trying so hard to be epic and original, that it completely lost sight of how Star Wars is built on classic story telling tropes and concepts. It feels utterly alien in a universe that is alien in and of itself. I'm not saying that 'Star Wars' has to be the same thing over and over, but that it has to cling to it's roots and provide the audience with the sense of familiarity we all have with the original. 'Star Wars' isn't about high concepts or deep philosophical implications, it was about an original story that felt like a familiar fairy tale. So when you watch this, shed a tear for what once was. We'll never feel the simplistic magic of the original ever again; we all know this, and we've known it ever since the 'Phantom Menace' came out. As that tear rolls down your cheek though, take comfort knowing that every end is a new beginning, and watch knowing that even though this movie is 'Star Wars' in name only, there is still plenty of adventure left in the universe, even if it is weird unfamiliar.",1
3347,"Star Wars The Last Jedi is not a terrible movie, it is a pretty damn good oneRian Johnson did a near fantastic job with the movie, the casino parts and the character of Rose I thought were pointless, but fun and the rest of the movie was heart warming, fun and exciting.",1
3349,"This movie isn't all bad by a long shot.  In fact it has some really great moments that bridge the gap to even the original trilogy.  And I commend the movie and Rian Johnson for taking some big risks and going to unexpected places.  The problem is that overall, the result is pretty confusing and alien to the franchise.The Last Jedi doesn't exactly feel like a continuation of what we saw in the last film, and it doesn't seem to lead anywhere that is very interesting.  Characters often act like different people, and MANY things that were set up in The Force Awakens (in some cases as intriguing and important, but even inconsequential things) are paid off to little effect.  But at the same time, the actions that take place throughout the film aren't resolved in a way that is compelling, so it feels less exciting than tedious to have to wait for the next installment.The Last Jedi is a well-intentioned sequel but unfortunately slight mishandlings and some structural problems result in an entry that probably won't be beloved by many people.  It's worth getting your butt into a movie theatre seat, but be ready to forget the movie very soon after seeing it.",0
3351,"I remember watching Star Wars: A New Hope for the first time when I was 5 years old. It had me on the edge of the couch glued to the television screen. I was in love with the show, and I all wanted to do was play Star Wars with my friends and reenact the scenes. The love I have for Star Wars as a franchise has only grown since then. Unlike a significant amount of people who didn’t like the prequels, I did, because it was Star Wars and there was more to learn about it. Now as a 32 year old man; my love for Star Wars has been reignited since the release of The Force Awakens. The first time that I saw the trailer, it sent chills down my spine and I fell in love with it all over again. I absolutely loved the movie and I can say that The Last Jedi was nothing short of that. For those of us that dove into the expanded universe of Star Wars, you know the rule of two. This was a perfect example of that, and Kylo like most Sith apprentices want to kill their master. He was given the opportunity and he took it. Kylo is the perfect antagonist to Rey and I cannot wait to see episode nine. For those of us who are true Star Wars fans, we love that its back and look forward to the release of future stories. The force is limitless, and for those who are complaining about aspects of Leia using the force to float back to the ship, let’s be honest, that’s not the craziest thing you’ve seen a force user do. So, in the end, those of us that are true Star Wars fans, loved the movie and thank Disney for rekindling our love for it.",1
3352,"Went into this film expecting a disaster, having read the metacritic user reviews (which I trust more than actual critics). I previously abhorred ""The Force Awakens"", and I still do.I was absolutely surprised to the contrary. This is possibly my favorite SW film to date, possibly even better than Rogue One. The characters from TFA really come into their own in this film, with amazing performances that also explore their deep-seated psychological issues (Kylo Ren & Rey). This is a visually and aurally mind-blowing film. The space and ground battles are astonishing, let alone due to the originality of the planets they are fought in, and the look of the ships aswell as the sounds. This is a film that in scale, leapfrogs what we saw in TFA and even Rogue One.On the negatives, the film has a pacing issue. The entire film is basically one massive extended sequence, and drags on. My other gripe is the character of ""Rose"", which I found unlikeable and totally useless in the film.Finally, onto the story itself. I believe this is what ultimately causes the bad ratings. It is obviously a very divisive story. It is quite clear in this film that the makers of TFA had no idea where they wanted to take the story. Most of the deep plot questions everyone had were resolved more (Kylo Ren, Rey, Luke) or less (Snoke, Phasma) satisfyingly. What I will say as a SW fan is that the film is an amazing mixture of pure nostalgia and fan-service, but also truly taking SW into the new age. I always felt the prequel series suffered from childish use of CGI and bland acting...TLJ is a hard-hitting visceral SW film. I've read some reviewers complain that the SW lore is spat upon. I disagree. I feel Rian Johnson obviously TOOK RISKS but also took SW into the new age whilst giving the hardcore fans (like me) some real fan-service.This for me is an 8/10. Surpasses all the prequel films. I prefer not to compare to the OT because I feel they are in a category of their own. On par and even better than Rogue One. Misses a perfect mark (10/10) due to the bad pacing issue and the annoying Rose character.It will be interesting to see what JJ Abrams does with episode 9. But I am very negative considering TFA is such a useless film in the series. If anything, TLJ is what TFA should have been. TFA is an extended introduction to the characters, which was not thought out and just made to make money, TLJ really kicks things into gear and makes things happen to the characters.Well done Rian Johnson.",1
3353,It's definitely a mixed bad. If you don't care for any meddling with Star Wars Lore you might be annoyed. But in the end I think the interesting themes dealing with failure and legends not living up to their name as well as the focus on the failings of Jedi philosophy topped with the great action scenes still make this is a good movie in the end. Amazing? No. Great? No. Good. Yes. Thought provoking? Yes. Divisive? You got it.,1
3354,"""This is not going to go the way you think!""... That was Luke's warning on the trailer and oh boy, seems like a lot of people didn't listen to that. I really enjoyed the movie and was surprised again and again. It's fun, heartwarming and overall a solid 8. I knew people would have trouble with some stuff but I didn't find them particularly bad. The plot builds upon the lore established on the novels, rises debate about the true powers of the Force and the role of the Jedi within it, offers a close up to the struggles of the members of the Resistance and resonates with a message of wonder for the future. The visuals were truly breathtaking with some of the best scenes I have seen in a Star Wars movie... it actually made my jaw drop in a couple of shots as I was taking in everything that was happening. Obviously, the music is superb. Yes, there are parts where the pacing slows down and I guess they could have been handled those better but they were not detrimental to the movie's enjoyment. It does make me wonder how are they going to handle EP9 with how things end in this movie. In any case, I can't wait to take my niece to watch it together.",1
3355,"My biggest complaint in Force Awakens was that it lacks originality. It was just an Episode IV with a new twist, not presenting something really new. This time we can actually experience new ideas, on a dynamic that was not seen in a Star Wars ever before. It's a great, solid and exciting story that does not play safe, and that's the whole charm of it. If you see this movie without being strained with nostalgia, actually wanting some new perspective, chances are you will enjoy this movie deeply.It's not perfect though. Some characters and plot points were undeveloped. And they did focus a lot in fan service moments that make people scream in movie theaters. I loved some, but there were just too many.Another controversial thing was that some Star Wars taboos were broken. Definitive and epic answers won't be seen here, and we'll learn a thing of two of classic characters that we didn't expect at all. Some people will love this plot twists, while others will feel that the movie was reckless. I guess it will depend on how much you are open for changes and your understanding that Star Wars it's not just for you, long time fan, but also for a whole new generation.Anyway, it's a great movie in my opinion. See it with an open heart!",1
3356,"I see the Reddit keyboard warriors are at it again. Upset that their precious prequels and garbage Legends continuity has taken a back seat. They would expect the predictable outcome that Rey was a Kenobi/Skywalker/Solo which would have been fan-fiction style awfulness. They think JJ Abrams and Disney ruined the franchise but the box office and critical reception says otherwise. None of these ""fans"" want to face the fact that if Lucas took on the sequel trilogy, it would have had the same pitfalls, except with 33% more dementia.No one cares what social media has to say about the franchise. And all of your theories were crap.",1
3357,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a genuinely entertaining and exciting film. It took twists and turns that were unexpected and I think that makes me like it even more. Although some romance and humour feels out of place it doesn't take away the amazing special effects, oscar-worthy acting (especially Mark Hamill) and brilliantly written story.",1
3358,"This is probably one of the 4 best star wars movies. It has its flaws (Canto Bite subplot and some un-needed humor) If those two things were cleaned up or changed in some way this movie would have been a solid 10. The people hating this movie cannot seem to get out of their own way, let go of the Eu, and well like it for what it is... instead they hate its not what they wanted.",1
3359,"This is a movie that pulled at my heart strings and had many interesting twists and new ideas for the franchise. I definitely noticed flaws in the movie while watching but looking at the bulk of these user reviews I don't understand how over the top the hate train has gotten for this new trilogy. At first when I saw the difference in the critic score and user score on Rotten Tomatoes I thought the critics were out of touch, but now I'm beginning to expect the same from a lot of the ""fans.""  If you're not willing to accept new ideas in the Star Wars franchise then you won't enjoy this movie, but I for one thoroughly enjoyed the way they handled Luke, Kylo, and Rey.Luke is burdened by the ""Legends"" that surround him. The stories from the EU deified him as the ultimate light side user just like this new Star Wars universe deified him after the events of Return of the Jedi. In a fleeting moment of weakness he is responsible for the creation of Vader 2.0 and afterwards he cuts himself off from the Force. Ultimately though he lives up to the legend of being the ultimate light side user in one of the films final scenes and creates even more legends about him as he fades away.By the end of the film I was completely on board with Kylo being the main villain of the next film. I was never really interested in Snoke as an original character and I'm glad they killed him off.  As a twist on Vader's invitation to Luke to join him and rule the galaxy, Kylo actually follows through on killing the Supreme Leader and invites Rey to rule with him. Finally I'm ready to accept Rey as a spontaneous awakening of the Force. Kylo could have been lying to her, but I think it makes perfect sense that as Luke cut himself off from the Force and the dark side grew in strength, the light side of the Force would have surged in select few like Rey. However I still think the possibility remains that Rey's parents were not junk traders as the main villain is not alwasy a reliable source of information.Now for the flaws with the film. Most of my complaints revolve around Vice Admiral Holdo. My first gripe is that Admiral Akbar shouldn't have died off screen and he should have been the one to lightspeed jump into the First Order fleet. I would have been fine with Holdo being introduced as a Resistance leader who is set to take charge after Leia and Akbar's inevitable absence, but the way she was handled was the biggest problem in the movie. Also if Holdo had been honest with Poe while still putting him in his place, we wouldn't have had the whole Canto Bight sequence which was admittedly unnecessary and ultimately detrimental to the Resistance as well as the film. Finn and Rose wouldn't have been betrayed and their transports would have been safe. And that final scene better tie into IX somehow or I'll have to add that to the list of flaws.In short it's a fun Star Wars film with awesome moments, but not without noticeable flaws. Not the best, but certainly better than the prequels.",1
3360,"As a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember, I think that fanatics are being way too un-reasonably harsh against this movie for simply not doing the things they expected it to. Don'tget me wrong, this movie was flawed with a bad sub-plot, and some questionable decisions in the story, but it is still a very good movie and is definitely worth seeing as long as your okay with the fact that it doesn't cater to the fanatics.",1
3361,"The Last Jedi is a healthy response to the major criticisms that The Force Awakens received. The Force Awakens was called unoriginal and uninspired in its strive to rouse a sense of nostalgia within people. Well, The Last Jedi makes it abundantly clear throughout the movie that it is not afraid to skew from the paths of traditional storytelling and make the experience a highly more high-risks endeavor. These twists and unorthodox directions the movie takes, however effective in weaving a different and innovative storyline, are a huge risk that ultimately made the movie as polarizing as it was. For fans who are not afraid to stray away slightly from the strict format of other star wars movies, this movie will be all fun and emotion that keeps you interested because it never goes the way you think it's going to. For fans who don't like the transitional role of the sequel trilogy (ushering in a new generation of galactic heroes while saying a respectful goodbye to the classics), this movie will be incredibly frustrating. This star wars movie is a lot more fantastical than the rest, making very different decisions in terms of storytelling (this is the first star wars movie, I believe, where we get a real flashback) and in cinematography. The movie is very divorced from the rest of the franchise artistically, it has no remorse in taking much more flamboyant strides with its cinematography that makes it very unique visually. However, where this movie excels in, is the development of Rey, Luke, and Kylo Ren's characters as they are easily the three protagonists. It takes turns with characters that we weren't expecting in ways that will leave you reeling at how badass some scenes were... but also empty at the lack of resolve it provides. It answers a lot of questions, but not in a manner that is satisfactory or proportional to the two-year wait that it took to get them, and because of them, you leave the theatre feeling... unimpressed-- as if the answers were thrown into the script only after the bulk of it was written just to please the fans. However, one question goes starkly unanswered, and it doesn't feel natural, it feels like the moviemakers just genuinely couldn't think of a good answer so they didn't even bother. But maybe that mystery was intentional... who knows.Unlike some reviews say, this is not the best star wars movie since Empire Strikes Back, but it is better than The Force Awakens, especially for fans with more of an open mind towards the franchise.Going into this movie expecting a strict, algorithmic movie, like The Force Awakens, would be a mistake, and why many fans left the movie emotionless, for they were expecting a classic star wars tale, rather than (if I dare say it) a revolutionary method of star wars storytelling.As for story points and some of the subplots, The Last Jedi leaves a lot to be desired. Some stories are unnecessarily convoluted, while others have noticeable plot holes that you really only realize once you finish the movie. The major ones of these, really, leave you unconvinced that the enemy is really worth the fear or that they hold any real threat.All in all, this movie is a healthy and much-needed break from the classic star wars method of storytelling, while still keeping true (usually) to the classic Lucas quote: ""It's like poetry. It rhymes."" It answers questions in ways no star wars fan was expecting and takes the story to unconventional places (whether that is a positive or a negative is up to the audience solely). However, ultimately, this movie suffers from the change in director. The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are radically different in most respects and it feels like Rian Johnson didn't agree with, or care to continue, some of the plot threads JJ Abrams had left, so he cut them short and focused on his own story.Finally, this movie feels more like an end to the story than a middle, as if the new movies should not be a trilogy, but instead just two movies.This movie will excite you throughout, if you don't think too deeply about the stories, but does not do its job at leaving questions or plots unattended to in order to excite you for the next one. It really feels like this movie was tailored to be a finale, even though it is confirmed to not be.",1
3362,I left the cinema feeling great.Acting was a bit weird at the start. Had great moments. Wasn't a 10/10 film but still great.Would recommend to others.,1
3363,"8.25/10. Fun, enjoyable, flawed but great entry in the Star Wars franchise. Some disappointing things about it, but nothing as bad as briganding fanboys and trolls make it out to be",1
3364,"The Last Jedi is a step in a new direction for the Star Wars series. It's not executed perfectly and there's some slightly confusing decisions taken by the characters but it still works well enough. Whatever you do, don't go in expecting something quite as great as Empire Strikes Back, but it's certainly no Attack of the Clones.",1
3365,"Pretty good entry in the Star Wars universe. Nice to see other minds, writers, and directors playing with George Lucas' toys. Some great moments, some dumb moments: yeah, a Star Wars movie!",1
3366,"Not sure why there are so many negative review on here, but I really enjoyed the movie. Other than the casino part, most of the movie was pretty enjoyable! A few twists were just ""okay"", and the pacing was kind of weird at times (things happened WAY too fast on a few occasions), but the good outweighs the bad for me. Mark Hamill's acting was top notch in the movie. Definitely better than The Force Awakens. The original trilogy is still the best, but this movie might be right behind them.",1
3367,"First of all I wonder how many of the reviewers who have been negative about this movie actually had the opportunity to see every movie in its original format in the movie theater.  I was 6 in 1977 when a New Hope was released.Now on to Star Wars The Last Jedi.  Among the now 9 movies in the Star Wars universe I place this movie a close second behind Empire Strikes Back with Rogue One third.  This movie had a bit of everything in it and was a pleasure to watch for a true Star Wars fan.  If you only started enjoying the series with the Phantom Menace Trilogy or with the Force Awakens then there may be some parts that may seem repetitive or may not make that much sense.  To gain a true understanding of the movies you need to watch them not in chronological order from 1-8 with Rogue One in between 3-4 but rather how they came out: 4-6, 1-3, 7, Rogue One, 8.  This gives you a different understanding of the movies.I have seen them both ways obviously.  I miss the unedited versions of episodes 4-6 from 1977-1983, George Lucas did the movies a dis-service by changing them, but, it was to correct his original vision so I understand.  I am not here to spoil any of The Last Jedi for anyone, just go see it in the theater, this is definitely a movie you want to see on the big screen.  It will probably take a few screenings to truly appreciate all of the aspects of the movie.  I have only seen it once so far and plan on seeing it many more times in the theater before it leaves.  Hope this help and May the Force Be With All of You.",1
3368,"so everyone is complaining about the severed ties with the old saga just like they complained the mimicking in episode VII... thank god you are not critics. The last jedi isn't a perfect movie and it's mostly disney's fault or do you really think that looper's director could ever want an out of the blue joke scene? come one everybody, Star Wars is as good as a franchise as mc donalds. Despite all of this I really enjoyed how jj abrams' effort to give us a cameo saga went south, mostly thanks to new grounds breaking like killing snoke in few seconds. it's a good star wars movie mostly beacause of the good use the director makes of sw universe itself giving us something fresh, nothing like the force awakens",1
3369,"A worthy addition to Star Wars cannon. The film isn't afraid to destroy the past and build a new future with exciting twists and environments that feel at home in the Star Wars universe. It's weaknesses are apparent at times, but I think there are few true miscalculations. Some moments emotionally fall short and remind us that ""What we're watching isn't real."" But that's okay. We shouldn't ask this universe to be everything. Star Wars is a universe not built on hard rules and technicalities, but on  adventure and the fun-of-the-ride that comes with stepping aboard a mythology unlike any other in modern times.At its best, the film is a remarkably fun journey and its single greatest accomplishment is  that it establishes a new direct. Defining the Star Wars universe beyond any one  character (past or present). The Star Wars universe berthed the Skywalkers, not the other way around... Overall, this is the 4th best of the 8 Episodes released. Better than Force Awakens, but is it  better than Rogue One? A repeat view will help parse this out in time.",1
3371,This movie isn't perfect but i still love it so much. Mark Hamill is so amazing in this movie i LOVE him. And Poe Dameron is now one of my favourite Star Wars characters.,1
3372,"Звездные Войны: Последние Джедаи- невероятно крутое кино. Мне будет сложно объективно оценить это кино, так как я большой фанат. На этот фильм посыпалось очень много гнева, которого он не заслуживает. В фильме очень крутые персонажами. Актеры выложились на все 100%, особенно хочу отметить: Адам Драйвер, Бенисио Дель Торо, Марк Хемилл. Очень крутой главный злодей Калой Рен!

3373,"This is a good movie. It was very enjoyable, it was funny as well as dramatic but I feel that the movie, while very beautifully shot and well acted, shoots itself in the foot with a lot of strange decisions. For example (spoilers, duh) the fact that Rose saves Finn from sacrificing himself is so unnecessary. That would have been such a truly dramatically incredible moment, the sort of immature, wisecracking Finn maturing and finding it within himself to sacrifice his life for the greater good. In whole, the entire Rose and Finn story is incredibly boring. The movie stalls in the casino city, and I didn't find myself particularly interested in their supposed romance. It felt kind of rushed and uninspiring. Had they gotten a bit of true good backstory together, like Han and Leia, that would have saved that storyline.Luke dying I feel totally works. It adds a lot to his character and it is very interesting. The movie is very funny, the ""Hugs"" part made me laugh a lot, Yodas ""Page turners, they were not"" was one of the funniest Star Wars lines ever. The movie ranks 4th on my list of my favourite Star Wars movies. The list now looks like this:Empire Strikes BackA New HopeThe Force AwakensThe Last JediRogue OneReturn of the JediRevenge of the SithThe Phantom MenaceAttack of the Clones(The difference between my enjoyment of Revenge of the sith and return of the jedi is obviously MUCH bigger than the difference between Return and Rogue one. I will forever dislike the prequels)",1
3374,"(No Spoilers) Glad to see a Star Wars movie take risks and push the envelope. The direction Rian Johnson took the film, left me constantly surprised and on the edge of my seat throughout the film. The journey of new character's as well as our legends is told well, the cinematography is beautiful and the film stays true to Star Wars while taking a bold new direction. Not only is this a good Star Was film, it's a good film in general. I won't dismiss that a few things fall flat, but in a 2.5 hour movie, that's bound to happen. I left the theater smiling and I can't wait for Episode 9.",1
3375,I am a LONG time Star Wars fan growing up on the original trilogy.  I've ALWAYS been a HUGE Star Wars fan even during the dead times of most of the 80's and 90's.  I was HUGELY disappointed in Force Awakens but loved Rogue One.  So after Rogue One was so good I had hopes that this one would be better and that Disney would have learned from their mistakes they made in Episode 7. Well They didn't. :(  They made the SAME EXACT mistakes as Episode 7 with repeating things that happened in the original trilogy over and over and over again.  They also went with the Marvel philosophy and had some corney Jokes (namely the very beginning of the movie) and some things that just didn't make any sense/are not possible.  I'm looking at YOU Leia!  My dad saw the movie and I was talking to him about it and he said he went to the restroom about 30 minutes into the movie and another patron was mumbling of how Disney has ruined Star Wars.  That man walked out of the theater and didn't even finish watching it!  THAT is a HUGE problem.  Disney is alienating the VERY people who LOVE WITH A PASSION this IP. They BETTER right the ship with Episode 9 or I fear they will lose the majority of us.,1
3376,"To the people who feel most disappointed about this film, I understand, it's how I felt after The Force Awakens.  It's time to admit that Star Wars died when George Lucas gave up control.  Disney will just be content to repurpose, reimagine and remake every single Star Wars moment that came before.  Eventually Episode 15 will roll around and it will be a remake of this one, with an 80 year old Mark Hamill reprising his role.  That being said, I didn't hate this film.  It feels like it was made with a sense of craft that was sorely missing in Episode 7 and I liked the greater roles that Luke Skywaker and Leia were given.  As for some of the points that people re bringing up, I never cared to know who Snoke was, or who Rey's parents were.  It all stopped making since 2 movies ago.",1
3377,"long story short, the hate for this movie is unwarranted and the movie is 80% brillaiant, 10% crap and 10% average. just watch it now",1
3378,"The Last Jedi may be the most divisive out of all of the Star Wars films. It's actually pretty crazy just how many fans are on each side of the argument. And while I understand why a large portion of Star Wars fans are not too pumped with it, I really enjoyed it. It takes risks that I never thought that a Star Wars movie would take, and it develops some of the characters in ways I didn't expect, and I'm fine with almost every choice Rian Johnson and LucasFilm made. I will say that my biggest problem with this film, and this is a problem I had with The Force Awakens as well, is some of the comedy. A lot of it worked, despite not necessarily being needed, but some of it took me out of the movie completely. This is a movie set in a different galaxy during a different time period, but yet we were given some 2017-based humor. I get it; a sure fire way to make sure a joke lands with a lot of casual fans is to use topical humor...but it really doesn't work in some parts of this film. They've gone all in on this type of comedy, though, so I guess I might as well get used to it.The visuals of this film were incredible. Some of the best of the saga, if not the best. There's one scene in particular that caused my mouth to drop. It was extraordinary looking. And while I don't want to get into spoiler territory, many of you who have already seen the film will probably know the scene I'm talking about.Character development, and some of the choices the characters make, is what I feel like has divided the fanbase the most. As I stated earlier, I was pretty satisfied with a lot of the choices made in regards to the characters in this movie. There's only one moment that has me teetering more towards siding with the fans who are upset, and it has to do with a flashback scene involving Luke. After letting it marinate for a while, I've come to accept it more or less, but I was a bit perplexed when I first witnessed the scene. I was satisfied with the story as a whole. The first half was a bit slow for my liking, but it makes up for it with the second half that moves at a blistering pace. I think that this film has set us up for a very interesting ninth installment, which could potentially be the best of the trilogy. In the end, The Last Jedi gave me exactly what I was hoping for, with some surprises sprinkled throughout. I'm looking forward to seeing it again soon.",1
3380,"As hard for me as it is to write a negative review about a Star Wars film, here I am. What i can say that is that what it does good, it does good. What it does bad, it does bad. First of all i'd like to start with the good. Starting with an absolutely stunning space scene with amazing visuals, fantastic state of the art CGI and unbelievable camera work, this film sets it's self out to be the best looking Star Wars film ever made. Director Rian Johnson has got this part of the film right providing fans with two and a half hours of jaw dropping scenery and visuals. Not only this but there are a load of nods to past films and like the dice from ""A New Hope"" and yes this is a spoiler but Yoda coming to Luke in force ghost. There a loads of moments throughout the film that will make a true Star Wars fan really squirm with excitement, I mean i cheered alongside many others in the cinema when Yoda appeared. The space fights are outstanding, the planets, the old rebellion ships the use in the final act are stunning alongside the scenery but the big question is, do the positives outweigh the negatives?Starting with Finn and Roses subplot. This was so out of place and poorly paced. Overall they ended up having no major effect on the film or anything that happened, Finn was wasted and Rose just felt so forced into the film, the love triangle it potentially creates is just unnecessary and i found it somewhat irritating. Finn does *Spoiler* kill Phasma but it was in such a poor underwhelming fight that really makes you feel like director Rian doesn't care about his characters at all. I think everyone went into the cinema expecting Phasma to take a more prominent role because her character is actually so cool and her costume is insanely nice. Phasma kind of falls into a Boba Fett thing where you still admire how cool she is but everyone knows how wasted that character actually is. The fight lasts all of a minute and it doesn't even end up REALLY being Finn that kills her. I really loved the scene with Rey, Kylo and Snoke. I say that but i also fundamentally disagreed with it. This whole scene literally takes every single ounce of curiosity that EP7:TFA left us with and throws it out the window. Who is Snoke? Who are Reys parents? IT LITERALLY DOESN'T MATTER. Snoke dies and Reys parents are NOBODY. I honestly can't understand the direction they've took this in and that upsets me. Luke Skywalker, the hero, the legend and now the scared old man with no fight in him, oh and also the dead man. Luke's character feels the furthest away from being Luke Skywalker that he could ever be. He literally wanted to kill his nephew, the man who literally nearly gave his life for his Dad to return to the light side of the force got scared of his nephews raw strength and dark thoughts and literally pulled a lightsaber out on him while he was sleeping and then payed the price leading him to exile. This is the worst possible Luke storyline for me. Mark Hamil himself has said he disagrees with everything they did with Luke. It just makes no sense to me. We don't get to see any cool force scenes with Luke, any lightsaber scenes, nothing. Infact there isn't an actual lightsaber fight in this film. Luke dodges a few attempts from Kylo but that's literally it. How depressing. The final complaint of mine is how underwhelming Luke's death is, i mean surely if you have the balls to kill of such an icon you have to make it epic for the fans? Well that's not at all what we got. Luke uses the force one last time to make what i'll call a force hologram tricking Kylo into thinking he is there to distract the First Order so that the resistance can escape.. or rebels at this point? That was confusing too. Luke dodges attack from Kylo a couple of times, beautiful scene and everything but then finally he stands down and pulls an old Ben Kenobi 2.0. Doesn't quite say the same thing but does the whole ""Strike me down and i'll"" thing. Kylo strikes him and he's still stood because it's a hologram. By doing this Luke uses all his force maybe? I don't know this isn't made clear but he dies while watching the two suns of the planet he's took exile in set, in a new hope fashion. Luke did not get the ending he deserved. I'd rather go on believing Return of the Jedi was the end of his story. Verdict.This film creates new possibilities in the Star Wars universe while destroying and missing so many opportunities to please original fans. The sub plot was weak and the main story provides poor answers for massive questions, had they got this right this film could be compared to or better than Empire Strikes back but unfortunately it falls short where we really needed it to exceed expectations however the film is action packed and lots of fun with some misplaced humor creating so cringey moments but some beautiful.",1
3381,"I enjoyed every part of the movie. Is has some little flaws but i think this is the best film of the saga. Great twists, amazing scenes and very good actors performance",1
3382,"It's big, and messy, and charming. Some sag in the middle act and some slightly clunky or contrived plotting in places, but it's willingness to shake things up in a way that feels true to the characters and setting is great. Makes the force feel mystical and strange again, and is full of heart. It's a good movie.",1
3383,"This movie was decent.  It had a lot of flaws but fixed many of the problems I saw with The Force Awakens.  Rey is no longer a ""Mary Sue"" character, Poe Dameron has much more screen time and development, and there aren't as many visual distractions.  With all this comes more problems however.  The main plot is split into two much like Empire Strikes Back, and begins much in the same vein because that's what the director - Rian Johnson - had to work with.  There are times where it feels like a direct ripoff from not only Empire, but Return of the Jedi as well.  For instance there is a scene where Rey gets captured on purpose to try to turn Kylo Ren, but Ren takes Rey prisoner, much like Darth Vader did with Luke, and takes her to Snoke.  Snoke then mirrors Emperor Palpatine's role nearly down to the exact lines, and Kylo Ren ends up saving Rey to kill Snoke.  This was such a wasted opportunity and I saw it coming from the moment the scene began.  The sad thing is both Kylo and Rey had more trouble with Snoke's guards than Snoke himself!  There are other cases where the sense of urgency just isn't there when you think it should be, such as with the fuel crisis.  Finn and Rose seem very content to spend time enjoying the scenery on the Casino planet when their entire fleet is on the verge of being wiped out in mere hours.  This is a scene that could easily just be cut down or omitted completely for the better.Where the film truly shines though is the final act on the salt planet (I forget its name).  The imagery and cinematography is second to none, and the way the salt turns red as the speeders run at the AT-ATs is absolutely stunning.  The final battle is also well done, but I wish Luke and Kylo would have actually dueled instead of Luke dodging all the swings.  Overall the film was decent.  I liked it better than The Force Awakens but it definitely doesn't top Rogue One or any of the original six films bar episodes I and II. Episode IX definitely has a lot of work cut out for Star Wars to regain its footing, but I'm sure JJ Abrams is up to the task.",1
3384,"The movie successfully subverted my expectations for the characters, delivered fantastic action scenes, and expanded the universe. It wasn't perfect, some of the pacing in the middle of the movie lagged, and not all plotlines were equally successful. But even so, it was an ambitious and ultimately rewarding film experience. 3.5/5",1
3385,"The people are getting angry with this movie. But the truth is it´s a good movie. I spent some really great hours at the cinema whit this movie.Not perfect, but certainly it does not deserve a zero.",1
3386,"Amazing! Don't listen to the widows, they deserve twilight movies. The movie is amazing, Rey is an awesome character and Luke is REALLY badass. Go and watch it now!!",1
3387,"After my first time watching The Last Jedi I came out not knowing how I felt. There were a lot of unexpected turns and one character arc that wasn’t the greatest. However, upon my second viewing I appreciated the film and the risks that Rian Johnson took. No film is perfect but that doesn’t stop it from being good. First off, the characters were very well written and the action was choreographed to perfection. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley both give terrific performances as Kylo Ren and Rey and carry every scene they are in. Mark Hamill give his best performance of his career and Carrie Fisher is much improved over The Force Awakens. In fact, her performance proves that she can still act after all these years. Fin’s story arc is a weak point in the film and slows the movie down a little. There are many strong moments in this film that you will remember for years to come. There are small moments I could nitpick but they don’t affect the overall film. There’s some comedy that works and some that doesn’t, but again, it doesn’t detract from the film. I don’t want to ruin anything for anyone but this is a very different film from what I though it was going to be which might cause some to dislike it. However, if you go in knowing that this isn’t going to turn out the way you think, you’ll enjoy the story that was made.",1
3388,"This movie takes a lot of risks, and for that to happen to a franchise and even the Star Wars franchise is something special. However I might admit that the first 1/3 (not including the first space battle scene) is extremely disappointing with some reveals that have extremely poor execution. Soon after the battle, some characters get sent on a mission which I’m pretty sure contained a countless amount of MacGuffins and some lacklustre world-building which is unlike anything Star Wars would ever do (even the Porgs got annoying after a few jokes)As I was watching these scenes on Canto Bight, I honestly thought they’ve messed this up so badly that it’s unsaveable. However, the last 1/3 is some of the most outstanding scenes that this franchise has to offer. The battle scenes are fantastic and tension is high throughout. The island scenes with Luke and Rey are also a highlight with some fantastic creature-effects as is to be expected with the franchise. I could make the point that this stuff was so good that I was disappointed by everything else but it all has to be at the same level and it wasn’t. I think I’m nervous yet excited for Episode IX, it has the potential to be terrible or fantastic",1
3389,"You're all angry because it wasn't another remake of the OT. You're setting a bad precendent by complaining about a commercial film that takes bold risks and attempts to be creative in the process. Lucasfilm is making a clear statement with TLJ: we're not making superhero movies and things can actually Happen here. What was the last unexpectedly unexpected blockbuster film you watched at the cinema? Oh, I know: it was Terminator 2 in 1991.",1
3390,"The Last Jedi will ease Star Wars fans by doing something different, even though they will still probably be mad because they are Star Wars fans. Rian Johnson gave this series an incredibly unique direction, that makes this film stand out. All of the arks in this movie are written and pulled off beautifully. There are some definite issues in pacing, for the movie will derail a lot in the first act. This may tie into my last complaint, but I don't like what Finn and the new character Rose are doing in this movie. Finn also doesn't have an ark or any character development, which was disappointing.I did like The Force Awakens more, by the way. I don't by into a lot of the criticisms and nit picks that people have, because they're stupid. But The Force Awakens move along at a better place, and overall had less problems then The Last Jedi. I still loved this movie, and it is a welcome addition to the 3rd Star Wars Trilogy!",1
3391,"Side note: Anyone who rates this movie below a 5 either doesn't understand how number scales work or doesn't understand how to critique a movie in terms of actual cinematic elements.  Actual Review:  This movie is weird, in that it combines goofy humor, bizarre characters, and painful loss against the background of some ofthe most beautiful cinematic landscapes in movie history. In other words, it's a lot like the Empire Strikes Back, where a confused college-aged kid straps a green goblin to his back and tromps around a swamp. When Yoda and Luke first meet in Empire, Yoda steals a granola bar from Luke's supplies and wrestles with R2D2, basically acting like a spoiled brat. Real serious! In Empire, Han, C-3PO, Chewbacca, and Leia basically crack jokes through 1/3 of the movie as they take on famously stupendous odds from scene to scene. The shock of seriousness and silliness juxtaposed in great Star Wars movies has been lost on the great number of persons who are critiquing the Last Jedi for being too funny. If you have a single, brash star pilot attacking an entire fleet, you really think that dude isn't gonna add a little levity? Humor has always been a small resistance's weapon against great tyranny. Study history (or look around at the world today).And, at its core, this is a movie about what it means to be a rebel against great odds. From scene to scene, Rian Johnson shows--with great heart, jaw-dropping visuals, and genuinely new ideas in a world rotting with copycats--what it means to take on great evil with courage, wit, and a few dedicated friends. There are some ideas that miss, but that's what happens when you try out so many new ideas. When the ideas do land, this movie splits your mind in two at light speed.",1
3392,"LIGHT SIDE: Rian Johnson gave a great and risky approach to his vision of Star Wars. The cast was great: Mark Hamill was at his most greatest performance as Master Luke; Rey was terrific; Kylo began to grow on the audiece; Finn's role was satisfactory; Carrie Fisher gave a calm and beautiful final performance; the action scenes were fantastic and and has given the Star Wars franchise a new sense of view; the humor was so on point; there were many unexpected surprises which gave the film a solid edge. I would say that I've enjoyed the Last Jedi a little bit more than The Force Awakens. For sure, both films are still better than the prequels.DARK SIDE: OMG! TOO MANY DISSATISFACTIONS! REALLY????!!!! AND THERE ARE TOO MANY LEGITIMATE REASONS WHY!!!! ANSWERS EXPLAINED FROM EPISODE 7 BUT A BIT HALF-BUTT! EVERYTHING IS A TOTAL MESS BOXED IN A SWEET PACKAGE! I AM NOW QUESTIONING THE FUTURE OF THIS BELOVED CHILDHOOD FRANCHISE!!!!!",1
3393,"I really do not get all the hate for this movie. TFA was a predictable nostalgia fest - this actually breaks new ground for a Star Wars movie and in a pretty enjoyable way. It was far from cheesy, the action sequences were excellent and there was a solid moral undercurrent throughout. Really interested where they take the third movie given where the main characters are at the end of this movie.",1

3396,I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was the first Star Wars movie that I had to stop and think about afterwards. I am excited for some change in the Star Wars universe. Can’t wait to see IX!,1
3397,"Uh boy... Where do I begin with this one. Ok, first things first: As a big, life long fan of all that is Star Wars, this movie makes me very conflicted. It is gorgeous. It has some of the finest sound editing, effects, and looks. The acting is good, and some of the action pieces are exciting and fun. Some of the jokes work. With that said, I'm really conflicted about the story; In an objective view, it is well done and written, but as a fan of the original expanded universe I really hate some of the choices and decisions they made. So how to rate it? As a lifelong fan, I would give it a mediocre or bad score, but I recognize that if I didn't know anything about the other story, I would probably love it. So trying to be as objective as I can, as a movie only it is well made, and is a fun time. That being said, I can see why is so polarizing to the fandom. Final verdict: 7.6",1
3398,The Last Jedi is a great movie but not a good Star Wars movie. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is great and the way it ended leaves the door open for more.,1
3399,"I honestly don't understand why this is getting so many negative reviews. Sure, it may not be the best Star Wars film, but it's still pretty good overall.Star Wars: The Last Jedi is generally more comedic in tone, making for an overall more enjoyable experience. There are some predictable paths it goes down, and one scene in particular had me almost cringing. Still, taken by itself, it's a fine sci-fi film. As an addition to the Star Wars saga, it's nothing mind-blowing though.",1
3400,But muh Star Wars dis is Didney they runed mah favourite franchise with SJW women and actual good writing! This isn't a Star Wars movie! It's an actual good movie with a point and a message and character development that's deeper than the gaping hole in my brain! Movies that make me think are bad! I wanted Snoke to be Mace Window! And Ray's parents should've been the prequels! Give George Lupus his franchamise back you shill Rian Johanison! Roueg 1 was better it had more death and darkness and edge! I definitely know what I'm talking about because I went to middle school and know my abxs. And in English class they told me that I was a good critic better than the BOUGHT AND PAID FOR FAKE NEWS REAL CRITICS THAT DIDNEY CHOKES WITH THEIR SCHLONGS! O r maybe I just disagree with the real critics because I'm a fricken' moron and have no clue what I'm talking aabout! But that's can't be it. lololoplolo0lololol,1
3401,"The Last Jedi is a polarizing but poignant film that takes exciting new directions with established concepts that seems to me an incredibly worthy evolution of Star Wars. It shrugs off the formulaic approach taken by The Force Awakens (and to an extent, Rogue One) and takes the cast and story in a bold new direction but, unlike many may think, does not rewrite the rules of Star Wars.Action movies tend to favor the bold, brave heroes, but this time around they are put in check by more cautious, albeit conscientious, leaders. Right off the bat, Poe leads a reckless victory that is marred by the amount of casualties and loss of ships. He, Finn, and Rose end up concocting a bold plan to infiltrate the enemy fleet to temporarily disable their tracking system for just long enough for the rebels to escape, but end up nearly getting the remaining resistance members decimated. It’s in fact Admiral Amilyn who saves the day by evacuating the resistance to a remote planet, then sacrificing her life to save them from Poe’s miscalculations by going at light speed straight into a First Order star destroyer. While Leia’s role is not prominent in this film, her wisdom as a leader is shown in brief glimpses and through Amilyn as a disciple, while our new heroes are forced to contend with the consequences of their approaches.The chemistry between Rey and Kylo Ren is beautiful and amazingly portrayed. They struggle with being pulled in the opposite direction of where they want to be pulled, yet find a powerful connection in their mirroring struggles. There are callbacks to Vader and Luke here, but their stories go in completely different directions that are legitimately surprising but also feel entirely natural. I was not convinced that when Kylo killed Han Solo that he was completely free of his light side inclinations, but I never expected how much harder he could fall into a downward spiral. And that’s where killing Snoke was such a brilliant twist - unlike Vader’s killing of his master, which definitely brought him back to the light, Snoke’s death marks Kylo’s true descent into darkness, filled with a hatred that can (seemingly) never be cured. Rey’s hope for Kylo’s redemption is shattered along being confronted with the painful truth that her parents were nobodies that simply abandoned her, but she does not give in to his desperate attempt at turning her to his side.This movie tears down the old masters and gives birth to a newer generation of light and dark users of the force. Kylo is not Snoke, Rey is not Luke, yet both of them have definitely picked their side. Luke’s downfall is perhaps as tragic as his father’s, and while he hasn’t turned to darkness, his light has certainly been snuffed out for a long time. His final sacrifice is so true to his character (humor included) and a beautiful redemption, as well as an exciting cliffhanger to find out what the Jedi have learned about existing as force ghosts (I highly doubt this is the last we see of Luke).The Last Jedi is filled with a lot of surprises and revelations that I’m sure are eliciting some negative responses from people. But the way I see it, these all fit in perfectly with the established universe while not being a retreading of old ideas, and that’s exactly what I wanted out of this movie. It’s what George Lucas would have done anyway.",1
3402,"BIG FAN RANT ALERT! (Seriously,I warned you.)So...After the huge 'Tidal Wave' that was the fans tearing the movie apart with a massive hate on it (move over,prequels),I was really scared for the screening,but in the end was Star Wars The Last Jedi a massive letdown (as the fans 'always' say)? Wrong. A 1000 times wrong. This is one of the best movies i've seen this year,even if it's nowhere near Empire Strikes Back. The pure love that an indie director like Rian Johnson (Brick,Looper) crafts throughout was so impressive,I kept smiling for the whole runtime. Like some rare sequels (say,the recent Blade Runner 2049 or Toy Story 2),this is one of those that truly expands upon the last one,with a production design that really loves the universe and tries to put every single detail on it. Think of it like a birthday cake: You have the bread,which is the set design,a delicious cream made of Oscar-worthy Visual and Sound Effects,the taste of the bread which is the story that delivers some surprising twists and a comedic timing that I only saw in Empire,and then the candles,which are the score (this time made excellently by John Williams,unlike TFA) and the acting,with Mark Hamill delivering the example of what a Supporting Actor Oscar nominee should look and be like,Adam Driver constantly evolving through his career with a Kylo Ren that is truly written this time around,and the saddest tribute I could have ever seen in a movie by Carrie Fisher. And yeah,the Porgs sure are adorable,i'll put those as sprinkles on my cake,thanks. The only flaw that keeps it from a 10/10 is the relation (?) between Finn (played by John Boyega) and Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran). It almost makes the experience distracting from the main story,but it's not like a huge pinpoint. It was decent to look at. And another flaw isn't specifically with the movie,but it's revolved around the internet,and that's the fans: ""Overrated s**t""""It changes nothing we have had for 2 years while having the slowest space chase in cinematic history.""""Too D**n long!""EVERYONE HAS TO SETTLE THE CREEPER DOWN. If you are reading this as a fan,hoew the living TNT could you get upset and mad at this?!? You did the same thing in TFA being ''A New Hope 2.0"" (one of its biggest cons and pros),now you're being mad at something that tries to go a different route rather than being ''Empire Strikes Back 2.0''?!? Well,good luck on making this the ""mother!"" of Sci-Fi movies... Because that's how the Internet works... And 2017's horrid generation of young audience members... (i'm 15).But anyway,yes,i do recommend checking out The Last Jedi. Trust me,it'll be worth your time and the hype.",1
3403,"It was quite good; I don't know why everyone is making such a fuss.  The art direction and fights especially were very mice.  There's some more force powers nonsense, but it's a fantasy movie, so space magic is understandable.  Mysteries are left unsolved, but they might come up later (characters can lie), or maybe be revealed in the comics (reading comics won't hurt you).  There was more humor than I expected, but that's not a bad thing.  Lots of surprises to be had as well.  I'm not sure why people expect so much from a movie, that so many are angry.  It was a very fun use of almost 3 hours.  Don't expect it to fix your life's problems, though.  Still sad and alone  (but that's not Mark Hamill's job to fix).",1
3404,"I loved it. It's a great movie. As a star wars movie though... it's gonna be divisive for one reason: Change. Fans will have a hard time accepting that people can change during the course of years. This movie expands the star wars canon in  risky ways. I can understand why some people would get angry at that, but that's not my case. The arcs are amazing (especially Kylo, Rey and Leia). My only issues with this movie are some of Luke's choices throughtout the movie and the fact that even though a lot happens, it's not trascendental. A casual movie goer could skip TLJ, go directly for episode IX and may not even notice.",1
3405,"Loved the movie, It was unique I noticed none of the main characters succeeded, this is a film, about failure and looking to the future, failure is important to the human condition, just as The Last Jedi is important for the future of Star Wars.",1
3406,"This vast improvement over the last two installments in this storied franchise provides some much-needed relief to a series that was rapidly running out of gas and originality. With a well-crafted, insightful allegorical story line, fine performances by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, excellent special effects and a restrained reliance on action sequences to carry the narrative, ""The Last Jedi"" gives viewers much to ponder while serving up an entertaining saga more in line with the original films in the ""Star Wars"" mythology. Admittedly it's not perfect -- a little overlong (especially in the pacing in the first 45 minutes), a little weak in its use of 3D effects and a tad too cutesy in its comic relief -- but these shortcomings don't significantly detract from the overall product. It's truly satisfying to see this franchise finally getting back on track.",1
3407,"Originally gave this film a 1/10, But on further reflection I realized that I hadn't taken into account the monolithic amount effort required to make a Star Wars film worse than the prequels. I mean, considering the that Finn has replaced Jar Jar merits its own form of special recognition. Rest in peace Star Wars. I'll try and forget this monstrosity as soon as I can. Maybe somebody can remake the Dune Universe... I miss good sci-fi movies.",1
3408,"This is a thoroughly good movie, though it does have a number of low points. It is beautiful, well acted, has good characters, and tells its story clearly without losing subtlety. On the downside, some of the scenes stretched on too long, and one in particular could have been quartered while not losing anything of any value; the story it is telling also isn't truly great, and it has a number of minor issues in that area.",1
3409,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the newest Star Wars movie in the new trilogy. And really Star Wars the Last Jedi isn't a mess but it is messy. That doesn't mean i didn't like it. In actuality, i really was impressed with what they did with this film. Aside from the Force Awakens and Rouge one, two awful Star Wars movies, this one is actually consistent. Rian Johnson has taken helm of it, which was exciting because i like Rian Johnson. Looper, The three breaking bad episode's he directed, and Brick are great and he did a decent job with this film. Anyway, i want to talk some negative things first, because i need to get all that **** out first. My first negative is with the insanely jarring subplot with Finn and Rose. It felt like it was just there so Rose and Finn had something to do. It was so lazy. Like one of the worst subplots i've seen in a film. No character development during this sequence, and any development that there is, is incredibly lazy and just thrown in there. This is also when we get introduced to Bencio Del Toro's character DJ who is the ""master code breaker"" Bencio Del Toro is ok in the movie, but the character that was written for him, not so much. He just felt there so that people can go ""Ohhhh. A big hollywood movie star"" He felt so out of place in this movie. Speaking of **** characters let's talk Rose and Snoke. First Rose. She is there, much like the main subplot, just so she has something to do. She doesn't have much a character and we spend too much time with her. Her stupidity really affect's the movie in a way. Once you see the movie, you'll know what i mean. But she's completely useless. Snoke is also just there. He's there so that Kylo Ren has an arc. His arc is totally forgotten and misused. An opportunity that was completely underused. You have so much ambiguous traits and mysteries with him, that you could lose interest. I never liked snoke, but i wished they delved into his character more. The movie also was surprisingly dumb. This movie has moments where the movie just gets really stupid. Stupid moments that are extremely laughable. And the ending was a bit cheesy. And that's pretty much it. This movie also has force awakens jokes, that made me cringe so hard. Probably as harder than the force awakens. Now positives. The action was really impressive. The space battle's were really awesome. The beginning action scene was really amazing. Made it feel like it was the original Star Wars, It was extremely fantastic. There's a lightsaber battle towards the end of the movie that was **** awesome. Just overall, the action was awesome. Most of the acting was good. Daisy Ridley was fine. Her performance in this movie was equal to her performance in the force awakens. John Boyega is the same. Oscar Isaac is also fine. Carrie Fisher is extraordinary. Her last  performance is her best performance. Adam Driver is amazing as Kylo Ren once again. Andy Serkis is chilling as Snoke. Even though his character is **** dumb. Laura Dern is decent. I didn't care for her character because they did nothing with her character. Mark Hamil is stunning as bitter Luke. He was amazing in this movie. The best he's ever been as Luke. The characters are really built in this movies, they has clear and perfect arcs. Rey is more developed and more perfected in this movie. Poe has my favourite arc in the movie. His arc was really built throughout the movie.  Finn has really confusing arc. Kylo Ren has a amazing arc. You see every thing that this character has gone through. Already his character is extremely fascinating and can't wait to see what they do with this character. Leia is great, like always. In the force awakens, her character was there for, what it felt like, nostalgia. But her character here is really good. What i heard, is that Luke's character was awful, and that it ruined their childhood. I thought Luke was great. His bitter character was really cool. Seeing Luke as a bitter, brutal, old man was reeling. The first act and the last act are really great. But all that second act stuff with the casino, Rose and Finn, is really bad. But overall the story is fine. The direction and cinematography are amazing and great. And the special effects are stunning as well. The music is fine, but still feels kinda rushed. Like the force awakens where the music is just really awful, the music is just fine here. Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is decent, enough for me to like it. Where they go with the Star Wars series is really fascinating, and i can't wait to see where the new franchise go's.73%",1
3410,"I'm an old fashioned Star Wars first trilogy fan. The only one that should have been existed. This is not a 10 because the movie worth a 10. A user score of 5 is unfair. The movie is great but it does not have the Star Wars feeling anymore. It's been done for a wide range of people and little new fans. Times are different from 40 years ago. We should open our point of view before judging this movie. I've found some scenes frustrating - i.e. Leia in space...wtf? - the Casino part is horrible. Luke's struggle within it's lacking of passages, too Obi Wan style. Even if since the very beginning he was a kind of pessimist - i.e. Yoda's training on Dagobah. I felt the force only in few passages. It's not what I wanted to see. But objectively Ryan Johnson made a great work.",1
3411,"Devastadora, emocionante, y sobretodo, sorprendente. No es lo mismo de siempre y por ello, The Last Jedi se convierte en una película única dentro de la saga, la cual demuestra su papel de ''película puente'' entre los episodios VII y IX. Frescura, innovación y una nueva visión sobre la Fuerza hacen de esta nueva entrega todo un tesoro para recordar a los fans de la saga.",1
3412,"La película tiene las características propias de una del resto de la saga, tiene identidad propia y se notó el esfuerzo por darle sentido a la historia que dejó la película anterior, tiene detalles como cualquier otra pero cumple con el cometido de entretener y disfrutar Star Wars en toda su extensión.",1
3413,"I don't understand the dislike for this film. Either it's an anti-Disney bot explosion or a lot of self-professed Star Wars fans out there who suddenly don't like Star Wars films because they're proper movies again. Last Jedi is a massive accomplishment. A huge success. Emotional, thrilling, exciting from beginning to end. Considering Lucas made the first film to evoke Saturday matinees, this one is every bit a continuation of that.",1
3414,"In my opinion, The Last Jedi was really good. It's a very interesting movie that usurps your expectations and hopes but does it in a way that makes sense. Movie critics seem to love it. After seeing it, I thought fans we're going to be more divided. This ended up being the case. I think this is because while the movie is not disrespectful to Star Wars, it is not overly reverent. It does not bow to fan theories or the fanfics theorists created in their head. Part of me is slightly disappointed in some of the story decisions. Still, I thought the movie was very well done.The ironic part is that people are going to hate this movie for the exact opposite reason as the Force Awakens. The Force Awakens was like a chocolate cake. It was super delicious but somewhat simplistic. This movie is deeper and the flavor is going to drive some people away. The Last Jedi could be called the new Empire. This is not because it follows the same story beats as Empire but it is Empire in the sense that it leaves the audience unsure of how to respond. Like I said, I liked it. I need to watch it again a few more times. While it did not follow the epic I wrote in my head or the old EU, I do not think it's trash. I am not sure if this is simply a good Star Wars movie or if it is something truly special. As far as criticisms go, I think the movie has some pacing issues and not all the dialogue works. Not a negative but some of the character decisions might make fans uncomfortable. The plus is that this movie is something new and it has breathtaking visuals.",1
3415,"A bold, ambitious, and utterly mesmerizing ride through the Star Wars universe, the Last Jedi has the guts to NOT give fans what they've been asking for, which is exactly what the franchise needs. As an avid fan, and a writer, I have spent many years thinking about what I have wanted from Star Wars, and what I would do were I ever given the chance to take the helm. TLJ went about as far from my idealized version of Star Wars as possible, and yet I could not be more pleased about that. You can’t experience the joy of discovery and surprise, if you receive what you were expecting.After the sugar-coated suppository that was The Force Awakens, Disney has finally taken the Star Wars saga in a bold new direction, where the struggle of good vs evil has been skewed more toward a realm of grey. Rather than the done-to-death formula of J.J. Abrams' entry in the series, Rian Johnson has delivered a complex and emotionally-saturated work of art, that makes the audience work to find the meaning behind each scene, rather than spoon-feeding it to them as though they are toddlers. Some of the greatest decisions Johnson has made are sure to infuriate rabid fans, but in time it will become clear that the direction he chose to take these characters and storylines was ultimately best for the series.While shy of a masterpiece, this film does an admirable job of trying to please the three target demographics (Children, adult fans who have grown up with Star Wars, and adult fans who have wanted Star Wars to grow up alongside them). This is accomplished largely by creating a subplot to appeal to each group, be it Finn's wacky, child-friendly adventure, the truly space operatic struggle of the Resistance, and the complex and ever-shifting relationship between Rey, Kylo, and Luke. While this does not always work, and at times the tone of the film feels truly all over the place, it is a worthy trade-off to see the franchise grow beyond its roots, and strive to be more than just a repeat of what has come before.It should also be noted that this movie is greatly enhanced by multiple viewings. Not only does it help to strip away the viewer's preconceptions (which is the biggest hurdle TLJ must face), it also allows one to pick up on the carefully-woven threads of story that were place so expertly and subtly, that they are almost impossible to see the first time around.In conclusion, The Last Jedi is a flawed, but ultimately rich and rewarding experience, for those that are willing to accept that the movie they created in their mind was never going to be the movie that ended up on the screen.",1
3416,"A Star Wars movie that cares about characters and surprises in so many ways while honoring the past films. I had such a wonderful time watching this movie and gasped a dozen times at the beauty of the shots. This movie is smart and true to the characters. If you hated it, I bet you'll like it the second time around. Give it a chance.",1
3417,"They're just angry beacuse it wasn't what they want it, and what they want it is make all their ""Preditions"" real. I don't care what the haters says. The people who love this film agrres with me. This is by far better than The Force Awakens. It has action, emotion, exciting moments, humor and it definitly it is impredictable. This is a great Star Wars movie to watch and i'm not afriad to say it.",1
3418,"This Movie is far from perfect, but really? Giving this movie 0's and 1's is just stupid. This movie was fun and exciting. People were cheering, laughing and clapping in the theatre. This movie is easily the third best in the franchise. The only problems I had was the scene with Rey and Kylo, and the end with Luke. The emotion was there but sometimes it was just lacking.  I just don't see how this movie deserves a 1. Lowest is a 6.",1
3419,"Star Wars fandom is full of hipocrysy. OT have bunch of silly content and nobody complain. Is Rey a Mary Sue? What about Luke in OT? Fans want some connections with OT - TFA - ""no no is'ts a copy no!"". Fans want something new - TFA - ""no, no, it isn't Star Wars !"". Guys. Where is logic?",1
3420,Great film. The user reviews are currently being skewed by a very vocal minority of fans that have unrealistic expectations and don't like surprises. For once the critics have it spot on.,1
3421,This is not going to go a way you think. Absolutely Amazing!! -    SPOILERSOnly think i disliked was Finn and Rose's storyline.,1
3422,"It's a nice film, better than The Force Awekens and the Phantom Mence, and of course Attack of clones. This film have a good action, well action and intresting character.",1
3423,"Certainly a strong movie wit strong direction and cinematography. Admittedly it lacked and major twists or punch that left a resonating mark with me. Regardless, still a strong movie and well worth watching.",1
3424,"I have been a Star Wars fan for as much of my life as I can remember. I haven’t loved all of them, and I have mixed feelings about the prequels. This is an amazing Star Wars story. They poured so much TLC into this movie. It’s not perfect but it’s an epic Star Wars story.",1
3425,"Well i hated episode 7 with my whole bodey. Episode 7 was so bad, it did hurt even a year later. But episode 8 is not that bad.Rey is still a stupid character.But Kaylo is better this time.",0
3426,"A phenomenal movie that blows apart the SW mythology with depth, and a spiritual thoughtfulness that really gives the entire idea of the Force resonance. Absolutely beautifully made film. Hats off to Rian Johnson and boo-hoo to all you fanboys who just don't get it and wanted it to be Luke Skywalker jumping out with his lightsaber and kicking ass. The movie is asking you to grow beyond it all, in the same way Yoda says ""we are what they grow beyond"".  Its also why he destroys the jedi texts. I'm not surprised people aren't getting it. The world is getting dumber",1
3427,Very good I love it. It has some thing new for star war and  it is unpredictable. I don't know what people see but for me it really really good. I never see star war like this before,1
3428,"This is a really interesting and complicated movie. Like a quote in the trailer ""Let the past die"", It went in a different direction than other Star Wars movies, the movie was a bit long and can get really slow at some parts but throughout, it was still entertaining thanks to a solid direction from Rian Johnson. The action was good, the creativity was good, the cinematography was good. It also answered most of the question in ""The Force Awaken"" and opened a lot more, Some people will be satisfied but some won't. It will make you really love it or hate it, but either way, it is a must-see movie.",1
3429,"I signed up just in order to leave this review. I really do not understand this backlash. The movie is ironic, the photography is stunning and the plot twists are extremely unpredictable. A few elements of the Snoke thing do cause some perplexity, but I think that the fans who now cry just wanted a dumb remake of Ep. 5. This movie is new, the story is new and it challenges the foundations of the franchise. Well done Rian Johnson",1
3430,I don't get the HATE for this movie. It's a great movie. And give me more of Finn and Rose (I think that's her name?). I just love it. And here is where I try to fill space for the 150 character minimum.,1
3431,"TLJ could very well be the best Star Wars movie we've ever received. It defies your expectations at every turn, and that seems to be why so many people have a problem with it. For the first time in a LONG time, I was legitimately on the edge of my seat, physically tensed up, not knowing what would happen. Beautiful thematic messages permeate the entire story (the role that failure plays in our lives, as well as the idea to ""Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to""), and there is a LOT of story. The long run time is absolutely justified for me, and I honestly would have been fine with it being even longer. A joy for a Star Wars fan eager to see something new.",1
3432,"I have to give this a 10 but its more like an 8.5. Dorks giving it a 0 are being way to cynical, but then again the Star Wars community is the most toxic of any community.",1
3433,"The movie is so long, but I don't know how many time I hold my breath, but sadly the script I think it was poor and plane. I cried in all Leia's scenes.",1
3434,"For real look at this user score. This is the problem today in movies. People beg for originality and creativity and when they get it, guess what? They hate it or spit on it. This is the reason why we don't get original ideas/concepts. Alright onto the film. First of all the actors and performances were all incredible, but Mark Hamill steals every single shot when he is in frame. Also Daisy and Adam are incredible. They better be right? They are the lead roles after all, but well done. The movie looked incredible down to every detail in design, costumes and CGI, and you can not forget about the creature models/designs. Some of the best creatures I've seen in a movie in a while. The story I felt was really engaging and felt more complete this time. It felt more of a fantasy and oddly enough a thriller at least to me. It has all the Star Wars fighting, lasers and Stormtroopers dying, along side some really awesome 1 on 1 fights and some surprises I did not see coming sprinkled in. Overall if you are a fan of Rian's work or just love Star Wars see it in theaters, and actually give originality and creativity a chance it might actually shock you.",1
3435,"Sigo sin entender por que el odio a esta película, si quizá no fue lo que se se esperaba pero la verdad es que cumplió demasiado, los personajes son mejor trabajados en esta que en entregas pasadas haciéndolos mas humanos y no solo héroes por que si incluso vemos un pensamiento en Luke con mucha razón y justificación. Pienso que a muchos les molestaron los giros pero creo que eran necesarios para que la película se sintiese fresca y no como un refrito de la trilogía Original o como que apelaban a las teorías de los fans, los efectos visuales son asombrosos eso si se usa un poco mas el CGI pero no molesta, la comedia tal vez sea el punto mas feo de la película no tengo problemas con chistes o bromas ya que se usan desde la trilogía original pero estos son malisimos a tal punto que se sienten super forzados. Una película fresca de Star Wars que soluciona muchos fallos de el episodio VII y que apesar de contar con fanservice este no entorpece la trama o la vuelve un calco de episodios pasados, veanla y tengan sus propias conclusiones yo la disfrute y hasta llore con lo emotivo que se vuelve.",1
3436,Really liked it. Despite too much humour aimed at the young kids I enjoyed the character moments and how much it bucked all the fan theories. I wonder if thats why some users seem to be review bombing it? I hope in time people grow to enjoy this pretty unique Star Wars film,1
3437,"The most exciting movie I've ever seen. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but please, do yourself a favor and see this movie in the theater. You'll be glad you did, because there's nothing like it. The negative reviews on here are written by angry fanboys creating multiple accounts to tank the film's audience score. This movie is a heart-wrenching masterpiece.",1
3438,"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is a spectacular movie on so many levels. First, ;et me give one proviso. I highly reccomend viewing Episode VII - The Force Awakens first as it explains a lot of the context of The Last Jedi. Now the bare facts. The Last Jedi handles character exposition, development, and disposition wonderfully. There are many points in the movie where you briefly ask: ""Why?"" only to have the explanation to become jaw-droppingly clear.  As always, the cinematography is amazing. I can guarentee that when people get into long drawn out discussions as to which Star Wars film was the best of the series, The Last Jedi will rank among the top of the list of even the most rabid and opinionated Star Wars fans.",1
3439,"One of the best Star Wars ever. Aknowledges the failures from the past generations and learns from it. Shows everyone is susceptible to them, even legends. If this movie you did not like, this movie you did not understand.",1
3440,Star Wars The Last Jedi is amazing. It takes what is so good about the originals and blows it up. The space battles are so cool and the lightsaber fights (although few) are amazing. This movie is funny and just utterly entertaining.,1
3441,I've seen the film twice and boy was it better the second time. Rian Johnson puts his own style into this universe and the results are pretty great. I see the backlash because it does take chances but the risks taken are very well rewarded. A,1
3442,"I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. In many ways it was quite different from the previous Star Wars films, but in the greatest way possible. Wilst boldly pushing the plot forward and being a new kind of Star Wars movie it does much more than live up to my expectations, indeed it exceeds them. Not only does The Last Jedi tastefully honor the Star Wars legacy, it dares take the storyline to unexpected places. For me it was the best Star Wars movie to date – I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and I cared deeply about what happened to the characters on screen. I love good character development and I feel that was The Last Jedi's strongest point along with the incredible connection between Rey and Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. I'm very impressed that Rian Johnson was bold enough to take the franchise in the direction he did by building on the groundwork J.J. Abrams had set up in The Force Awakens and writing this incredible story about the characters we all know and love. I can't wait to see what Abrams will do with what Rian has made here.The Last Jedi has a few delightful callbacks to the previous films without relying on nostalgia to drive it.",1
3443,Easily one of the best Star Wars films ever made. Much better than Rogue One and Force Awakens. Both films felt they were lacking something and The Last Jedi did a great job bringing back the Star Wars feel while also not being afraid to try new things. And this film is filled with multiple twists and turns that make it very entertaining and fresh when it comes to moving the story into new and exciting places. Definitely one of the best movies of 2017,1
3444,"Сказать честно фильмы после третьей части меня не очень интересовали, и этот как вы поняли мне тоже не был интересен. Но все же я поставил этому фильму 7. Хороший монтаж, спецэффекты и конечно же актеры. Одному его не советую смотреть, а с друзьями или семьей можно.",1
3445,I like the actions sequences. But I dislike the relationship between Rey and Luke. They are going nowhere. The musical score is just marvellous. For me it is among the best Star Wars film series,1
3446,The best Star Wars film yet. Rian Johnson did an incredible job on this film and has obviously sparked controversy among the fanbase. I for one think this was the perfect direction to take the series. A bold and unique take on the series that in my opinion is the best Star Wars movie of them all.,1
3449,"Possibly the weakest entry to the Star Wars franchise, a lot of forced moments and character push. A lot of the characters that you would expect to have a major role from the first movie of the new trilogy werent really pushed in the main plot at all and the ones that were pushed were overshadowed by how shallow some of the minor plot points were showcased. Its a ""good"" movie but not a so good Star Wars movie.",1
3450,"Oh boy...where to begin? Star Wars: The Last Jedi is easily the best or second best Star Wars film--easy. It manages to give us an amazing story, filled with amazingly well written characters, beautifully crafted scenes, and a score by Williams that will make any person shiver with euphoria. Everything on screen and I mean everything is visually gorgeous and hard to top. The Last Jedi is the darkest film in the Star Wars saga and is filled with jaw dropping moments that will leave you speechless--It certainly left me speechless. Mark Hamill returns as Luke and nails it. Carrie Fisher (God bless her) returns as Leia and nails it. Oscar Issac shines as Poe and gets more character development. Daisy Ridely ad Adam Driver SHINE as they give powerhouse performances here. Andy Serkis is always great when he's on screen. Domhnall Gleeson does great here as well. This is a perfect movie, but there is just one downside to it and that involves John Boyega and newcomer Kelly Tran, playing Finn and Rose. They have a storyline here that doesn't fit all too well for parts of the movie, and at some points feel like an entirely different movie altogether. But it can be easily forgiven as it does give us new looks on the Star Wars Universe, plus LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT. The action is incredible, the space battles are star gazing, the lightsaber fights are blazing, and the fights on the ground are blaring. But most of all, this movie tells a story that you will never see coming, not from a mile away. It toys with your expectations, knowing exactly what you are expecting, and the immediately does that and/OR THE EXACT OPPOSITE. Plus, it answers most questions left in The Force Awakens while also leaving oher aspects open. It should also be noted that this movie barely did what The Force Awakens did, as in fan pandering. There's barely a single sign of it here and that goes to show just how passionate the man behind this movie is. Rian Johnson has written and directed the best Star Wars film I have ever seen and it proves why Lucasfilm is giving him free reign on a new trilogy. Rian is a master class filmmaker here and he needs to be recognized for bringing a new story, with hard hitting moments, to life. But most of all, I am excited to see what happens next...Luke was right, ""This is not going to go the way you think."" I am going to watch it, then watch it again, and again, and again. Thank you, Rian, and thank you, Lucasfilm. And before I go, don't worry Game of Thrones fans, Captain Phasma actually does stuff this time. Cool stuff too.",1
3454,The movie was excellent and only gets better with repeat viewings. I highly recommend. 10 out of 10.,1
3455,"Had to login to rate the movie a 10 because of all the trolls rating the movie negatively. GG Metacritic. Anyone rating this movie below a 7 shouldn't be allowed on this website, obvious trolls or people that should stop watching movies. The Last Jedi was amazing and even better than 7, it's hilarious to see all of the people that try so hard to give the movie a bad wrap when they have no idea what they are even talking about.",1
3456,I love that they leave everything preset and silly speculations and theories. It was time to forget the old stories. There are characters that did what I expected for more than 36 years to do and finally I could see it. It's not perfect but it's what the saga needed.,1
3457,"I don't understand the reason of why they're so much negative reviews about the movie. I suppose that much people didn't like maybe another side of view about Luke's attitude, but, in my opinion, it's important with the idea of renew of the saga.On the other side, I have to say that I've loved the film when I saw it at the cinema and has accomplished all my expectatives, but, obviously, it's not as good as episodes IV and V. The only think I'd like to maintain about the saga is the essence of the first films.",1
3459,"Risky and excellent film of Star Wars? Definitely yes. The film may not deserve 10 of 10, but 0-5 is not exactly, because there is an excellent acting, visual, moral and a lot of memorizing scenes. Strange moments are present, but they fade in comparison with everything else. Relax, people. If you consider this film to be the worst of all, then you will get movies in the style of marvel, which everyone likes. ""Fear is the path to the dark side…fear leads to anger…anger leads to hate…hate leads to suffering"" - Yoda (c).",1
3460,"Finally Star Wars evolved and found a formula to evoke emotions in a non-nostalgic way. Disney realised that 'never change a winning formula' wasn't in place anymore. They needed new values and leave the predictable (and almost milked) concepts behind. The simplicity of good versus evil makes place for something more nuanced. A lot of people will hate this movie. I can only applause it.By the time the movie ended, it had brought pure catharsis. One advice: go empty-minded and enjoy the ride.",1
3461,"I really liked this movie. All scenes with Luke Skywalker are simply gorgeous. The scene in Millennium Falcon is full of nostalgia. Be objective, even if you do not like this film, it does not deserve a rating of 0.",1
3462,"Finally after 20 years of seeing awful to average movies with the star wars name in the title we get a film that deserves it's place in the saga. Despite a slow half hour in the middle, the rest of the film feels absolutely epic, unlike the ever so praised empire strikes back, this one doesn't need a cliff hanger and a part two, it could quite easily be a self contained film, like every film should be. I doubt any star wars film will ever be as good as A New Hope, but this one is definitely up there.",1
3463,"According to Disney, the Force is political correctnessAfter watching Star Wars VII, The Force Awakens (TFA), I actually had a new hope (pun intended) for the Star Wars franchise. It was fun and exciting, it generally respected the original characters, it introduced new characters, and yes, the old characters was certainly gracefully giving way to the new characters. I thought it was a great way to start the next trilogy. So I was hoping that Star Wars VIII, The Last Jedi (TLJ), would now cement a new set of long-lasting, memorable characters in the guise of Kylo, Rey, Finn, Poe and even the new ""Emperor"" Snoke. Great scott, I was so wrong. What in the world was that mess all about? The Last Jedi was so crammed with politically correct ideology (all men are stupid and degenerate, all women are clever and enlightened). Characters like Poe that showed so much hope in TFA, even Snokes showed some weight at the beginning of TLJ, and even Luke Skywalker himself, but they ALL completely degenerated into nobodies in TLJ. And oh my goodness, the whole claptrap ideology about women being the enlightened and evolved ones and men being the old patriarchy and degenerating into dumb monkeys is so obvious it made me nauseous. By the end of The Last Jedi, I was dying to re-watch Transformesr 1-5 all over again - at least Michael Bay didn't PRETEND there was a story (nor politically correct ideology) and the effects were good!The force has indeed awakened, only to fall asleep again... Disney is fast becoming a politically correct school for kids.",0
3464,Beautiful. An intense and powerful experience. I have never been more excited about what the future holds for Star Wars. It was nothing like I expected. And I loved that about it.,1
3465,"Everyone knows Star Wars has its fair share of haters, and the spike in scores of zero underlines that perfectly. The movies is not zero to anyone that actually reviews it, the movies is a zero only to people that want to purposely drag the score down. This movie is at least a 7, even to people that aren't very fond of the universe. The effects, the acting, the dialogue, all done very well, so even if you disagree with the way it was written, you should still appreciate the good things.",1
3466,"This movie delivers one of the biggest ""wtf""-moments you'll see in your life in theaters, and has delightful performances by Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and so many more of the cast.Some characters die before you really get to know them, which feels a bit like a shame but which is what the extended universe is for I guess. Finn's entire storyline does feel exactly the same as it was in TFA, which is a shame and the worst bit of the movie for me. They could have been more original in that regard.Johnson made some decisions I wouldn't have made in writing and shooting the movie, but all in all it is a great movie, with its heart in the right place, and which might leave people a bit depressed at the end of it.The lesson of this movie is failure, but I look forward to how much higher these characters will be able to soar in the last chapter of this trilogy.The creature designs were amazing and used at the appropriate times to bring some lightheartedness into an otherwise very dark movie.",1
3467,"Pro: Objectively the best film in the Star Wars franchise. It's fresh, different yet faithful to the rest of the universe. The fate of Luke if brave, but makes 100% sense. Con:I fear for the consequences of the use of Hyper-speed as a weapon, it opens a door into completely different space battles from now on.Snokes death makes no sense to me, neither from a story telling point of view or in the scene. I really hope we will see more of him in IX.While I think it is fine to include a plan that doesn't work, the Casino detour was the low point of the movie. To the haters:The film do require a bit more of it's audience than the rest of the series and made a big F-you to all film theories - which I loved it for! ;-)The conclusion after 3 movies and the Rebels TV-show: Disney is not the enemy of Star Wars (at least not nearly as much as Lucas himself had become).",1
3468,"Rian Johnson and Disney find a way to right the wrongs of ""The Force Awakens"" (in terms of being a safe Star Wars film) and deliver a film which is both unmistakably marked with the DNA of Star Wars, but also offers a wider view into the many themes and established universe that George Lucas engraved into our everyday pop-culture, deepening the mythology in delightful and unexpected ways.No doubt a difficult task to achieve, the film takes the liberties of being clearly a Rian Johnson film, while at the same time being a natural progression for the Star Wars canon going forward.While most character's storylines and relationships work beautifully (specially Rey and Luke), there is one storyline involving a set of characters which seemed to slow the film considerably, and which did not end up paying-off in a fulfilling coherent way.Other than that, the performances from all returning cast seem more alive and ""meaty"", and all new faces blend perfectly into the ongoing story with ease.The most riveting and exciting Star Wars experience since The Empire Strikes Back.Can't wait to see where Episode IX will take us.",1
3469,Fantastic - it subverted so many of my expectations as a long time Star Wars fan. Beautifully shot. Funny. So much happened in this movie that I felt overwhelmed by the end. Can't wait to see it again and really interested to see where the story will go next.Rated 10 to balance out all of the ridiculous 0 score reviews. How can you simultaneously complain because the movie wrapped too many story lines up and then  also complain that nothing was resolved in it? I loved how it subverted many of my expectations while still definitely feeling like a Star Wars film - clearly others did not. A core message of this movie (time to let old things go) is something that has hit a nerve with many.,1
3470,"Theories are over people, this movie made the biggests twists in Star wars history and I liked them all. I know that most of us want some things to happen in a certain way because we are fans, but if that was the case, then there would be no surprise and no moving foward to the franchise.Things I hated:-Leia Superman-Daisy Ridley's mediocre acting at the 1st half of the film.Things I liked:+Everything elseThis movie was never boring and had some awesome fight scenes. Most people are sad because of how the film went, for example: when did Luke did something powerful in the originals? Never!, he only tried to turn his father to the light. Fans put a lot of old characters in a pedestal and that's why they didn't liked this film. Rey's parentage was also very well handed, but fans disagree wanting her parentage to be from a known family. But isn't the galaxy inmense or infinite? Fan theories are only that, just fan theories. If she would have been from a known family like Kenobi, Skywalker or Palpatine that's just lazy and making the galaxy more little than The Bahamas islands.Overall this film is about the new generation & letting the past die, it's original and doesn't copy Ep. V. The way it ended, it will certainly make Episode IX a very unique film.",1
3471,"Why does this film have so many negative reviews? Maybe im just easy to please but as a hardcore Star Wars fans I loved it. My 3rd favorite SW film after Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. A worthy addition to the legacy of Star Wars. Rian Johnsons cinematography is gorgeous and all the leads performances are top notch. The only thing that bugged me was how they handled Snoke, outside of that an almost perfect film.",1
3472,"""snoke was a red herring i hate the movie"" The real villain is Kylo Ren why is that a problem for you? ""luke who was never formally trained until he was 20 and has gone into hiding like obi wan removed from the force like obi wan isn't the super jedi on par i wanted him to be"" (vader was always holding back when fighting him, easily beat him in return of the jedi when he wasn't, it was his goodness just like rey's that lets him overcome... just like obi wan was a better jedi than the great anakin despite being less powerful. ""luke died i hate the movie"" think of the deaths in the original series that serve to guide the young characters from the first films: obi wan and yoda. he became a true master and one with the force. this wont be the last we see of luke. ""the movie was cheesy"" you signed on for that, go back and watch a new hope and tell me you aren't watching with rose colored glasses to say that it's not cheesy or watch any of return of the jedi (storm trooper marimbas anyone?). ""this movie forces the message of inclusion"" star wars has always been about fighting oppressive militaristic fascism and if you don't like inclusion, star wars isn't for you. ""nothing is explained"" oh i get it now, you are an idiot. Thumbs this down all you want, butt hurt babies. i enjoy thinking of you all watching this great film with your arms crossed and angry. This move treats the series with reverence and adds depth to all the films that came before it.",1
3473,"Gorgeous, challenging, and character-focused. While this movie definitely has a few issues, I think a lot of the criticism is that it takes familiar characters and story beats and subverts them, telling fans that they need to be able to look to the past and enjoy it but not let it tether them to what they think the franchise would be. Several characters are killed off that had potential, and while in the case of Snoke it certainly makes sense thematically, not even giving him two lines to explain where he comes from is a little bit of a misstep.While the majority of the cast gets some great development, Rose and DJ unfortunately remain a little flat. I love Rose, but her feelings for Finn came from nowhere, and DJ was basically only a plot device.The movie has some gorgeous shots, from space battles to the juxtaposition of red and white on the planet Crait. Using Luke to deconstruct the old ways of the Jedi was fascinating, and while he has moments of conflict and weakness, he never strays from the Luke we knew. He’s still ultimately someone who wants to help, who wants to make things right, and even through his guilt he maintains that.There are moments of awkward humor, the milking scene in particular stands out to me. Of course, several of the serious moments end up ridiculous, but it wouldn’t be Star Wars without the narm charm.The Last Jedi isn’t perfect, but it’s intelligent and challenges the conventions of the series while still maintaining the central themes of the series: standing up against oppression, and hope against all odds. It’s going to make fans angry, but it’s exactly what Star Wars needed.",1
3474,"One of the best blockbuster films ever. The inclusion of some semblance of nuance and ambiguity among the characters and ethics of the world makes this a compelling film. Maybe a bit too many Porgs and not enough gays, but still incredible.",1
3475,Much Much better than the Expanded Universe. It makes much more sense than anything offered there.,1
3476,"This is the longest instalment in the Star Wars franchise, and packs in more twists and subplots than any that have come before. Admittedly some work better than others, but amongst the filler there are some great character moments, epic battles and revelations that I'd never have expected. It's not as tightly scripted as the likes of Empire Strikes Back, but as a modern-day Star Wars movie it's certainly one of the better ones. Bring on Episode IX.",1
3477,"This is my favorite Star Wars film since TESB. I stand by that. It is a film about disappointment, but not itself one. It is about tragic mistakes, and the inevitable betrayal of life that is that immortal truth: all things must change, and die. And we either accept change, or become tyrants, great or small, to prevent it.It celebrates what we love about Star Wars as entertainment, but is not afraid, by embracing the underlying philosophy of what Star Wars represents as MORE than mere entertainment, to then burn all of that to the ground. Because it must.FULL SPOILERS follow.Why did the paragon of good consider killing Ben Solo? And why is Rey so powerful if she isn't a Skywalker, or otherwise ""special?"" Those questions are answered, but are also not the point.As Yoda tells Luke, there was nothing in the Jedi traditions that Rey did not already have within her. This despite her not apparently having any special lineage. This, solely because of her choices, and because the Force wills it.People don’t want to hear this, but I’m going to say it because I am convinced of its essential truth:  people over time have forgotten what George Lucas' original intent with Star Wars was. Much like Luke lost his way once beyond the idealistic confines of his heroic youth. (If you believe The Last Jedi ""ruined Star Wars,"" ironically because of Luke's characterization in part no doubt, I'm talking directly about you. Yes, you.)Star Wars was never about midichlorian counts and force powers or even lightsaber duels.No. It was about a small group of rebels defying a fascist empire. It was about previous generations' failures and their conflicts with the next generation to follow them (the people they failed, be it their students, or their children - or a whole generation in the abstract.) It was about hope, and how the unlikeliest people can change the course of history. It was also about a mystical force that binds all life together, and about the need to LET GO - to be selfless - instead of trying to CONTROL AND PRESERVE all things, in order to be one with it. (A great irony of this fandom.)In case people missed one of the major points of the prequels (in fairness, in part because it was poorly communicated): Despite all his hyped up ""highest midichlorian count I've ever seen in a life form"" potential, his hubris, greed, and tragic fall destroyed Anakin Skywalker. His ""special space bloodline"" did not save him, or the galaxy.It was only a choice he made in the end that saved the galaxy, NOT his bloodline or his midichlorians. There is a reason for that. George Lucas’ story is not elitist, but rather, egalitarian. The midicholorians, while canonically relevant, were THEMATICALLY a red herring, and a CAUTIONARY TALE. People missed that, apparently.The prequels were also the story of a Democracy dying due to apathy and greed, and how good people turn bad. It was NOT the story of a ""chosen one"" whose blood made him stronger than others (or did you forget he was defeated in a rather Faustian manner by someone with a perfectly ordinary ""midichlorian count"" in Obi-Wan?)Lucas' point and intent was to say: none of that stuff matters if you're a selfish person willing to side with someone like Sidious. But the message people got instead, unfortunately, was: Anakin being born of the Force and having an unparalleled midichlorian count are what makes him special, and therefore all subsequent protagonists must be similarly special and elite in some way in order to be powerful, or nothing makes sense and Star Wars is broken. (And by extension, his son Luke must also be without flaw, apparently.)Meanwhile, unlike Anakin, Obi-Wan and Yoda - both with canonically lower midichlorian counts - recognized their failures and changed because of them, going on to be great heroes because of their humility. And Luke, with minimal training next to Vader, had the wisdom to throw down his lightsaber and reject hate, even if it meant his death. (At least, the Luke of 30+ years ago did. People change. But I digress...)That was the point. That was Lucas’ message: Be selfless, resist evil, and anyone can be a hero, even if they aren't ""chosen ones."" THAT IS STAR WARS.To say Rey cannot be a hero unless she is a Skywalker or Kenobi or Force messiah is the OPPOSITE of the philosophy of Star Wars. And, ironically, it's exactly that point to which Rian Johnson has returned. TLJ shows us things we don't like, but need to accept - much like Luke & Rey. That our heroes aren't perfect. That people change and make mistakes even after great triumphs. That the old must give way to the new, or the old becomes oppressive. That your bloodline doesn't make you powerful (or weak,) your choices do. That heroes and hope continue to rise even in the midst of pervasive darkness. That was the point of the stable boy with the broom at the end, by the way. And that was also, ultimately, THE POINT OF STAR WARS.",1

It was a true popcorn sci fi movie, humorous comments, wicked action and  some brutal fights, especially the one between Rey , Ren and the imperial guards.I can appreciate why a lot of folks wouldn't like this film, and also why a lot of people would like it. The only thing that left me cold was...SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERSSPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERSSPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERSSPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERSSPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERSSPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERSThe fact that Luke Skywalker was poorly realised, under implemented and his character ultimately wasted.

THIS TOTALLY WOULD NOT HAPPEN.Then there was the final act.

What a complete waste. It struck me at first that Luke had willingly allowed this to happen and that he had committed suicide. A few hours later, a line Kylo came out with earlier in the film came to mind, when he first communicated with Rey within the force, he says something like "" How are you doing this? This should be tearing you apart"".  This comment implies that force projection is very hard and very dangerous to do, and I see now, why that line was included .  But it still doesn't make me feel better that Luke has been written out of the Star Wars saga. First we lose Han and now Luke in the films, and of course Carrie in real life. A real shame. I would have rather seen each character say their goodbyes and ride off into the sunset myself, but no, the new star wars movies have killed them. A real shame...But....I'll still go see this again, there's enough good stuff in the film to almost counter balance the films other events, but the Canto Bight scenes were a tad pointless and drawn out, the whole lot could have been done in a  five minute heist scene in my opinion.So, there you go. I'm going again, and I'll buy it on Bluray, but the loss of Luke will sting forever. As it does with Han.7/10 ( Better than Phantom Menace )",1

3483,"The Last Jedi is the star wars movie that will divide generations of viewers - and by doing it it refers to the struggle we actually have- us as humans, - with other generations, the ones that are in power, the ones we critic, the one we want to be different from. So let the angry fans shouting hate, by pointing plot issues, their own projections toward character - all of this doesn't have sense : the Last Jedi is an analogy, one that combines so well with the rest of the saga, an analogy of how is our world, our politics, our moral judgements and more. People should focus on these aspects rather than reducing a movie - which is a piece of art - to a cartoon, to a sum of characters, to a simple story. Star Wars has always been a contradiction between scale, between a family drama and a powers ruling the entire galaxy, a contradiction that remind us of our own world. The last scene of the Last Jedi is just showing us how can we handle this, it gives us hope.",1
3484,At times it leaves you with internal conflicts but in general I would say that it is a good film. At least I didn't fully enjoy it because the movie is a constant time trial which made me feel anxious from minute one. I'll have to see her a second time more relaxed.,1
3485,"With the past two movies relying more on familiar beats and concepts rather than an original vision for the series, I questioned what this new trilogy would deliver. I wondered if Disney would be bold enough to break the mold and venture to the unfamiliar and untested. The Last Jedi proved to me that this trilogy deserves to exist, and that a new Star Wars can be fresh and creative without using the past as a crutch. The sequel trilogy now has a thesis statement, characters that have been properly fleshed out, and an exciting direction that finally engrossed me in this side of the saga. It's not flawless, but Star Wars desperately needed to be creative and gutsy again, and The Last Jedi manages this with the ingenuity the series deserves.",1
3486,"Truly the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back! Having in mind that all SW films are aesthetically spectacular, I will only talk about the narrative itself. I truly don't get all the negative backlash on TLJ. I guess it was probably because it didn't show what these ""fans"" wanted to see - TLJ was able to mix that heart-warming feeling of watching a Star Wars movie with something completely new, combined with stunning and insane action scenes and epic Luke Skywalker moments. Sure, the beggining of the film is SOME confusing and there were a LOT (a LOT) of cheesy lines, Snoke wasn't what we all expected him to be, but then again, rest of the filme balances those aspects. It's 2017's best film, it's worth every penny!",1
3487,Much better than The Force Awakens.  The plot twists and turns in unexpected directions to always keep you on your toes. The action is great.

3488,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!O novo episódio de ""Guerra nas Estrelas'' joga com a expectativa criada de que seria um remake d'O Império contra-ataca, de modo similar que ''O Despertar da Força'' emula ''Uma Nova Esperança''. As situações estão todas lá, construídas perfeitamente para que os mesmos jargões sejam usados de forma segura e nostálgica. No entanto, os temas subjacentes sofrem mudanças importantes, e a solução do conflito tende sempre à surpresa.E são todas ótimas surpresas, que revigoram a mitologia da saga ao mesmo tempo que permitem a expansão de seu universo. Os avisos de Luke para Rey, ''Isso não vai se passar do modo que você imagina'' e ''O que você acha que eu faria, pegaria uma espada laser e sairia pela galáxia para dizimar a Primeira Ordem?'', são emblemas que permitem ao roteirista Rian C. Johnson navegar por mares conhecidos através de correntes pouco aproveitadas.Assim com em ""O Império contra-ataca"", dois arcos principais se desenvolvem simultaneamente até que confluem no terceiro ato. No primeiro deles, espera-se uma reedição do treinamento em Dagobah. Rey é enviada pela Resistência e apresenta a Luke as credenciais de ter sido recomendada por Leia.Assim como Yoda, Luke se mostra relutante em relação a nova discípula, mas por motivos bem diferentes. O mestre sabe que o conflito entre os jedi e os sith cega para uma harmonia maior, que, ao ser ignorada, reproduz o embate em escala ampliada. Desse modo, sua decisão é se isolar na ilha mais sagrada da Ordem até encontrar a paz necessária para que possa morrer, levando consigo todo o legado do qual se tornaria o último representante. Skywalker concede três lições a Rey, buscando fazer com que a moça compreenda a necessidade do fim dos Jedi. Por trás de todos os vínculos se esconde esse poder, essa força, que também está presente em todos os seres. Luke demonstra a vaidade que está por trás da crença de que a ''luz se extinguiria sem os Jedi''.Não que o nosso heroi se livre da tentação do apego à realidade em que cresceu. Ele hesita quando se trata de destruir a árvore sagrada da Ordem, que marca seu centro cósmico e esconde seus textos originais. Luke não sabe se a hora realmente chegou. Sua indecisão é rompida pela presença mágica de Yoda, que coloca fim à materialidade da história Jedi e dá uma lição no antigo discípulo: não há nada nos livros destruídos que Rey já não soubesse, e não cabe a esse ou aquele mestre estabelecer a hora do término do conflito entre luz e sombras. O que cabe ao mestre é transmitir o que aprendeu, incluindo o poder que se esconde por trás de seus fracassos.Rey, por sua vez, continua em sua jornada marcada pela carência de raízes. Ela projeta a figura paterna em Skywalker, do mesmo modo que projetara em Han Solo. Sua ânsia pelo fim da rejeição a leva diretamente para o confronto contra o lado obscuro, e ela vê seus múltiplos e aparentemente infindáveis reflexos, que representam camadas de seu ser, em uma sucessão desesperadora que, quando enfrentada, a conduz mais uma vez a si mesma e à sua própria solidão. Essa solidão, por sua vez, a abre para a influência de Ben Solo.O líder dos cavaleiros de Ren também enfrenta o mesmo tema da libertação de qualquer dualidade, que nele toma a forma de ruptura com o passado. O novo deve suplantar o contexto e as estruturas já estabelecidas. Luz, sombras, Jedi, Sith, pais, mestres, rebeldes, Império pertenceriam ao passado da saga. O futuro está em seu vínculo com Rey, cuja carência pretende suprir ao revelar à menina aquilo que ela já desconfiava: ela não é ''ninguém'', não pertence a nenhuma linhagem nobre que lhe dê direito de tomar parte significativa na história dos Skywalker. Seu papel seria dependente de sua relação com o filho de Han e Leia.",1
3489,"The applause and the audience reactions in the cinema (both times) simply do not reflect the overwhelming negativity I'm seeing online. The bitterness is saddening. I guess it's a strong emotion which leads to reactive behaviour more reliably than pleasure. So here I am simply to lend my positive opinion to the online realm and make it more reflective of the ACTUAL public opinion surrounding the film. Firstly, I'm a lifelong fan of Star Wars. I thoroughly enjoy all of the films, even those I understand to be objectively quite poor. I've spent hours lost in KotoR and the Jedi Knight games, and enjoyed reading the Thrawn books as well as some of Obi-Wan's EU saga, and I'm at peace with those stories becoming 'Legends'. I'm also at peace with the Star Wars saga going in a new direction, with the galaxy changing, and the nature of the force changing (you may call it inconsistency, but there's nothing in the SW canon that suggests that the living force is a static, unchanging entity). With that out of the way, I find 'The Last Jedi' to be beautifully written, spectacular, and wonderfully exciting adventure. I'm not going to put too much effort into a review that is going be skimmed over or left unread, and most likely attract a wave of 'unhelpful reacts' (that's modern discourse for you). But what I will say is that this movie touched me, awed me, and surprised me. It felt remarkably conscious and understanding of human nature, and the writing was brilliant in that regard. The set pieces were incredible, and there were some truly, truly grand and powerful moments that I just keep replaying over and over in my head. This movie made my imagination run wild, it made me laugh, it made sense (and almost all arguments to the contrary are trivially easy to defuse), it excited me, it developed characters in new and interesting ways, it introduced new and exciting locations, technology, characters, and creatures, it featured sombre, bittersweet, and meaningful moments, and it gave us truly iconic imagery that – whether you like it or not – will be adored and remembered by millions for years to come.This movie is a deadset classic, and time will come to treat it as such. No amount of nitpicking will stop that. This movie succeeded in awakening the adventurous, hopeful, fun, imaginative parts of young and mature minds alike, and that was the main thing it needed to do. 'The Last Jedi' is a sheer victory.",1
3490,"great movie! :Di was watched this movie in the last weekend and very liked it.there are some bad things, but they are minor and not critically.so... let's watch this movie!",1
3491,"A satisfying film that effectively ties up many of the plot threads introduced in The Force Awakens while expanding on characters both old and new in surprising and believable ways. The humor is often a bit more ""modern"" than the previous movies, but doesn't get in the way of the story and adds levity in a natural way. The Last Jedi deviates surprisingly far from a standard three-act structure, which can make the film feel disjointed at times, especially with many characters' plotlines unfolding at the same time. However, dramatic tension/release is doled out in a way that keeps the film tense and engaging despite its length. I did find myself noticing how long the film had gone on about the 1h50m mark, but was quickly recaptured by an excellent last act.As a meta-Metacritic aside, I feel the people complaining about the Porgs' incredibly brief and unobtrusive appearance in this film is probably just suffering from some kind of Minions-induced trauma, because they stay out of the way of the film's momentum and aren't obnoxious like some other Star Wars creatures have been (see: Gungans and Ewoks).",1
3492,"Exciting, unpredictable, inspiring and gorgeously filmed. It was nothing I expected, which is exactly what I wanted.  The themes were inspiring and I'm excited for the future star wars.",1
3493,"When I left this movie, I felt conflicted. It had taken almost all of my expectations and completely flipped them on their head. I was expecting a much different movie to the one I got. However, after careful consideration, both of the movie itself and for what it does to Star Wars canon, I have decided that I quite like this movie.I do disagree with a number of choices this movie made, from having Luke be even more of a washed up hermit than I expected him to be, to killing off Snoke at such an early stage. However, I don't think it deserves the level of hate it has gotten. Once I made peace with the decisions the movie made, I was able to see it as what it was, a beautifully made movie that makes hard choices that move the franchise in a bold new direction. And as much as it hurts to let the past die, I'm confident that this new direction can give life to Star Wars for decades to come.On the other side, I don't think this movie is AS revolutionary as some people are making it out to be. The Jedi order is not being thrown away; it's returning to its roots, to a time before they had become the complacent, Republic-serving, priestly Order they had become. There's a blink-and-you-miss-it moment in the Last Jedi, where you see that the sacred Jedi texts were, in fact, not in that tree when it caught on fire. Rey and secretly taken them with her when she left, as evidenced a by them being shown on the Falcon at the end as Finn is grabbing a blanket. Thus, when Yoda set the tree ablaze, he wasn't burning down the Jedi tradition, because as an omniscient Force ghost, he knew the books weren't there. That means when he said ""Those books don't contain anything the girl Rey doesn't already have,"" he literally meant that she has the books. This means when she is training to become a Jedi, and eventually training a new Jedi Order herself, she'll be building it from the original Jedi teachings.Really, this movie brings the whole saga full circle, enhancing the prequels by acknowledging how the Jedi failed during that era and making it a central plot point. The Jedi philosophy isn't bad, no, what the Jedi had become over a thousand years of peace and complacency is bad. This film makes the promise that the Jedi Order will be rebuilt to be what is was originally supposed to be. And that makes me excited for the future. (Also the possible future of showing what the old Jedi Order was like when it was still in it's full glory, Rian Johnson trilogy anyone?) But that's just my opinion.",1
3494,"Ich denke Luke wusste, dass er nur noch eine Legende war und wollte an dem auch nichts mehr ändern. Darum ist er nicht zurückgekehrt und löste sich zum Machtgeist auf.Das mit Leia war zuerst schon ziemlich komisch, wenn man aber bedenkt dass sie die Tochter des mächtigen Dath Vader ist, ist das durchaus Plausibel. (Info: laut NASA kann man tatsächlich bis zu 80 sek. ohne schutz im Weltraum überleben.)Der Tot von Snoke war vielleicht ein wenig früh aber wenn es um den Brauch der Sith geht (schüler tötet meister) hat es genau DAS gebraucht um die Ausbildung von Kylo abzuschliessen!Was auch zeigt wie mächtig Kylo sein kann, er hat snoke die ganze Zeit falsche Gedanken vorspielen können! Das ""Duell"" auf dem salzsee war doch schon seeehr verwirrend und da hatte ich doch 2-3 WTF momente hintereinander, dass hat mmn. die ganze stimmung des films ein wenig geschadet.",1
3495,"Is it the best Star Wars film ever? Probably not, but it does at least match 'The Empire Strikes Back'. I do feel I'll need to see it again to take everything in and not watch it while tired, but overall I left the screen quite pleased. Rian Johnson creates a strong and unique work, and while I can see some things annoying some fans but the movie takes bold steps and it mostly works. As far as cast goes, everyone is quite strong. Adam Driver really gets to come into his own as Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley seems more comfortable as Rey and has some struggles to overcome this time around and it makes her a more compelling hero. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are the best version of Luke and Leia that they've ever been, strong characters worn down by years of struggles, fighting and loss. Oscar Isaac deserves a particular shout out, his Poe Dameron becomes an essential but reluctant leader and he shines as the naive trigger happy star pilot who needs to learn about making the tough call and you can see they realise how he was wasted in 'The Force Awakens'. I won't start stating what I disliked as it may run into spoiler territory and that'd be unfair on anyone who hasn't seen this film yet, but it's more that there was a number of small issues that added up to be annoying rather than one big thing and in the grand scheme of the film, it still comes out looking pretty good.",1
3496,"Rian Johnson directed a awesome film...  I would give it an 8 out of 10 but there are so many 0 dark side reviews- (the film definitely doesn’t deserve a zero) I need to balance out the negativity.  Great twist, turns and fun.  Not what I was expecting.  It kind of had a mix of old films and the prequels. (which might be where bigot negativty comes from, ).  Look forward to Episode IX",1
3497,"The Last Jedi is considered to be the most divisive star wars movie of all time and I totally understand why the Older Fan base hates it but that doesn't mean the movie is complete garbage. Honestly for me Its definitely one of the greatest star wars movie ever made. This isn't your typical star wars movie its more than that. The movie well structured story with excellent performances and stunning visuals which will prolly go down in the books as the greatest.This movie takes risks like no other big franchises do , The bold choices and different direction the future movies go through is something very unique and innovative . The light saber duals look gorgeous with wide angle shots and the only issue I had is the story arc of Finn and Rose which ruins the pacing of the movie, Apart from that this movie is perfect .",1
3498,"I feel almost compelled to jump into this dumpster fire of a fan reaction to throw in my 2 cents as to why I feel this is one of the best Star Wars movies that has been released to date.Got your attention?  Good.What the Last Jedi does better than any other Star Wars movie is completely rip off the cliche clothing and step forward into undiscovered territory by making this a story about a collective, instead of a story about a few individuals putting the galaxy on their backs.  The First Order is not about one old evil man with ridiculous powers.  It is not about 1 apprentice hell bent on world destruction.  It is not about one girl with extraordinary powers.  It is not about one General who never makes a mistake.  It is not about a heroic pilot who can do no wrong and every plan works without fail.  This is how Star Wars has been throughout its history.  Have a galactic problem?  Sure, let the Jedi handle it.  Hell the Old Republic was all about letting the Jedi "" keep the peace "" throughout the galaxy with their immense strength.  Anyway, this movie sheds all that.  Poe is a fantastic pilot who could perhaps on his own take out a Star Destroyer, but he makes failed choices and lacks true leadership.  As Leia says, he is a Hero, but not a Leader.  His actions destroyed the bombing fleet, got dozens of people killed and in the end didn't do much but destroy a Dreadnaught, something the First Order has more of and will simply make more of.  So in the end, that action that cost lives, did nothing.  Finn is not just a super soldier who's every plan comes to fruition without fail or consequence.  His idea to pack up his things and try to jettison an escape pod, a simple enough task, is foiled when Rose catches him and tasers him in the throat.  Then when they try to put together the perfect plan to best the First Order and save the Fleet, it fails because they trusted a man only interested in money, on nothing but faith that he wouldn't stab them in the back.  Plan failed.Snoke is not just Palpatine 2.0 as fans wanted him to be.  He wasn't some evil man in a chair whos every ambition becomes reality and every whim comes to fruition.  He trusted his legacy into a little kid who was already emotionally troubled by his past.  Than this old man ridicules his apprentice throughout the movie expected no retaliation.  His own arrogance pushed him to believe his vision of the future so solidly that their was no alternative, like the saber being drawn and struck through was not Rey's body but his own.  He could not see a future where his apprentice turned on him and killed him for his own ambitions.  As Snoke says, "" I cannot be defeated, I cannot be killed "".  He was an arrogant old man, who deserved what he got.Luke Skywalker is not the legendary grandmaster jedi that we all wanted him to be.  He was a broken soldier with a heavy heart and mind due to his own failures in attempting to train family and others.  He did not have the knowledge in all aspects of the force to stop his students from being tempted by and turned toward the Dark Side.  How does one handle such a thing?  He isn't the be all end all soldier who would return to the fight and stop all from happening.  He couldn't be.  What sort of Galaxy would be left behind if they all looked toward one person to do it all for them?That is what I love about this film.  It works toward building a collection of characters and ideals that when put together form a solid foundation, not built on a single hope, but a group effort and desire to be better.  That is the idea of this film, and one that is absolutely nailed from start to finish.  So many twists, so many nostalgic moments.  The acting is much improved from TFA, the battles are much improved.  Really this is Star Wars grown up and bursting out of its shell of endless Cliches.  I love the new direction, and cant wait to see how this Saga ends.",1
3499,"Great chapter in the SW saga. Not sure why the hate for this outing, except that people hate change. Pay the naysayers no mind and see this movie. Though the movie is probably an 8 or a 9, I'm giving it a 10 to balance out all the 0 and 1 ratings which are complete BS, IMHO.",1
3500,"It was great. It was surprising, thoughtful and deep. It has one of the best lightsaber fights in the entire franchise, a starship moment that made the entire audience gasp, creatures around long enough to be cute but not get annoying, characters who made big decisions instead of having the plot happen to them, and stakes that haven't felt as high since the Empire Strikes Back.  I agree with the professional critics, and I don't get the dislike of this movie.  Just because you don't like what happens is not a reason to hate the movie. People didn't like that Han was frozen in carbonite, either.",1
3501,"I think people who review popular movies, both negatively and positively are somewhat of an echo chamber. I recognize the storylines outside of Rey, Kylo, and Luke were pretty average. That's why I wouldn't review it 100%. Cinematically this was one of the most gorgeous films I have ever seen. The main storyline being equally incredible was enough for me to find this move excellent enough for a 9/10.",1
3502,Best most cohesive Star Wars movie ever. Everything fit into the one larger singular theme about letting go of the past and learning from your mistakes.,1
3503,"One of the best Star Wars movies ever made. Period. If you grew up with the original trilogy on VHS, then this is the film for you. It lived up to and surpassed the hype.",1
3504,"Mimo kilku kiepskich pomysłów, film jest naprawdę bardzo dobry, wiele zaskoczeń, bardzo dobra gra aktorska. Niestety postać Rose, tak samo jak wątek w kasynie jest słaby.",1
3505,"The Last Jedi is definitely a surprise for the Star Wars franchise. It's light-hearted and both uncomfortably dark. Though I had problems with the pace of each sub-plot, the payoff is inevitably grand. Luke and Rey's story takes a hard turn against expectation and Finn's subplot is magical and somewhat philosophical, but fails to serve any importance to the end of the film. I think a joke or two less would keep a steady balance to the tone of the film, but all in all the themes of leadership and love evoke some nice messages.Star Wars - The Last Jedi: B+",1
3506,"Rian Johnson walked the SW franchise off the cliff where Jar Jar Abrams has placed it with TFA. TLJ is superior to TFA. It is far, far from perfect, but no SW film ever was. Yes, there is abundance of silliness (Leia floating in space taking the prize for perhaps the most ludicrous moment of perhaps the entire franchise), but unlike TFA, this one dared to take risks and has managed its characters far better (both new and old). With Abrams in charge of Episode IX, the franchise is still not safe from ruin, but with this TLJ it gets to live another day",1
3507,"I enjoyed this film, I can see some elements of the film are driven by Disney... And it has some flaws but compared to the TFA which was a remake of a new hope this film took risks and will ultimately move the saga forward. Couple of gripes benicio del toro merely appeared for a redemption cameo in the next film, and snoke I am sure isn't actually dead etc...",1
3508,"I think how you react to this movie depends on what you want from your Star Wars. If you view the original trilogy as a sacred text which must be revered, cherished, taken seriously, and adhered to faithfully I can't imagine you will like this movie and I highly recommend ending your Star Wars experience with Return of the Jedi.For me however the force was both mystical and mysterious. The galaxy was wacky and fantastical. And this movie goes between both fun and intense. Ultimately I think that's the spirit of the original movies even if it decides to push forward beyond exactly the scope dictated by those movies. See this movie if you want a fun Star Wars adventure that decides to continue to develop both the protagonist and the galaxy of the originals.",1
3509,"I saw the original trilogy as a kid and loved episode 7. The Last Jedi was so thrilling that my jaw inadvertently fell open a couple of times. Incredibly energetic, inventive and full of surprises, this was like a dream come true for a fan like me. I cannot wait to see it again!",1
3510,"Having seen The Last Jedi twice now, I can say that each viewing I left the cinema with a different feeling. On my initial viewing I felt conflicted and unsure of what I had just seen, and couldn't decide whether I enjoyed the movie or not. I believe this came down to expectations on what I thought I would be gaining from Episode VII and what the film actually delivered. Upon my second viewing however, I left the cinema feeling satisfied and excited with the new unexpected direction. for a 2 and half hour movie it certainly flies by and rarely loses its pacing, the plot isn't without its flaws though but it is greater than the sum of its parts, it delivers some amazing visuals with one scene being especially jaw dropping. the acting is also top notch, with strong performances particularly from Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Andy Serkis. it is a very well constructed film and a fine addition to the Star Wars Universe 8.5/10Edit: I want to address the 0 scores people are giving, i don't care how old you are, whether you are 10 years old or 50 years old. Show some goddamn maturity!! i understand if you didn't enjoy the plot, that is fine, no movie will please everyone. but try and at least acknowledge the skill that has gone into the special effects, or the music, or the acting, or even the set design and costume design. You cannot sit there and tell me all of those things plus more are representative of a ZERO score, go ahead and subtract points for a story you hated i don't care, but show some objectivity and give it at least a 5 for all those aspects I've stated as they were executed with so much skill and expertise.",1
3511,"This movie is everything I wanted it to be.  It is really enjoyable, with epic moments, conflict, good character development , great (AMAZING) soundtrack, some of the best fan-service I’ve ever seen (goose bumps) ... I really had a blast! Does it have flaws? Yes, of course! The movie tries to be funny a little too much and the second act with Finn and Rose drags a little... But in the end you leave the theater with a BIG NERDY SMILE!",1
3512,"The movie was diffent of what i was expecting,TLJ was no ESB, but it was awesome nonethless!  Rian dared a lot in this movie, but by no means he ""destroyed"" the SW we know and love! Chill a little people, ****",1
3513,"'The Last Jedi' finds itself as perhaps the most polarizing installment of the Star Wars franchise since 'Return of the Jedi,' with die-hard fans either dwelling too much on the bad parts of the script, or obsessing too much on the good.  The fact is, the film gets more right than wrong, and even features some of the best sequences of any Star Wars film, period.It's largely the first half of the film that suffers.  There are times when the comedic relief falls flat, or perhaps shouldn't have been attempted in the first place.  It's also the first time that the ""Disneyfication"" of the franchise feels quite apparent, with softer storylines, muted violence, and cuddlier creatures.  I, for one, could readily punt one of those Porgs off a cliff into the ocean and not feel guilty doing it.However, there's good reason why Disney has decided to hand director Rian Johnson the keys to the next Star Wars trilogy.  He's managed to successfully blend the commercialization of the 'The Last Jedi' with the tradition and lore of the larger franchise.  Furthermore, his action sequences are quite riveting (and two in particular are insanely good), his color palettes throughout the movie are visually stunning, and the musical score is rather delightful.As a result, 'The Last Jedi' notably serves its purpose as the middle child in this latest trilogy, tying up all of the loose ends from 'The Force Awakens' while setting up the next film for a fresh take on the Star Wars universe.",1
3514,"This movie was great.  Easily one of the best of the series.  The fanboy negativity is mainly rooted in the movie not meeting their theory expectations or them putting too much weight into the importance of secondary characters.  - For example, Snoke.  Why does anyone give a crap about this Palpatine clone?  He was one of the main issues of the original, IMO.  Just a typical overpowered CGI ""evil"" baddie.  No layers to him.  We've seen this trope in essentially every Super hero movie of the past decade.  I'm over it.  His backstory is irrelevant.  You nerds will no-doubt have the unnecessary blanks filled in with comicbooks.- Got news for you - Kylo Ren is easily the most interesting/compelling movie villain we've had in a blockbuster since Ledger's Joker.  Try thinking of one better.  Closest you'll get is Loki.  Adam Driver's performance is outstanding.  If you look at what his side has accomplished in the past two movies - they are absolutely laying waste to the entire rebellion.  His chemistry with Rey is undeniable.  This series comes down to the lightside/darkside clash between these two conflicted characters.  It's working.- I love Luke.  Those of you who have had expectations of Luke's post-movie career - no doubt rooted in endless hours spent reading since-uncanonized **** novels, countless extended universe comics, and several video games, did not appreciate how different this portrayal was.  Step back.  It makes sense with the story they are telling.  His role worked to push Rey/Kylo further.  It was faithful to his personality given what we know about Kylo's origin.  It was a wonderful ending, and he no-doubt will return as a force ghost later on.  There were incredible moments in this movie.  There were aspects that were certainly rough (Laura Dern's character in particular), that I suspect had a large part to do with Carrie Fisher's death throwing production a curve-ball.  The humor was on-point.  The action was on-point.  The emotional weight was on-point.  Overall, this was a phenomenally entertaining movie.",1
3515,"This is a great follow-up to The Force Awakens in that tonally it is very different. This movie is more light-hearted with well-timed humor paced into a memorable sci-fi action movie. I expected a rehash of Empire Strikes back in the sense that TFA was a New Hope rehash. Nope! Largely original. Yes there are some great easter eggs from Empire Strikes Back scattered throughout, and I cant wait to watch this movie again to find more. However, this movie is not all light-heart humor. There is narrative to develop the new characters of Rey, Finn, and Kylo that makes these characters far more interesting. I'm actually interested in what's going to happen to these characters now after Last Jedi, whereas I was just ""meh"" with them after Force Awakens. I enjoyed the direction they took for Luke's character. In fact, a lot of his story to me is an Easter Egg from Empire Strikes Back. The action sequence towards the end of Last Jedi actually made me nostalgic for the original trilogy in a way I didn't feel in TFA or even the second trilogy. I'm glad Rian Johnson is making his own Star Wars Trilogy. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next!",1
3516,"I think this movie was ok. Not great, not bad, just ok. Positives: I loved luke, leia, kylo and poe in this movieNegatives: The entire canto bight sequence was boring and rose was just dumb",1
3517,"It isn't a perfect Star Wars movie, but it is nowhere near as bad as whiny fans are making it out to be, much like The Force Awakens, I was left wanting even more!",1
3518,"A worthy addition to the franchise. Full of surprises and energy, there are a few bits that could have used more polish, but a satisfying adventure.Very pleased with their going against type and having some of the route one tactics run into complications. A lot of tropes from the previous films were led up to the edge and just pushed off.Really enjoyed the more expansive view of what the force is and how the Jedi fit in with it. I read a lot of bile in these reviews, and passionate fans have every right to spout off.  But there was no outrage in this movie for me. I’d frame more than a few scenes differently, but I like where Mr. Johnson took this.  Driver and Ridley had great performances and were an effective center to the movie.Well done.",1
3519,"Enjoyed the movie thoroughly! In my head either everything makes sense, or it leaves me wondering - and i like that. Was not a big fan of Finn ""the filler"" and his storyline, but that seemed to be exactly the part my girlfriend liked.",1
3521,"Despite the feminism undertones, I still enjoyed the movie. My only complaint would be again Rey is a **** character with no personality who is yes a Mary Sue. And also the the scene where Fin and Rose go track down the code breaker and he's conveniently in the jail they so happened to be put in. Overall though much better than the Force Awakens and some memorable action scenes.﻿Show lessREPLY",1
3522,"An awesome deconstruction of Hero archetypes and the nature of cycles. If you are interested in seeing something different which has something to say about bravado & human value, check this out. If you want exact repetition of story beats from previous movies, this is not for you.It does have a few shallow kids bits, but if you are a star wars fans you should be used to that. It's not as silly as ewoks, but it's more dumb than tatooine cantina.",1
3523,"I think this movie is being review bombed for an unknown reason (maybe because it's racially diverse? or maybe everyone hates Disney?).Regardless, this movie is significantly better than expected.What I love about this Star Wars is that it's more than a reboot, it somehow manages to keep its strong emotional connection but is full of surprises. Too often are ""bad guys"" just overly vilified as just pure evil with no reason and without showing their motivations. This movie helps to humanise Kylo Ren, which makes it far more relatable and understandable, overall making the movie far more impactful.The rebels also fail several times and things go a completely different direction to planned (e.g. wrong codebreaker, failed disabling of tracker, failure to prevent gate destroyer) which is refreshing to see, it means you can't constantly accurately predict what's going to happen and again makes it more relatable and it feels more real.Another is maintaining the emotional side and tribute to the originals, Luke & Leia reuniting is genuinely touching and Yoda coming back to help end the Jedi is very refreshing and provides closure on the old trilogy.Overall, this is a really good movie and well worth a watch, ignore the review bombing, it's a great film!",1
3524,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was one of my favorite movies on 2017, it was really fitting in the universe of Star Wars, it has everything you would expect. I saw this movie opening weekend and before all the terribly written reviews without knowing anything I can say that this is still a really good movie.",1
3525,"I enjoyed this movie immensely and I have been a Star Wars fan for 30 years. I’ve read the EU books and comics, played the story expanding games like Force Unleashed, and spent time discussing unimportant facts about the Universe. The reviews claiming that this movie betrays the Star Wars universe are strangely obsessed with the idea of having a movie that would rehash the same old Star Wars tropes from the first trilogy. They complain about time spent on developing a character like Rose and they pine for more pointless Jedi training scenes of sitting cross-legged to levitate rocks. Instead of that tired business, this film gives real screen time to establishing a new set of characters and their motives. Instead of a generic bad guy who wants to rule the galaxy for the sake of evil, you get a character with a unique conflict towards the main protagonists. It’s worth your time and I highly recommend seeing it.",1
3526,"Great film...one of the best Star Wars films. Has real heart and character and something decent to say about the protagonists and the war itself. Funny, moving, exciting....what’s not to like?",1
3527,"I am not Star Wars fanboy. I did like 4-5-6 parts (best?). I liked 1st one, didnt like that much 2-3. 7 was the worst of all for me.. to slow and I felt bored when I watched it. The spinoff was good. And this one is at 4rth place for me, after the 4-5-6 part. Great action, plot twists, yeah, there was so not needed things, small romance that was useless, naive character and one flying witch.. but with those few mistakes, there was ton of fun. 9/10But still I hate Disney for trying to steal shows from Netflix. Thou it wont affect this score",1
3528,"I leave from the theater with a strange taste and I do not finish liking. It has a lot of plot problems (a couple of ridiculous scenes like the one with Leia flying in space, the Rey and Kylo seaing each other because Snoke connected their minds, the unnescesary Finn and Rose subplot, the death of Snoke) and felt it very long. The performances are very good (especially Mark Hammil and the beautiful Daisy Ridley), the action scenes are excellent (the first 10 minutes have no waste) and the CGI as always perfect. The ""forced"" humor they criticize so much, I did not feel it at all. I really liked some of the twists, makes the movie unpredictable. Even do, I think there were many flaws in the script, so it's a 7.",1
3529,"Watch it with your kid eyes. Enjoy it like a kid does. It's a wonderful movie, with some mistakes but full of great moments and a good character evolution.",1
3531,It is way better than Episode 7 The Force Awakens. It is very creative. It is smart. It is funny. It makes you think. It gets much better with repeat viewings.,1
3532,I honestly feel the need to sign up and write a review and give this film full marks due to the mass pathetic hate this film has received. Watch this film decide for yourself if like me it's absolutely wicked. The hate is unfair and should be ignored. It might not be the best star wars film or film of the year but it's much better then most!,1
3533,"Easily the best Star Wars movie since Empire.  Though be warned, if you hate the very idea of doing something fresh with a franchise then you'll probably resort to whining on the internet about the people ruining your childhood.",1
3534,"From a technical standpoint, this is a very very well made film. It's filled with great shots, top notch scoring, some intense scenes and moments and amazing performances(Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver make this film). It's a divisive film among fans, I had to watch it a couple times and to start to fully appreciate what it was trying to do. This film isn't without it's faults: the Master Codebreaker subplot was botched and wastes Finn and Rose, Finn should have sacrificed himself at the end of the film and I still don't agree with how Luke was portrayed in the film. Nonetheless, it was a pretty good movie. Divisive, but good.",1
3535,"It took a second time to actually love this movie. There are a few things that keep it from a ten. But there are somethings in this movie that just blow me away. If you don't understand what Disney is trying to do with Star Wars then you will not get this movie. Carrie fisher dyeing is exactly why Disney is doing what they are doing. Killing off Han and kind of Killing off Luke is the point. These guys are old they cant and probably dont want to do these movies. Star wars is not easy. Even Daisy Ridley sounds like she does not want to do them. Star Wars Fans are crazy and probably annoying. We make it rough on these actors. I didn't like flying Leia and maybe a little too much comedy maybe. I say maybe because I did laugh at some things. I dont like the fact the they did two David and Goliath parts in this movie. I mean the Rebals have now destroyed Starkiller base, A Dreadnought and now Snokes big ass ship. Enough with this crap. To be honest If I could just watch the Jedi Sith stuff This movie would be a perfect score. The interactions between Luke and Rey, Then Rey and Kylo then Kylo, rey and Snoke. Then Kylo and Luke were just perfect. And ""Yoda knocking some sense into Luke was awesome. There are some holes in this story that are just plain lazy writing and that is what knocks this to an 8 out of ten. But this is a great movie and I loved it and want to watch it again and again.",1
3536,"The Last Jedi was great. It has a clear theme and isn't beholden to the huge extended universe. Beautifully shot with some genuinely great work from everyone not named Benecio Del Toro (the stutter is so, so unnecessary, man). It's about making your own future/way in the world without following the playbook set forth by your parents and everyone that came before you. Just like Kylo Ren, the movie is a bit like an angsty teen: brash, unpredictable, impulsive, and sometimes a little confused. Above all, it's something Star Wars hasn't been since Empire: risky. The movie isn't perfect and won't survive the scrutiny of the Reddit crowd, but that's fine. Viewers would do well to take Luke's advice: Breathe. Just breathe.",1
3537,"In defense of The Last Jedi:This movie is unpredictable and unlike any Star Wars film to proceed it. Yes, there are elements of the movie that at first seem out of place for a Star Wars film. The Force is used in new ways. You can even say the Force and its many forms (and its divisiveness) are the star of the film. There are many plot-points and none have the ending the audience is prepared for. The film movies quickly, yet it is the longest in the franchise. Most noticeably, Luke Skywalker's story ""does not go the way you think."" At first, all of these unprecedented changes come as a shock. That may be unsettling for Star Wars fans that feel the franchise must fit in a box. For everyone else, this movie is everything Star Wars should be: funny, unpredictable, filled with family drama, mystic, and inspiring. This movie will be debated as long as Star Wars is a main staple in popular culture. But it should be watched, reflected on, and remembered for bringing new life into one of the longest lasting sagas in cinema's history.",1
3538,I think this movie checked all the boxes.  It both honored the old material and laid the ground work for new stories.  There were many scenes that were visually striking and almost every role was exceptionally acted. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
3539,"""This is not going to go the way you think""That line right there basically sums it all. When you predicted everything that's going to happen, then suddenly get the carpet pulled underneath at the last minute. You either like or dislike Rian Johnson choices, but at least it's going in a new direction and not another remake.As Kylo Ren put it: ""Let the past die""What I love about 'The Last Jedi' is how it doesn't care what you think about 'Star Wars. While not insulting you as the audience. Taking fan theories or the mystery 'Force Awakens' stet up, and shut it down completely. Instead, what we get is a bold message about are our places and where to find hope.   Rian Johnson absolutely kills it with his direction. Perfectly framed shots and the magnificent cinematography, made the overall experience something to remember for a long, long time. Even as I'm writing this, some of the imagery has implanted into my mind. Beautiful, yet menacing with the dark side creeping in. Performance and characters all around are great. Oscar Isaac character (Poe) has such a fantastic character arc in this movie, that even he learns from his cocky attitude or quick thinking from deadly situations.Both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are the main dynamics of the film. The scenes with Rey and Kylo are the most captivating elements of the story. A balance of light and darkness shown in their characters. Is Kylo Ren emo? yeah, if you like. Compelling villain? YES. You see good in him from Rey's point of view, but also darkness from Luke's.This is the best I've seen from Mark Hamill. You'd think he will portray an old mentor in the shadow of Alec Guinness and Yoda. However, that isn't the case. You see Skywalker has given up on the force and wants nothing from it. Becoming a shadow of himself. Heck, he barley trains Rey, and that alone doesn't matter. Seeing him on screen gave me on all happinesses in the world.Sound design, costumes, visual effects, and the lightsaber fights are all top notch. The biggest issue I've heard from people is the casino scene which didn't bother me. The film itself didn't drag, for me. As the runtime feels justified for something like this.Now for problems: Some CGI scenes looked a bit unfinished, which is mostly green screen backgrounds. Other than that, the effects look pretty great.  I didn't buy the ""love triangle"", with Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Even Finn was just as surprised as me when this was suppose to be a thing. I rather see a relationship with Poe and Finn, than Rose. Or just be friends.While I praise the film for taking bold choices, but it never fully goes for it. A lot of fake outs deaths that afterwards made me wish it actually happened. It's tonal inconsistency. One minute it's funny, then the next it's dead serious. The humor isn't as awful as people have said. Unfortunately, it doesn't help that characters are jammed packed and didn't need to be there. And Captain Phasma is still the most pointless character ever. Overall rating: Despite it's flaws, the force is strong with this one.RIP Carrie Fisher, Our Princess",1
3540,I genuinely can't understand why fans are reacting this way. The character development takes center stage and there are some really resonant moments. It has shaken things up after TFA and now I have no idea where it's going. I feel that people will eventually look back on this film much more favourably.,1
3541,A great addition to the Star Wars saga apart from the Finn and Rose subplot the movie was great from start to finish. The however the forced humour was way over the top.,1
3542,"Star Wars elitists are very unhappy.   I'm not one of them.   While it did borrow a lot of it's feel (and a little of it's plot) from the Empire Strikes Back, the main arc of the story was great.  The side-plots were serviceable.   I left feeling some closure to the old guard.  Seeing Carrie Fisher's last performance was worth the price of admission alone.  Her brief scene with Mark Hamill left it's mark, and more importantly it passed the torch to the new generation.   It somehow made The Force Awakens better.  There were some questionable decisions made on how the Force works - and even though it's explain still in simple Yoda like terms, I left the theater thinking the Force is as mysterious as ever.   Looking forward to the final part in this trilogy, much better than the prequels.  I rank this film #3 on my list of best Star Wars,  my favorite episodes in order:  Empire Strikes Back, Rouge One, The Last Jedi, A New Hope, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, Attack of the Clones, Phantom Menace",1
3543,"It's flawed in a couple of places, mostly some pacing in the middle where we have our trio run off to get a macguffin. But I loved it, hit all the star wars notes without relying on nostalgia. It was nice to see a continuing trend of ladies being more than damsels in distress.",1
3544,"Rian Johnson delivered a big, bold & beautiful Star Wars film. Loved every minute of this film, and thought Mark Hamill delivered his greatest live action performance. Visuals were strong, characters much better fleshed out than in TFA and the story was suspenseful, touching and surprising. Not sure what film some of these other SW ""fans"" saw, but for my money The Last Jedi is the BEST Star Wars film since Empire. Look forward to seeing it again next week. May the Force be with (most) of you. ;)",1
3545,"The Last Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars films. I really appreciated the way the film grapples with themes of disappointment and failure. It would have been really easy to make a Star Wars movie that pandered to exactly what fans and mainstream audiences wanted to see (arguably, The Force Awakens does that a bit too much), but I don't think that would have made for a compelling narrative. Sure, there are flaws with the plot of The Last Jedi, but none are so overwhelming that they overshadow the central point of the movie: we must learn from our failures as much as our successes, our weaknesses as much as our strengths. I thought Rian Johnson communicated an emotionally and philosophically complex story that really delivered. If you've grappled with grief and disillusionment in a serious way, this may be your favorite Star Wars film. I know it's one of mine. Thank you, Rian Johnson, for making a Star Wars film that was so different from and better than my expectations. I look forward to your future Star Wars films!",1
3546,"While the movie isn't perfect, I'm giving it a 10 because of all the whiny man-babies on the internet who can't handle a freaking Star Wars movie that doesn't cater to all their childish whims.The movie itself is very entertaining, but too long.  That Leia Scene is really corny, and Finn is utterly useless and he's only in the movie to sell toys.  Everything else is great.",1
3547,So many fanboys on here are hating on this film. While no movies is ever perfect I think these negative comments seems a little bitter or sour. It was an entertaining movie that shifts the series in a new direction. I’m excited to see where it ends up. Are there still many questions that we all have? Yes there might be but I’m excited to be along for the ride. Rian Johnston tried to shift gears into something new while The Force Awakens was more nostalgic.,1
3548,"People complained TFA was too derivative of the original, now people complain this one's too different. I liked it. I'm not entirely happy with the treatment of Luke Skywalker, but I'll get over it. The most amazing thing about it is it leaves us not knowing what's going to happen next, which is quite an accomplishment for a 40-year-old franchise. I'm surprised people found the humor off-putting; the humor is much funnier than previous films and makes sense for the characters.",1
3549,"*** This movie hurt, but it was good. I really couldn't tell where it was going, and that was amazingly refreshing for a Star Wars film. Granted, it wasn't perfect. Some of the writing felt clunky (but really, clunky writing is as much a part of Star Wars as lightsabers?) some of the jokes were great, others felt forced. It felt like the film was overstuffed, too many characters, too many sub plots. The Last Jedi would have been a stellar eight episode tv series, too bad. But still awesome. Loved where they took Luke, loved everything from the island (especially that last bit with the fire). But more than anything, I love that fascists hate this movie. It makes me love this movie SO much more. I'm giving it an extra point just for this.",1
3550,"Amazing, one of the best Star Wars movies yet. No, it may not have been what you were expecting and it may not have had a lightsaber fight. Anyone who gives this a negative review is simply mad that they didn't get the movie just the way they wanted. There were some weak elements but the pros far outweigh the cons.",1
3551,"Some people are as salty as the surface of Crait. I, however, thought the movie was great. Pretty mindblowing twists and combat scenes. There is a lot to process and I'll need to watch it again.",1
3552,"I think everyone is being too hard on this movie. I'm an avid Star Wars nerd, and this movie hasn't changed that. Yes, this movie isn't The Empire Strikes Back, but we knew that coming in. It was an awesome movie! I left the theater smiling. It met most of my expectations, without spoiling things, which were just small details that don't take away from the experience. If you disliked the movie, you're not a real Star Wars fan. It was a worthy installment to the series, one I'd love to watch again and again. It leaves the door open for J.J. (better director imo) to take it home and make an awesome finale. In short, yes, this may not be as good as The Empire Strikes Back, but it was never meant to be. These movies aren't remakes of the original trilogy, but a continuation. ""Let the past die"" perhaps..?",1
3553,"Okay, I've seen it. Like many others, my expectations were high. It did help that the marketing campaign didn't reveal any real spoiler. I didn't know what to expect going in. And I was pleasantly surprised. I got something unexpected, I got some serious 'WTF?' moments, but in a good way. Rian Johnson's direction is impeccable, and his choices are bold. I hear, here and there, people screaming that he has betrayed and butchered beloved characters... I'm pretty convinced that those were the same who would be outraged that the Force Awakens would play it too safe and use the same tropes as A New Hope. You can't have it both ways, people. Either you want something new, and you have to admit that things can go in an unexpected direction, or you don't want anything to change, and then you don't get to complain about 'carbon copies'. I, for one, am glad Johnson took risks, changed the game and the stakes. And nothing in what I saw felt like a betrayal of any character or the universe.I loved that movie. I rank it in my top three Star Wars movies, with Empire and a New Hope. And I rank it my top movie of the year.",1
3554,"The Last Jedi was a great watch! I was gripped by the story and really couldn't guess where it was going.As could be guessed, it had brilliant and beautiful shots and top notch sound. But I was genuinely impressed with character motivation/progression and character design (so many funky Aliens and critters to marvel and/or laugh at).The film had some fan service as per The Force Awakens, but had a completely fresh story with well placed comedic relief.I felt tension and suspense unlike any Star Wars film I have watched before and I felt real sadness near the end (should state that this is not due to a sudden plot development, but more due to the amalgamation of the themes and messages of the film).Really looking forward to seeing this story develop in episode 9. I'm still fresh on this but maybe my favourite Star wars film so far - though the original trilogy have the near impossible to beat nostalgia value in their favour this film really does a good job in avoiding cliches (with the exception of one part that remains my only complaint).9/10",1
3555,"Such an amazing movie. A definite must see. It had a couple of flaws, but overall was terrific. My daughter and I will be seeing at least once more in the theater. I actually created an account to post this review because of all of the other bad reviews. Don't be swayed. See it and judge for yourself.",1
3556,Watched this movie last night. What a great film! I have no idea why it's getting such low scores. I am 40 years old and a long time fan and I loved it.,1
3557,"Its a really fun film, the family loved it. Yes its flawed but every single Star Wars is. a 7.5 rounded up to 8. I would like to have seen the film go in a different direction and I think a lot of criticism is valid but in todays era of cinema this is a solid film.",1
3558,Structural issues in the first half aside I can honestly say I loved this film. There was definitely fat to be trimmed - looking at you Canto Bight subplot - the subversion of expectation and speculation was inspired and hugely effective in my opinion.,1
3559,"I will start by saying Star Wars the Last Jedi isn't that bad of a movie to deserve a 5.5 but also it is not a movie deserving of a 9 or higher score.That been said let me start putting the things that i liked first and then i will put the ones i disliked.LIKES:*The whole interaction between Kylo Ren and Rey via of a Force bond where she was trying to make him see the good while he was trying to make her join him. It really helped in flesh out both characters, especially Kylo (he is still a emotionally unstable crybaby turned killer).*Luke conversation with Yoda was really a nice thing. Interesting enough was the fact that Yoda was able to interact with the world either by making a lighting strike the tree or by hiting Luke in the head with his cane.*The duel between Kylo and Rey against Snoke guards was really good. Amazing coreography.*Luke's display of Force mastery by the end.*The little kid using the Force to pull a broom at the end.DISLIKES*The MAIN PLOT of the movie is pretty much ridiculous: it is a stupid chase at subluminal speed because the Republic flagship can't hit hiperspace more than once for lack of fuel and because the First Order ships found a way to tail them in FLT flight. However WHY not even one of the several First Order ship's captains had the simple idea of making a short hiperspace jump to the position where the fleet trying to slowly  run away was?????* Why didn't Vice Admiral Holdo share her plan to go to the Crait planet while using the Republic flagship as bait to allow escape ships to hid in the planet?Instead she acts like a huge @sshole demanding blind obedience. Sure chastize Poe for acting out of line but at least share with all the Officers and pilots giving their lives for the fight what your plan was. Had she done that  then perhaps half of said officers and fighters wouldn't have joined a motim against her.*Luke's death by the end was really stupid, why not finish that scene with just him looking at the Sun? Really unnecessary death, feels like the director was just trying to make some CHEAP shock value.*Snoke is a joke. All powerfull but can't realize Kylo is actually going to kill him instead of Rey? That feel like a really ""screw you"" directed at JJ Abrams by Riam.*Really bad explanation to all the foreshadowing Abrams did in SW TFA about Rey's parents. Again another ""screw you"" moment from Riam to JJ Abrams.All in all STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI is a movie that has it's really good moments amid a lot of fat in the story and bad resolutions to mysteries from the previous movie.A good movie but it could have been a LOT BETTER.",1
3560,"An objectively good adventure movie, this is a disappointing film in dropping the ball on the heroes development, motivations and legacies, in favor of the development of one of the most unappealing villains in recent film history. Characters with outstanding chemistry and potential such as Finn and Rey, and arguably the most iconic protagonist of all time, Luke Skywalker, are all at the short end when The Last Jedi decides to break with their established past victories and struggles. Outstanding performances by Mark Hamill, Oscar Isaac and the late Carrie Fisher are not enough to withstand the whiplash of this film being an immediate sequel to The Force Awakens. Despite Johnson's stunning visuals and the incredible efforts of the creatures department have to show for this movie, the writing lacks the spark this saga is known for, and sets a difficult act for J.J. Abrams to follow (and fix).",1

3569,"I honestly don’t get all of the hate for The Last Jedi. I think it’s a great film and a great Star Wars film. Is it perfect? No. But it’s still a great installment to the Star Wars saga. This film answered questions that fans had but it didn’t have the answers that you were expecting. The Last Jedi had good character development, a great story, amazing action sequences, and great effects as usual. Is it as good as The Force Awakens? No but it’s pretty close to it.",1
3570,Cambia la narrativa en Star Wars sin dejar de ser el mismo de siempre. Es un paso evolutivo en la saga absolutamente necesario. Si el epVII se criticó por no innovar este se critica por ser demasiado innovador. Magnifica la evolución de Kylo Ren que se erige como verdadero protagonista de la trilogía y como malo con carácter y carisma. Un personaje más complejo que el propio Vader. Maravilloso.,1
3571,"The Last Jedi is a great addition to the Star Wars Universe its a perfect middle film for this new trilogy. To start with - Snokes Death... Rian Johnson has said that we don't have to know who he is... That would be true if it was General Hux in charge of Kylo Ren. A power hungry bureaucrat who has taken charge of the first order. Snoke, on the other hand, is an old and scarred giant figure of a deformed man. You cannot create someone like that and leave him with mystery and no backstory. We assume that Luke and Leia and every other character know who he is... But unfortunately we the audience are frustratingly left in the dark. If they had carried him on like they did with Darth Sidious (The man behind the curtain) at least we would then grow into this character and treat him with respect as the evil villain he is appearing to be and then an ultimate showdown in the 9th film.This film has given us many surprises and an interesting direction for our characters. I found it very magical in giving us more information about the force and showing more on how it's used. It felt like a Star Wars film which is always a plus and it's pointing us to the next generation of Jedi. The next Return of the Jedi. I just felt there was a lot of ""showing"" but no explanation for why or how! for example... Leia flying in space!I also felt that this film was more about Poe Dameron as he did feature a lot of screen time and some nice heartfelt moments with Leia. We also need to see more happen with Finn, I felt his journey wasn't as significant as the first film and his journey was more of a time filler than importance.I feel that the 9th film will be a time jump forward - Kylo will bring together the knights of Ren and build up the first order into his vision. While Rey will have progressed into being a Jedi and perhaps other Jedi are starting to appear with help from Rey. I feel like a big showdown will happen between Light and Dark. Only time will tell!Wouldn't it be great though if Snoke came back and then we knew he was Darth Plagueis the wise!! Maybe he needed to be set free from the body he was in and needed a new form? ""The dark side of the force is a path to many abilities some consider unnatural""It just all seems convenient that he was able to link Rey and Kylo together through the force to bring them together. I hope that there is a much bigger plan in play and he will come back!! It would give us the back story that is needed and solve a few questions from Last Jedi!! This would also show careful planning between episodes 7, 8 and 9.I can't wait to watch The Last Jedi again!",1
3572,"Starts off slow but builds up speed. Some great moments and some brilliant call-backs. Lifted probably more from Ep V than was necessary, but far far less than VII did with IV. Overall a quality star wars entry, ignore the review-bombing.",1
3573,"It took guts to make this movie. It's not more of the same. Despite growing up with some of these characters, I'm glad that they approchead this like nothing should be sacred. This wasn't Star Wars one week ago, but now it is! And If you don't like this, that's ok. But not one pearson or group gets to say what Star Wars is or isn't. Noone should be shamed for how they feel about this movie. If you think they didn't live up to the classics, then go watch them, noone's gonna ""spoil"" them (well, not anymore at least, wich is really ironic, all things considerad). And I say that having loved Force Awakens, having a poster of it It in my bedroom wall for two years now, but reconising that they played It too safe, making the plot too similar to A New Hope.",1
3574,"NO Spoiler Review: First go see this movie because there is pretty much a 50/50 split between fans and there is no review that's going to accurately tell you what side you will fall on. You will just have to see it and decide for yourself. Second, one thing most people agree on is this film is beautiful, I highly recommend seeing this in IMAX 3D. This movie was made for the IMAX 3D and I was blown away. I am of the camp of I loved the original trilogy, I thought the prequels were not that good but ok. Episode 3 was pretty good. I absolutely hated the Force Awakens and I liked Rogue One.That being said I liked The Last Jedi a lot. It has it's moments of bad lines, humor that falls flat, plot holes, and it even drags in parts but, in the end,the rest of the movie makes up for it. And when I say makes up for it I mean it is great. I went through so many emotions watching this and through most of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. I really like what they did with this movie, there are so many unexpected things and it's refreshing. Go see it and judge for yourself.",1
3575,"Very good movie! A fresh take, doesn't shy to break stereotypes and preconceptions, opens up avenues for a whole bunch of new stories. Will see it again many times to come.",1
3576,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson, will, as Luke tells Rey, ""not go the way you think"". The Last Jedi begins straight after the end of the Force Awakens and it is immediately apparent that Rian's vision for the new Star Wars is being put on the big screen. This is the most ambitious film in the franchise to date, as it settles all the fan-theories that have strangled every Star Wars fan for the past two years, by simply scrapping them, and I seriously liked it. First and foremost, all the characters, bar Han Solo, return in this epic, action-packed and emotional film, including Rey, Finn, Poe, General Leia, and Kylo Ren. After appearing briefly at the end of the Force Awakens, we finally see Luke as the old, rugged and isolated Jedi, who simply does not want to go back to what it used to be, saying that ""it is time for the Jedi to end"". We are also introduced to a trio of new characters: Rose, a maintenance worker in the resistance; Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a leading officer in the resistance; and DJ, a codebreaker and a thief. Each character, both old and new, have a shining moment, few, in particular, were visually stunning to watch, such as Kylo Ren slicing Snoke in half with Luke's lightsaber and Holdo sacrificing her own life for the escaping resistance ships by flying the command ship straight at the First Order fleet at lightspeed, silencing the film so the audience could stare in awe. The acting was the best that's ever been in a Star Wars movie, with Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa the highlights in that department. The action was spectacular, particularly as the Rey and Kylo team-up against Snoke and the rebels escaping the First Order fleet was panning out at the same time. The story arc of Rey, Kylo, and Luke was incredibly well done, with Rey planting herself as a powerful force user and Kylo apprehensive on his allegiance to the light and dark sides. The reveal of Rey's parentage I believe was very well done and came as no surprise to myself, but I'm am certain that many who were expecting something more grandiose will be dissatisfied. Admittedly, however, many Star Wars fans will find these revelations and events irritating and conflicting. One such being of Supreme Leader Snoke, who was simply a red-herring this whole time, and though his death was shocking, it was somewhat unwarranted that the Force Awakens painted him as the ultimate villain, similar to Emperor Palpatine, for then to be killed off. Despite this, the whole sequence of events spanning a short period time that led up to this moment was suspenseful and thrilling to watch, and the immediate team-up of Rey and Kylo, as well as the kamikaze of Holdo into the fleet, culminated in without a doubt, one of the greatest Star Wars moments. My other issues, some are nitpicky, include Captain Phasma, who was a wasted opportunity again, and will be known as the Boba Fett of the current trilogy; the Finn, Rose story arc was weak and the ensuing romance felt forced; how did Finn, Rose and Poe know to call Maz Kanata to find the codebreaker when only Finn had met her for barely a brief moment in the Force Awakens; and how did DJ know about the escaping rebel ships when they were captured. I know many found Leia's using the force to fly in space far-fetched (I initially found it weird), but knowing this was Carrie Fisher's last movie as Leia, it was a nice to see her using her force sensitive powers numerous times. My lowest point of the Last Jedi was Canto Bight. What was the point really? The entire plot to find the code-breaker was utterly pointless and eventuated in a total failure. It introduced nothing that was relevant to the rest of the main plot and in the end, they found a less qualified thief in Benicio del Toro's DJ. Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, despite its weaknesses in some aspects, is one of the best in the franchise, equal second with a New Hope behind Empire Strikes Back, and where many of the negativity comes from maybe because it is the least like any Star Wars movie previously. Many of the complaints are fair, but the surprises that we were least expecting made this a far more thoughtful film and its ambitious take on the universe of Star Wars is a refreshing new step.",1
3577,"Rian Johnson is not your nostalgia pimp. He's created a fun, creative, beautiful and thematically rich adventure that will challenge and subvert your expectations. Highly recommended. Can't wait for RJ's stand-alone trilogy!",1
3578,"I have grown up with Star Wars, watched the first trilogy as a kid, then the prequel trilogy as a teenager and now the new trilogy as an adult. This is the best Star Wars movie I have ever watched. It is deep, moving, political, smart, funny and it doesn't shy away from any risks. This is, of course, my opinion, but I felt like I had to come here and fight this horde of people attacking a movie that is pushing the series forward. These same people would have hated The Empire Strikes Back if it came out today. This is the best acted and scripted movie of the series and some of the dialogue will ""stay"" with me for a long, long time.",1
3579,"I personally loved Episode 8. There is one part in particular that is REALLY dumb, but other than that I thought it was a great movie. Seems most of the butt hurt comes from people being upset that THEIR fan theory didn't come true. They made something new. They didn't just recycle the same old crap into a new package. People should be happy about that, but people are ignorant. They claim they want something new, but they want the same old crap with a new coat of paint. Boo hoo haters. Just enjoy the film for the great experience it is...except for that one part...that one really dumb part. Cons: Finn still can't pull off humorIt's a tad too longThat one REALLY stupid partPros:Everything else.",1
3580,"I first watched The Last Jedi in a Real3D Format on it's UK release date 14th December 2017 and absolutely loved the movie from end to end. Quite simply I was glued & fixated to the screen and all the various plot twists & turns, smokescreens & mirrors & misdirection's, and as for the humour, it was absolutely awesome and brought back some of those thoughts & feelings I had not experienced in a movie since young childhood & The Original Movie.  So I felt that Official Reviewers throughout very many Media Realms had gotten it correct in Quality Reviews & reflected that position in there scores.  Even character & actors I had not been overly impressed with in Episode VII had really upped there performances & contributions, if episode VII set the scene in a very narrow focussed World, then Episode VIII Expands that World Massively in multiple directions.At some later point I became aware that attention was being drawn to RottenTomatoes & Metacritic Scores suggesting that Audiences are not happy blah blah blah & that the critics and so on had gotten it incorrect.What could I do? Had I been that wrong? Well I wanted to see the film a 2nd time anyway and attended a 2D screening.  Although I can cope with popular 3D, I usually between the 2, prefer 2D finding 3D effects etc.  to often be an undesirable distraction.  So on the second viewing there was less surprise, though very many details that you might miss within one sitting become apparent.  Visually the film is jam-packed from scene to scene & sequence to sequence with very many 'references' or nods to other loved films & Star Wars Realms & this is where some segments of Fan-base are falling over themselves to make idiots of themselves in the critique. You may well suggest that A DIE HARD Fan would have to have knowledge of Star Wars throughout a Cinematic Realm, The Comic & Book Realm, The Video Game Realm, and so on.  The film effectively & conclusively manages to include styles & ideas from across The Star Wars Empire or Universe, and most of the alleged 'Expert Fan' ""complaints"" actually do not hold water very well, if at all, because they are arriving from a ""PURIST"" knowledge viewpoint of cinema, or a ""PURIST"" knowledge viewpoint of comic book, or a ""PURIST knowledge viewpoint of videogames.My love for Star Wars began when I was very young, and that continued when I was 10, 20, 30, 40 - during that time period I have entertained dipping my toe (so to speak) in reading some odd comics & books and playing videogames as well as loving the Movie Series, so the wisdom I can perhaps share, is that this movie is being complained about by EXCEPTIONALLY SELFISH ""diehard"" 20 somethings or diehard 30 somethings who still want total possession & control of how they want the Star Wars realm to be for only themselves & their particular favourite realm gang or Audience Demographic.The Movie Makers have effectively made a movie that spans generational tastes & realm tasteseffectively making what I would call a REAL INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILY MOVIE that can be enjoyed by people of all tastes & age ranges and has a special appeal to the young, perhaps experiencing there first or earliest special cinema trip at Christmas, just as the Original Movie was experienced by myself and friends during our young childhoods.If you go in with dogmatic preconceived ideas as to how the movie has to be shaped & played out, then you will likely join the negativity gangs.  If you go in open minded and wanting a fresh Star Wars or indeed Movie Experience that does not follow or conform to very many ideas that you might have thought of prior to seeing the movie, then you will likely walk out with a big grin, checking your diary as to when you can see it again and finding out when it is available on DVD or Streaming Services.",1
3581,This is a very entertaining movie. Good job ! Loved how the story continuously develops in an unexpected way.,1
3582,"I think if the subplots were reduced then the movie would have been better. It jumps back and forth a lot and so much is going on that it causes the movie to drag and a lot more content should have been cut. Otherwise, it did keep me guessing though, which I enjoyed, because most Star Wars movies in general are way to predictable.",1
3583,"Star Wars Episode 8 starts very disjointed; no focus, a weak plot line with quite uneven pacing and so-so acting. As the film progresses, it becomes a roller-coaster ride of nostalgia and new ideas broiling into so layers that it almost becomes three movies in one. Controversially, I understand why the critics loved it and the fans are on edge about the new steps taken with this film. The trilogy rules are broken in this film with us fans going 'What can even happen in the third film'; and this is why I love it.",1
3584,"To hybrid quote a friend, “This is the boldest Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.” He said Return of the Jedi. My argument is that Return of the Jedi wasn’t bold because it played everything safe. This film and Empire are the only two films in the Skywalker Saga that do not play things safe. If you’re not a drooling theorist, who literally wanted Rey to be related to everyone in the galaxy, then you’re probably like me and actually enjoyed this film. It’s not a perfect movie but it does a lot of things well. All Easter Eggs aside the film does a great job of picking up right where the last one left off. It has some beautiful scenery and the best acting in the entire saga. The cinematography is fun and pays homage to some classic films specifically on Canto Bight. The sets were gorgeous as well, Snoke’s chambers have to be the coolest looking set in a movie I’ve seen in a while. I could on and on at well the film was crafted but that’s to be expected with a multimillion dollar budget. I think the best thing about this movie are the themes that have been implemented. Without spoiling too much, Disney is saying, “Anyone can be special, in a galaxy far, far away.” Like it or not, how are they supposed to continue making these movies based on actors who are in their 60’s and 70’s?I’ll admit my first go around I was very surprised where this movie went because I didn’t expect the film to go that way at all. Isn’t that why we spend $15 on a movie ticket though? Even some of the things most of the internet has a problem with... at first I was right there with the internet but after thinking about the events, in the context of the film, most of them make sense.Which brings me to my next point, saying this movie is bad because it didn’t go the way you wanted it to go isn’t a fair assessment of anything. That’s called being entitled not being a true fan. A true fan doesn’t say the movie shouldn’t be canon because they didn’t like the installment. A true fan watches, walks out of the theater, and into the next showing to better understand the film. A true fan doesn’t say that Disney ruined Star Wars because a true fan remembers seeing the Prequel Trilogy, over and over again, from 1999 through 2005 when Star Wars newbies said the same thing.This is a good film and a welcome installment to the Star Wars Franchise in my book. If for some reason you haven’t seen it yet go see it because it’s a lot of fun and it’s a good one to see in the theater. If you’ve been reluctant because you’ve heard bad things from fans remember the internet is a domino effect. Meaning that most people don’t think for themselves. They hear from someone in their newsfeed that Star Wars was bad and then they feed into it. The reason the film is sitting at 52% from fans on Rotten Tomatoes is because a fan with a following asked his followers to review bomb the movie until it was removed from the Star Wars canon. On that note I’ll leave you with this. I read an article the other day that published about a week after Empire Strikes Back came out. The article talked about how a lot of fans were disappointed or in denial to find out the Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker’s Dad. Sound familiar?",1
3585,"So Disney, I know you paid a lot of money for Star Wars but to maximize the return you don’t have to directly copy whole scenes from the original trilogy. It wouldn’t cost all that much to get a writer to come up with something new. But I guess not, so cue The Last Jedi, a mash-up of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.I can’t see how this is being touted as the best Star Wars ever. It was ok, even good in places, but not really great at all. And please please Hollywood, enough with the pale English baddies and the multiple endings.Also Disney, there’s this thing movie makers like to do, it’s called editing. You chop out the padding that perhaps the director is in love with, but isn’t necessary to move the story forward or round out the characters. However, what The Last Jedi did give us was the performance we all sort of knew Mark Hamill was capable of. Just as Harrison Ford carried The Force Awakens, Hamill was the jewel in the crown here. Well done Mark, and well-done Disney for bringing Luke back.So because fanboys love to rank these films, I’d say The Last Jedi is number four in the pecking order, below Empire, A New Hope, and Awakens, but better than all the rest.",1
3586,"The Star Wars Fanfiction lives on under the leadership of Disney's takeover of Lucasfilm and an increasingly politically Kathleen Kennedy making token gestures to make the franchise come across as more diverse, when really, if you think about it, wasn't this already there? We had Lando - who doesn't love Lando? Yet, his character did not ever come across as ""filler"" or unnecessarily added to an already large list of new characters meeting legacy characters. Well, peeps, that's exactly what this movie is though. Frankly, it's a mess, but at the least I can give it that it was entertaining and at times interesting. The problem with the characters is that it tries to build on the established cast from The Force Awakens while struggling to put the past to rest, a theme which is actually quite dominant this time, and by the credits you'll finally have a sense that Episode 9 has a chance of standing on its own legs instead of Disney's nostalgia pandering. It's just hard to see the originality that's left as something positive amidst all the cringeworthy and disservicing amounts of diversity-pandering. Characters you desperately want to love like Finn are shafted as a comedic-relief character who goes on a circular subplot full of all the worst aspects of the prequel trilogy and the tone of your average Disney Channel sit-coms, all with its own fart-sniffing jokes and white-toothed family-friendly smile. It feels ingenuine and detracts from the entire film when they try to juxtapose the actual plot development of Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren with this vapid attempt at making the movie accessible to kids. I understand it's family friendly but it comes off as needlessly cheesy and forced. As for the actual plot it starts off well in several arcs that get set up. Rey actually shows a bit more weakness, doubt and humanity but ultimately returns to her Sue self as she keeps nailing every obstacle in her first try and every scene where she struggles is set up almost without context, just like what they do with the ""mysterious"" character Snoke. It doesn't help everything somehow fits into a formulaic retread of Empire Strikes Back. That said, there's just enough few snippets of actual ingenuity and idea-making from Rian Johnson's input to make this movie somewhat worthwhile. It's very inconsistent however, and while on one hand the director/writer shows he cares about the lore and how the Force is most popularly represented (as a mythical, almost zen-like concept, NOT midichlorians or science-fact)  he abuses the concept so often in very pivotal scenes that the audience winds up laughing making it hard to figure out it these were legit attempts at doing the ""Marvel Comedy Action"" routine or just an attempt to do something novel that feels too weird. It can suck the emotion out of important scenes as much as it can pique your interest thinking it's going somewhere. Ultimately, The Last Jedi mostly turned out to feel self-serving in its novel attempts at adding something new to the canon but at the very least it seemed to finally let go of the Original Trilogy circlejerk as its final message, but then it's too bad Episode 9 is directed by J.J. ""Remix"" Abrams once again, who will certainly undo all Rian's efforts at seperating the new trilogy from its nostalgia for the past. If Rian were to direct the sequel, I would be very, very interested however.",1
3587,"A terrific film that knows how to keep an audience at the edge of their seat. It's a beautifully told story about how we deal with the past, our failures and how we can overcome and move forward. The characters grow and learn along their journey, as well as wonderful chemistry and tension between the main hero and villain. This is without a doubt the best acted film of the franchise, providing stellar performances all around. Topped with wonderful cinematography, fantastic effects, and a wonderful score by John Williams, this Star Wars film reminds us that it's important to look to the future, and not worship the past.",1
3588,"The Last Jedi is another good addition to the Star Wars franchise. It has shocking twists and reveals, good action, and a great villain. However, there are some disappointing subplots and pacing issues in the second act.",1
3589,"A great movie with wonderful character, great visual, and fantastic creativity. This is a film that will hock you from beginning to end.",1
3590,"This is the most exciting and interesting film in the Star van, which I've seen in my life. So many emotions I have never risk. about sunset, Post'pore. There are minor flaws, but they can close the eyes, because in every movie they are. I personally really liked the movie. Stable 10/10.",1
3591,"This movie is one of the best star wars movies, however it is in no way the best star wars movie. Now some people don't like the movie because of some scenes that are in the film and now thats fine not everything works in the movie however there are still some many good scenes that really work. Some story elements are amazing for example Snokes death is one of the best points because it puts Kylo Ren in command of the First order, I feel like this because I really don't think that you need a Palpatine type character in every trilogy. Now I'm not gonna spoil any more of the movie. Now there is something that the people must remember and that is you cannot instantly judge this movie immediately after you come out of the theater. 9.5 star destroyers out of 10",1
3592,"HAY DOS TIPOS DE HATERS DE THE LAST JEDI    1. Los que critican en mala STAR WARS Episodio 8 TLJ son unos frikis virgenes eyaculadores precoces, con elevada preferencia temporal, son de esos saco weas que Nintendo o  Microsoft se los viola todos los años vendiendoles la misma mierda de hace 30 años y los weones compran 100 veces todos los aparatos y juegos todos los años.    2.Los otros Haters son posers, como la película les exploto la cabeza y no tienen noción del universo SW y creen que es la historia de los Skywalker y sus amigos, se sienten decepcionados y dicen ""esto no es Star Wars"" ""Hay pocas batallas con espada láser"" ""echaron por suelo la lucha del bien contra el mal, la luz y la oscuridad"" ""Como los villanos pueden ser tan tontos y morir tan fácil"", mira poser de mierda hay un montón de novelas en el universo extendido, en una Vader lucha contra animalejos y al vencerlos se hace su líder (historia posterior a la destrucción de la primera estrella de la muerte), historias incluso de personajes terciarios, cuaternarios, incluso que ni conoces con su tinta propia, como dice el prologo ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"". Es SABLE DE LUZ y pues dime que en la Trilogía original viste mas de 1 pelea por película o de calidad, si lo que buscas es acción no critiques esta película en base a la trilogía original. ¡Ay! amigo te falta conocer la fuerza, leer sobre los primeros Jedi, mas sobre Maice Windu o a Yoda escuchar con mas atención debes. Como en el punto uno, queda una película no  seas impaciente, la trama se ha mostrado mas compleja, eso puede resultar bien o mal, los malos también se equivocan o como dice el mensaje de la película ""los buenos o los malos, solo depende del punto de vista"".",1
3593,"I really enjoyed the movie. Where episode 7 was mostly a remake, proving that ""hey, we can still make the movies you fell in love with in the 1970s/80s"", the last Jedi brings in more ideas on its own.Of course there is some stuff to nitpick (hence me not giving 10), but I was entertained and got a great star wars feeling from this movie. The casino subplot was a bit long though.I really loved Luke Skywalker as well as Rey and Kylo Ren, good acting that makes me wonder what we will see in Episode 9.",1
3594,"It's a flawed masterpiece, only for fans who are looking for a living, breathing story rather than something solidified decades ago and cast in bronze. The backlash to this movie is just Dylan going electric all over again. Fear of the new. There are definitely annoying flaws with this movie, but they can barely detract from the incredible originality, passion and style of what Johnson made here.",1
3595,"I'm really not understanding all the hate this movie is getting.Is it perfect? No of course not, but it is a lot of fun and moves the franchise is a new direction. The film is all about breaking the cycle, which I get isn't what everyone was wanting but then people complain just as much if it's too much like the past films.I can't wait for episode IX to see where they take things now they've shed the shackles of the past.",1
3596,"One of the best movies in the franchise. Rian Johnson managed to breath a much needed breath of fresh air into the movies. Amazing direction and photography, amazing acting and a gripping storyline. While not appeasing to some fans it was surely an amazing movie for everyone else and it'll surely be praised for a long time.",1
3597,"Luke was right: ""This is not going to go the way you think.""TheLastJedi will shatter you - and then make you whole again.I love This movie my review 10/10,may the force be with you always .",1
3598,"Yes, I am lifelong SW fan and loved TLJ.  Humor was clever and had many throw backs to 4-6; characters more complex - good vs evil isn’t as clear; Luke’s tortured isolation was reminiscent of his impatience in 4, 5 as well as the Skywalker temptation to the Dark side; fun, different yet honored the originals.  Spoiler: strong women upset some reviews.  Get used to it.",1
3599,"Too much forced plot twists and forced humor. But since others Star Wars movies are full of Locomia, pod racing, boring stars shots, ewoks and other things that make them not really that pleasuring to watch, this one is not the total garbage most people are saying it is.But the action scenes are so good that I really think that it kind of saves this movie. With one less hour of meaningless arcs, this would be excellent. Definitely a movie wich I will rewatch when I can skip the boring parts in the bluray.",1
3600,"I have no idea why so many people hate The Last Jedi !.So much better compare to The Force Awakens , and one of the best Star Wars movie ever !.The last 30min of the movie is so Epic and emotional.Just WOOOOOOOOOOW!.Because episode 8 is so much different to the other Star Wars movies, I love it!.Something new , and something fresh !.I love the story.I love all charaters.I love comedy scenes,and I have no problem with Rose Tico ,that many people hate her!I really like her character.She was great for sure!.All action scenes were great and special effects were awesome!.So much better compare to The Force Awakanes!(I hate that movie ;]).Too bad that the Soundtrack Music is not as AWESOME as from Star Wars The Phantom Menace ;], but even though the music still was OK!.Nothing special ;].Poeple dont listen bad reviews and bad critics.Just go and see this movie because this is one of the best Star Wars movie ever.The new Blade Runner is still the best movie of 2017 ;], but was so close ;].",1
3601,"This may be my favourite of the 3 ""Disney-era"" Star Wars films. While I didn't think it was as consistently strong as The Force Awakens, with a few strange scenes, like Luke Skywalker's daily routine on Ahch-To, I found it absolutely refreshing to see a Star Wars movie where I genuinely had no idea what would happen next. Compared to Rogue One from last year, it had the distinct advantage of not being any form of prequel, and compared to Force Awakens, it felt like it was completely unique, not rehashing anything. What this ""second installment"" gets right, compared to Empire Strikes Back and contrasted with Attack of the Clones is the theme of failure. What was missing (among a long list of things) from Attack of the Clones is the characters failing with consequences. In Last Jedi, Poe ignores General Leia's orders, and absolutely decimates the Resistance in the process. In Empire Strikes Back, Luke leaves his master behind on Dagobah and loses his arm, and almost gets his friends, whom he rushed to save, killed. Another aspect that made this movie so enjoyable to me is the ""everyday hero"" aspect of it. It's so rare in the Star Wars universe (so far, at least) to see a hero who isn't anybody special. This new generation of heroes are unique in that aspect, that Poe, Rey, Finn and Rose are, really, nobody special. But the direction this movie takes them in, especially with the ending scene of a child on Canto Bight, using the force, and looking up at the stars, is that anyone can be a hero. It is not one's bloodline or one's family name that determines their worth. Anyone can succeed, and more importantly, anyone, regardless of family name or status (such as Kylo Ren, in this film and the last) can fail. Overall, while it isn't my favourite of the whole saga (Return of the Jedi takes the crown for me), and it isn't the best in terms of the complete package (Empire Strikes Back, of course, takes that cake), it is certainly a worthy addition to the ever growing Star Wars family.",1
3602,"Great movie, i don't know why it's getting so much hate, all i see in the negative reviews are men complaining about feminism. Though the casino scene did go on for a while, i'm still giving this a 10 just to cancel out all the frustrated adult virgins.",1
3603,"This is by far one of the greatest star wars films ever made. Johnson has meticulously crafted a movie that is relatable to everyone. No longer do you just have to be special to be a force user. You can come from nothing and not be born into a special class. The refined take on the Force clarifies a lot of the oddities of the prequels. Johnson made a brilliant film that was exciting, funny, and meaningful.",1
3604,"Neither Luke nor Rey is the Last Jedi. It is Rian Johnson! He was made Star Wars universe a real universal story. This film isn't just a Star Wars movie, it's also real good film. And I think the final scene is the one of the best of the cinema history. Yeah you knew it...",1
3605,"A Great Movie! Pros:- Interesting Story- Stunning Visuals- Awesome Battles- Overall Great ActingCons:- Doesn't Feel like a Star Wars Movie- Plot Twists are a bit underwhelming (Specifically Rey's Parents)- Snoke gets killed of WAY too early!- Kylo is a bit ""weak"" in the movie (Acts like a huge baby and a emo)",1
3606,"Great start with stunning visuals, lenghty middle part with great moments but unnecessary story parts. Ending is great again but there is no ""aha effect"" (""I am your father!""). Also I miss depth in story and character design/development. There are about 90 minutes of great Star Wars movie within this 152 minute movie.",1
3607,"I was not a fan of Force Awakens due to the fact that I thought it was primarily an uninspired rehash of past movies, and had little to no focus on exposition or dialogue. I will acknowledge that this movie burned down every major plot point set up to be explored by the first movie, but I for one was greatly relieved by that fact. I'm so sick of tropes revolving around missing parents and an emperor figure pulling the strings that I was personally glad when they jettisoned those plot points in favor of something new. td;dr, IMO if you disliked VII like I did, you'll probably like this one, and vice versa.",1
3608,"Solid characters, great deconstruction of the mythos, beautiful cinematography and great performances.It has its serous flaws. Tone sometimes is all over the place, the Fin subplot is useless and there a few plot holes here and there that could be easily avoided. But GO and see the movie with open mind and focus on what is doing right. A great fresh deconstruction of the Star Wars story with an interesting theme about failure. When its good its really good.Many (not all) of the criticisms this movie is getting are completely unreasonable made mostly by fanboys complaining about things that even the original trilogy had, even though the same people consider them a masterpiece. You can like and hate what ever you want but having double standards on your criticisms is a bit hypocritical. I will now get in to spoilers. SPOILERS START HERE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>For example people complain about Snoke being a nobody and we learned nothing about him in the end. Well guess what, the Emperor was no different in the original trilogy. No information was given by the movies. The Emperor was also a pretty one not character that his sole role in the story was to highlight Luke´s and Vader´s internal conflict.  People complain about the movie adding weird things about the force. Which was what the original movies also did. Being able to create force projections makes as much sense as being able to shoot lighting from your fingers or stopping blaster fire with your palms. And in the old movies these things came out-of-nowhere. In the last Jedi it was at least foreshadowed.People also complain that Luke should never be tempted to kill his pupil and become bitter. The movie takes place 30 years after the original movies and after Luke has failed at almost everything he tried. Of course he is a bitter old man. Everyone would be. As for being tempted to do cruel things. Many times in the past trilogy he was tempted to surrendered to his emotions and almost did. But eventually he held himself under control. Just like here. It make perfect sense for the character.   That is what i mean by inconsistent criticisms. They have more to do with everyone personal expectations than actual objective flaws. And i for one, as a very old Star Wars fan, I enjoyed that a star wars movie subverted my expectations in such an interesting way. Too bad many people are too protective of their little baby of pop culture to appreciate that, liking the movie or not.",1
3609,"The Last Jedi is overlong and doesn't have enough plot to justify its length, but there are enough thrilling (and charming) moments to keep it interesting throughout. I'm willing to forgive its flaws in return for its sheer entertainment value, but as the second movie in a Star Wars trilogy it never quite reaches the heights of The Empire Strikes Back. Nonetheless, it's well worth seeing if you enjoy Star Wars in general.",1
3610,What a great movie! People complaining about this movie need to lighten up. It was a fun movie and yes it isn't a 10 out of 10 like the original trilogy. BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE 5 and 6s of the prequel trilogy.,1
3611,"Loved it - 9/10.  Thought Lukes return was excellent, the force is still strong in him.  The whole story around the end of Jedi/Sith was brilliant and almost feels like both Kylo and Luke are on the same page.  My only struggle was when the cruiser took out the Supremacy by hyperspace jump through it.... hence 9/10",1
3612,"I really enjoyed this movie, love the plot twists, photography, music and character arcs throughout the movie. It has a familiar feel but with a new air in the Star Wars universe, thus making it a refreshing take  on the classic universe.",1
3613,"I have never reviewed a film on RT or Metacritic before, but I hate to see this movie get dragged into the mud over what I can only imagine is personal preference. Rian Johnson has done something for which a LOT of SW fans have been waiting: he took a hard left at viewers' expectations for how a new entry into the saga should look, and I don't think that counts as making a film ""bad"", let alone ruining an entire saga. Without spoiling any of the surprises ""The Last Jedi"" beholds, I was excited, surprised, and often giddy as a school child throughout the duration of this movie. It's by no means perfect (very few films are, let alone SW movies), but it takes risks in almost all of the right places. If you take a moment to consider the stories, the developments taking place within the characters (however small or large these may be), and the balance between the film's levity and darkness (or shall I say, ""light and dark""? :) ), I think it's evident that Rian Johnson isn't the bumbling moron people are making him out to be. Disliking the turn of events within a film is everybody's right, and if 45% of audiences TRULY disliked these, then so be it. Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but The Last Jedi"" is not the technically awful sacrilege many reviewers (and bots) are making it out to be.",1
3614,"Unlike Episode VII, The Last Jedi is more of an original movie. As you would expect, it is full of throw backs, fan nods and thankfully more original story telling.In one hand, it is a maturing of the characters in the Star Wars universe, combining years of wisdom from those that have been part of the struggle for so long, mixed with fresh naiveity and creativity from those just getting started.This is a new movie and with it, a fresh approach. If you are expecting a rehash of the same tried and tested formula gone before you may be unhappy with the direction. However, the new approach combining the seriousness of a moment with increased slap stick humor, although strange at first, is something I very much welcome and feel gives this movie it's own sense of identity. Something Star Wars movies gone before have sometimes struggled to accomplish.The movie has it's plot twists, which are something more reminiscent of Episode IV. Your mind will be gently working throughout the movie to understand the actions of some of the characters and will keep you guessing right to the end.However it is not without it's cringe worthy moments, some of which certainly require further explanation in order for it to become palatable.In summary, this movie is a brilliant half-way point in the trilogy and answers enough questions as it proposes. Episode VIII is well placed to become another movie that can be treasured in the Star Wars universe for years to come.",1
3615,"This movie is more than a Star Wars movie, it expand the franchise in so many ways and do an amazing job updating the trilogy, all the haters here are just mad because they want something predicable and tied up to similar things that we already saw on the original movies, that they all complained on TFA. A good movie that will stay known as one of the bests on the franchise.",1
3616,"My review is largely a rebuttal to the user critics because yes, I respect you guys. The Last Jedi was a refreshing change of pace in the new trilogy that was sheer brilliance. While the Force Awakens was a disappointingly conservative complete rehash of the original trilogy, TLJ used some artistic license to make changes and take risks, and it paid off. If you are looking for a story told in an archetype fashion, you will not enjoy something so new and different. There are still recurring themes of light, dark, force, family, struggle, and balance that make this a Star Wars classic, but the creativity and change in the movie are inspiring to say the least, such as the visuals, settings, and story.Some great examples: The silent scene of Holdo sending a ship through another ship was Gravity-esque brilliant. Benicio is always fantastic, and his random inclusion in a subplot (ie NOT the master coder) rightfully shows that a story doesn't always have to follow a simple linear path. Rey's alliance becomes questionable. The story is never overly predictable, leaving many different avenues open. It also gives you a lot to think about, such as Benicio's revelation that many don't draw a simple line between good guys and bad guys.I was surprised and disappointed by the low user scores/reviews. I feel like unlike most of them, this movie had substance. Summary of bad user reviews:-Luke's character defiled (blasphemy!)I get it, it was a bit disappointing to see him not be the true master we all expected. But realize that there is no perfect character, and a temporary lapse in judgement is reasonable. Honestly, I feel like he was never really a well developed multi-dimensional character anyways, at least until now (blasphemy!)-Soulessly sets up for selling toys/games/licensingYou kidding? Have you seen the original Star Wars? Where wookies, ewoks, walkers, x-wings, planets, etc were invented? In fact, many walkers and ships were reused here, not much innovation there. And Star Wars has always been about creativity. I really appreciate the work in showing us new worlds and creatures, such as the casino planet (compare it to the original trilogy's cantina)-Silly humor in this new trilogyAgain, refer to the original trilogy (R2D2, C-3PO, Chewbaca, etc). I thought the clothes iron scene was hilarious. If you think this movie was cringy, complain about Marvel movies.-Political agenda: too much emphasis on minority/different characters, white men are portrayed badlyI can kinda see how there does seem to be some political undertones in this, but this mostly just comes off as crying to me. Surely they produced this before it became Trump's 'merica, so hopefully they will ""fix"" this by whitewashing the cast in the next movie.-Didn't like Luke milking a cow or other creatures on his islandWell how else is he supposed to get calcium? Seriously, I saw this in a number of reviews lol-Porgs == Jar JarAbsolutely absurd to compare them, Jar Jar was an important character that diminished the graveness of scenes. Porgs had a small ""role"" in only a few scenes.-Something, something, Disney/corporate defilement/cash grabPretty incoherent arguments here, can't really find a thesis behind them, but some just seem to hate Disney. They took the franchise in a different direction, move on.-Too different from original star wars, I saw/grew up with the original movies, Star Wars is my religion, I'm not ready for change, etcBingo. Can't argue with you on that, but if you want blissful nostalgia, watch TFA or the original trilogy againFinally, while I loved the movie, a few things I was slightly disturbed by:-Leia space scene was a bit of a stretch, still cool tho-Rey overpowered w/little to no training-Emperor Snoke extremely powerful but defeated very easily + who was he?-Luke wants to end the jedi, then at the end says they'll still live on?-Luke vanished :( why?! (issues behind the scenes?!)-Finn+Poe+Rose subplot seemingly pointless, but still a refreshing unexpected plot change-Still haven't seen any Jedi mind tricks! :pTLJ's theme of wiping out the past and moving on is perhaps a reflection of the nostalgia that people hold onto in justifying keeping star wars movies repetitive boring rehashes. Sorry guys, but let the past die. Kill it if you have to.",1
3617,"Rian Johnson single handedly pulls the main story arc of the Star Wars franchise out of the dumpster fire it was heading to. He took an incredibly complex plot, fraught with a lot of potentially cliche and dull as hell story possibilities and steered the series back on course. In fact, it was done over and above expectations by making amends for the previous movie sins commited in the ""Force Awakens."" While the movie was full of a few too many last minute saves it didn't to my best recollection step to the depth of paradoxal coincidence. there were one or two unexpected twists, but this is the first of the major series I've actually enjoyed (excluding Rogue One in particular) since Return of the Jedi. I am suspect that this may be a one off as I don't fully trust Disney in the least. However, you don't have to agree with me or any of the other reviewers. just take a look at the long lines at the theatres...",1
3618,"One of my favorite star wars movies of all time.  The fact that you actually see the rebellion struggling and that everything doesn't just always go the way it should really brings the world alive more than ever, adds gravity and seriousness to their plight, and makes all of it more powerful.I loved the character development and really just everything about this movie.",1
3619,"this movie is a good movie in general and a good star wars movies,most of the people that put a bad score on this i because they dont liked it just for personal reasons, objectibly talking, its a nice and well directed movie, luke last scene is gorgeous",1
3620,I loved this film.  The character development was surprising and engrossing.  The action scenes were beautiful.  highly recommend as a long time Jedi!,1
3621,I don’t understand all the backlash was a great movie!!  Rian Johnson and the rest of the film crew did a wonderful job!!  From the opening till the end it had me glued to my seat! View it for yourself and you be the judge. I thought it was a fantastic Star Wars movie!!!,1
3622,"Is the Last Jedi perfect? Nope, it sure isn't. But it is a ""good"" star wars movie. It has it's flaws, especially in the second act, however it does nothing to hurt the canon and is desperately trying to move away from the stranglehold that the fandoms love of original trilogy has on the canon. Go into it with your eyes open and you will have a good time.",1
3624,"Despite the constant railing from many hardcore fans, this movie belongs in the Star Wars universe as a way to show that Luke, Leia, and all trained in the Jedi arts, are not without their flaws.  If you stop, put your assumptions about what a jedi is or is not aside, and witness what is happening you will quickly see that the torch has been passed.  Star Wars cannot continue to be about a dark overlord who rules everything and pulls on the puppet strings of another in order to maintain his control over a galaxy.  Anyone wanting that should simply stop with the original trilogy.  What you saw here was Luke admitting a failure and trying to redeem himself with his one final act.  Leia showing the wisdom of a seasoned general, but knowing that a great leader has to trust those around her.  Rey on her own discovery to find out who she really is, only to be met by more questions, and then Kylo Ren offering to give her answers, only to end up misleading her and trying to claim power for himself.  Before you judge harshly wait until the third movie in the trilogy releases, and see what the decisions in The Last Jedi actually set into motion.",1
3625,"Hate this film with a passion do you? Are you feeling the rage boil up inside you until it explodes from your finders in an electrifying tirade of abuse? Well we all know how that is referenced in this film. Rian Johnson has created a visual marvel, an artistic masterpiece with visionary creativIty not seen since Lord of The Rings. The story is action packed, yet riddled with subtle clues that change the way you feel about the black and white nature of the force. Rian was asked to take chances, which he did and everyone has panned him for it. Nearly all decisions taken here make sense. I've had discussions with a friend who didn't like this and he explains that the space battles were pointless, the middle section with Finn was pointless and in the end everyone ends up without any real resolution. I can see his point however, I think this film needs to be seen with the context that it is the middle of a trilogy and is transitional movie. The force awakens left little of me wondering what is next. It re trod so much old ground that I felt like the next step was predictable. I'm now really excited about the next movie as Rian removes the chafe, blurs the lines between light and dark and divides opinion in such a way that speculation for the next movie covers so many more topics that it has to be unpredictable. It's my opinion an I'm entitled to it, but I'm not sure this dark hate and fury from social media is good for arguably one of the most imaginative franchises in history. Maybe next time you will get what you asked for, bland boring and predictable? Maybe mext time I'll be the one spewing hate when Luke is found alive and well, Rey is a princess and phasma wins a fight.",1
3626,"For me best STAR WARS in XXI century. I don't understand such negative opinions. We get something different and that's a problem? Johnson had courage to throw away almost everything Force Awakens did wrong and thanks to that, we can expect something new in the next episode. At last the story is fresh.",1
3627,"The Last Jedi really holds up as the most ambitious Star Wars film to date. It doesn't necessarily change anything, it just shows us that there's is more to the story than we thought we knew.Beautiful direction and editing, and my god the best lightsaber fights in the entire saga, I promise. The only problem is the pacing at times was kind of off but still was a very solid watch. Go see this, my guys.8/10 -A",1
3628,"I believe the vast amount of criticism for this film is completely unwarranted. On a deeper note, the film debates some great issues: reflection on youth in the old age, debates between good and evil, and using non-violence to succeed in a war. On a visual note, the cinematography and visual effects are absolutely mindblowing. On top of this, witty humour, cute new species, and good fight scenes are sprinkled throughout the film. As a long-term Star Wars fan, I believe this film has outdone it's prequel in the new trilogy.",1
3629,"I enjoyed the heck out of this movie. I docked it a point for a few plot holes but overall I enjoyed the story, each characters progression throughout the film and the separate journeys that they were set on, as well as the interactions between the two leads.  I thought Luke was amazing (wipes shoulder off) and MH performance was his best. I enjoyed the jokes and didn't think they felt out of place because EVERY Star Wars movie has jokes in it (Walking Carpet, I love you...I know, Nerf Herder, JarJar (hehe), etc.). Overall, I'm excited for the next Star Wars film (Solo) and the next film in the main Saga. Thanks Rian!",1
3630,"Over all I really liked this film, There were two things that I really didn't like but not to the point where they ruined the whole film.The scenes in question are the Leia death fake out and how crap Snoke ended up being. Other than this though, I loved it, all of the actors give fantastic performances (especially Mark Hamill), the old & new characters are all great and there are a lot of unexpected turns here as well. Production quality is as good as you would expect with Disney budgets and there were some very nice practical effects here too. If I have any other criticisms (apart from the aforementioned scenes) it would be the pacing, I think the fleet chase lasted too long and the film seems to slow down quite a bit during Finn & Rose's side story.  I think Rian Johnson took a lot of risks here and it has split the fan base as half of the people I know hated it half loved it. For me it's not the best Star Wars film but it's also far from the worst (remember Attack of the Clone people lol)",1
3631,I laughed. I cried. I was genuinely shocked and awed. It dared to piss off a lot of SW fans and I loved it. some fanboys didn't get the same **** all over again so there goes the **** and moaning rest assured no one hates star wars more than star wars fans,1
3632,Was it perfect? No. Did it get the job done? Yes. Were there some stellar moments of nirvana? Absolutely. My favorite scene was General Leah coming back from being ejected from the damaged bride of her ship. It reminded me that we really have no idea where The Force will show itself.,1
3633,"Not a perfect Star Wars movie, but the Star Wars sequel we needed. It dares, it moves and it has balls. I embraced some of the changes, loved most of the plot and that relationship between Rey and Kylo is simply wonderful. A relationship like we've never really seen before in the movies. Better than TFA imo. Simply because it's way more daring and packed of action and lore (old and new). It places itself between EPVI and EPIII in my mind.I recommend it and even if you don't like it, there's still and enjoyment for the lore candy and beautiful VFX (practical AND CGI).",1
3634,"It's absolutely fantastic! I've loved every single moment. Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver were wonderful. There are some less successful scenes, but the rest is amazing.",1
3635,"I am a little shocked by the haters.  To anyone saying go and watch Rogue One, that just illustrates that there are polar views abounding, because I can barely watch Rogue One.  That is a collection of characters that are pointless.  I really enjoyed most of characters in TLJ, and that combined with lots of epic moments, great space battles, some laughs and fairly cohesive story, equals a great star wars movie.",1
3636,"Not a bad movie at all, yet it still suffers from some minor flaws in the script as well as some of the decisions taken for the storyline. It holds up pretty well in terms of effects, directing, and editing. However, fans are destroying this movie simply because the nostalgia for older movies, wanting everything to remain the same, which makes sense, as in this movie everything that was built before was completely teared appart. Nonetheless, this is a storyline, and it cannot stay the same. Yes, some of the humor is out of place, but the rest of the script is well written and characters are well developed (except snoke, a simple plot device whose death did not trigger me, as I expected it to come since Kylo was always highlighted as the true antagonist). Anybody saying that the prequels or rogue one are better than this one for sure have no knowledge at all on what constitutes a good movie.",1
3638,"The Last Jedi delivers on entertaining. As a whole, a fun time at the movies. It has an excellent visual effects and an outstanding set design, a good overall story, and great musical score.  The movie drags slightly about half way through  but the first half is gripping and the movie finishes well.Could the movie been better if there was better script and Ms. Fisher, apparently ill, did not appear so lethargic?-- Yes.  But outstanding moments in the film make it a great experience at the movies. My experience was like the fun I had watching the original 3 Star Wars and the Force Awakens and unlike the disappointment with Rouge One and the prequels.",1
3639,Best Star Wars movie ever! loved the Action scenes and the casting! Best underrated Star Wars film ever seen!,1
3640,"*Spoilers ahead*The only reason I can think that people don't like this movie is that they came in with preconceived ideas of what they wanted the film to be. If you go into it with no expectations, it's one of the best movies you will ever see. The movie doesn't do what you think and in that sense is very refreshing for a Star Wars film. I love that Rey is a ""nobody"". I love Poe's plan didn't work out. I love that they didn't blow up a death star thing. It doesn't follow the Star Wars script like Force Awakens or Rogue One (the worst Star Wars movie ever made), in that theres isn't a space battle, a light saber fight, and a land battle all going on at once. It's refreshing and a must see.",1
3641,"Do the morons giving the movie a '0' not see how everyone sees them as just trolls? Even if you hated the movie there are elements like score, CGI, and acting that should at least give it a 5/10. So spare us hipsters. Let me guess #notmystarwars lmao so pathetic",1
3642,"Its has some bad parts but also some awesome parts. The reaction in the theater when Rey and Kylo team up was awesome. Probably the best fight in all of Star Wars movies ever. People went wild. When Luke stands in front of the AT-ATs was also very well received. It has some pretty cool scenes. Porgs and Crystal Foxes are great. BB-8 was great. It definitely had some awesome moments and visuals. Some of the humor was spot on. That said some aspects of this movie do not make sense if you think too much about them (Hyperdrive attacks??). Other parts such as Leia using the force look cheap and should be digitally remade / shot (She looks a bit like Mary Poppins). But as a fun film, it is pretty good. If you just want a fun movie and not overly concerned with the lore, this movie will be a lot of fun. I love Star Wars (Legends, Universe, old Canon, new Canon, etc), but my wife is not into it. Yet, she really liked this movie. I think that is the reaction of the average casual viewer.There are also a lot of things that are not what they seem and will be better understood in Episode 9.",1
3643,"Preface: I am an intelligent person who enjoys, and has studied, films for years. This movie was awesome and Rian Johnson did a great job. Anybody who thinks none of the other Star Wars movies contain their fair share of plot holes and faults is crazy, cuz they all do. This movie rips the saga out of the ""fans'"" hands and shows that Johnson had all intentions of making something original and his own. I love the lack of generic star wars tropes. It feels new and different and I love the he'll out of it for those reasons. Wish Johnson was doing episode 9, I'm afraid we might get a reskinned return of the Jedi with JJ. Regardless, Johnson made the sky the limit with the future of this saga and I'm super pumped about it.",1
3644,The best Star Wars film since Empire. Totally worth seeing the movie. I am a huge fan or Star Wars and this movie made my fan boy sqiuee with glee....great acting great writing...It's great to see Luke Skywalker have more depth.,1
3645,"A terrific and bold film. It certainly brings the franchise towards a new, and maybe better direction.",1
3646,"The Last Jedi is a fantastic and fascinating film that stands with the very best in the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson pulled off an amazing feat: create a film that feels quintessentially Star Wars while also introducing fresh ideas and pushing the story (and the whole universe) in an exciting new direction for old and new fans alike. The highs in this movie are as exhilarating and powerful as many of the best moments in the original trilogy, with a few scenes and images that are more beautiful and breathtaking than anything in the Star Wars canon. There are at least 3 scenes that made me gasp, and a half dozen images/scenes that are permanently embedded in my movie fan memory bank. It's also funny, balances dark/heavy elements with light/fun moments, does a great job of establishing new geographies and critters in a seamless way and, best of all, it's unpredictable. This is not going to go the way you think.Ignore the haters. There is a small percentage of entitled, nutball fans who are trashing this film because it doesn't bow to the tyrannical, whiny 11-year boy inside them. Of course, the movie isn't perfect, and there are a few things here and there that I had considerations about, but these are nothing compared to the power and impact of what this film does well, and the huge themes that are at its foundation. To me, The Last Jedi immediately ranks no less than 4th overall behind 1) Empire Strikes Back, 2) A New Hope, and 3) Return Of The Jedi. And after I view it a few more times, it might be tied for third or possibly take over 3rd place completely. Ignore that tiny fraction of loudmouthed fanboi haters, go in with an open mind, and have a blast. I'm already looking forward to Episode IX, and I can't wait to see what Rian Johnson does with the 3 brand new Stars Wars movies (outside the Skywalker saga) that Lucasfilm has asked him to create. Exciting time to be a Star Wars fan.",1
3647,"Spoilers ahead:Have you ever had that one brief moment of weakness, that one action, that ruins a relationship cultivated over years?  Have you ever wanted to give up or been disillusioned?  Many of us who have lived a life full with ups and downs, joys and regrets, can see ourselves in this Luke Skywalker.  How could one live up to the hype?  The victor over the Emperor, the destroyer of the Death Star -- evil was supposed to have been defeated.  What if one moment of weakness brought back everything you had worked so hard to achieve?As we grow older, we can be consumed by regret; Luke Skywalker, in the end, does not succumb to apathy and withdrawal, but confronts the evil posed by his nephew in a way that befits the one who defeated the Emperor -- he truly is a Jedi, like his father before him.   He does not have a moment of violence, like Vader in Rogue One, or even Yoda in Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones.  No, he stays true to the light.  Even if he was there in person, I believe the fight would have gone exactly the same way.   The defeat of the good guys leads to a new resolve, and the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.And for everyone complaining about Leia: Yoda said, ""there is another Skywalker"".  She knew that Luke was alive after DS2, she heard him through the force in ESB, she resisted Vader's interrogation (which uses the force, even Luke couldn't hide the truth about Leia from Vader).  It is obvious that she's very force sensitive.One of the best Star Wars ever...",1
3648,"Excellent movie, overall- I wasn't a fan of everything that happened but I commend the director for taking risks and a new direction. I'm a huge fan of SW in general and nothing will probably ever beat the original trilogy but I support the franchise reinventing itself to a certain degree. This movie is unpredictable, exciting, visually stunning, original and clever. The humor is a 50/50 hit/miss for me - some of it feels forced, some of it is perfect.There's a lot of backlash and hate going around atm; I can understand people scratching their heads at some of the events and twists in the movie and I also have unanswered questions, however, the level of vitriol is simply not justified. If you're giving the movie a rating of 0/10 and saying it's the worst movie ever then you're clearly having an irrational emotional tantrum like Kylo Ren - search your feelings, you know it to be true.It's brave new world for Star Wars and I'm excited to see what happens in ep IX.",1
3649,"Unique take on the franchise. Watched it three times. I'm liking it more and more each time I see it. Watch reviews for questions you may have after seeing it, some of your questions will be answered. Not every moment was great though.",1
3650,"I genuinely can't get my head around the amount of hate on this review page. The Last Jedi is built around its characters and gives each of them satisfying arcs helping them grow as people. That forms the core of the movie and everything on screen ties into one of those arcs. MINOR- SPOILERS AHEAD Finn goes from a selfish deserter to someone willing to give his life for the cause. He learns the wider context of what he's fighting for by seeing the inequality on Canto Bight. Poe goes from a hotheaded 'hero' to someone who is truly starting to understand what it means to be a real leader. Rey and Kylo go from lost children unsure of their futures to committed adults ready to give everything to what they believe. They lose their respective mentors and now have to come into their own. Luke has a great arc from the reclusive cynic to the hero the galaxy needs after a pitch-perfect lesson from a fan favourite character- 'failure is the greatest teacher of all'. It's these arcs that hold The Last Jedi together and make it a rewarding film first and a fun Star Wars movie second. Throw in some standout performances and spectacular action and this is definitely a solid entry in the Star Wars series. By no means is it perfect but to say 'it's worse than the prequels' or 'Disney have ruined Star Wars' is completely unfair.It's not going to be for everyone but as a huge Star Wars fan since the age of 6 (when I first saw ANH on its re-release), I was in no way disappointed and neither were the group of 7 fans of various ages and viewpoints that I saw it with.You'll have to see The Last Jedi for yourself to make up your mind but it would be a shame if this is the film that causes a real split in the Star Wars fandom, I guess time will tell.",1
3651,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was important that Kylo was more complex than just a big bad guy. He needed depth. The traditional good vs bad is way too simplistic for our time. Case in point who is the villain in the justice league movie (no one remembers or cares)? Which also btw has a higher user rating score than this! Come on people! Even if you didn't love it (and it was great imo). This movie is not a 0-1 score!! There can be a middle ground! Please compare it to other movies and score it fairly, even if you didn't love it!",1
3652,"I wonder if those people who complained that Episode VII didn't dare anything new are the same who now scream because Episode VIII defies expectations. Yes, this movie feels different from other Star Wars movies. And if you tune down your fandom, your despair because all the fan fiction didn't come true, and take a step back and look again with an open mind. you'll find a film that takes a radical and modern look at religion, at Lucas' pathos of family and the ""force"" and declares a lot of it as the mumbo jumbo it always has been. You cannot have watched the prequels and hope for the Jedi to come back like that. Ever. This film is the beginning of a new rebellion and it rightfully starts with its own in the Star Wars canon.",1
3653,"This one is absolutely perfect, much better than the previous The force Awakens, and the best of the three trilogies so far. Acting is incredible, and the story is breathtaking! A pure perfection to be seen more than once in a movie theater.",1
3654,"I loved every moment of The Last Jedi. As a long time SW fan, I was hoping to be shocked by the unexpected, and I truly was. The plot is relatively simply: The remnants of the Resistance are seeking to escape The New Order and Rey is searching to be trained as a Jedi. Both have conflict, with TNO being able to track the resistance, who are running low on fuel, and Luke Skywalker being a broken shell of the hero we once loved. All characters, both friend and foe go through transformations. It was especially fun to not be able to guess what was going to happen from one scene to the next.",1
3655,"A magnificent and emotional chapter to the saga!  The movie pairs up our characters to great effect, and this is the best performance by Mark Hammill yet.  I found the big moments epic, the intimate moments involving, and the surprises were true doozies!  (So much so, that you really limit how many reviews you read for fear of massive spoilers.)  It is evident why Lucasfilm felt so confident in Rian Johnson, to give him the keys to a new trilogy.  There is a real confidence in his storytelling, and the humor laces itself in at just the right moments. The best moments in the movie were not teased out in the trailers.  Getting more development from Rey, Kylo, Finn, and Poe just has me thinking...More please!",1
3656,"This is the best Star Wars movie since Empire, if not since 1977. The haters are just wrong - they got turned off by opening 90 seconds of admittedly not very good jokes, which I think jolted them out of the heart-felt brilliance of the remaining 150 minutes. I spent the second half of the movie either in a mess of tears at seeing old friends reunite and rediscover their heroic resolve or mentally punching the air with cathartic joy as Rian Johnson bought together epic visual (and vehicle) design, heroic self-sacrifice, and the most successful evocation of that ’Star Wars’ vibe since the 80s (SPOILERS FROM NOW): ramming the Snoke ship at light speed, the heroic lone bomber fighter in the opening battle, the falcon intervening in the Crait battle, those speeders, all of Mark Hamill (but in particular his emotionally devastating and surprisingly athletic final lightsabre showdown with Kylo Ren - the power of this duel is quite subtle and will take a second watch to sink in), fleets of ships desperately warping through the galaxy under imperial onslaught. I even loved the middle section: my favourite childhood movie franchise showing some moral heart by raising a wish-fulfilling middle finger to the 1%, which is a really on-f***ing point message during a time of shameless inequality. Full marks for Johnson for writing it into the film. Full marks also for killing off Phasma (‘You’re Scum! Yeah, but rebel scum’ - freaking epic line!) and Snoke (what is with that terrible name), who were dead weight on the series and their absence sets up episode 9 a much cleaner Good vs. Evil final confrontation. The humour was laugh out loud: BB8’s impersonation of a mouse droid, C3P0 not being allowed to finish calculating the odds of survival, Finn playing up his ‘resistance hero’ status, Rey ‘reaching out’, Yoda rediscovering his original playful teaching methods, Luke’s ‘not-busy schedule’. Great performances by everyone (Boyega, Ridley, Carrie Tran, Oscar Isaacs all have difficult parts in this film) but Hamill and Fisher steal it, with Fisher seeming much more on her game than in TFA. But this is Hamill’s movie -  he is oscar worthy (best supporting, plz), successfully conveying a heartbroken former warrior whose heroic spirit is re-awoken in time for a final showdown, and he even resurrected some youthful attitude, spirit and cunning in his performance.If you hated it I challenge you to go back and see it again and forget about the opening minutes - I’m confident the star wars joy will sink in over time. Empire was pretty bad in places but is overall amazing (we seem to always forget about C3PO’s constant whining, the stupidly repeated ’the hyperdrive is broken again’ plotting, the boring parts of Cloud city). I ****ing love this movie.",1
3657,"I want to respond to some of these ridiculous low score claims.  The biggest is that Finn/Rose's mission is wasted part of the film.  Wrong.   The whole point of that is about character development - it is through this that Finn learns that he doesn't want to run anymore, and Poe learns that he is too hot-headed to lead and has a lot to learn - in otherwords, it reinforces the central theme of failure leads to future strength.   And it's refreshing to see that sometimes the best of intentions /plans are thrawrted.  Characters in this movie are round, not flat.  They are evolved from 30+ years ago, not static.  It's refreshing.  Beyond this, most of the points are stupid uber fanboy type stuff.   I love Luke Skywalker; I love him more now realizing that he is fallible, but redeemable.   This is an amazing movie, right up there with eps 4 and 5.",1
3658,"Ok let’s get this straight. Wasn’t part of the reason that Star Wars was created was because it was geared toward children? And because of that it pioneered the mass merchandising of movies? Before Star Wars came along nobody took advantage of the merchandising of it’s characters like George Lucas. So please people (those that apply) remember why Star Wars is Star Wars. Go back and remember what it meant to be that kid again... C3PO, R2D2, Jawas, Ewoks, Salacious Crumb, Yoda? These characters SCREAM cute little eye candy for children. All from the Original Trilogy. How easy we forget when we get older and wish Star Wars would get on our level and mature (which in a lot of respects it has). Star Wars is for the kids! George Lucas himself says that Star Wars is meant to be “enjoyed by 12 year olds”. But I’m an adult and absolutely love this flick because I take it for what it is. Rian Johnson and everybody else at LucasFlim understands that and thus stays true to the spirit of Star Wars.This one goes toe to toe with Empire. This movie is great! Can’t wait for Episode IX (9).",1
3659,"PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS! I was very surprised to see how divisive this movie is among fans. As the critic score suggests, it is a well-made (and well-directed) film. Most of the criticism is directed towards the movie's directions with the characters which I will not explore too much as I am trying to keep this spoiler free. First off, this is easily the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back: its plot and character developments, insane special effects, and lasting emotional depth (including a few heartbreaking scenes with Leia/Carrie Fisher). It uses some nostalgic elements-- but no where near the amount in Force Awakens. It takes the story in surprising, and provocative new directions. Some of these directions are causing divisiveness at the moment. It seems many people are having trouble (*caution small spoiler) with the direction of Luke's character-- in this film he is not the all-perfect hero of the original trilogy, but I'd like to think this film made him a more dynamic and human character-- and he still has an incredible act of heroism towards the end (*end small spoiler)Overall a phenomenal film. Do not listen to the criticism on here as the only people reviewing this movie on this site and RT are those who are passioned haters. A majority of people love the film (just look at IMDB for instance with an 8.1/10 rating from over 50,000 reviewers). Anyway I recommend you see it and decide for yourself whether you think it is a respectable movie or not. I'd love to see your voice be heard on this site and others :)",1
3660,"Rian Johnson brings his unique direction to Star Wars and the mythology is better for it. Really appreciated the emphasis on character moments, even at the cost of the Rey-Kylo ""A-plot"" time.",1
3662,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is not a groundbreaking film, it is an earth shattering one. Director Rian Johnson clearly was given full creative freedom to tell the story he wanted and take characters into whatever direction he wanted. This film is already one of the most divisive blockbusters to ever come out in theaters, at least among hardcore fans. For some fans, The Last Jedi is not the film they wanted at all and they have some legitimate reasons. I have spent the last 5 days coming to terms with my full feelings about this movie. Not everything in this movie works, some of the humor doesn't work, the whole Rose/Finn/Poe plotline is weak in structure with a few plot holes, and some ideas could have been executed better (Leia using the force is awesome, but why did she have to look like some hokey superhero while using it?). The other gripes I had with The Last Jedi when I came out of the theater for the first time came down to how wildly unmet my expectations for the story were. Rian Johnson makes subverting expectations a clear theme of the story, and it often seems obvious that Johnson deliberately makes the touch choices when it came to plot decisions. I think this film will eventually grow out of the the backlash and become appreciated for the huge risks it took and how it managed to make it all work so damn well. I don't expect some fans will ever change their minds, but I think most rational folks will come to see this film in a better light. The themes of failure and lost legacy are so strong and resonate through every pore of this work. Mark Hammil's perfomance as Luke Skywalker is one of the best of year, and if the Academy didn't hate space and fantasy movies, I would say it deserves a nomination, at least. This review won't convince the cynical fanatics who are spamming this film with overly negative scores, but I hope they eventually grow tired of hating things that other people enjoy. 9/10",1
3663,It is the best star wars movie of this century. If you can stand only one annoying character (Rose) than you should go and see this with your own eyes. Exelent special effects and many plot twists will make you amazed same as me.,1
3664,"The s**t this movie is getting is absolutely ridiculous. The character development is pretty good for a Star Wars movie! I personally don't want an another Darth Vader, a mute God-like anti-hero if you like. A human with drama, like Kylo Ren, is obviously a different kind of villain, but more relatable. Luke with his own mistakes has also become a mortal and stopped being a ""myth"". I liked Ren very much, but it was really disappointing to see that just because you have such power, you can just become the strongest Jedi ever existed without a proper training. As for the characters, the only annoying thing was just Ren ""development"" as a Jedi (not as a hero).The humor was childish I get it. It was off-putting I get this too and nobody needs to defend the film for it. But we shouldn't act like the mythical original trilogy didn't wear the marks of the 80's film-making era.Now we have these must-have Disney s**t like the cute creatures (for PR porpuses only) the quotable sentences without any shown depth or the childish humor. But nothing I personally cannot forgive them because it's consistent with the universe. Not the infantile jokes but e.g.: the creatures. It's adding to this world as did the new trilogy anno. The great power of Ren and Kylo is also a modern cliché.  Like in the previous movie: ""It's like the Dead Star but bigger!"" I was feeling I'm watching a Star Wars movie and I'm glad that the younger generations now also have a ""Star Wars experience"" too.",1
3665,"Of course, it's a bit long and not perfect, but if you set your expectations on ""episode 1"" level, you will have a great time. I don't understand all the hate. It was thrilling, fun, took some unexpected turns and has great acting and even better special effects.",1
3666,This movie is different and that doesn't make it bad sorry that it didn't meet your theories and it expanded the universe and added something new to it. Luke was great and his arc made sense. Great movie. Best star wars yet. sorry empire,1
3667,This required a second viewing to appreciate it fully. After having read hours of user reviews and comments I've swayed back and forth between masterpiece and mediocre. There are just so jaw dropping moments in the movie and I love how they've figuratively thrown away baggage and tropes of the previous movies to create something new. I feel that in 10 years time this will be more fully appreciated by the fans once it's seen in the complete context of the full trilogy (and the future trilogy.),1
3668,"I had to see it twice to understand it better, it has mush information between scenes and speech that you might miss. I believe it is a masterpiece. Can understand haters, maybe they are on the dark side of the Force... All star wars movies had flaws, all of them, i wouldn't remove a single scene from this one.",1
3669,"And here we go with the toxic fandom. I quite enjoyed the Last Jedi, it really reminds me of the mirror image world they are building with this new Star Wars trilogy. The thematic flow and mirroring of ESB makes this a stand out for me.Spoilers below:While the Casino story line may run a little long, I don't think it hurts the story and allows us to see more of the Star Wars universe.  The First Order hunting down the last of the Resistance feels tense and allows us to see Poe grow into the leader he is meant to be, through an error in judgement he realizes he is not the only one giving everything for the Resistance.  It was nice to see the old guard giving way to the new.  The building of Kylo and Rey was amazing and Luke did exactly what he needed to do to bring balance to the Force.   Who cares what Snokes back story is? It doesn't matter, he's Snoke and he made Kylo turn to the Dark Side. Also, if you ever payed the PnP Star Wars RPG back in the late 80s/early 90s, you'd know that Force Projection is a thing. Oh, and Leia was using Force Pull on the ship and rather than pulling the ship to her, she pulled herself into the ship (again non-canon now, but part of the EU). It's clear the toxic fanboys have been busy reviewing this, but this is actually quite a good movie, if a bit long.",1
3670,"I absolutely LOVED this film and it has restored my faith in the Star Wars franchise. I grew up with these films in the 1970's, lived through the dire episodes 1-3, and thankfully with LTJ Star Wars has found its feet and is finding its OWN voice rather than clinging to a stodgy restrictive past.The theme of this movie is front and centre ""death and rebirth"" (the dark and the light) and I think it did a very good job, whilst I can TOTALLY understand why the haters are hating on it, I think they are missing the WHOLE POINT of the story, it's OK for people we idolised to have flaws and make mistakes, you grow and you learn from them. Thankfully this time they at least gave Kylo Ren a bit more depth than ""moody teenager"", there was real loss for the Rebellion in this, thank goodness, rather than the fake faux angst in previous films. It took Star Wars in new directions rather than relying on tired old formulas, the plans didn't always work, the outcomes weren't always predictable. I'm GLAD they didn't play it safe with the information on Rey's parents and didn't go the obvious and safe route.The haters are hating because the film didn't go where they wanted it to go, but that's exactly why I absolutely LOVED IT. It was fresh and didn't try to be precious and safe, I in no way think it was giving the middle finger to the franchise that had gone before it (but can understand why some might think so), I think it was trying to define its own identity, which I think it did admirably. Let's just hope that with Abrams back at the helm for the next one he doesn't get scared and just give us an uninspired safe regurgitation of films that are over 40 years old.",1
3671,"Star Wars is back full ""force""!!Oh dear! This movie is getting hammered by metacritic users, because the thinking Star Wars fans were turned off by the disappointing ""The Force Awakens"" and the ""The Force Awakens"" fans couldn't endure the action-less spell in the middle of this movie (while impressive twists were preparing to turn around the thickening plot). Star Wars fans need to get this in perspective. The Force Awakens was the only shallow entry in this series from Episode III onwards. Star Wars is back full ""force"" with ""The Last Jedi"" and you won't regret giving it another chance!",1
3672,i was relieved that this film veered in a direction different from what i was anticipating.,1
3673,"Not a perfect movie but one of the best star wars movies, he take risks with the story that pays off mostly, with a few issues coming from the casino section. Its impossible to please everyone but the hate this one is getting is ridiculous especially when attack of the clones exists.",1
3674,"The Last Jedi is an immediate classic that's dark, emotionally gripping and filled with already iconic (and controversial) moments and quotes. An analysis of insecurity, failure, the burden of ageing and how small mistakes can have catastrophic outcomes, The Last Jedi succeeds at deepening and expanding upon the plot and characters of the more comfortable and family-friendly previous film, taking viewers on a winding rollercoaster ride into bold, daring and highly unexpected new territory. Possibly the greatest Star Wars movie ever.",1
3675,"I have watched all of the Star Wars movies, some of them multiple times. I am a huge Star Wars fan. The Last Jedi is among the best Star Wars movies and Sci-Fi movies of all-time. It is a complex, entertaining, visually stunning masterpiece. I believe it will stand the test of time. I give it a 10.",1
3680,"I'm not a Russian bot, I don't have a political agenda and I'm not a troll. I don't hate all things Disney. I'm just a disappointed and frankly angry Star Wars fan of 40 years. Angry enough to write this. Why? Because The Last Jedi feels like a slap in the face. I remember almost physically flinching in the theatre and wondering if it was all a really bad (and belated) April Fool's joke. The Force Awakens and Rogue One are both very good films and Solo, well, m'eh, but this film is offensive. I've watched it countless times (much as I did The Phantom Menace) in the hope that it'll get better with repeat viewing, but it doesn't. It's like giving that really expensive Lego Millennium Falcon to a toddler and watching what happens.",1
3681,"Best of the best Star Wars movies, yet. There's so much substance behind the story. Rey is the best character in the franchise, yet.",1
3682,"Good movie. I enjoyed it. That said, I knew even before I left the theater that the fan reviews would be mixed. There are lots of sad fanboys seeing the end of what they know and love. Did Disney get it perfect? No. Did they please everyone? Nope.   What I don't understand, is why people have to project their opinion as something everyone should be feeling.  If you did not like the movie, that is OK.  It's your opinion and you do not need to understand why there are fans and critics that loved the movie.  Like I said, I enjoyed the movie, and as far as I am aware, that is all that matters.",1
3684,Great! Just great! Stop crying guys. So fresh! I love it! Best antagonist of all all time. Right now this is the most interesting story and this is really exciting! All in to Rian Craig Johnson! You make Star Wars even better! I thought it was not possible! Never lose hope guys;),1
3685,A great film that will shine beyond just the initial reactions and will stand the test of time. Like many films before that have had the same audience reaction.,1
3686,"This was such a great movie, there are just too many picky people out there. Adam Driver and Mark Hamill did such excellent jobs, I hope they when a lot of awards for their performances. This is a top 2 Star Wars film for me.",1
3687,"A great addition to the Star Wars movie franchise. Their renewed effort in the series is really showing through unique settings, an original story, and well cast actors.",1
3688,"I was impressed with the character development. Kylo was less angsty and a more manipulative, deceitful villain yet I still felt sympathetic for him. Poe was somewhere between brash and brave. Finn and Rose learn an important lesson in trusting strangers in a great sub plot that reminded me of a Flannery O'Conner short story. Luke has always been angry, and it seems now he's channelled it into his obsession with regret. He resolved his oedipal complex in return of the jedi and was becoming a pacifist, which I thought Rian Johnson maintained in a clever way at the end, but I think for real closure I wanted him to resolve his anger problems. The conflict between Kylo and Rey is great when they forcetime each other but she needs more character development. Her character is a little bland and needs some salt- maybe from that planet with all the salt. And I wish Leia was more sarcastic. But maybe she's older and wiser now. I liked the david and goliath plot line of the rebel fleet on the run. Their situation becomes more and more dire until the fleet is reduced to hiding out using junk speeders to fight. I became afraid for the characters, I saw they were afraid, which is basic and crucial for an adventure story yet missing in the force awakens. (That movie felt to me like an encore presentation of star wars in the form of improv hosted by han solo.) However the whole point of the david and goliath story is for something big to happen at the end, which is where Last Jedi seemed to peter out. It just drags on unsure of when to stop. That was my big issue with the pacing. Great dialogue. Nailed the sound of the Jedi, clever one liners, yet didn't quite nail the star wars sense of humor.  It's more character based, about sarcasm and cockiness, the shakespearean irony of two people flirting by insulting each other, cute child archetypes in the form of droids, droid/human misunderstandings. And the bad guys never make you laugh. Cinematography was well composed, I know Johnson was influenced by the Russian film Letter Never Sent, great restraint on lightsaber fights, thank god no death star and I hope disney wont put two in the next one to make up for it. I missed the influence of Campbell and the monomyth. Had big hopes for Johnson in this regard. Hero with 1000 faces seems to have been milked dry anyway but maybe there are other Jungian/Freudian psychology books that can influence this next trilogy. Or I could always rewatch A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back instead.",1
3689,The Last Jedi gives Star Wars a long needed change to it's old copy-paste story construction and does it fantastically well!Almost every scene looks like an artpiece ready to be hanged on the wall.,1
3690,"I wish I could tell you that this was, indeed, the perfect Star Wars film.  That it met and exceeded every expectation that I had allowed myself to build up over the past two years but, sadly, I can’t do that. With some editing and tightening, it could have been, but like I said earlier, that is because someone wanted to give us more than needed.   Overall, I had fun and that is really what matters.  I went to be entertained and, I was, very much so.  There are some genuinely joyful and shocking moments that will make you gasp, laugh and even get a little misty eyed.  It is even one of the more humorous entries along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy at times.   Is the film good?  sure, it is, but be sure to leave your expectations at the door and go to be entertained. for a detailed review go to: https://latetothegame.blog/2017/12/15/new-movie-review-star-wars-episode-8-the-last-jedi-for-real-this-time/",1
3691,"It took 1 movie to kill Solo and 2 to kill Luke and finally the past is gone. The movie was really good, it's a new beginning, a completely new direction for the next generation of sith and jedi(if the principles and the names are kept). Let's move forward, let the past die, we can't leave in the past like we leave forever. Looking forward for IX.",1
3692,"Before going to see TLJ today I was slightly disappointed/nervous at the audience score on aggregators such as Metacritic. I thought, ""What could fans hate so much that some stoop to the level of likening it to The Phantom Menace?"" Now that I have seen the film (and read through many comments from people who both liked and/or disliked TLJ) I will give my reaction in full.To state it simply: I really enjoyed TLJ. Why? The visuals, the practical effects, the shocking moments, the action scenes (the fight in Snoke's chamber and the action on Crait were very exciting), the acting (particularly Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver), the intuitive nature of the dialogue (I'll also add that ""Darkness rises, and light to meet it"" is one of the coolest lines of dialogue I can remember).Were there things I didn't like? Of course - but they're small. I'll talk briefly about my top three issues. First, I thought that there were pacing issues. There was one moment in particular that was more of an editing issue where one scene jumped almost abruptly to the next. Second, some of the humor was present at times where I thought it shouldn't be (even though I thought that pretty much every line that was meant to be funny was worth at least a chuckle). Third, (and I think this has something to do with TLJ being the second film in the sequel trilogy) I felt that this episode could have been it's own stand-alone movie, that it wasn't a sequel to TFA. The only things that connected it to TFA are Rey's journey to find Luke and Kylo's struggle with the Light.Now let me address my views on some of the more dividing moments:Let me get two things out of the way quickly. First, Leia's moment where she floats back to the ship. Strange? Very much so. This is one of those moments in the film where Rian Johnson took a chance. I understand the explanation for it (Leia is Force-sensitive), but I think that the film would have been as good without it or if it had been filmed differently. So I guess in that instance I'm 50/50. The other criticism I want to bypass quickly is that some people have labeled TLJ ""childish"". This is nonsense. If you didn't know Star Wars was made for children then do some research.Here are my feelings surrounding Finn's story-line. I've seen a few people dismiss it as ""unnecessary"" because they [Finn and Rose] didn't end up completing their objective. Am I the only one who found it more appealing that they didn't complete their objective? Having them succeed would have felt too ordinary to me. Also I have heard people say that the character DJ was a waste of time. I would mostly agree. It's sad too, because I actually enjoy characters like DJ. I wish he would've been used in a different manner. Unfortunately, subtracting DJ from the plot renders the scenes on Canto Bight null. This is also sad because there was some great action scenes here. Now, I have tried to reconcile this. I find some plausibility that in a real life scenario, heading into uncharted waters means that things will not always go as planned. Finn and Rose went to Canto Bight to find the codebreaker but end up getting captured. They then break out with DJ's (and BB-8's) help, only to get on board the Supremacy and have DJ turn on them. Also, it’s important to mention that the children we see on Canto Bight are important to the last scene of the film, so there’s that.Now let's discuss Luke. Yes it is different that someone like Luke would struggle with fear and failure after what we witnessed him do in Ep. IV-VI, especially at the end of ROTJ where he ultimately proclaimed himself a Jedi and shunned the Dark Side. Fast forward to TLJ, we find out that Luke has changed. He clearly cared deeply for his nephew Ben. Such emotion can illicit strong reactions. I think it was made clear in TLJ that Luke was disappointed with his actions, that's why he went into exile. He realizes that he made the wrong choice back when he considered killing Ben. He feels responsible (as I've heard Mark Hamill say) for Ben's fall to the Dark Side.The death of Snoke I certainly did not see coming. How it happened was, I think, the most shocking part. Was Snoke a powerful Force-user? Apparently so. Should he have noticed the lightsaber moving next to him? I thought he would while I was watching it, but now thinking back I don't think it's hard to imagine Snoke being so transfixed in the moment that even if he had reacted he would have still been killed. Am I disappointed that we didn't learn more about Snoke's background? Yes, I am. That being said, Ep. IX has yet to be made. I'm pretty sure Snoke will be mentioned in IX.To sum up, I will say it is the nature of the plot of any film/novel for people to both like it and others to hate it. Still, I think that a lot of the criticisms of TLJ are premature.",1
3694,"Saw the first Star Wars movies when I was 10, so no movie will seem that good again but I liked this sequel better than most.  I would rank this as 3rd favorite behind the original and Rogue One.",1
3695,"One of the best of the saga and the best film of the year. Incredibly bold and surprising. Great performances, characters and impeccable story! 10000000!",1
3696,I like this film beacose it has many unexpected storyline turns. Veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery goooooooooooooooooooooooooooood film.,1
3697,"Yes, it's flawed. There are some scenes that had me thinking 'Really?' But I was prepared to forgive them because had they made The Same Film Again (Eps 4 / 6 / 7), that would have been it for me. The franchise desperately needed some defibrillation, even at the expense of a broken rib or two, and it got it. Admire it for its bravery, if nothing else. Visually brilliant, not just in the usual sense but in the choice of colour palettes. The IMAX version I saw sounded amazing, too (and the 3D was a pleasant enhancement, not an annoying gimmick). This is not the best film ever made. It's not even the best Star Wars film. But it does give the series a much-needed kick up the a**e, which of course will annoy the crap out of those who get cross that it wasn't the film they wanted to see.",1
3698,"I must respectfully disagree with the fans who are panning this movie. This is a different Star Wars film and isn't that what we've wanted for some time now? This is a gorgeous looking, entertainingly written, very well acted film that takes established characters in new directions I did not expect. The humor is a bit much, and some setups don't get the deserved payoff. I understand how divisive this film is. Honestly though, I think the harsh fan reaction is a gut reaction to unexpected outcomes. I was torn after seeing it the first time. I then thought about the film and while I have issues with it, the fan backlash is absurd. This is a good movie and for once, I'm with the critics on this.",1
3699,"While there was SO many stupid, inane, ridiculous, and contrived moments in this movie, it's still so much better than The Force Awakens.While some of the set ups are pointless, it's exciting and well told overall, with some very powerful moments emotionally. It's trope destroying, and I think that's perhaps one of the things I like about it the most. All of the fan theories can kiss their arse goodbye, and I love that it had the guts to do this.It's not a great movie. Not even close. It's not even particularly good. It's just better than The Force Awakens, better than Rogue One,  and probably better than all of the prequels too.I hate that they made the choice to let go of one of the cast members, and I feel like I would have prefered to see more of them. I'm also disappointed in the scene where they effectively burn the last remnants of the jedi code, because it's like burning EU canon. There's no jedi code now, and that's how Disney like it, but the code of the sith and jedi are two of the only really interesting things in this fictional universe, so I was left feeling a little bitter at this.But overall, it's a step in the right direction. It's a shame the series goes back to the master of playing safe for episode 9. JJ Abrams is the worst.",1
3700,People are being so ridiculous... this was an excellent Star Wars film.  Sure it has it's flaws... but overall very enjoyable and well made. I'm glad they gave Luke some humanity.  I guess a lot of people think they can do a better job... which is absolutely insane.  Rian Johnson did good job covering his bases and creating another Star Wars masterpiece.,1
3701,I loved this movie. Luke was portrayed exactly as he should have based on his character from A new Hope. I love the diversity they added with the characters. I'm looking forward to the next chapter of Rey.,1
3702,"After a second watch, I understand what is likable about this film. There is a lot going on and the film tries to deliver the survival of the Rebellion in a way that is interesting end provocative. It almost works but the problems lie in the provocation from The Last Jedi and how it tried to force (no pun intended) select ideals on its audience. Take, for instance, the heavy-handed feminine heroism pushed throughout. Hardly any leaders of the Rebellion are men. Heck, the few that exist are mostly eradicated in the early, leaving Poe and Luke Skywalker as perhaps the only true male leads that matter in Star Wars. That would be fine if the female leads took control and made me believe that the Rebellion is in good hands but it takes over 2 hours for me to finally feel any semblance of certainty and that's only when Rey and Poe appear to take the reins of the whole operation. Vice Admiral Holdo was a great, albeit small character to showcase female heroics but when Disney tried to force Rose and Leia as important characters going forward, it made it hard to love The Last Jedi. Afterall, the name of the movie highly suggests that this movie is very much about Luke Skywalker and yet his presence in this movie almost feels secondary to all that's happening. That brings me back to my original point: so much is happening in this movie that it can be tough for an audience to focus on the big picture. My first viewing I found myself constantly battling the somewhat schizophrenic scene jumps between Skywalker, the Rebellion survival, FN and Rose's shenanigans, and the building interest of Kylo Ren and what his view is of the future for the First Order. Speaking of the First Order - who the hell was Snoke? There was a ton of intrigue that was nearly thrown away in this movie. The curious draw of Kylo and Rey was awesome and could have lead to an interesting future for Star Wars - a path that no other film has taken and could have at least offered a snippet of unexpected behavior for a franchise that has stuck to a formula since the succession of the original trilogy.Given that this is Disney, and Disney doesn't always do best in adult-targeted films, they should have left the experiments (like the pointless casino plotline which wastes the audience time, especially given the result) to the spinoff films. Rogue One was EXCELLENT and I had the utmost confidence that Disney may have figured out what a good Star Wars movie could be and give it new life to rival the original trilogy. Alas, we're still hoping. The good news is that J.J. Abrams is back for the 9th film (helped on The Force Awakens, also does the modern Star Trek movies) and given his reactions to The Last Jedi I feel a bit more confident that the final installment of this current trilogy holds better moments and more cohesion. Abrams, like many, didn't care for the way Luke was sent off, the holding of Leia in the films (especially given the fact that many knew her health was of concern and the series needed to let her go in the right way), and more with The Last Jedi and I think that lessons can be learned and bring forth a better Star Wars in terms of the main storyline of the fight between the Resistance/Rebellion and the Empire/First Order.TLDR? If there's one thing I wasn't pleased with regarding The Last Jedi, it was the inferior storytelling. Too much jumping around and odd character choices with the progression of those characters taking seemingly-bad turns. It's like Disney knew they had a great movie and decided to throw some wrenches into the mix. It doesn't kill the movie but it knocks it down a couple points and that's too bad - The Last Jedi definitely could have been the best movie of the franchise.",1
3703,"3rd on my rank of SW movies. After V and IV.The Luke arc was the best of the movie. Most of the haters that asked for an ideal luke kinda like Superman, don't understand the force as he did. So...",1

Though I love some cool moments that I'm sure many people would left more than satisfied, The Last Jedi just don't seem to cover a lot of mystery JJ Abrams had put in The Force Awakens that fanboys and fangirls all around the globe had been waiting for for the past 2 years. Well, as for now, I hope the last installment of this trilogy (episode XII) can completely cover this problem once and for all, and please, DON'T SCREW EPISODE XII!!!!!!",1
3707,Best Star wars movie since the original trilogy. No idea what all the hate is about and this is coming from a guy who saw the original trilogy as a kid when they first came out.  I definitely recommend that you ignore the Trolls and see it for yourself,1

Most people post their reviews directly after seeing it for the first time, I watched it twice just to be sure if I saw what I saw and damn. THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. The CGI is stunning, some jokes were a bit too much for me but that put aside it's a very good entry in the Star Wars Saga.",1

3713,"The Last Jedi is a movie filled to the brim with intrigue and disappointment. In my initial showing, I felt as though there were a lot of misplaced ambitions as subplots from Episode VII were gutted left and right. However, contrasting VII's theme of ""awakening"", I now see that this was a story of failure. A true drama, casting off all ambition and expectation in its telling. While I definitely don't believe everything was executed masterfully, it does serve to cement the cast's role in a new and greater story.",1
3714,"What an amazing movie! Such a fantastic and fresh take on the franchise. Great job! The direction, the acting, the storyline, all very moving. So happy!",1
3715,"Despite its flaws, I loved The Last Jedi for its **** attitude. All the best bits were profanities against the franchise's pieties & orthodoxies. Found it refreshing.",1
3716,"While writing this review , I'll try to address just a few ""issues"" some of the negative reviews are throwing out there. I saw the first movie at age 4 , so yup – you can still be lifelong fan and love this movie. I don’t need anyone telling me otherwise thanks.PLOT - easy to follow, it ain't rocket science. If you can't get your head around it, or don't even know it's there then that's your problem, not the movie. ""Story"" is different to ""plot"", and there is a great SW story here, that follows the tradition of conflict, hope and redemption.CHARACTERS - On one hand people are complaining about Luke, and how he isn't the Luke of old, and then in the same breath they complain about lack of character development?!? Well , which is it? Character development please, but oh, wait, just not for Luke ?!?Luke’s arc is great. He is not a coward in this movie. Changed yes, but not a coward. New characters are introduced without suffocating the main story, and will likely develop into the next movie, and yes, they do affect the plot and add to the themes. Seems a few too many “fans” aren’t comfortable with strong female characters or a character getting hauled up for mansplaining. Again, that’s a problem with the viewer, not the movie.ROMANCE – Apparently there was a budding romance between Finn and Rey in TFA. Seems two characters of the opposite sex can’t exist in the same movie and just be close without have to fall in love. LEIA – agree, her “force” scene didn’t seem to fit. I’ll concede that.There is great, inspiring, film making here; and look for the little details and nuances, many that you will miss first time (I have now seen it twice) , but you do appreciate so much more second time round, but i'll keep this spoiler free.So many perceived problems appear to be from angry people who can’t concentrate for 150 minutes, or went in looking for something they already filmed in their head. While looking for their own movie, they ended up missing a great one.",1
3717,"Though the director used a entirely different rithm in this movie compared to the rest of the saga, this movie is absolutely delightful, The script is like something I've never seen, the caracters now have a more realistic tone and the fight scenes are unexpectedly awesome.",1
3718,"A stunning movie. Ranks alongside ANH and ESB as the best Star Wars film. Loved the strong themes, tones, bombastic action scenes. Incredibly excited for Episode 9 now!",1
3719,Movie was great. Loved that it tore down everything to make room for a new generation. Sucks its getting review bombed. Basically the Szichuan Sauce of Star Wars movies. Very angry nerds.,1
3720,I am loving the way that the saga is going! I loved Luke`s jorney and the definition about Rey`s parents.,1
3721,"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. First movie i've seen as 4 years old kid.I didn't enjoy The Force Awakens  actually. After i left the theater i felt quite dissapointed. And when i watched it 2nd time i felt bored.So, i had no expectations about The Last Jedi. I just hoped that this is not going to be a failure. I really enjoyed Rouge One so i trusted Disney in this one.I was not dissapoined.The film is actually really nice Star Wars movie.I know there are a lot of mistakes in the film, but they didnt bother me at all!The plot is great but there is one catch. This movie was created to build the universe.The film itself doesnt answer many questions. If you want to find out these answers you need to buy books/comics or watch a tv series. So i see why The Last Jedi has so many negative reviews. It's not great movie itself, but i really enjoyed it. For me, the film was tense and perfectly solved the characters' threads.",1
3722,"For the folks that are giving this move a “0-2”, give me a break. Have you actually seen the original trilogy? They weren’t exactly masterpieces of dialogue and nuance. This movie is very good and fits in perfectly with the saga. Great plot twists, action sequences, and characters. If you are into capturing the spirit and the fun you had while watching the originals, this one has all of that. If you’ve grown too old and cynical to enjoy them, you may want to move on. Citizen Kane and The Godfather trilogy are all available for download last I checked. Meanwhile, the rest of us will enjoy a very cool Episode 7 and 8. Looking forward to Episode 9.",1
3723,This movie was one of the top 3 best Star Wars movies to date. Rian Johnson had so many plot issues to tackle in this movie that were presented in Ep. 7 as well as other issues that he had to work around such as deaths in the cast. This film was very Lucasesque and I think he would have been proud of this effort. The plot was unpredictable and well executed. There were also many funny moments in the film that contrasted the action and dialogue well. It also delves into lore that was somewhat missing from earlier films. 9/10,1
3724,"Thrilling entertainment, mind bending special effects, and a superb send off for Carrie Fisher.  There are moments in this film that will leave fans of the series, and particularly of Fisher and Mark Hamill, spellbound.  John Williams score is a knockout.",1
3725,"it didn't scare me enough then..Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last JediWhen Luke Skywalker says, ""..Han was Han about it.."", Rey smirks slightly for just a frame on the screen this shows that not only is the movie written explicitly on paper but also executed with all the dedication and excellence. The Last Jedi checks off each and every fantasy of a fan, whether it be complex concept, dreadful characters, awe-struck moments or one of the finest unpredictability natured script of Star Wars. The sense of urgency that was present in The Force Awakens is still kept alive with a tightly packed screenplay especially in the last hour of the movie (which is the ace in the hole and also reminds you of Inception) where the movie holds you on the edge of the seat proving you wrong about every prediction you might have created in your mind (Literally Luke Skywalker's dialogue comes alive, ""This is not going to go the way you think!""). A marvelous background music by John Williams, stunning visuals and Adam Driver's presence on the screen are some of the bright colors that paints this stunning craft that Star Wars is. This is Rian Johnson, Star Wars and a cinema at its peak, without any doubt this is the best installment of Star Wars Series till date.",1
3726,"In one word - great. With that said...THE FOLLOWING IS IN REFERENCE TO THE LARGE SCALE FAN DISCUSSION AND NOT AN OVERALL CRITIQUE OF THE FILM: I've got to be missing something here - perhaps I'm the perfect capture audience for this film but I honestly think it is as good and maybe just maybe better than V and VI. The only complaint I have is exactly why Luke had to die there and then, it seems in one part he has mastered the force and goes of his own will to torment Kylo Ren and it also shows him really struggling with himself. And personally I like the idea that Star Wars is the tale of the Skywalker's but that's a personal wish and I can roll with it if necessary. Apart from that - and the dragged out casino film - I feel the film did alot right. I don't feel any racism was directed at Fin or Rose. My girlfriend believes that Star Wars is ahead of the curve for feminism. I think Luke ever so briefly acts out of character in a couple of scenes but actually acts very human just like he did in Empire and just like Anakin did before him. Luke changed as a result of some incredibly serious personal experiences and changes in the force and I absolutely see how this character 'could' have and did form. I enjoyed the madness of Kylo Ren, it really explains his actions in VII. His torment has literally driven him to moments of pure madness that were played out well. I enjoyed that the big bad was killed off early. I enjoyed Snoke's deception of Rey. I enjoyed Poe being shown as young, naive and missing a trick - his counterplay with the purple hair lady (oops) is great. I enjoyed Leia's use of the force, even if the cinematography wasn't perfect.I have been a long time fan of the films and what I have read on the Wiki ONLY. I am not a huge Star Wars buff, I just happen to know what has happened around the films. Honestly it really thrilled me. I just feel the need to stand up for the film as a consumer while most of my nerdy comrades are blasting it. From my point of view it was great.﻿",1
3728,"when this first came out i was set against seeing it as i hate what disney has become in recent years but after seeing all the reviews both hating it and praising it i caved and i saw it and to my surprise it was amazing the effects were amazing, the performances were outstanding, and the music was just awesome i don't want to spoil anything but mark hamill was just perfect in this film he deserves an oscar that said this film has issues its a bit to long and the pacing was all over the place but over all the film was star wars through and through",1
3729,"""The Last Jedi"" was an unpretentiously subversive, bold, hilarious, auteur-driven, beautifully presented, humanist, and emotionally powerful film with some of the most wonderful action, acting, writing, themes, and characters in all of ""Star Wars."" It is about as polished as a film in this franchise could get, stands as well on it's own as V and VI, and it is the least “corporately-driven” installment since ""The Empire Strikes Back.""It supplants practically every single convenience, trope, and expectation associated with the series (romances are unrequited loves, legendary heroes are flawed and tragic icons, what seem like great coincidences result in dismal failures, etc.) and in turn succeeds in giving it palpable growth and stakes while presenting simple, but powerful/all-encompassing themes that should be taken to heart.""But Luke's development was an inexcusable betrayal to his character!""Luke's characterization was entirely appropriate for a western monomyth hero. Just look at Arthurian Legend and its central figure's not so happy story, which has always served as one of the blueprints for Luke's writing. It's especially appropriate given the implications that the impulsive nature and rage he displayed in both V and VI make about him. There's even a meta-narrative argument to be made concerning George Lucas's background and ideology while he was writing the original trilogy in the aftermath of the Vietnam War era, and this makes Luke's disillusioned veteran portrayal even more apropos. After all, this new trilogy is already meta to begin with in how it treats the legacy of ""Star Wars"" with characters like Rey and Kylo Ren, both of whom are technically ""Star Wars"" fans.Luke endured an awful conflict for much of his life. It took away friends, family, and scarred him for life. After it's over, he finally knows peace, only to find out years later that Ben will reignite those horrors. In what way, shape, or form is it not logical or faithful to his character to have him experience murderous intent in this scenario, only for it to ""pass like a fleeting shadow,"" not unlike what happened in the aftermath of Luke and Vader's final duel? He saw light in his father, but he saw darkness in his nephew.But sure, all of this is somehow way less interesting and respectful towards Luke Skywalker as a character than how the Expanded Universe had him cowardly betraying all of his friends and become the resurrected Emperor Palpatine's apprentice. Let's just completely disregard this universally, socially relevant story of a historical figure being intensely deified in the face of serious faults.“That milking scene was disgusting and pointless.”If the whole point of that sequence was to disgust, then it wasn't really pointless. The audience is not supposed to be looking at Luke in a positive light, at least not in the beginning of the movie. Personally, I thought Finn drinking the dirty water in VII was much worse, and it baffles me that I even hear this complaint enough that it bears mention.""Why did Luke just decide to become one with the Force in the end?""Luke didn't willfully disappear. The strain of projecting himself across the galaxy killed him, which is something that was foreshadowed by Kylo Ren when he was telling Rey how the effort of bridging their minds together would kill her. The film shows that Luke has no way of getting off the island. I’m almost certain that Luke will come back as a force ghost in IX since we were never told Rey's third lesson.""Mark Hamill has numerous interviews talking down the direction Rian Johnson took the character.""Rian Johnson and Mark Hamill had initial creative differences (something that happens extremely often in this business), ones that Mark clarified were inconsequential to the quality of the finished product, which even George Lucas (who was explicitly hostile towards Disney and vocal about his indifference to ""The Force Awakens's"" direction) thought was a great movie.Besides, even if this assertion that he hated the movie was true, why is Mark's opinion the only one that ""matters""? What about the other original cast members and creators? It just seems like detractors are going out of their way to reach under the barrel here.""Why would Luke leave a map behind if he didn't want to be found?""The films never said that Luke himself left that map for people to find him. That map just revealed the location of Ahch-To, which as Kylo stated in VII was hidden from the Empire's archives. People only assumed that Luke was there because that's where the first Jedi temple was created, and they happened to be right.""Rey is too good at things, so she is a Mary Sue.""Let's ignore the fact that the operational definition of this term is universally misunderstood in this context...so her getting frozen, captured, and then force slammed against a tree to the point of unconsciousness by Kylo Ren, having trouble taking down a",1
3730,"I can't possibly write a review the way I would like to in just the 5k characters allowed. There are way too many things that people complained about.  Some of them make sense while most of them do not.  This is a reboot in many ways and old school fans (of which I am one) were pissed.  You have a right to be, but not on all the nitpicking b.s. that you have done.  Even so, let's start with the bad.  I have two major issues with this movie which I will not forgive (and they are huge ones).  And yet I still love the movie despite of it...General Leia floating back to the ship.  Rian Wilson took alot of what was sacred in the franchise and turned it on it's ass.  I agreed with many of his decisions but not this one.  The easiest way to say what's wrong with this idea is simple.  We have known that Leia has the force and has chosen not to use it much.  So be it; if she changes her mind, no big deal, she has the right to do so and we can't complain.  UNLESS, you take something that has been in seven movies before it, over a span of 40 years, and decide to add a new aspect of it.  One that has never been introduced- or even hinted at- before.  So basically, all of a sudden Jedi can crystalize (?) and float through outer space?  If that were the case, it should have been brought up way before now. You can't invent something just to move a scene forward or keep someone alive.  That simple.  Besides that, quite honestly, it just looked cheesy as hell.My second major issue is basically the same thing (the use of the force) but in this case it comes at the end of the movie.  And since it is the climax of the movie it kinda sorta brings you to a crashing halt.  I'm referring to Luke's ability to transport himself to another location.  Again...it's never been done before now and hasn't even been eluded to prior.  And since you're dealing with a lot of other source material, you can't just make it up for the sake of what you want to do...just because.  What makes it worse is: every- thing leading up to it is pretty awesome.  I have no issue with Luke dying, but it would have been a much better ending had he done everything that he did and actually, you know, been there.What's good about the movie is basically everything else.  You can argue that the Casino scene is unnecessary and you wouldn't be wrong.  And truth be told, I could have lived without seeing most of it.  So be it.  I still don't despise it like so many others.The evacuation scene and the new ship the dreadnaught: awesome.  The bombing of said ship also awesome.  Seeing the inside of a tie fighter while BB 88 fixes it: great minor detail.  Luke's pessimism: I think that direction was very smart.  Especially the idea of showing both sides of what happened between him and Kylo Ren to make Ren turn to the dark side.  Very believable story line.  Speaking of Kylo Ren; I can't say how great of an evil villan he turned out to be.  That may be Rian Wilson's greatest idea.  Snoke dying: love it.  Many people were mad but really, he wasn't that interesting.  Great idea to surprise the audience and a great way that it was done.  The fight scene in Snoke's lair: the best fight scene we've seen in a Star Wars movie and a great plot in regards to the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey.  Yoda's return: Yoda's return!!  Not a CGI look alike but the actual puppet!!  Genius idea.  And the whole scene with him was amazing as well as emotional.  This is a good way in which Rian Wilson shook up the whole franchise for the better.  The friction between Poe and General Leia: another great plot point that worked on many levels.  Vice Admiral Holdo: of course she's tied in to Poe and Leia and the back and forth of what's going on between the 3 of them kept me guessing.  Star Wars is normally black and white, but this plot kept the audience wondering who was right and who was wrong.  So, again, the Casino scene with Finn may have not been necessary but it did have to do with the Poe/Leia/Holdo power struggle so it served it's purpose.  Also, let me say right now that Holdo sacrificing herself and charging a Star Destroyer by going into light speed...cinematically, one of the best shot scenes I've ever seen.  Not just in a Star Wars film, but any film. Kylo Ren & Ray communicating telepathically: the opposite of my complaints of what you can or can't do with the force.  This has been shown to a lesser extent in other movies, so the leap is not jarring and it works very well.  Rey's dream: confusing but I think I understand it.  Either way, looks brilliant.Battle of Crait: like I said, I loved every aspect of this ending except for the fact that Luke wasn't actually there.  There are so many smaller details that I just don't have the time or room to do that helps explain why I like this movie so much.  In the end, I don't care what anyone says...in no way was this film worse than Episode I, II or III.",1
3731,"Possibly the best experience I've ever had in a movie theater. My jaw dropped for the entire last third of the movie. Some brilliant twists and bold decisions. Fantastic performance from Mark Hamill. The cinematography was excellent. The red skimmer battle was beautiful, probably the best battle scene of the entire saga.",1
3732,"Best Star Wars movie since Empire, hands down. Butthurts don't like it, but they don't like anything that doesn't make their tiny ego tingle. They want the same old big flash show empty of character and story. Everything on Ahch-to is pretty much the best dialogue and film in any Star Wars movie to date. It's exactly what I would expect from a Filoni SW movie - which is probably why Filoni loved The Last Jedi and Rian's script. More nature, mystery, dialogue, and character, and less on the nose fan service to pander to the butthurts.",1
3735,Such a fantastic film and addition to the saga! It gets better after every viewing.,1

3737,"I am a life long fan of the series, and for the life of me, can not understand the hatred being spewed about this film. It is definitely a departure from the previous films in the series which was refreshing. It takes risks, and often is beautiful. It explores new themes, and introduces a galaxy and philosophy much larger than what Star Wars fans are used to. I loved nearly every moment.",1
3738,"This film finally gave us a real, human Luke Skywalker, and Mark Hamill's performance was a career topper. The rest of the 'jedi' part of The Last Jedi was almost equally terrific. Unfortunately the 'b' plot is underwhelming and ultimately pointless, and it drags the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Still, it's a strong overall addition to the franchise, regardless of the reactionary nerdrage it has engendered in some corners that have sadly come out to taint its score here.",1
3739,"While certainly not perfect, this is a solid Star Wars movie (in the top three for me) with some interesting ideas that expand rather than repeat the tropes we're all familiar with. I walked out of the movie knowing that I liked it but I'm surprised by how much it's stuck with me. I look forward to seeing it again.",1
3740,"This is an amazing film. It ranks up there with Empire and the original Star Wars in my opinion. It took huge risks, expanded our understanding of the Force, and even somehow managed to cast the prequels in a refreshing new light.",1
3741,"I have a tremendous amount of stuff to say and not nearly enough characters, even with 5000. Bear with me as I try to quantify my thoughts and prioritize what I deem most important.To start small, there are plotholes abundant. From the 1.5 hour long pointless space chase to the casino planet subplot, it's all pointless. Vice Admiral Holdo withholds information from Poe simply for dramatic effect and General Hux refuses to send TIE Fighters to intercept Ackbar's capital ship because dramatic effect. The casino planet exists to interweave a theme of animal rights and the entire subplot does nothing, absolutely nothing, to the main plot. It's literally pointless. Then, after about 90 minutes of time wasted, we reach the climax of the film which lasts about 20 minutes and there is no actual battle.Then there's the lore breakers. For example, we see the Resistance (which I'm still not sure what they're ""resisting"") is reduced to a handful of starpilots and commanding officers. Why? This is a big galaxy, right? There was a Rebellion but 30 year prior. Where is everyone? That Rebellion was massive; so massive they won. The lore established by the Disney canon recognizes that billions, even trillions of Imperial citizens rose up to topple the Imperial Remnant and the First Order is all that remains. If anything, the First Order should be dwindling at this point. So why is the Resistance so flipping small? The Rebellion had millions of cells, as made clear in the TV series Rebels. It seems more likely all of this was manufactured for dramatic effect.I am ok with Star Wars going in a bold new direction. That's fine. That's encouraged. I do not want to watch the same trilogy twice. Give me something new. However, and this is a big point, don't undo the previous plot. This seems petty, I know, but then what's the point, story-wise, of the original trilogy? Everything ends up backfiring and failing. In destroying the world created from the original trilogy, you honestly make the original trilogy a waste of time. We have to have a coherent plot from point A to point B: Phantom Menace to Episode IX. This is (hopefully) not a whiny critique from a fanboy, but an honest one from the perspective of all nine episodes. We've now created a world where 1-6 are somewhat less important of a story. If you want to have a good series of movies, then each of the films play off of one another to create one large plotline that tells one big story: the Skywalker Saga, as Lucas put it back in the day. This seems to throw that out the window. 7-9 shouldn't be a new story but a continuation of the bigger plot from 1-6; otherwise make them anthology films. These are no longer episodes in a bigger story, but three films completely separate from the previous 6. I think they did for marketing purposes rather than to maximize story potential.Then there's Luke. He's received much criticism from the fanbase for being an inaccurate portrayal, even Mark Hamill has made it clear this is not who Luke Skywalker is, however, I'll throw that out the window. We'll disregard that the man who redeemed Darth Vader was about to kill his own sister's son because he was tempted by the dark. We'll manufacture a valid excuse and move on. However, I cannot forgive the fact that he nearly gets his ass beat by Rey, who apparently is the master of the Force despite having no training and they simply write that off because Yoda said ""nah, she's an expert already. No training needed. Don't question it."" Luke could have been utilized so well, but instead all we get is a mindless, pathetic, whiny old man who doesn't do much of anything and dies in the end for no reason except for, you guessed it, dramatic effect. (Remember Ackbar died so they could use Holdo to sell more toys?) Also what the hell did Chewbacca do?All in all, this film, while visually stunning, acted perfectly, and has some amazing moments, like Holdo's sacrifice (which could've been Ackbar, but oh well), fails to utilize the potential it had to tie itself in with the first six films and instead chooses to line the characters at the chopping block and throw the entire plot out the window. This along with the long space chase, lack of adventure, and pointless characters seems to be nothing more than a marketing ploy that sacrifices plot for drama. That being said, the actors do a spectacular job and, for the average moviegoer, it's impossible for me to give it a poor score because it's a stunning film in its own right, but for the Star Wars fan, or for anyone who cares about the larger plot of movie serieses, this is an utter failure.

3742,"The problem with The Last Jedi is The Force Awakens. That film had a nostalgic, ""feel good"" tone and brazenly meant to bring back ""everything you loved about Star Wars""-- especially stuff that was mostly missing from the prequels. The Last Jedi takes an almost diametrically opposed approach-- it wants to --question-- everything you love about Star Wars. It is easily the most (only?) postmodern mainline Star Wars film, which is not going to sit easily with some. Sure, it's still ""good guys vs. bad guys"", but it's also more complicated and deeper than that. It attempts to subvert a lot of what fans assume about Star Wars. In the end, though, it stays true to those ideals. What it should have done more effectively was try to explain to fans how and -why- those ideals and assumptions needed to be subverted. Especially in regard to the Force and exactly what powers it entails. Ultimately,the Last Jedi adds depth to the post-Lucas saga and doesn't skimp on the tried-and-true Star Wars elements, either. If The Phantom Menace was, as Lucas put it, a film for children, Last Jedi has more lofty ideas. Far more often than not, it expresses them impressively well. Where much of the poignancy of The Force Awakens was the result of genuine but not cheap nostalgia, here it feels more driven by story, character, and acting. If you want to pick apart the minutiae of what ""can or can't"" happen in space or plotting details, the fruit is there. As a space opera, The Last Jedi is more than good, and it's very good on several other levels, too. Reading in hindsight that Disney/Lucasfilm were literally making The Last Jedi up as they went along, without a predetermined vision or story arc for the new trilogy, makes sense, because in terms of tone and approach Disney pulled a bait-and-switch with The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.",1
3743,"I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 4 years old, in 1977. I was obsessed with this series. I played every video game, read every lousy ""Expanded Universe"" book. I suffered through the prequel trilogy, and the series lost its luster for me quite a bit. Then Disney took over from George Lucas's tired hands, and my childhood returned. The Force Awakens was quite well done, even if it was an overly safe and derivative copy of my original passion. Rogue One was absolutely spectacular in every possible way. But The Last Jedi? Rian Johnson subverted every expectation, and he did it without sacrificing ANYTHING that makes Star Wars what it originally was. People rating this badly were likely the same few who actually enjoyed the prequel drivel. This returned to the original style of simple, tight plots, strong humor, character-driven narratives and action, but at the same time took the story in entirely new directions. Simply the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back. Disney has returned me to my childhood, 40 years ago.",1
3744,"Not your dad's Star Wars for sure, but it delivers enough story development and action to get an OK. A bit too much on the comedy and the cutesy animals running around, some important twists were poorly thought out, but I still have to give it an extra point for the solid feminist aspects they put in. So all in all, good movie, worth a watch, not really the catastrophe some would have you believe it was.",1
3745,"For me, this is comfortably the best Star Wars film since the originals, and most probably the best Star Wars film ever made. If you're trying to get your head around the ridiculous user score you should bear in mind three things that are contributing to this backlash(against what is one of the best sci-fi films of the decade so far, remember):1. Certain fans believe they own this franchise, and any deviation from their mind-numbing check-list of 'things a Star Wars film must do' is met by the most pathetic, infantile tantrums outside of an actual kindergarten. They also believed that they had the plot of the film mapped out before release simply by studying the trailers, and when it turned out that they had been wrong-footed and in fact they didn't have a clue(none of us did), they took it as a personal insult. Just digest that fact: grown ups, who pretend they care about cinema, were angry that they weren't able to predict the plot in advance. They felt angry because a film surprised them. That should tell you something about the intellectual and artistic level at which some of these so-called fans operate, and it's not flattering. It's the kind of attitude that, if it were widespread, would kill all art, all entertainment, dead overnight.2. A lot of people feel justifiably angry towards the way this franchise is being handled by Disney, and The Last Jedi comes hot on the heels of the debacle that was Star Wars Battlefront 2; a hideously cynical, craven exercise in bleeding online gamers dry, and a PR disaster that left Disney and Electronic Arts(the company who published the game) with a whole lot of egg on their faces. As I say, it's perfectly reasonable to be angry towards Disney and their handling of the Star Wars brand. Simultaneously, it's completely irrelevant and has nothing to do with whether the film is good or bad.3. This third reason for much of the backlash is by far the most depressing, and it comes down to one thoroughly tedious and increasingly ugly little word: politics. The most scathing and unhinged of the criticisms have come from a troll army, whose size is hugely overinflated by the number of sockpuppet accounts involved, and their objection is that this is an 'SJW film', with a 'leftist bias'. They complain about the black character, Finn, they complain about the female lead, they complain when a female beats a man in the film, they complain when a black beats a white; and in case you think this is an exaggeration I was reading some of the comments at The Guardian, a newspaper with relatively reasonable commenters, and the first criticism came from someone complaining about the ""anti-slavery message"" in the film. That was the first issue with the film that came to his narrow little mind. For the record, the ""anti-slavery message"" is barely discernible, and melds naturally with the flow of the narrative. Indeed, it's represented by a couple of images that last, in total, about...ninety seconds? But as jaw-droppingly nasty and petty as that complaint is, it still represents the more tolerable end of the spectrum of entitled, alt-right-crackpottery. There is an avalanche of worthless right-wing whining about this film, and astonishingly, most of it makes that Guardian comment seem insightful - after all, it didn't talk about Rose Tico, a very likable new character, being fat and ugly and Asian, or complain about Finn being...ugh, I could go on, but why bother. Everyone knows what the worst of the internet is like - just imagine them coming after one of the best sci-fi films of recent years simply because they don't like a yucky gurl being the lead and you'll have captured the character of much of the criticism this film is receiving.So, those three reasons have coalesced to form a perfect storm of stupidity and ignorant, dullard banality, typified by someone setting up an actual petition to try and force Disney to stop making good Star Wars films. I can only hope that they ignore these very loud, very busy, utterly irrelevant basement-dwellers, and continue to allow creatives like Rian Johnson the freedom to make Star Wars films as funny, intense, surprising, exciting and exhilarating as The Last Jedi - because make no mistake, this is the real deal. A Star Wars film that's not just good 'for a Star Wars film' but actually stands on its own two feet as a dizzying, fizzing, cinematic joy-ride through everything that makes the Star Wars universe even vaguely interesting. It's a startling light-speed jump forward for a franchise that, after the underwhelming episode VII, seemed to be slowly settling into a comfortable, predictable orbit. Think of it as a little like Game Of Thrones's Red Wedding(only not as bleak, obviously): a reordering, and a signal to the viewer that whatever comes next, you won't be able to predict it just by watching the trailers.My rating: 9.5/10",1
3746,"People are silly....0's really? Quit trollin'. I am giving an honest 8.This is what it needs to be and that's different. The force awakens was good but played it way too safe. This one took risks. It was weird in great ways. It certainly stumbled in spots, but that didn't bother me because it wasn't pandering or patronizing...while the force awakens was. I got my money's worth. Diehards can nitpick about silly things, but they'll never be satisfied. Star wars was never about realism though, it was about fun. It's not Star Trek tightly bound to sci-fi seriousness or even physics. Star wars of our era has to push the envelope. It needs to change and take risks. It needs to surprise us and maybe challenge us or make us mad. I loved rogue one because it had nothing to live up to because all the characters were new, but this had everything to live up to...if they had stuck to some kind of formula it would have been boring. This was not boring. Watch it for yourself... and think about what star wars should be today?",1
3747,"I'm not quite sure why the movie is seeing so much hate from users. It seems people are merely upset over the fact that old characters are passing, and they no longer use unrealistic fight scenes from the prequels. Regardless, it's a good story with a great twist that may seem confusing to non-die-hard fans, or people who don't understand the force. I'll give it 9/10, because The Force Awakens deserves a 10/10 and Rain Johnson simply cannot recreate JJ Abrams story-telling ability.",1

They walked into the theater expecting a rush of nostalgia and instead they learned that their childhood is over and that this is the year 2017. Last Jedi is the first science fiction movie to suprize me in a while and it has succeeded in throwing out every cliched fan theory that the internet has been entertaining over the last two years. I didn't know much about Rian Johnson but I think he is one of the bravest blockbuster filmmakers around. He has breathed new life into a stagnant franchise by writing the first original story in years, creating a completely open playing field for the next instalment. P.S.

3758,"First of all, The Last Jedi has not only been the most divisive star wars film for me, but probably the most divisive ive ever seen. Ive seen it a total of five times and finally have a decent grasp of a conclusion. Fisrt of all, I think in total the good does outweigh the bad, but lets start with that first. The worst thing about this film is the story, a pretty big aspect of film. Half of the story is very strong, with Rey and Lukes story on the island and Kylo Rens story proving to be investing and delightful, however the canto bight subplot and the long chase between the resistance and the first order is a huge detriment. Lets start with Canto Bight. This is by far the worst aspect of this film. The whole sequence is so poorly executed, with our main characters Finn and Rose having zero chemistry together, and a waste of John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran's acting talent. The whole scene serves no purpose, as in the end the entire mission amounts to nothing, and it tries to deliberately beat you over the head with political messages. Also, it feels way too much like earth and something out of a completely different film and not part of the star wars universe, and not to mention completely tanks the pacing of the whole second act whenever it cuts back to it. The one good thing to come out of it is that it expands on the lore of the first order and how they shelled planets for testing, but that could of been explained anywhere. In terms of the resistance and first order chase, it eats up the runtime and just goes on for too long, when time could have been devoted to more important things. Onto the next issue, the new characters are garbage. Rose as a character feels forcedly hamfisted into the film, has a lack of backstory and in general does not need to be there. Admiral Holdo again serves no real purpose in the film as to set up a false sense of a traitor, and the worst character of all is DJ, played by Benicio del Toro, who is completely wasted in a stupid character again served to beat us over the head with messages. Onto the next negative, the pacing and the tone. The second act of this film drags... hard. The slow chase scenes and canto bight scenes grind the pacing to a halt, but tonal issues is a big problem, mainly regarding the humour. The majority of the humour in this film just does not work, comes across as so forced, and take you completely out of more serious moments. When Luke is handed the saber by Rey, weve waited two years to see his reaction, and instead it is played for a cheap gag just like most of the film does, and this further bridges the gap between comedy and drama, giving the film an unclear sense of what it wants to be and as a result has serious tonal issues. The last negative I feel is the lack of expansion to the lore set up in The Force Awakens, and when I say a lack of I meant a complete disregard for. The majority of setups introduced in the force awakens were completely scrapped. Snoke having no backstory before being killed, lack of knowledge on the knights of ren, how did R2 suddenly turn on, how did Maz come to possession of Luke's saber, how did Lor San Tekka obtain a piece of the map to Luke. These can be interpreted as plot holes but perhaps the biggest one of all is why Luke built a map to his location in TFA when he said in TLJ that he came to the island to die, which does not make sense. Lastly, there are many many story beats I feel have been copied from TESB and ROTJ. Rey sensing conflict in Kylo-Luke sensing conflict in Vader. Kylo bringing Rey to Snoke-Vader bringing Luke to the Emperor. Snoke showing Rey the fleet being destroyed-The Emperor showing Luke the fleet being destroyed. Rey finding a dark place on the island-Luke finding a dark place on Dagobah. Rey seeing herself in the dark place-Luke seeing himself in the cave in Vader's mask. I could give more but so many story beats are similar. Onto the positives now, the film feels like a breath of fresh air for the franchise in the way that it is constantly surprising and tears down your expecations for the franchise, and its impossible to be blown away by some sequences. The action and the way it is directed is absolutely beautiful, with the opening space battle, Rey and Kylo teaming up against the Praetorian Guards (one of the best scenes in the entire saga) Holdos lightspeed sacrifice and the final battle on Crait being particularly powerful sequences. The cast is universally brilliant-Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver giving magnetic performances. The existing characters are brilliant. Kylo Ren being a more complex character than ever, Rey's parent reveal being perfect as it shows her forging a path from a nobody to a powerful force user, and Luke being just as investing and humanised as ever. The score is also terrific, and in conclusion the directing in TLJ is beautiful, the action is roaring and the existing characters are expanded upon and more investing, but many drawbacks.",1

3760,"I have to admit, Kylo Ren stole the show, but he still fell just a hair short of my expectations. Of course, Rian Johnson is to blame for this. Even though he made risks to possibly create a phenomenal film, they fell flat. A lot of it doesn't have enough back story to support his vision, an you need more than tv shows and books to make a film's vision work. You simply need to put it in the film since that's where most audiences will be. Overall it is a decent film.",1

This movie made risky decisions... and they all paid off.Rian Johnson has directed and written some absolutely great works - including Brick and Looper, which are two films that have brilliant writing. I will admit that I was taken aback by the amount of humour in this movie, but that got me thinking, this Star Wars film has the most emotion of any film in the franchise. Everyone complained that The Force Awakens was a remake of A New Hope, but now everyone is complaining that this is not a remake of Empire Strikes Back. If anything, it's better. Why? Because for the first time it feels that a Star Wars film has dedicated time to actually fleshing out its characters, and the writing plays a huge part in that.Unlike previous films, there's no dodgy writing or cringe-inducing lines (there is potentially one, but in context it's a perfectly acceptable line), and we actually get to know the characters more - be it ones that have been introduced in this trilogy, or some of the original characters. Understandably Mark Hamill was disappointed by his new characterisation but I honestly believe that this was a fantastic performance; one which has notably annoyed the fanbase, to which I ask you, seriously? Luke Skywalker is no longer the young idealistic adventurer he was in the original films, he's a much darker character weathered by the sense of failure, bearing the burden of having to live up to weighted expectations (similar to the expectations of fans for this trilogy coincidentally...). As for the other characters, Kylo Ren might be the best written character in the franchise - he's a complex character who is conflicted, at once vicious and powerful but also showing a sensitivity and reluctance to his atrocities. The newly introduced characters, such as Rose and DJ, are also humanised, far more than any of the characters in the prequels.Story wise, this film has been criticised by the fans (again), which I must disagree with (again). As I had stated this was by far the most emotional Star Wars film I have seen. Although there were no single moments that matched the sadness of Han Solo's death in the preceding film, this was a film that had moments where I would laugh, cry and moments that left me in suspense. The story is quite straightforward in that it's actually quite minimal - the Rebels have to escape the First Order, Finn and Rose try to find a hacker to assist them, whilst Rey attempts to encourage Luke to train her and help his sister, all while Kylo Ren continues to struggle with his nature. This is a film that has plenty of plot, but is focused more on the emotional aspect. The effects are the real stars of this franchise though, and boy do they deliver. The action set pieces are exquisite, with the climactic battle being a visual treat.So what can I say? I enjoyed this movie, but I am aware that there is a fanbase out there that believes Disney has ruined the franchise to which I say ABSOLUTELY NOT! This is, in my honest opinion, the third best Star Wars movie - bested only by the first two, primarily because I have had years to reflect on those and only days to reflect on this one. You might think that my judgement is less informed, but I disagree. This was a film that made me think about it after I left the cinema, and it moved me as a good film often does. To those who despise this film, I advise you to engage with it properly, maybe then you will realise the brilliance of it and the genius of Rian Johnson for daring to take a risk. It might not be what you expected, but that doesn't mean it's bad.",1
3763,"I love Star Wars and this film exceeded my expectations.  I loved the pace of the film and was never ""bored"" with the film.  My main complaint is that I felt the movie spent too much time in space and didn't visit enough new planets.  I also didn't feel the same wonder I felt in previous Star Wars movie.  That being said, I loved Admiral Holdo and Rose.  My whole theater was silent when Holdo hyperspaced into Snoke's mother ship.  Many people disliked when Leia forced back into the ship but I was crying at that point and thought that it was pretty cool.  I feel the humor throughout the movie was done well and wasn't forced (no pun intended) like it was in The Force Awakens.  I was a little upset that they didn't cover Admiral Ackbar's death more, but that might be the fanboy talking.  Yoda's appearance was tasteful and I loved that they kept him in puppet form.  I didn't like Benicio del Toro's character and felt like Finn and Rose's relationship, while cute, was a little forced.  Phasma's death was as disappointing as her first appearance and I do hope that she didn't actually die.  I loved the Rey and Kylo fight scene and felt like Snoke's death made sense because they didn't want to create another emperor.  I don't think that Luke would ever considering slaying Ben Solo so that bothered me a little, but his death was done well and the ending was cute.  I hated porgs at first but kinda liked them at the end.  I know my review was all over the place but I had so many feelings from this movie!  It's my fourth favorite Star Wars movie and I would give it an 8.6 overall.",1
3764,"I think TLJ is the third best Star Wars movie.   It’s definitely the most interesting one.  When it's best, it's better than all the new movies, but it occasionally makes obvious missteps The Force Awakens didn't.   I’ll list my favorite parts of the movie, and then my criticisms.  Kylo Ren.   I didn’t like Kylo in TFA, mostly because he was some kid who kept losing his temper and didn’t seem particularly strong.   But Rian Johnson’s Kylo Ren is menacing and complex.  Kylo passed up the chance to murder his mother, but he was totally uninterested in saving the rebellion when he had the chance.   Kylo is able to hide his true intentions from Snoke, allowing him to kill Snoke.   But he’s also impulsive and easy to manipulate, as Luke shows towards the end.   Kylo Ren is my favorite new character in TLJ.   Rey is spunky, and Poe is charming, but Kylo is easily the most conflicted, multi-dimensional character left in the Star Wars universe.    For the most part, TLJ captures the tone and spirit of the original trilogy.   The amazing orchestral music.  The beautiful landscapes.   The brisk, tense battles.   Critically, TLJ doesn’t spend too much time on frivolous backstory, and instead lets its characters show who they are through current dialogue and actions.  These are all things the good Star Wars movies have done right.   And now, the bad parts:Star Wars has always blended drama with humor well, but under Rian Johnsons’ guidance, the humor sometimes falls flat, and the drama is heavy handed.   Everyone is a smart ass in TLJ.   All the time.   When I watched the movie, no one laughed when Luke threw the light saber Rey gave him over his shoulder.   It was too odd (and unoriginal) for a Star Wars movie.   I’d estimate that something like this happens at least 6 times in the film.   One critic who hated TLJ said that the movie was trying too hard to be like Guardians of the Galaxy.   I agree.   TLJ won’t age well because of this.   Yet by far the worse part about TLJ is how ham-fisted Rian Johnson’s drama is.   Star Wars has always been a black and white saga, but it was handled well in the original trilogy because Lucas’ messaging was subtle.   Okay, the Rebels were kind of like the Vietcong, and the Empire was kind of like the Nazis, but not really.   People don’t call Darth Vader their favorite movie villain because he’s like Hitler.   Subtle messaging allows your characters to transcend petty editorializing, and take on lives of their own.   Rian Johnson apparently doesn’t know this.   The end of the move, where a kid stares into space because he feels hope, is an example of this.   It's already been beaten over our heads that the rebellion represents hope.  What the audience needs to see is the main characters, the people they actually got to know and learned how to relate to, feel hope.  Think of the powerful last scene in Empire where Luke, Leia, and co. were staring into space.   It resonates with the audience because we know we’ll be on that journey with them.   Unless Disney makes a new Star Wars movie every year for three decades, no one is going to make a movie about the slave kid.   He’s a pawn in Rian Johnson’s sentimental Hallmark movie scene.   And seriously, how many times do we need to hear that we don’t need the past?   Rey doesn’t need old Jedi wisdom, because it’s already in her?  **** gag me.   Transcending the past would be a more convincing theme if it wasn’t also Kylo Ren’s motivation for murdering his dad.  And don’t even get me started on TLJ’s adolescent take on arms dealing and rich people.  Conservative critics have gone too far in dismissing TLJ as SJW propaganda.  But if they could stop overstating their case, they would have a point.   TLJ definitely goes out of its way to be feminist.  There is never, ever, a guy rescuing a girl in the heat of a battle.  Rey saves Kylo from Snoke’s elite guards.   Rose saves Finn.   Also, there is conspicuously no male leadership in the Rebellion.   Contrast this with The First Order, which is almost exclusively white and male, especially their leadership.   Patronizing is the nicest thing one can say about Johnson’s portrayal of gender.   TLJ's shallow, rah-rah feminism is hard not to un-see, but still easy to get over since there is so much else going on in the movie.The only surprising thing about Johnson’s messaging is that Finn kissed a girl, and not Poe.  Finally, I was disappointed in Johnson’s Luke Skywalker.   Again, it’s mostly due to Johnson generally being as subtle as Donald Trump’s Tweets.  I don’t mind old and crusty Luke.   But Luke’s twisted face in both of the unnecessary scenes where he's standing over Kylo Ren with a lightsaber highlights how ugly luke was.    Again, I liked TLJ.   It’s also a lot easier to talk about the things you didn’t like than the ones you did. I need to see TLJ again to refine my take.  I look forward to it.",1
3765,I loved it. I think people are nitpicking it to death. Just enjoy the movie.,1
3766,"This was an interesting Star Wars movie. The story follow a certain logic and push it to it's limit. The characters are flawed in that story almost all of them, and I would say it's the theme of the story. Most of the movie is on a timer, which make every scenes counts in terms of pace. But you go to Rey and Luke from time to time, which slow down the timer. It's like watching two movies with two different paces, that get to assemble in the end. That's an unusual style and some might not like it, but it works well in my opinion. The FX are all amazing from space to on planet. Some of the distant scenes between Rey and Ben, later Luke are done with simplicity and are very efficient that way. Even the creatures feels more organics to their surroundings. I found interesting that some powers can be used in both ways. There might be debates that Luke in the end use a power from the Dark Side. But like he implied they are not all exclusive to one side of the force or one person. In the end, I wasn't very satisfied with Rey parentage or lack of good explanation regarding her powers. Although Yoda says she already know everything...at this point any explication would come too late to be satisfying. I wasn't badder by any critters, I didn't mind them. They provided good humor at key times, in a very serious film. But there was a lot to digest in this movie, maybe too much...The role of Del Toro was a little bit out of place but yet logical in the circumstances. His role was intriguing and very well acted on his part. I would love to see more...I give it a 85%. Second view: I though that the Leia in space scene wasn't particularity good, in a sens that if she did received training they could have mentioned it, but out of the blue...that's a hard sell. I was intrigue that the First Order didn't hyperspace the rebel fleet in front of them but decided to wait for them to exhaust their fuel. I think it's the first time we see that resources in Star Wars are valuable in space. Meaning spaceship, energy...risking small ships doesn't mean much for them (as long as they are in range) but obviously the big one are much more precious and limited to move. The same did apply with the Rebels fleet. So, I appreciated that Johnson put some realistic notions to space (including the X-Wing turning and acceleration). Luke did use the same power as Snoke in the end, but he did it in much larger scale. It follow a certain logic that he payed for it. And Ren, well...he acted just like a Sith. He killed his master (after Snoke insulted his intelligence), try to get an apprentice. I still think that Rey wasn't a nobody, I think Ren was just trying to use her negative feelings. Anyway I enjoy it a second time.",1
3767,"It has a deep message with some of the best lines in the franchise. It is also visually stunning and just fun to watch. The movie isn't bad when things don't go as we predict. And I don't understand why some are giving it under 5 points. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely, I personally think it is one of the best Star Wars movies, but this is just my opinion.",1
3768,"This is by far one of the top two Star Wars Movies! I needed a second go, but then: oh wow! It's very entertaining at it's surface, but has a lot of layers, symbolism and a brilliant meta layer. I love it more and more! For an old fan from the 70's and a film buff this is a very emotional ride for me. Fore most I love the development of Rey, Poe and especially Kylo Ren.",1
3769,I was extremely moved by this story. It made me believe that all life is connected and that I should do what is right against any odds. The visual presentation was breathtaking and I really believed it.,1
3770,One of the best Star Wars movies.Emotional diversity and change.Great scenario flow and final scenes.Great visuals and effects.And everybody's very successful acting.Seriously loyal,1
3771,"Wonderful filmmaking and brilliant storytelling. The first time I watched this movie I felt confused and started picking it apart. I thought there were gaping holes and unexplained or unnecessary plot devices, but instead of settling on that I went back for repeat viewings. Once the shock of everything that happens was no longer a factor, I started to notice the nuances of the story. This movie doesn't beat you over the head with its ideas, but all the bits I thought had holes turned out to have been in front of my nose the whole time. Every question I had about why a character did what the did was there for me, in a part of the film.This film will divide the fans from the fanatics, and that's okay. In any case, drop your preconceived notions and expectations, and let the story take you in. See it a few times to get all the bits you didn't get the first time. You'll be glad you did.",1
3772,"Ante todo, quiero expresar que respeto cada una de las opiniones (aunque algunas no las comprenda).The Last Jedi ha sido una de las pocas películas que me mantuvo al borde del asiento, haciendo que las más de dos horas se hicieran cortas, una entrega distinta con su propia estampa, la franquicia pedía esto luego de siete episodios, una precuela (Rogue One), y varias series de televisión. El lema es: ""Cada generación tiene una historia"" y en parte tiene razón, pero siempre bajo una misma línea, esta grandiosa leyenda necesitaba un refresco y eso lo entendió hasta el mismísimo George Lucas cuando decidió venderle los derechos a Disney porque comprendió que todo ciclo tiene su fin, es la ley de la vida, y el suyo terminó con las precuelas. No por esto hay que olvidar a George, siempre estaremos agradecidos de haber creado este fenómeno que se adueñó de los corazones de niños, adolescentes y adultos. Los críticos (público general) no les agradó de The Force Awakens argumentando que tomó demasiadas cosas del episodio IV, ahora los que están en contra de The Last Jedi apuntan que parece una película independiente, por alejarse de la línea de las originales (a mí no me parece tan así).Ciertamente este episodio ocho va tomando va tomando un camino distinto del habitual, y como lo vengo diciendo es necesario luego de cuarenta años, o sino disney hubiese remasterizado la primera trilogía y listo. ¿Eso es lo que quieren? Yo no.Lo que más me agradó de The Last Jedi es que no es otra película de Hollywood donde los buenos están bajo presión durante toda la película y en el tramo final de la nada consiguen revertir la situación, pues Rian Johnson no lo quiso así, acá no hay un claro dominio del ""bien"" o ""mal"", y nos enseña que todo objetivo requiere de mucho sacrificio y dolor para lograrlo.------- SPOILERS --------¿Cuál es el verdadero enojo del público?En lo personal, creo que la gente que salió disgustada fue porque no se cumplió la teoría que la mayoría esperaba sobre el linaje de Rey, decisión a la cual aplaudo. ""Dinámica de lo impensado"" esta frase no aplica solo para el fútbol, para tener éxito muchas veces hay que arriesgarse, aunque habrá gente que no les guste ese estilo, pero a muchos otros sí. No hay nada de malo que Rey sea hija de unos ""don nadie"" acaso que para que la fuerza se manifieste debes ser obligatoriamente de un linaje heroico? Como lo dejó claro Luke, la fuerza no es sólo levantar rocas o usar un sable de luz, la fuerza es todo lo que rodea a esa galaxia lejana que es el poderoso aliado de los desamparados, de aquellos que a pesar de su situación crítica prevalecen con esperanza (como es el caso de Rey que a pesar de los años, ella seguía esperando a su familia en Jakku). Ciertamente a Rey le faltó algo de entrenamiento, pero si nos vamos a ese punto, Luke no terminó su entrenamiento tampoco en el episodio V y pudo por lo menos combatir a Darth Vader. No entiendo como hay gente que compara esta película con los primeros tres episodios, esos episodios sí se alejaron totalmente de lo que en realidad es Star Wars llenando la pantalla de política, diálogos innecesarios y romance al estilo de Romeo y Julieta. Acá empieza un nuevo trayecto donde se pone fin a la política y al ámbito religioso, y comienza la esperanza. LO MEJOR DE LA PELÍCULA- El desarrollo de los personajes; sobretodo Kylo Ren, Rey, Luke, Poe y Leia.- Lo impredecible de la trama- Efectos visualesLO QUE NO ME GUSTO- Desenlace de Snoke- Falta de explicación de algunos tópicos.En general, yo concuerdo con la crítica de los expertos, una maravillosa película.﻿",1
3773,"If not for the decades long advantage Star Wars and Empire have in influence and in burrowing into my heart, I do think this would easily be my favorite of the series. Allowing that it's built upon countless ideas that came before, this might be the most exquisitely crafted of them all, from its individual moments to its unprecedented thematic strength. Every member of its sprawling cast is written sharp as a knife, many of them making a huge impression despite debuting in this chapter. Even in extremely judicious doses, Rian Johnson manages to find maybe the best ever moments for such mainstays as C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewbacca, and...well, to go on listing might be telling.The control of tone is assured, veering from some of the funniest beats of a very funny series (don't let anyone tell you otherwise!) to high stakes action and surprisingly intimate drama, without one mode ever compromising another. The story choices are genuinely thrilling, taking us to places you never would have guessed were ""allowed,"" and Johnson continually finds new ways to awe in organically expanding what a Star Wars movie can do.Some viewers have ""cleverly"" pointed out that a certain subplot seemingly has no bearing on the rest of the story (the same type who will smugly tell you that Raiders of the Lost Ark didn't ""need"" Indiana Jones) but I am here to tell you that movies are more than plot, and the character development, thematic exploration and sense of whimsy and adventure in each of the plots is very much worthwhile, and crucial to the overall effect of the film.This is all building to a finale that hinges on the embrace of myth, storytelling, and inspiration, with an all-time great poignant coda that is nothing less than the story of STAR WARS itself. If they were ever going to stop making these things, the final moments of this film would be the perfect coda to the whole series.I must admit I am somewhat baffled by the vocal segment of fandom for whom this movie did not work, though I don't doubt the sincerity of their reactions. I won't claim to understand where everyone is coming from (and I'm sure there are many angles both supporters and detractors are coming from) but I imagine some might enjoy it more if they looked at the movie less as the sum of what happens in it and how ""good"" it is for the characters they love, and gave themselves more fully to how it all happens and what it means.. or perhaps if they were more comfortable laughing along with something and still taking it seriously, or with the movie working to earn awe in ways for which there is no precedent or shorthand.It may just come down to some fans valuing different things in their Star Wars than I do, and that's okay. I will never understand how some apparently feel that the film is ""insulting"" to a character like Luke Skywalker -- to me it was a more loving, triumphant, fitting and poignant use of that character than I could have hoped for. I don't expect all those upset to come fully around to how I feel, but I do hope some of them get a taste of it eventually, because from where I'm sitting we have a truly exceptional movie. I've now seen almost 300 films that came out this year, and this may go down as my favorite of them all.",1
3774,"This is a very good Movie, that give to the trilogy the epic twist that it needs, it show with the script the strong of the movie and that the future with the StarWars-Universe its a mistery,maybe its not all the things that a hardcore fan wants to see, but it doesnt matter from what angle you see, you cant denied that it is a wonderful movie.",1
3775,"Amazing! One of the best Star Wars ever. This is the best Luke we have seen, Hamill crushes it! Kylo Ren was much better written in this one as well and Adam Driver has done a great job of breathing life into the character. Final act is mind blowing, just such an awesome fan service!",1
3776,"Only the dudebros or the uneducated don't get this movie.  It is a nuanced, intelligent film that has gone over the heads of, at this time of writing, 1,333 metacritic users.  The complaints that the film is geared toward getting a broader audience demographic is sheer sexist nonsense from those who don't want to see women in power.  The issues people have with Luke not coming out of retirement to laser-sword Snoke, Ben Solo, and the rest of the first order is a bunch of kids being butthurt that their fantasies haven't been fulfilled.  They would set aside all of Luke's history - has lack of training, his stubbornness, his defeatism - and turn him into a powerhouse Jedi saviour.  Well folks, it doesn't work that way.  This movie captured his flaws perfectly and developed a reasonable outcome from those issues.  Best movie of the new series so far and sets the universe up for an incredible finale in Star Wars 9.",1
3777,"I’m a longtime fan since the 80sI I thought this was the better film than the force awakens.Many of the complaints I’m reading on year are completely baseless. Do people even understand the definition of a plot hole? Anyhow I can understand why people didn’t like it, but 0 or 1 gimme a break.",1
3778,"This is the first truly brave movie in the Star Wars franchise, so I can easily understand why so many fans dislike it. It's really made as the middle part of the trilogy, so I expect the third one to round it all off, and then The Last Jedi should make much more sense to everybody. Apart from a few disappointing scenes and the long run time, I liked it very much and appreciate the director's brave approach.",1
3779,"Good Movie, not great.  All, All, all of the humor failed. I didnt chuckle one time. Enough with the cute little animal crap. dumb.  There is a ton to nit pick about but i dont feel better as a human bashing everything around me like so many. I'll just try to enjoy the good parts and rate my experience. Better than the prequels...what isnt. but not as good as rogue one...",1
3780,"Although it felt very sped along at times I enjoyed the movie overall.  I felt Laura Dern's character and Rose were shoehorned in.  Those characters needed some character development.  When Rose was injured and Laura Dern's character suicides I just had zero feeling about them. The special effects were A+ as always and the Rey/Kylo Storyline was decent.  While I can understand some of the more passionate fanboys disappointment, I think we just have to take these movies for what they are.  (not original canon)",1
3781,I really enjoyed watching this movie. It is exciting and very fun to watch. It has some great plot twists. One of my favourites.,1
3782,"It could be a masterpiece. Visually impeccable, with a cast of very good actors, (Luke and Leia) really exceptional. Too bad that the story seems to be written by a child of 5 years, enormous ingenuity, unforgivable omissions, and above all very little respect for the iconic figures of the past, which are literally killed badly. Some scenes like the ""flight"" of Leia and the absurd death of Snoke, and the absurd rescue of Finn by Rose, are horrible and cinematically unwatchable. A pity, all this material in the hands of a more capable director (for example Abrams himself) could really make sparks !!! At this point, all that remains is to seriously pray that Abrams in episode 9 will return to more obscure and epic tones for a finale that brings back decency and luster to such an important series. And, please, stop with the bubbly humor and jokes worthy of the worst comic film. Star wars is not Space Balls. Please",1
3783,"Better than TFA, not as good as Rogue One, still better than all the prequels and falls short of the originals. Solid flick all around, though nothing amazing, though it looked great. Fanboys can be funny giving it 1's and 0's, average at its very worst.",1
3784,Good very good would watch again 8 out of 10 it was good. It is fun for the whole family,1
3787,"Get ready to read. I have a lot to say. When Supreme Leader Snoke said ""Darkness rises and light to meet it,"" he wasn't kidding. Never before have I seen a film that is such a bewildering blend of brilliance and idiocy. Half of Star Wars: The Last Jedi works wonderfully and the other half is just brainless. I don't understand people who refuse to admit that there's anything wrong with the movie not do I understand those who refuse to admit that anything about it was good.There's a lot to say and I won't get to all of it here, but I'll start with what worked. By far the best aspect of The Last Jedi is the character arcs of Rey and Kylo Ren. The bond that they form is an intellectually gripping one. Kylo Ren is a fantastic villain because he is so easily understood. It's elaborated in great detail how everyone in his life has failed him and in the end he really comes across as sympathetic and his goals make a lot of sense--so much so that Rey is tempted to join him. When evil is able to take the form of something logical and enticing, that's when you know it's been portrayed in the most effective possible way. Rey's character serves to anchor the film in its themes of disappointment, failure, redemption and heroism. Throughout the story she comes to realize that she has been placing her hope in false perception of others and that she--despite her humble origins--is no less valuable or capable than even the highest-ranking leaders. She acknowledges, like Kylo Ren, that the past certainly has its moments of shame and failure. But she goes beyond his mindset of ""killing the past"" by recognizing that there are still good things worth protecting and she takes the responsibility of protecting the light upon herself. It's a powerful character arc--one of the best in the entire saga--and makes the film's deep themes all the more thought-provoking.The Last Jedi is a gorgeous-looking movie. I believe it to be the most visually stunning of the franchise. Rian Johnson's use of color, sound, and diverse camera work makes the galaxy look better than it ever has before.Many people dislike the humor of the new Star Wars films, but I enjoy it. What's wrong with injecting a little lightheartedness into the story? The original trilogy had its dark moments with some humorous moments thrown in there as well. The jokes in The Last Jedi are mostly funny but also are never excessive to the point of losing out on the poignant narrative.Everyone seems to think that there are a ton of plot holes in The Last Jedi, but what they really mean is that there are some unanswered questions, and that's not the same thing. Just because things are left unexplained does not make them plot holes, and if you need to be spoon-fed the deeper logic of every single additional force power and space warfare tactic explored here than thinking critically about them, then you are a dumb viewer. The Star Wars universe is rich with lore from novels, guides, the animated series' and more. Nearly all unanswered questions can be answered by these things. If every odd-seeming thing were to be completely elaborated upon in this film, it would have made the movie several hours longer. After a lot of thinking, I don't think any of the new abilities or aspects added in The Last Jedi are problematic in any way, except for maybe hyperspace ramming. If this is possible, why hasn't it been used before, if it's so effective? But I digress. Now for what didn't work.The entire subplot on Canto Bight in the casino was completely unnecessary. It made the film about 20 minutes too long and added nothing to the characters' development or even to the plot itself. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who believes otherwise.The character of Rose is by far the worst character in the film, arguably the worst in the entire saga. She's unfunny, annoying, underdeveloped, and obliterates Finn's potential-filled character arc. Finn should have been allowed to follow through on sacrificing himself when he was doing the suicide-run to destroy The First Order's cannon. It would have been a spectacular farewell to him as he has spent the last two films learning to overcome fear and to embrace selflessness and would have died completing his journey. Instead, we get the half-baked line about how we need to ""not kill what we hate, but save what we love,"" even though the only way to save what you love is by killing what opposes it, but whatever. There are so many parts of this film that were building up to something incredible and moving that just don't follow through--characters that could have been so much more compelling but were missing something essential (motivation, resolution, etc.). It makes the Last Jedi a very disappointing film because it does have some ingenious aspects but just missed the mark on so much that is ends up being just okay.Story: 5.5Acting: 8.5Script: 6.5Visuals/Sound: 10Entertainment Value: 7OVERALL SCORE: 7.5/10",1

3789,star wars VII has an excellent realization and feels beautiful emotions while re-enacting the star wars formula,1
3790,"The Last Jedi finally gave the fans what it was craving:  a new direction to a franchise that, while not tired, was in danger of entering into the ""hey let's do that thing again"" trap.  Sets up hopefully more surprises in Episode IX by giving JJ Abrams a clean slate to work with.  Bravo!",1
3791,"The Last Jedi was shot beautifully it had amazing characters , sure Rose and Phasma are flawed but they tried their best. I had to the say the best character's were Luke Skywalker , Leia Organa , Rey , Kylo Ren , Poe , DJ , Finn , and Admiral Holdo. The humor , the action , and the emotion in the Last Jedi is fantastic. It's not a perfect movie it has flaws like the casino scene and Snoke's death don't get me wrong that scene was amazing but now we don't get to know more about him which disappoints me. Overall this movie is fantastic definitely worth for your time. Definitely top 3 in my ranking.",1
3792,"Awesome ! They took the hard bet to try and give Star Wars a deserved evolution. Not a revolution though : you're still looking at a pure Star Wars movie. But things are evolving and that's great ! After dreaming with the first trilogy in the 80's, smiling and travelling with the prelogy, this new trilogy is (for now) the perfect follow up ! Let's hope Episode 9 will be as good !",1
3793,"Felt the need to write after reading both positive and negative reviews. It's amazing how many are saying (in Comic book nerd voice) ""worst Star Wars movie ever""...really??? Expectations are always astronomical with a film like this and while I don't think it captured what TFA did, it does have a roller coaster of emotions and keeps you on the edge for most of the film. Star Wars has always been filled with one liners and humor in tense situations. People are acting like this is some new aspect that has tainted the series. Get a grip and come back to enjoying movies like you did when you were a child. It is seriously like no one is pleased with anything anymore and feel they could do it better and can't wait to feel validated with even more negativity on sites like these. Oh, and go see it because it's the most fun you will have at the theaters this year.",1
3794,"All of these 0 scores are because everyone went into the movie with all their theorys and expectations. And when the movie didnt go the way they wanted it to go, the response is angry 0 reviews.Great movie, it destroys expectations, but not in a bad way. It was good for the storytelling aspect of star wars. Because why watch a film knowing whats going to happen? That doesnt sound very fun. Great direction, Great plot, Perfect sprinkle of humour in it, and twists expectations enough so it is a movie where you could get surprised at, you could get excited for because you didnt already guess what was gonna happen.",1
3795,"On one level, I get where the backlash is coming from (it's at least partially bots), but the things that are upsetting some fans are why The Last Jedi works so well. The very first line in the previous movie was ""this should begin to put things right"" and Episode VII did just that. It was basically a remake, but it restored faith in a series that many had felt lost it's way with the prequels.If you were to encapsulate this movie in a single line it would be ""this isn't going to go how you think"" and the movie opens by defying all expectations, where some of the first dialogue is one of our heroes making fun of one of our villains. We're basically picking up from right after where the last movie left us, with the Resistance abandoning their base as they're hunted down by the first order. After an exhilarating space battle, we pick up with Luke and Rey, on a remote island. It's not two seconds since the last movie ended, and once again, your expectations are challenged when Luke Skywalker takes his lightsaber and casually tosses it over his shoulder and goes back to being a hermit, despite Rey's insistence that he train her. The movie continues on like that through all kinds of major twists and turns, which eventually upend much of what was set up in the previous film and leaves us in a spot where we are set up to once again be surprised by whatever is in store for the next installment.",1
3796,"""What are you looking at me for? Follow him!""I think that line is what a lot of the haters of this film didn't got. Stop trying to get back to the past and accept the future. This movie is diferent from anything we've seen from this franchise until now. Being the 9° film in a franchise and introducing new concepts is pretty bold. I admired that and i didn't have a problem with any of the new concepts so that helps.Yep, i've gotta admit this movie is not perfect. Being Star Wars i can easily overlook some minor issues, like two or three lines that don't feel quite right, some underdeveloped characters or del Toro's stupid accent but it's a little difficult to overlook a whole sequence. The Canto Bight part felt kinda prequel-ish to me.I belive i've never been as enthralled in film as when i first saw The Last Jedi. I don't recall feeling like this with any other film. I couldn't blink afraid to miss something. Every character interaction amazed me and when there was a big revelation i had butterflies in my stomach. This sent shivers down my spine countless times. I was dezzled- and actually, i still am.On rewatch The Last Jedi is still amazing. Williams' score and Johnson's direction shine even more. This is Johnsson's expression, it's a piece of art. Some of what i felt the first time is lost, of course, that was something special and i hope i can feel that again with Episode XI or another film. Because that is why i watch movies. To feel. And this movie shook every bone in body and made feel through out every scene. This movie reminded me why i watch and love movies and my experience with it was really special.""God speed, Rebels""",1
3797,"On a scale of Empire Strikes Back to The Emoji Movie, I give it A New Hope. The action scenes are very fun (Especially the opening dreadnought scene), Mark Hamill's role as Luke is very good and makes it genuinely seem like ""Yes, this is a hero to a galaxy, who imposed exile on himself out of shame of nearly killing a student."", and the film generally does a lot of things right. There are a few flaws however. The film is only 2 1/2 hours long, but it feels like almost double due to the nature of one of the main plot points (Everything that's left of The Resistance is on a ship being chased by The Supremacy, the 1st Order flagship. The Resistance ship is just out of range, and is continuously flying away.) Also, HOW THE **** DOES THE SCENE WITH LEIA IN SPACE WORK? Those 2 issues keep it from giving me a perfect 10, but it's still a great film to me.",1
3798,"Rian Johnson successfully created a thrilling and suspense cinematic experience that are rare for huge franchise like this. The movie is filled with beautiful cinematic shots that are satisfying to watch in the theaters.However, Star Wars 8 failed to tell a complete story. With some scene completely unnecessary, it destroyed the suspense that was built up, such as the Casino scene. The entire plot of Star Wars 8 alone is pretty shallow as they are trying to reveal everything in Star Wars 9, which is the last of the trilogy. However, this not only created a boring Star Wars 8 plot-wise, but will also cause Star Wars 9 to be too rushed to reveal everything. Not to mention that Kylo Ren is the weakest, least threatening villain of all Star Wars movies. Because of this, the movie lack of tension during the fight scene of Kylo Ren. Overall, it is an enjoyable movie, but definitely not as good as critics claimed.",1
3799,"This is a great movie, albeit a little different from other Star Wars movies in many respects. However, it is pure entertaining joy - sweeping, grand stakes space adventurism. The movie runs a bit long, and not everything works very well, but most is strong enough to carry the day. The dynamics between Rey and Ren are worth the price of admission alone (especially when it includes space battles). This movie is polarizing; it throws away old conventions and plays fast and loose with treasured characters. I wonder what the real user score would be if you eliminated all the reviews that gave it a ""0"" because it plays to ""SJWs"" (i.e. it had a lot of strong female characters and leaders, gasp!).",1
3800,"I am beyond thrilled to see where Star Wars is going. In my opinion, this is the best Star Wars movie outside the original three (Ep. 4-6). You can tell that Rian Johnson not only respects but appreciates the SW universe. The Last Jedi is close enough and pays enough homage to Empire that it feels comfortable or well known. Except it's not. It deviates in all the best ways becoming something almost entirely new. There are so many great SW stories out there and we're just beginning to scratch the surface of them. The future is very bright for SW with directors like these.",1
3801,"I'm giving it a great review to counterbalance all of the negatives.  I don't understand the negativity.  It's not perfect, and could use a bit of editing, but it's as fun and watchable as the last one.  I enjoyed seeing Luke Skywalker again, and I have to say Mark Hamill's acting has improved enormously since the original movies.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are also strong performers and are interesting to watch.",1
3802,"I would say it was a good a movie, but some triggered fanboy might go **** on me over an opinion. So, here it goes…it was amazing. In many ways, the real critics nowadays are making more valid points compared to the average Americans who think BVS is better than Civil War. I am no big Star Wars fan, and I recognize some correlations with the old films, but nevertheless has the brilliance of hyperspace taking out an entire fleet far outweighed whatever flaw came in hand for a great film like this one.",1
3803,"It was okay, not as good as Part 7 and Rogue One. But I won't give it a negative review, because it's still not a bad movie. There were some things that I didn't like, but it's still not a 0-3, come on.",1
3804,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great film with stunning visuals, great acting, and beautiful cinematography. Rian Johnson really delivered with this flick. Not saying it's perfect, there's a good quarter of it that could and should have been cut out, but it's solid, for the most part.",1
3805,"The problem with Episode 7 was they were afraid to do new things, and I think that a lot of the new statements and lore in episode 8 unsettled some people because it was different. But it was done so well and the new characters, plot lines and development hit better then episode seven. Not without a few faults and plot issues though.",1
3806,"The Last Jedi is not what I expected.Whiles at first it was a shock, I came to realize that TLJ takes all the canon lore about the force and uses it. often all at once.It not only continues the plot of Ep7 but deepens that of the PT and OT, whiles finishing threads left unfinished in TCW.No plot holes are in the movie, every single negative complain has either been towards the humour (something subjective) or how Luke was made shown to be more complex and emotional, as someone who takes responsibility for his mistakes.The other ''issues'' are simply user error or forced hate.The plot holes that go mentioned online a lot are nothing more than plot-points.",1
3807,"Surprising, mystical, smart, poetic and visually gorgeous. I absolutely loved it.",1
3808,"Well i loved it, don't understand why its getting so much **** One of the best Star Wars film to date for me (I was not payed to say that). At its core its a story about hope.Things i love; Kylo Rens progression in to one of the best villains in a movie i have seen for a long time. I can't wait to see more of him, Adam Driver was brilliant. Rey and Lukes scenes are excellent, i like how Luke is training her why not to be a Jedi. The space battles and fight chirography are insanely good; especially the scene were Kylo and Rey are fighting Snokes guard together. All the actors are brilliant, direction and cinematography were also awesome. Things i didn't like; Snoke, altough i loved how he met his end (his arrogance basically got him killed) you did't really find out who the hell he was. Phasma was sort of wasted villain as well, i think she needed much more screen time to grow. I think this film is getting to much criticism, Leia has also used the force many times before,  a lot in a few of the books and in the previous films. Its not a stretch of the imagination that instincts took over at the point where she was about to die. I don't think it deserves a 0/10, (i say this a lot on metacritic) if you try hard enough you can find positives in any film.",1
3809,"I don't understand all the hate this movie is getting. I'm a star wars fan, like i love the original trilogy (i didn't care for prequels and i was 12 when phantom menace came out and thought it was stupid then - oh and numerous fights with the community about that), I didn't collect the plastic **** but played a lot of SW games, saw the movies a whole lot of times - the 1997 VHS edition. - I'm saying that only becasue there seems to be some kind of argument emerging that states that the movie offends fans in general. - But I love this movie and in a huge part due to all the things people seem to hate. I was surprised and mostly pleasently and went with it. How exciting to shift the focus to new characters and make them crux of the drama rather then hinge on expected revelations, loved the death of snoke not because I like wanted him dead but when it happened I loved that scene and the lead up to it... (like genuine drama in star wars? i thought it couldn't happen anymore) and completly driven by character dynamics. and it's not without flaws, it's too long and some plot twists and parts of narrative (the peripheral ones mostly) are too convenient and too cute, some points too hamfisted, jokes seem to, at times, interfere with a serious nature of some scenes, the sort of unorthodox (for sw) ticking clock premise (running out of fuel)... how ballsy... not very star wars-y but didn't mind that (it was like a submarine hunt or something). But now I'm really excited for new episode and how they're gonna resolve the story, which I was not, comming out of force awakens, really... and I like that movie even thou it's too derivative but that was kind of a point of it. So for me it's 8/10 but to balance the force I have to give it a perfect rating as to mitigate the overblown negativity it's recieving.",1
3810,"Thank you Rian Johnson for this masterpiece .Visually, Is the most beautiful in the entire saga.",1
3811,"There is a lot about this movie that many people do not understand. Some of them willfully so. This is a movie about guilt and doubt and fear, much like The Empire Strikes Back. Yet it also progresses the thematic content of the Star Wars franchise.The reveal of Rey's parents is not just the writer/director trolling the audience, this has an important message. The idea that Star Wars should be about a super special lineage is extremely problematic. The idea that the Force is the power that connects everything is antithetical to this kind of power and authority through succession mentality. It's this very mentality, combined with his nature as a rageaholic bloodthirsty control freak, that makes Kylo Ren a true villain. And what this movie is saying is that Rey exists specifically to undermine that. Rey is the expression of the Force's will to say that ethos is wrong.",1
3812,"This is the best Star Wars film. And almost the best scifi-fantasy film of all time. If you hate it, you're the guys who want to see only Jedi fighting with lightsaber, or X-wing shooting another aircraft in the film... And it indicates that you're watching the film like children, so far with critics' emotion.",1
3813,The first Star Wars movie that is thought provoking instead of just entertainment.,1
3814,"OK, so i like the film. Oh boy, here comes the wave of dislikes from the whiny Star Wars fanbase.",1
3815,"I hated Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It was awful film that felt less like Star Wars and more like another Marvel film. The Last Jedi surprised me thought. Providing very enjoyable Star Wars experience more similar to that of Star Wars games like KOTOR or Jedi Knight series. It felt good, it was intriguing even though that Rey still is a shallow character as in previous film and even though Kylo is so emotionally unstable that he would put Mel Gibson to shame, I liked his character. Biggest down side is the humour which reeks of Disney, and the fact that many questions have been left unanswered. Too many in fact. But overall this film was good and I'm happy to see that Rian Johnson is coming back to direct the next trilogy.",1

3819,"I only registered for this just to add another positive review. The negative reviews for this... well the fact that most of them are ‘1’ or ‘0’ just shows you how stupid and unobjective people are capable of being when they’re supposed to be reviewing a movie which at the very least is very well made. So what are they really doing. Venting their spleen because they live in their own little fantasy world of how their favorite movie series should pan out and it didn’t happen the way they would’ve wanted. Well, boo-bloody-hoo. Wake up! There’s a whole world of cinematic works of art out there and this is one of them. This is the most truly adult of the Star Wars movies. Nowhere near as much of the old good-cowboys-wear-white-hats and bad-cowboys-wear-black-hats as usual, and it’s miles better for it. Not only a refresh the franchise needed to stay relevant, but a great movie too.",1
3820,"Rian Johnson hits it out of the park with The Last Jedi. Perfect on every level, this is the single most character-driven Star Wars movie--with far more compelling character arcs than the OT, the prequels, or the other Disney movies--it also has highly inventive action sequences, phenomenal acting, beautiful music and cinematography, and constant subversion of expectations. The fanbase's reaction to this movie isn't surprising, if you look at his work on Breaking Bad, Rian Johnson aggressively insists on giving audiences what they need, rather than what they want. Rather than attempting to replicate George Lucas, Johnson challenges the good versus evil storyline of the other Star Wars movies and the very notion of traditional heroism; it's everything Revenge of the Sith should have been and far, far more.",1
3821,"Just giving the movie a perfect 10, just to balance all those negative reviews. I really enjoyed the movie though. I felt like it pushed the story to unforeseen places. It had guts and deserves all the positive reviews.",1
3822,"This movie, dang. Easily one of the most Controversial flicks of the year.I thought it was actually genius, the fact that it has managed to divide a community, split fans, and has become hauled as one of the worst star wars flicks is impressive, this film has stuck with me, personally, and is definitely one of the most philosophically rich and intriguing flicks in this franchise, and one of the most interesting flicks of the year due to reaction and the debate that it has raised. The script was strangely bold, and managed to break expectations, the actual character dynamics and developments of these characters are strange, completely unexpected, but honestly, greatly needed, in my opinion. I was quite taken back by the decisions that they went in.  It's not necessarily the fact that it makes HUGE jumps thematically from the original franchise or the previous film, its still Star Wars, it still respects the old and plays to fan service...like every film in the franchise... It's more so the fact that it allows itself to take the past, take pre-assumed assumptions of how these characters should be, after all they have been through, and presents this strangely intriguing film about failure, and not being able to live up to expectations, or live up to the past, to slowly over time become overwhelmed by expectations and become disillusioned due to time, and to lose sight of what you originally set out to achieve. Failure is at the heart of the script, at the heart of these characters, they are failures, in the grand scale of this new error, we aren't seeing the stereotypical Hero's journey, these lines are slowly being crossed. I definitely agree this film is way too long, i definitely agree that the humor is average and pretty bad. And I agree that one of the narrative arcs is definitely terribly weak, and that it has issues in terms of pacing. But when Im reading comments complaining about Laura Dern's character having purple hair, when Im reading comments complaining about this absurd belief that the film is being POLITICALLY CORRECT i cringe. I can't even see how, or why, this would be the case. Its gross tbh. I definitely agree with many of the valid criticisms towards this flick, and agree 100% if u didn't enjoy it. Your entitled to your beliefs. But idk, being someone that never really loved Star Wars, I found this strangely poetic and relevant in terms of power dynamics and how things have currently been within these times that we are now living in. I even think the divisive reactions from fans are even more so enhancing the core themes of the flick.",1
3823,"this review is spoiler free. this review also rates the movie at an 8 instead of a 6 (its original rating) in order to even out the atrociously negative ""0"" reviews. the good1.this is the most visually stunning star  wars film of all time, with great cinematography and epic action setpieces2.the action sequences in this movie are mostly choreographed and filmed well (especially the lightsaber fight)3.the special effects are done very well 4.the acting by the main characters is pretty good in this movie (especially Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver)the bad1. there are certain story threads and character arcs that ultimately do not add to the plot AT ALL and it just leaves me frustrated when what I've witnessed for the last close to half hour doesn't amount to ANYTHING2. there are many plot holes in this film. one might wonder how so many people worked on the story (including the legendary Carrie Fisher) and they were still unable to contribute a logical storyline3. some character motivations do not make sense in the least bit (y'all know what I'm talking about)so in conclusion this definitely does not feel like the worst Star Wars movie ever made (which some people are claiming it to be) but this movie still does not live up to some of the high standards set by its predecessors. definitely an entertaining and well made (sort of) movie, but nothing mind-blowingly good enough to satisfy its entitled target demographic :)",1
3824,"To all the people who are all bent out of shape about how they handled Luke, they need to watch Return Of The Jedi again. In Return Of The Jedi, Luke doesn't act like a Jedi Master. HE throws down his Lighsaber after his fight with Darth Vader, which is not how a Jedi Master acts. Then he stands there and monologs to the Emperor, another thing a Jedi master doesn't do. For all of his troubles he gets zapped. So to say that Luke wasn't portrayed correctly in The Last Jedi, his portrayal in Return Of The Jedi Didn't make him look that great either.",1
3825,My most favourite movie of all time. There are fresh ideas and suprised everyhwere and the movie stands out against fanatism and a black and white view of the world. The new Luke is more human and more relatable than ever. However fresh ideas are not everyones taste so be wary on the audience ratings. The alt right has alteady publicly addmitted that is manipulating the audience ratings down.,1
3826,"All around, a good, but often messy film. There are about three different stories going on, that wouldn't be sufficient on their own, with Rey's jedi training, the empire looking to wipe out the rebels once and for all, and some girl who is a big fan of Finn ""convincing"" him to join her in a crazy coup attempt. The three sort of crutch each other and tie the plot together fine in the end. The movie does drag on, though, with Rey chasing Luke around for a while, trying to persuade Ren to join the rebels (not gonna happen), and trying to find the ""master codebreaker"" (I don't remember what they call him). That whole island detour is a little unnecessary... The ending scenes also seem somewhat unnecessary, but maybe they'll be put into perspective later on. The stopped suicide attempt seems a little unnecessary (though I do like Finn), especially if this is meant to introduce love drama (Finn, the girl, Rey, Poe...). Overall, a worthwhile watch for Star Wars fans, though they may be the most disappointed. For a non-fan, this is not a good standalone film. As far as comparisons to The Force Awakens, it's probably not so good, but not by much. That parallel storyline in TFA is somewhat annoying, whereas with this one, it's fresher and slightly more difficult to predict.GRADE: B",1
3827,"I was very happy to watch this two days prior to general release, I was totally in love. Yes, this film is unconventional and goes off the tracks of what is expected from a Star Wars film.

3833,"Rian Johnson has created the visual equivalent of navigating the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs - it shouldn't have been possible.  I loved The Force Awakens, I relished in its retreading of A New Hope and fell in love with the new characters, the new score, and all the questions that JJ Abrams left unanswered.  But as the sequel grew ever closer, I slowly came to terms with how unsatisfying the answers would inevitably be.  I couldn't imagine a way that it wouldn't feel contrived; but alas, my fears were unfounded.  The Last Jedi navigates those waters with the utmost skill, finding the best possible course through those narrative mines, taking unexpected turns and delivering on the emotional promise of this new series.  To those who have yet to see this movie, understand that those turns might not be for you.  If you want the original series to be retold, then this is not the trilogy you are looking for.  But if you want something new, yet something wholeheartedly Star Wars - then strap in.  Go in cautious, it's always better to go in with lowered expectations, but don't let those decrying this film steal your hope.",1

The side plot that people complain about saying it was not needed, obviously did not understand the pay off it provides. Perfect balance of spectacle, action, humour and drama.",1
3836,"Masterful update and, dare I say, re-boot of this enchanting, iconic series. If you are a superfan looking for a deep-dive coda built on the foundations of 20th-century storytelling (i.e ""the past""), you'll probably be disappointed and join in with multitude of negative, self-flagellating, mourning user reviews. But, if you a looking for an updated foundation for storytelling in the 21st-century, with fresh takes on heroes and villains, with some measure of ambiguity about who is which, then you should really enjoy this movie. Personally, I enjoyed the challenge of this story. My expectations were not always met in scene after scene. But there is so much now to build on in future installments. Remember how you used to love going to Sears stores back in the 1970s? They were full of cool things to see (Pong video games! Overstuffed plaid couches! Dishwashers with clear doors! Toughskins jeans!!). Well, nowadays you can sit at your desk and peruse through everything your heart might desire on Amazon, WalMart, or any one of hundreds of Websites. Which shopping experience do you prefer? Everything points to the fact that most Americans strongly prefer 21st-century Internet shopping to the 20th-century bricks-and-mortar experience. You wistfully wish for the past and the hustle and bustle of in-person shopping; you lament its passing. But then you fire up your iPhone and buy from the Internet retailers anyway. IMHO, that's whats going on with the newest episodes of Star Wars. Once you give them a chance and see the new storytelling twists and turns, you will see that it really is better now. The past was precious, but it is now in the past. Progress is good. And so is this movie.",1
3837,"""The Last Jedi"" was a daring take on the Star Wars saga, something that has angered some so called ""die hard"" fans. Rest assured, ""The Last Jedi"" is NO ""Phantom Menace"",  nor has any of the tedious writing or acting of any of the prequels, a fact that should be taken as a relief. Rian Johnson has taken some major risks with the Star Wars universe; we see a jaded, remorseful Luke Skywalker, living like a hermit on a far away planet. Quite the opposite from the optimistic and energetic Luke we last saw in ""The Return Of The Jedi"". So what happened? First and formost, he got old. Old people tend to be grumpier, right? Add a massive failure in trying to train a nephew who's gone to the dark side and depression will certainly sink in. Luke feels he has let down Leia, Han and his nephew Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) in a major way. Convince this same man that he needs to save the galaxy from the new empire, now called the ""First Order"" and things will not be easy. What ""The Last Jedi"" does is to hand down the baton to the next generation of characters in the Star Wars universe. It would be ridiculous to see Star Wars episode 99 and still wanting to see Chewie, Vader, C-3PO and all the characters we so much love. There has to be a continuation. Will I miss my favorite characters? Hell yes, but that's how life is when you lose a dear one. It's not like those Avenger movies where nobdoy dies and they all end up killing and winning over the bad guys. And those movies can get rebooted anyday because that's what comic book heroes are destined to be: and endless parade of reboots. To all those trolls hating ""The Last Jedi"", what did you expect? A reboot? Weren't you the ones who complained tha ""The Force Awakens"" was a disguise reboot of ""A New Hope""??? And now that you have a different Star Wars episode you complain that it ""deviates too much"" from the core of Star Wars??? ""The Last Jedi"" is certainly NOT perfect: some scenes drag on too long in the middle act, the Canto Bight sequences looked borrowed from a Harry Potter movie (even John Williams score during this scenes sounds an awful lot like Harry Potter), some of the humour could've been toned down a bit and I could've done without that Princess Leia sequence trying to be a modern Mary Poppins force user, but in general, it was a great ride of a movie and it still is very much a Star Wars film. John Williams score is far more memorable here than in ""The Force Awakens"" (where only Rey's and Kylo's themes were the only things that stood out, beside the familiar themes). It's still not as dark as I thought it could be, despite some characters apparently passing away. The award for the darkest and bleakest of all Star Wars movies still goes to ""Rogue One"". I suggest you give ""The Last Jedi"" another watch. Star Wars movies are not a ""I saw it once"" affair to fully grasp everything's that's being thrown at us, information wise. With each viewing, certain things will start making more sense. That is, if you are truly a Star Wars fan, you'll see it more than once, and this humble review is aimed at those fans. Casual or fair weather fans need not to bother.",1

Luke could have been way better too, and he died sort of a coward. I'm only giving it a 7 because it was entertaining.",1
3840,"Not the best one, but is great !I get the hate for this movie but i had such a great time watching this !The plot has some mistakes, but the movie delivers one of the best moments in the Star Wars Universe : The Death of Luke Skywalker ... It was beautiful.",1
3841,"Yang kasih rate 0-3 berarti sengaja menjatuhkan karya orang lain, lu pikir bikin film itu mudah ? lu pikir penilaian sebuah film bagus atau tidak cuma dinilai dari plot nya / ceritanya ? kalo mau kontribusi kasih rate yang objektif lah, pertimbangkan aspek2 lain dalam film tersebut (unsur2 intrinsik film).  Saya pribadi sangat setuju dengan komen ini, thumbs up ""Great film...one of the best Star Wars films. Has real heart and character and something decent to say about the protagonists and the war itself. Funny, moving, exciting....what’s not to like?""",1
3842,"Engaging movie that I always love re-watching. Although some parts of the movie were unnecessary, I do think the movie makes up for it at the end of it. To me, it's a good continuation of the Star Wars franchise.",1
3843,"'The Last Jedi' was a great movie. I really don't care what the fans say, this movie was a masterpiece and one of the my favorites from the franchise. It not only have great visuals, but also a entertaining story, action and a special and memorable performance by Laura Dern (her moments with Carrie Fisher are priceless). Mark Hamill it's also better than ever.",1
3844,"In 1980, the audience shared a collective groan as the The Empire Strikes Back ended--three long years to wait before the next movie in the series. In retrospect, the movie became my personal favorite from the original trilogy. The Last Jedi will share a similar fate. Angry fans struggling to let go of heroes and ideas from the last millennium will eventually return to the movie and see its full value. 1) Luke was always flawed and whiny--return to those ""Uncle Owens"" in Episode IV. Han, Leia and Luke will not provide a solution--a new generation is necessary to find an ultimate solution and to continue the story. Let go. 2) The notion behind the force has always been complex and shared a diverse religious foundation. The notion of a Christian good and evil was always mixed with a Taoist notion of yin and yang. The Taoist leaning of The Last Jedi is consistent with the direction of The Clone Wars. Let go. 3) The capabilities of the force are not a known quantity confined by previous movies. Astral projection across the universe seems at least as plausible as immortality. Let go.",1
3845,"A controversial topic to say the least, Disney's third Star Wars film, The Last Jedi, is, to put it simply, ""a terrible mess that I loved"". Rian Johnson is bound to serve as the punchline for every hardcore fan's joke over the next decade, as Lucas was for the Prequels. His ideas for the film and its characters are new and interesting, particularly Mark Hamill's Luke, who takes a unique path throughout the film that is different than expected. Does it work? Sort of. In fact, most of the new ideas do work, and expand Star Wars in new directions. But there are plenty of occurrences that left me disappointed. The Finn and Rose ark feels forced, and adds on an entire half-hour that proves to be unnecessary later on. A particular scene involving our princess Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher, though somewhat awesome, feels bizarre. However, the most disappointing aspect, one that adds to my ""terrible mess"" conclusion, is that most of the questions left by The Force Awakens are ignored here. It seems that Johnson was focused more on providing something new than he was continuing the story. The technological elements of The Last Jedi are great, as expected, with some of the best CGI in recent memory, and great motion capture work from Andy Serkis. The cinematography is wonderful, Johnson's direction is fresh, and the performances are easily the best of the series - Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Mark Hamill especially. The Last Jedi is a great movie, just not a great Star Wars movie. It works most of the time, yet many plot points don't fit the world established by JJ Abrams, who will have a lot on his hands when making Episode 9.",1
3846,"I don't understand the hate for this film. It is EPIC! Everything you could want from Star Wars is here at the highest quality in terms of direction and effects. It's also the most funny Star Wars IMO. Sure, the story is lacking in depth and not everything ties together as nicely as in previous films, but as far as entertainment goes, I can't complain. Perhaps die-hard Star Wars fans may be disappointed, but for the rest of us, it's a great movie!",1
3847,"I overall enjoyed this film a lot. Not because I would like the weird humor being thrown around, but because how unpredictable this movie was. The visual aspect of the film was flawless, the script felt real. Nowadays, all the people wanna see what they wanna see, and if they don't get, what they wanted storywise, they rant like crazy. I liked how Snoke was killed in a totally non-epic scene, that felt real. **** just doesn't happen the way you expect it to. Neither it happens in slow motion or with dramatic music playing in the background. It just happens. This film was not flawless by any means, mainly the annoying humor has done the main slaughter, but still, it is a pretty good 2,5 hours to spend, because **** actually happens. Not like in those god disgustingly long movies like the LOTR Trilogy and The Hobit, and countless others.",1
3848,"Pretty good sequel, even tho the cyclical nature of the recurring storylines kind of makes sense, I'd with more original twists.Enjoyable action, nice to see ""sacred"" characters thrown out (with good reasoning) and not kept in canon, just because they're money makers. Snoke was a bit too ""Disney"" for my taste tho.",1
3849,"Фильм неплохой, лучше 7 эпизода. Не понравился момент со сноуком. Слили его просто",1
3850,"The Force Awakens was a reminder of the earliest history of the Star Wars franchise. The Last Jedi is an introduction to it's future. The Luke an Rey dynamic serves as smart-alecky way of outright bashing the perceptions and expectations fans have for what a Star Wars fan can be. Sometimes to the point of even spitting in our faces and quite frankly it's just what we needed. The movie defies expectations in several areas. You can still predict certain outcomes, but The Last Jedi has plenty of surprises in store.The battle scenes are spectacular, the emotion is high, and the way it makes us question our heroes and our villains is exemplary. It's Star Wars film with some balls. The cinematography is nothing short of stunning. Adding a sense of beauty to those tense standoffs and set-pieces. The humor... is a bit much at first. Honestly, the way the film starts off with ridiculous humor taking center stage and a ridiculous scenario, it feels like a parody of a Star Wars film at first. It manages to find it's way before too long and the self-awareness and jokes get more comfortably integrated. Not before throwing some shade at The Force Awakens though.It's a Star Wars film with some balls. It doesn't always deviate from the expected, leaves us with some unanswered questions, and gets off to a rough start. The humor can also clash with everything else happening onscreen rather garishly at times. Yet, there are still plenty of shocking moments, spectacular action scenes, a lot of heart, and some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen in a movie. It pays tribute to the past while carving it's own path to the future. It's handling of the original Star Wars heroes is touching. One of the best films in the series.",1
3851,"I loved the entire movie, and probably for the same reason that so many neckbeards hated it.There may be slight spoilers, so read beyond this at your own peril.Don’t get me wrong, there are definitely things they could have done better. Interactions that lasted a little too long or felt just a little off. However, the whole of the movie is far better then the parts say it should be. There are so many parts that are so good. However this review has to stay short so I will only cover four.I love the fact that it destroyed the whole Skywalker bloodline as being the center of the movie and universe. The fact that Rey supposedly is not anyone special, that her family were just drunks means you don’t have to be a Solo or a Skywalker to have the Force choose you or to be able to wield it. Some say that isn’t what the movie says, but I just leave the example of the child at the end using the force to pick up the broom.I love the fact that Kylo Ren is an obvious stand in for the whiney alt-right man babies. He whines about the same things and throws the same kind of fits. His callous disregard for Rey being uncomfortable with him being shirtless is just one small, tiny example that encapsulates the alt-right self-importance. The whole crying about remaking the empire sparks that same MAGA concept the racists/sexist crowd in real life spouts. It is perfect movie model of real life.I also am ecstatic that it destroys the expanded universe of Star Wars. I am sorry everyone, but I am old enough to have read those books when they came out but the vast majority of them SUCKED. I mean absolutely sucked with no redeeming quality. I am glad to sacrifice the few good things to get rid of the rest of that garbage. I like that Disney is making a clean slate to entertain and tell a story about that universe, especially once SW IX is done.However, the final part and best part is making space for people who aren’t white males as heroes and as the center of the story. This is coming from a white male, I am damn tired of the same old tired stories that don’t give everyone else a chance in the spotlight. I can easily watch and love something that has women, alternate orientations, and people of color as the stars. I can identify them as someone to look up to. This benefits everyone, gives us a richer field to choose movies from and puts everyone on the same footing.  I look forward to more of this and I will happily spend my hard earned money supporting these ventures.The good: The wide range of actors and actresses, the opening up of the universe, and just about everything SJW this movie does.The bad: There were little things that bothered me, but nothing any other movie would have done. The biggest bad of this is having to wait 2 more years for SW IX.",1
3852,It is quite nice. I don't understand people who don't like it. I thought it was nice.,1
3853,"The movie is very good, but i can't just ignore the mistakes on the story. I agree with many reviews, but i don't in somethings. The characters are good and the roles too, but it needs more development in their stories and personalities. Snoke's death with no informations of his story is disappointing, but the way Kylo does this brings a great moment for movie. I think Rian is a good director but as a screenwriter...",1
3854,"I don't get the hate for this movie. I respect their opinion but I don't get it. Was it too high expectations or was it a bad movie, cause I really liked it. The CGI was good, the acting was good and the characters were mostly good. The casino planet thing was unnecessary but I wasn't too annoyed with it. I didn't like Snook so much in this movie. He is presented as a very skilled and powerful sith but is killed fast and in a pretty easy way.",1
3855,"The coordinated ratings bomb on this movie is despicable. Reddit and **** are sewers of fanboy/gamergate-style hatred, and this fine movie brought those awful trolls out in force, first to bomb the audience rating on RT, and now to bomb the user reviews her on MC. This movie breathed fresh life into a franchise that was getting all too predictable. I shouldn't be surprised that fanboys don't want any change in direction, but to keep this franchise fresh, a new vision was necessary, and the brilliant Rian Johnson provided that fresh new vision.",1
3856,"The most original take on Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back!  The movie delivers on fun, action -- and especially on the psychological intrigue between Rey, Kylo Ren and Luke.  It's especially satisfying to see the evolution of the Luke Skywalker character (in a terrific performance by Mark Hamill). A terrific installment in the saga!",1
3857,"The Last Jedi gets a solid 8 from me. This is Star Wars, there are stories, there are top notch special effects, there are side characters, some make it, some don't.  Leia doing a Superman shocked the heck out of me, tho.  Found myself grinning like a fool towards the end.",1
3858,I felt that the last Jedi was just a exact copy of the empire strikes back even to the bare details for example when rey falls in the dark hole and sees her self exactly like Luke seeing darth Vader as himself. But over all I think it was far better than the force awakens. But iI agree with Kylo wren it’s time to forget about the past and create something new.,1
3859,"Has potential to be the best Star Wars film ever. I was on the edge of my seat during the action sequences, and the multiple twists and turns in the plot led me on an intense emotional journey. I've seen the original trilogy dozens of times, and I sat through the prequel trilogy as well. This film represents a radical shift in the positive direction, and I hope Rian Johnson stays on as director for the sequel. What he did with this movie is brilliant.",1
3860,"The first viewing is rough, but take some time & see it again and there's some really cool things in The Last Jedi. It's time to grow up and that isn't comfortable. The movie explores themes that directly put a mirror up the audience and asks questions about the nature of idolization, wish fulfillment, nostalgia, expectations & labels, authority, blind respect, communication, nature of war, looking at things in black & white, over reactions & rash decisions, ego, failure & how to deal with it, trauma and holding onto the past in ways that aren't healthy, moving forward in ways which aren't healthy, symbols vs real people, fame, responsibility, identity, aging, younger generations relationship to older ones, and in particular coming to terms with the fact that the older generation may not be perfect or even right and the responsibility the current generation now faces knowing there isn't a clear answer to these big problems or someone to turn to answer them. These are all things that are uncomfortable to face initially but they are universal themes that should be taught, much like the themes that we hold so deal to our heart that the original trilogy gave us. Give the movie another viewing, with an open mind and a level head. It is messy, and very flawed in a lot of aspects, but let's not let those things blind us so we can see the forest beyond the trees. There are very mature, nuanced things that the movie explores, new things, perhaps unpleasant things and we can agree it didn't get there in the best manner. It played with subversion in some dramatic areas it shouldn't have and perhaps was a bit cynical, goofy or shortsighted in others, but I'll take those flaws in order to get the concepts it brought to light. Upon a 2nd viewing most of the negative things weren't all that bad either. The pacing felt better (particularly the casino scene), things didn't feel as awkward and off, and the overall the annoying aspects just weren't as glaring or distracting and I could actually enjoy what was the film was doing as opposed to being irritated or on guard with what would come next. I even think if you view it through a meta perspective you can possibly have some campy fun in some of the weaker moments too. Overall it's a flawed film and there are things that it lacks no matter what, but if you're patient and can look past your differences with the film, it offers some really amazing insights & ideas for not just a Star Wars film, but a blockbuster film.  Asking us a very mature, adult question; to move past our fantasies & gut reactions and to take a breath & move forward with perspective in all aspects of life. That's something I'm thrilled that it did and it makes me proud to continue calling myself a lifelong Star Wars fan. 1st Viewing: 6.5 out of 102nd Viewing: 8.5 out of 10 (10 was to balance out the irrational 0's & 1's)",1
3861,"Don't listen to the contrarian neck beards and bots. Is TLJ a perfect movie? By no means. But it's a very good Star Wars film. As a lifelong fan of Star Wars that read almost eveyr piece of EU content, and is currently caught up on all the current Canon, all the complaints people have about story and characters are unfounded. The only issues with this film are messy editing, misplaced comedy, and a few scenes that feel out of place. TLJ is finally taking Star Wars in a new and exciting direction. I made my review a 10 to make up for all the **** spamming ""0"" ratings. Realistically, I would give the movie an 8. It was a very good movie, but it had too many issues to ascend to greatness. Metacritic, you would get more REAL reviews if you did something about your bot problem. I'd like to see what this movie's score would be if you took out all the 0s, 1s, and 2s to remove obvious spammers.",1
3862,"The best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back. Great acting, Superb writing, and awesome action.",1
3863,"i love it, i dont know why the people are getting so much hate on this movie, cause like, ok it is not the best movie from star wars, but we still have a lot to see in the others movie coming",1
3864,"The Good, almost great:  Female characters.  Rae:  The Last Jedi is a terrific depiction of a female heroine, she is true to herself.  Can't elaborate with details - but I admire her choices.  For a kid whose childhood was incredibly bad, she is incredibly resilient, believes in herself and makes decisions based in what she values, including herself.  That's totally worth the entire film. My complaint is - she is ridiculously overpowered, a bit more training and deeper analysis of how this works with someone new would not go awry, think about it producers, please.   Rose and her sister:  Great characters, again terrific female characters.  Lots of insight here and depth.  I am not bothered by Rose and her interest, she is dealing with a lot and that informs her choices.  As this develops I imagine there will be more nuanced choices made, she does not strike me as particularly reckless.Leia and Rebellion Leaders:  Wonderful to have female leaders, especially with competence.  BUT A little heavy handed on the Resistance metaphor, seriously, I work in the current political resistance and felt this was just a little bit too much - even as it was deeply appreciated to see so many female leads - loved the emphasis on planning, patience and not on hotshot reckless crap.  BUT Leia should have dressed Po down in private for his choices a bit more, she coddled him which makes no sense.  And noone should wear long dresses in space, its just not practical for shifting gravity, blowing into space, infighting if you are boarded - it makes NO SENSE.  Kylo Ren:  I actually loved this character.  He is also true to himself in good ways and bad.  Most of these characters have depth, of the male characters Kylo/Ben appears to have the most depth and I enjoyed the gradual revelations of his character over the course of two movies and his relationship with Rae - in all its complexity.  The Bad:  Resistance ll's RESISTANCE:  About the RESISTANCE metaphor, I carried a photo of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia during the women's march in Oakland and SF so I get it but this was incredibly heavy handed in drawing its connections to the world of today.  We were already there, you didn't have to work so hard, your viewers are not stupid, I was that little girl on Jakoo and the little boy in the stable - so I get needing hope.  When you work this heavy its as if the curtain pulls back and I see the strings, try not to do that. Finn and Po:  Getting better, although both could use more actual character development, the series has never been known for its depth but raise their insight scores, as they make some fairly bad choices based in self centered perspectives.  Why let Po get away with killing so many?  Not sure this is consistent with any military discipline, is that not a thing anymore?  BUT also ... Not every mistake has to be made by a guy and not every shallow observation or thought has to originate with a guy.  And while this was not entirely true, Kylo/Ben had some deep thoughts, the Rogue One characters were honestly better than this, take some authenticity from there.  Luke Skywalker:  Not a huge fan of this character, his wisdom is not incredibly high.  Still I liked him better here overall, but was dissatisfied with his choices with Rae and his lack of insight and connection to her character - I expected more.  His scenes with other significant SW characters were also dissatisfying and a bit inconsistent with the past.  Luke went through some tough stuff, but I expected more wisdom and growth with age and was disappointed not to find it here in this film.On another note ... Han was the hopeful one in the end, and that wasn't what I expected 40 years ago.  BATTLES:  Battles were better here overall, but NO Science in these BATTLES:  Here is one of my most annoying issues.  There is no gravity in space.  Are the bombs magnetic?  Why is the bomber so slow - it makes no sense when there is no ""falling"" in space, momentum yes, force yes, falling no.  Why approach the ship on that axis? Again, the approach makes no sense for everyone to come at the ship in a single plane, its like they are lining up to be shot one after the other.  Space has no up and down, battle scenes need to reflect that.  Fix this, it literally takes us out of the action!  Explosions in space, again, speak with scientists, battle scenes need to make sense.  Loved the escape battle though, and the planet surface scuffles made more sense.  BUT wow, these are far too conventional, I want to see more variety for a civilization that has advanced space travel and FTL.  Overall, liked the movie a lot!  One of my favorites of the franchise although Rogue One will always be my fave - its just more real, and made so many great choices.  Can't wait for next movie!    Please stop retreads:  no more casino/cantina tropes.  no more speeder chases if you can help it.   LOVE the changes involving the force.  Would love to see Rae understand balance can be grey.",1
3866,"I want to write a review because I enjoyed the movie a lot, as did almost all the critics, yet apparently the average reviewer here did not. I'm surprised by this. There are a lot of flaws with the movie, and there are plenty of reviews telling you all about them. I won't repeat those points here, though I agree with most of the complaints made. However, the movie also did a few essential things very well. For me TLJ was a great movie, far better than TFA and R1: films with fewer flaws that also did very little to advance the franchise. TLJ felt like a breathe of fresh air into a franchise at risk of quickly becoming stale. The main characters (Rey, Kylo, Luke, Poe, basically all of them except Finn) were developed in interesting and compelling ways. Kylo has really grown on me as a villain: in TFA he's a slightly cheesy Darth Vader-light; now, I've realized that his ambiguities make him a rich character to explore and adds uncertainty to the series. And Adam Driver did a great job; I didn't expect him to be the one to carry the movie. Really, the whole Rey-Kylo sub-plot was great, thankfully so because that should be (and is) the heart of the trilogy. It's a slight let-down to see Snoke built up as an antagonist, only to see him killed him off almost as soon as he was introduced. I also think it was a great decision to do so. It had the shock factor, where suddenly our expectations are turned upside down. It added the element of genuine suspense: having no idea what's going to happen next but being glued to your seat to find out. And it allowed Kylo to come into his own as a character, seeing how he reacted to his new role.Adding to that same crucial element of suspense was hows both Poe's mutiny and Finn's mission failed. Admiral Holdo seemed like a bad guy--until she turned out to be the hero. These added an element of realism (though the plot was implausibly thin in other places) and uncertainty: not everything turns out as hoped for the good guys. It also makes for interesting characters--I thought Poe had a nice character arc. In TLJ, we see the Force used in ways we didn't know were possible until now. We also see hyperspace used as a weapon. These decisions have been talked about at length. But I loved it. Especially Kylo and Rey's ""facetime"" conversations. I find it far better than the opposite situation: where everything about the Star Wars universe and its Force underpinnings is set in stone with no room to be explored further. In summary, there are flaws e.g. with many plot choices, bad humor, and the pacing. But the movie does a great job with developing the characters and evolving the franchise to new ground. I think the movie will be judged better in hindsight.",1
3867,"To start, let me say that this isn't a perfect film. No movies are. But for me, this receives the highest rating for how it made me feel, especially after multiple viewings.The tone of the film is one that I personally like, with the darkness and despair, mixed with a bit of hope. The plot subversions, with Snoke and Rey's parentage, were a welcome breath of fresh air, compared to the Mystery Boxes presented by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens. Getting into it, Snoke was just as mysterious as the Emperor on the OT, but people years on didn't harp on the fact that we weren't given his back story. Why make a deal of it now? And to have Rey come from nothing gives greater weight to her accomplishments and the gravity of her power.Finally, I would say that how Luke was portrayed was absolutely amazing. Us, as an audience, we were stuck in a time bubble from just after Episode VI, and even some with the EU that is now NOT canon. We might have seen some growth from the OT characters, but it wasn't the way we expected. And to see the growth go in the opposite direction from our expectations shouldn't make us mad and rant and rage. It should make us ponder and question and visualize the life that Luke lived to have come to such a point in his life. His struggle and trials probably mimic ours in this life more than people realize, aside from the whole Mystic-Force-Space-Opera side of it. He is more real now than he has ever been, and that makes him wonderful and relatable. Flaws and triumphs come together wonderfully to make this film the best I have ever seen, and makes it unbearable to wait to actually own it.",1
3868,"This is part two of a three part trilogy, and I enjoyed this outing.  I would like to see where the storyline ends up before locking in my rating here.  I don't understand those who hate this movie so much, yet loved the Force Awakens.  The Force Awakens was basically A New Hope, reimagined, as The Last Jedi is basically The Empire Strikes Back, reimagined.  I found Luke's personality change interesting.  His conflicted darker self was talked about in SW 4, 5 & 6, but he pretty much remained a consistent Mary Sunshine throughout that trilogy, his biggest offense being cursed with self-doubt.  As much as I love endless optimism, it's nice to have some added character dimension on display, and see that our heroes can be flawed.  Overall, I see this and The Force Awakens as a balancing act of trying to respectfully close out the story lines of the original Star Wars players and passing the story on to the next generation, and I think they did a good job.",1
3869,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I don't like the new trilogy,but one day I understand that nothing can stop the Disney. They will continue to make those movies. And if look on new Star Wars trilogy it's not that bad.",1
3870,"I really agree with this comment ""Great film...one of the best Star Wars films. Has real heart and character and something decent to say about the protagonists and the war itself. Funny, moving, exciting....what’s not to like?""",1
3872,"It's not as a good as Rogue One gut that's my personal favorite of all. Leagues better than TFA and any of the prequels obviously. All of the Luke, Rey, Kylo stuff is very well handled and some of the best stuff in the franchise.",1
3873,"Creo que si la gente se limitase a no tomársela tan en serio ni compararla con ""las buenas"" se disfrutaría mucho más",1
3874,"I'm always excited for a new Star Wars movie, and The Last Jedi was no exception. It has all the elements I've ever wanted out of a Star Wars movie - lightsaber duels, implausible space combat that seems more like something out of WWII, and the fight between the sides of the light and the dark, within us and without.I was pleased with Rey's development as a character, pushing for new ground rather than rehashing old tropes or providing fan service, and appreciated that they still managed to get nods in to previous episodes. The same kinds of journeys are happening, but the paths are different, the choices made vary, and the results lead in new directions.There are some pacing problems - the Canto Bight casino scene needed to be a little more heavy handed, I think, to get people to understand the reason for it, but the payoff in the end helps to mitigate that to some degree. The humor felt too modern in many places, especially right at the start, and that distracted me from it being long ago and far away.It was most assuredly an action adventure, and still aimed fairly young, as Star Wars has always done. There are some simple morals to the story as well, but instead of the prior episodes where those were fairly black and white, this time there was some nuance in play, a little more acceptance of things varying depending on your point of view. That made it feel a little more grown up, and like it was taking its young audience seriously.Enough calls back to prior episodes and returning characters to make an old fan happy, enough surprises in the storyline to keep you from knowing what would happen except in the broadest of strokes, and a wealth of characters changing and evolving and becoming more real and believable along the way.",1
3875,really awesome story. maybe this is the best star wars movie ever made. i can see there is a great hate campaign against disney. most of peoples dont likes the movies without a reason.,1
3876,"The Last Jedi is another solid entry into the Star Wars universe. Unique visuals pair up with powerful themes to deliver a worthy follow up to Force Awakens. The film develops Kylo and Rey in interesting ways and TLJ is not afraid to take creative chances. However, it is something of a muddled film. Like Rogue One, TLJ is missing a clear narrative arc and the story seems to swing from one plot to another without much coherence. Once again Finn is completely unnecessary to the plot, which is disappointing considering how much potential his backstory offers. The movie is bloated with a long side plot that amounts to nothing and only serves to distract from the more compelling lead narrative. In the end, I wish they'd developed a more focused story, but nonetheless, The Last Jedi is an exciting film and well worth a watch.",1
3877,"My favorite Star Wars movie so far. The story was great. It was dramatic, fun, and added a little comedy every so often. The plot was a improvement from the last (which I still loved), and made it all work, which was amazing. The new characters were great additions, and were acted well (everyone acted well too). Lastly, the special effects were the best the series has had. It is for sure worth a watch.",1
3878,"For me it was one of the best Star Wars movies ever.Showing new concepts and ideas for the Star Wars lore, some that were never shown it the canon lore. Revealing more about the political situation within the galaxy and the human relationships within the resistance, which I'm sure were similar in the rebel days.After the movie, opposite to what most say, I held Luke in much greater respect, as a Jedi, than I did after the original trilogy. I always thought that he was a great Jedi, now I see him as a legend.There were some things that I wanted more from the movie, and one thing that I thought was ridiculous. But ultimately, it didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie. In so many moments I was amazed with goosebumps about some unexpected turn of events, that I personally didn't expect but thought were fitting and just amazing.A movie that I'm going to rewatch as soon as I can. I definitely recommend it to any Star Wars fan and I encourage to keep an open mind to new ideas and don't be prejudice.",1
3879,"Man, I just love this movie. The scenes between Rey and Kylo Ren are just amazing. Leia (Carrie Fischer) did a stunning last performance.But for me the true star is Mark Hamill as Luke. His eyes just says it all.Like most people who has something to say about Star Wars, I grew up with the original Star Wars and all I can say without spoiling The Last Jedi is that this is really worth your time and money. I love the story progression, let alone the visuals!!!!! Best looking hands down!",1
3880,A fantastic film and a unique Star Wars experience.Rey and Kylo Ren develop a fascinating and unexpected relationship in this the 2nd installment of Disney's Star Wars Sequel Trilogy. The interplay between these two characters is the highlight of the film and the two actors have great on-screen chemistry.Finn and new character Rose go on a journey that amounts to an exploration of the nature of war.The Poe Dameron character is deepened from the one dimensional hero from The Force Awakens to a heroic but flawed man who can be reckless.Leia and Luke are great in a supporting role and taken in new directions.Overall a very satisfying movie.,1
3881,"For me, a best episode since a old trilogy... Maybe its rash, and sometimes can litle bit slow down and give time to touching Sadly scenes. But still i like it, a well.",1
3882,This was a great Star Wars movie and Rian Johnson did a good job and I m glad he will do the next trilogy,1
3883,"Someone asked me how I would rank this installment in the Star Wars films (8 of them so far or 9 if you include Rogue One) and I said possibly this is my 5th favourite. And this is through no lack of amazing cinematography, score, or ever great battle scenes or individual duels but there were a few things that put me off and most of them are on the character development. Without going into spoiler mode I refrain from taking about then just yet. This does not make it a bad movie though, but just one that is not a brilliant as some others.  I still think that certain fans and newcomers may still largely enjoy it.",1
3884,"With every new Star Wars movie comes a split audience. I loved this movie because it took every fan theory, every speculation, everything wrong with TFA, and threw it away. It was a bold choice, one that I think paid off, but others might disagree with.",1
3885,"This newest installment is taking a beating by a small segment of fans that feel they know better than anyone else.I Personally enjoyed the movie multiple times as did the people in the packed theater I was in! Was it perfect, no it wasnt. No movie ever is. The skewed results of a the review sites clearly shows a bot or concerted effort to drive the score down. Look at the difference of the sites. Something is amiss..Strong 8/10 with a few silly moments that may not have been great choices but certainly they don't ruin the movie",1
3886,"I know a lot of people weren't to happy with The Last Jedi, and I am also willing to consider that my taste in movies could be bad.  One of my all time favorites is the original Die Hard, so yeah.  That said I loved almost every second of The Last Jedi.  I thought it was paced really well and made use of epic set pieces to really show how small The Rebel Alliance is.  A real David and Goliath story.  The movie was also not at all afraid to send you in a direction only to be yanked the opposite, but it works without completely botching the pace.  The price of admission was definitely worth the 2 and 1/2(?) hours.",1
3887,"I had to chime in. This movie is NOT a 0, 1, 2, or 3. That's just plain ridiculous. I am a 44 year old avid Star Wars fan, hater of the prequels, and minimal follower of the TV shows, books, & games.Though I would've loved to see Luke (and Han & Leia) come back to this trilogy in their 1983 character personae, it probably would've come off as kind of silly. It's completely believable that the same wide-eyed Luke who saved his father's soul against all odds, became a Jedi, and overthrew the Empire (w/ his Dad's help, of course)....would or could feel this way 30 years later. PLENTY of real-world, bright-future 20-30 year olds are bitter old people at 50-60 due to other events that happened to them. How many earnest, whitebread American boys have gone off to war enthusiastically with valor, honor, courage...and wound up as bitter, wounded veterans living in self-isolation decades later? Not an exact analogy, I know..but it's not THAT far-fetched. Even at the end of Return of The Jedi, Luke wasn't celebrating and laughing w/ the others. It was bittersweet as he looked off at the ghosts of his father, Obi-Wan, and Yoda. The weight of the world was still really on Luke's shoulder. His father had died. What to do next? He wasn't at all the same Luke who was excited to go ""pick up some power converters"" any more.All that said, YES-- I found it hard to swallow that Luke would stand over his nephew's bed and contemplate killing him for ANY reason. That's pretty silly or could've been filled in better. No, it's NOT a bad thing that Rey has no ""royal lineage."" How STUPID would it have been if she was just another force user related to someone we know on screen? It's ALWAYS been established that force users can come from anywhere. ""If he had been born in the Republic, we would've identified him early"" (Qui-Gon, TPM-- Ick, can't believe I'm quoting that film).  In ANH, Obi-Wan described Anakin as a ""great pilot""--not as some kind of royalty or anyone of governmental importance when they ""met."" (Of course, we know now that he was a slave racing pods...)... Only the SKYWALKERS have grown to carry that ""important political/governmental lineage"" throughout the story-- not all force users in general...BUT yes, it's SUCKED since TFA that Rey is a Mary Sue who ""gets"" all of this w/out training. I was hoping they would at least have given her an Anastasia complex--and say she had been trained by Luke until she was taken and left on Jakku--and she just consciously blocked it out...but at least Rian Johnson TRIED to sort of give some general reason as to how people are now mastering the force w/out using it. After TFA, I kept asking--w/ powerful people like Rey, why they are all so deadset on finding Luke anyway? All this over one man? Kylo Ren is stopping blaster bolts mid-air. Johnson cleverly answers that in one line when Luke quips ""...Do you expect me to just come back and take on the whole First Order with a laser sword?""Luke's death fit THIS story beautifully and poetically. Sure - -it raises questions-- Why does the wind blow his astrally-projected hair? Does Leia FEEL the kiss? Why can 3p0 see Luke too? The answers to some of this make 'ya say ""OK, then should he have been wounded by Kylo's blade anyway?"" But Star Wars has ALWAYS had questions on that level... The biggest now may be -- ""does anyone really ever die?"" If dead force users can burn down trees and such-- Is the death of a character really even a death at all ? ANH set up the line ""strike me down and I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine""--but that always seemed false looking at how little Spirit Ben could do.. Now, it's starting to seem real...but then, should we even call Luke's death a death? The problem w/ Star Wars is all of these concepts were poorly fleshed out to begin w/ --and we all had our own expectations and the more movies we add by more and more directors & writers..the more it stretches and starts to fall apart.Rian Johnson has done an excellent job creating a thoroughly entertaining movie (and I go to the movies to be entertained--period!)...He did something unique-ish for Star Wars and he did it with love for the subject matter. When I watch the prequels, I see contempt for George's audience and I feel like they were made with utter disregard for the details of the story. Say what you will about the storyline in TLJ but Rian Johnson made this movie carefully with love and a genuine interest in Star Wars. I personally like Rogue One A LOT more...and I am sad, too, to see that this is how our OT characters have wound up (and yes, ""flying Leia"" was 1 silly scene...but KIND OF makes sense)...TLJ hasn't left me excited to see where this goes next...but for the 8th movie in this story...Rian did something as creative, colorful, different, and thought-provoking as possible. It's NOT a bad movie..maybe not a fantastic one--but it's pretty darn good.",1
3888,"Looked great visually and fit well into the Star Wars universe.  Plot-wise I really enjoyed it, really like the explanation of Rey's parents, as it opens the door to more Jedi that wont need to be traced by lineage to the few Jedi we know of.  Side plot was not as interesting but overall i enjoyed the film",1
3889,"Comparing to the prequels, This movie is good. Taking out the Finn subplot, It is an enjoyable film. Still I'm not waiting for the next one after this film, I did not feel to have any good cliffhanger in the end.",1
3890,STAR WARS IS BACK i never thought i would say that but i AM!!! it has new ideas  and a good plot although it´s dialogue was at times pretty bad and the Canto Bight story line could have been a LOT better but stil a good movie and everything else (except a PRETTY huge plothole) like the camera shots they were great too!!! this is a MUST see if you are a fan of cinema or star wars,1
3891,"The movie is so far so great. Rian Johnson has taken it into a new directions that are different from the Original trilogy. It's totally acceptable for Luke Skywalker to die and become one with the force after Han's death in The Force Awakens and Leia's FORCED death in the upcoming Episode IX. Yes, we loved the original trilogy so much, yes, we loved the triangle Luke-Leia-Han so much. However, they cannot be there FOREVER in the story. It's time for new blood and different characters to lead and rule in the galaxy far, far away. Therefore, the way The Last Jedi has redirected the saga is totally great and just in time.",1
3892,"Unlike the massively disappointing Episode 7, Episode 8 brings Star Wars into a new, creative future - something that was very needed after the terribly uncreative Force Awakens.Now, I get that some may not *like* Luke's journey here. And that is to be expected. I myself enjoyed it, though it is not at all what I expected and nothing like the old canon. And that is the most divisive thing.I loved the music, the story, most of the characters, and the action/visuals were fantastic.I did not like *any* of Canto Bight - it felt far too ancillary with no bearing on the plot. Though I did really like Finn and Rose as characters. Why were there zero returning species? Why make them all unseen species? That particularly felt disruptive and causes a broken connection to the larger Saga.My only other major dislike is that Phasma was once again terribly handled and just tossed away like trash. So much potential for a very cool character wasted.Overall, 8 is one of my favorite Star Wars films now - behind 6, 5, and Rogue One. Whereas 7 is way down at the bottom",1
3893,"Great Star Wars movie, and great overall FILM. Terrificly written, acted and edited.",1
3894,"Out of all the Star Wars films that are made this one is directed by Rian Johnson. People absolutely adore it for it's everything, the acting, the effects and the writing like in The Force Awakens and they can't wait for another film to come out which is called Episode IX. So after Star Wars: The Force Awakens, people absolutely loved everything about it. Much like the original trilogy, they love all the memorable stuff in these. They love the music like I do, it's so memorable. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han Solo. The side characters are alot of fun too but with those in the original trilogy, I'll get to that later in the original Star Wars reviews in the meantime. Now for this Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi or Star Wars: The Last Jedi, whatever you wanna call it, is continued previously after Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Now I'm sure alot of you might be thinking: I've been watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi with my friends. Now this is not the first time I've been to the cinema with my friends. No, no, no, no, no. The first time I've been to the cinema with my friends is where we've been watching Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Yeah, bet you didn't you, did you? The film resembles around four new characters from Episode VII - The Force Awakens, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn and Oscar Issac as Poe Dameron. Geez, they have new actors and actresses put into this which is why they're from The Force Awakens. And I think the film has new characters in this by Laura Dern and Benicio de Toro. Yeah, maybe that's all I can about The Last Jedi and also before I end it, I just gotta say, the visuals in the end battle are gorgeous. Whoever did the red crystals makes the visuals of the crystals and the floor made of red crystals really makes it so beautiful and fantastic to look at. So yeah, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a fantastic film and I sure gotta get around to watching the other Star Wars films. Even though I did notice before leaving the cinema is a tribute to Carrie Fisher who died last year of a heart attack after my favourite singer George Michael on Christmas Day. So that is Star Wars: the Last Jedi and people and I can't wait for the last and final film of the Star Wars films in 2019. Stay Tuned. May the force be with you.",1
3895,"It is truly fascinating to me that some people do not like this movie.  For me, it was a great Star Wars movie filled with awesome new sequences, fun new characters, terrific adventures, and unique romantic dynamics.  Mark Hamill brought new layers to Luke Skywalker.  His PTSD was quite believable.  I do understand a lot of people wanted Rey's parents to be these people, or Snoke to be this guy, or Benicio Del Toro to play this kind of character, and when they didn't get what they got, it really upset them.  Probably because Star Wars is truly owned by its fanbase.  That said, if I have to accept the prequels as canon, you're going to have to accept this new trilogy as canon.  Things don't always go the way you think.  But at its core, this movie has top notch acting, and breathtaking special effects.  You can't please everyone, but you did please me.",1
3896,I thought The Last Jedi was far better than the last 5 Star Wars movie and can stand alongside the original 3 movies.,1
3897,"TLJ is not a perfect film (what movie is), but it is one of the saga's best. It may have not been the movie all of the fans wanted, but it is the movie that all of the fans needed. Breathing fresh air into a franchise that was on the verge on becoming stale with overused nostalgia and similar storylines. TFA and Rogue One were very much focused on the past and nostalgia. Whereas TLJ takes the series into a bold new direction and is very much focused on the future. Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to. It's the only way to become what you were meant to be.",1
3898,**** you this is a great challenging movie and rye is not really a marry sue she did basically nothing much in the whole movie and in the throne sene did you notice kylo ren killed more people than rye,1
3899,"I fail to see how anyone can call this ""the worst"".I could understand some disappointment, otherwise it is IMO a solid piece of film and my new favorite SW film tied with ESB.This is probably gonna get a lot of down votes.",1
3901,"Good film,because it is new part for every fan. And this is good.You can watch a new movie.Every fan should enjoy this",1
3902,"Last Jedi gets an 86 CRITIC rating here for good reason. The story is far better than Seven - which was basically a New Hope rehash (without improving it).  Plot moves in welcome new directions, effects are great, there's character development galore... and it's FUNNY! This movie rocks.The disenchantment from 'fans' goes way beyond partisan.   Lamenting plot holes is absurd for space opera genre movies like this; these are not only standard fare but also largely beside the point.  I've seen all three trilogies (2/3 of the most current of course...)in their original runs, and they all shine in their own right and for their TIME.  Each is distinctly fun in a different way.  Expecting them to merely recreate past glory is both futile and boring.",1
3903,"The only thing wrong with this movie is that it matured the Star Wars universe, themes, and mythos while many fans failed to mature with it. Too many people had made up their own mind about what they wanted to see and failed to go in with an open mind (or much of a mind at all). Ironically, the movie is about moving on and learning from mistakes and so much of the hate for this movie is from people who can't move on and can't handle that their heroes have actually changed in 30 years.",1
3904,"Excellent movie, just what the Star Wars franchise needed, change, taking risks, and do what is good for the story, not the fans. What a ride!",1
3905,"Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an amazing film that has been getting WAY too much hate. I loved absolutely EVERYTHING about this film. Adam Driver was absolutely perfect as well as Daisy Ridley. I definitely loved the cinematography. Every scene was so visually perfect. There were some parts that I didn't get but it makes up for it when praising the director for taking risks. In the end, this is definitely the best star wars film yet.",1
3906,"The Last Jedi (in my opinion) is one of the best films of the year. It has stunning visuals, great action, the cast is great, and a fantastic score from John Williams. Although it is a little slow at times, the film is very pleasing. Here are a few tips for the haters of this film: As Kylo Ren says in the film, ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" For everyone who is saying that TLJ is ""Ruining Star Wars"" or ""Killing the franchise,"" think about this: Star Wars is heading in a new direction. You can't expect it to be exactly the same as the original trilogy, otherwise it will feel old and bloated. They have to make changes for it to feel fresh and new. They have to introduce new ideas, characters, and concepts. I guess that the people who think that Star Wars is ruined are people who aren't able accept new facts and ideas that ACTUALLY WORK for the franchise. For everyone who is complaining about the Snoke scene: If we didn't have the prequels, we would know just as much about Palpatine as we do Snoke. Therefore, he isn't supposed to be a major player in the story. For people who thought the casino planet was unnecessary: Yes, it did slow the story down a little bit, but I think it humanizes the movie. Sometimes we fail at something we think needs to be done, but then we realize it was never necessary. I think it makes the film a little more relatable. For people who say ""It destroys the original characters."" Our favorite characters such as Luke, Leia, and Han are still human. They have human issues and problems pop up in their lives. So for those who keep saying that the film is ruining the characters because they didn't make them ""perfect"" and ""flawless"" like many people thought that they would become after Return of the Jedi, remember that these characters are humans and make mistakes and aren't god-like beings. I could go deeper into these, but I'm not going to. If you haven't seen the film yet and aren't sure what to do because of all the negative haters out there, don't listen to them. They think they can drag you away from the film and they want to bring down as many people as they can with them. Go watch this movie and see how great it is.",1
3907,"This movie is fresh and new and was star wars like never seen before. There were some parts of the movie that were off, but overall a fitting second installment of the new trilogy. I am so excited to see what happens next!!!!!!!!",1
3908,"Not a perfect movie by any means, but a damn good time, and a satisfying follow-up to Force Awakens. Yes, the tone was a bit uneven and that part with Leia in outer space was unintentionally funny, but this installment had solid character development. The new characters were given their due, and Luke and Leia had some wonderful moments. Bottom line, it's not as good as the Force Awakens, but it's light years better than episodes 1-3 (and Return of the Jedi).",1
3909,"My opinion about user scores usually matches that of Metacritic. This time this is just not the case. This movie is probably one of the best of the whole saga. I did not enjoy VII, but this one is really outstanding. Of course the characters could have taken another route, and of course Luke is not what we would expect, but isn't the surprise one of the main goodies of the movies? The story is not bad - it is just what we didn't expect (and I think it is good). There are clichés, but show me a SW which hasn't. The ship combat scenes are THE BEST among all SW movies. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews - give the movie a chance, and you probably will be positively surprised.",1
3910,I liked this one a lot more than The Force Awakens. The plot for the most part made sense to me and there were great action scenes. My only serious complaint is that it was 30 minutes too long.,1
3911,"A really great entry in the Star Wars franchise, not glorifying the past. I think TFA was the safest take on a Star Wars movie ever made, like a fan made movie adding nothing new to the franchise. TLJ surprised me often in good ways and most folks here just hate Luke. But especially Luke never was the greatest Jedi, just the last one and especially untalented to begin with. Rey is talented and more like my imagination of a young Yoda.I like what Disney keeps doing here.",1
3912,Very good.  It's perhaps a little long but not too bad.  There are some twists and turns that leaves a viewer wondering how they will pull-off the next movie.Ignore the basement dwellers who are slamming this movie.  Go see it.,1
3913,Really liked it. Thought it was able to blend the original trilogy with the prequels while being something new.,1
3914,"Terrible.... Everything interesting from Abrams' masterpiece Force Awakens aka A New Hope 2.0 has been thrown out the window! Nothing makes sense. What the heck with Leia flying? That is so stupid. Mary Moppins! So stupid. That's not how the force works!!!!! She should have been jumping around doing spin moves and back-flips with twin lightsabers and telling the first order that she has the high ground, after all she was flying!! That would show us just how powerful she is in the force. I mean it has been 30 years!! She can do better than just flying through space... Oh and don't get me started on how wasted Snoke was. He is supposed to be the most powerful bad guy in the galaxy remember? If you read the Snoke comic book you should know. After all if you didn't you are not a true Star Wars fan. And Phasma! what a chrome dome! wasted again. She was so cool and stupid Ruin Johnson ruined her!!!!!! It was completely normal for her to appear out of nowhere in episode 8 after her apparent death in 7 because if you read the Phasma comic book volume 938, which was a real page turner, if you are a true fan then you would have read the 87 page explanation starting on page 851 of how she survived by boarding Snoke's ship on a tie interceptor with the aid of DJ. To make matters worse, Rose and Haldo were basically shoehorned in just so there are more women with one being Asian and one with purple hair. Literally, they serve no purpose to the story. If anyone with half a brain who gave this movie a good review like the paid critics and Disney bottom feeders were even paying attention during this 2 and a half hour movie which was basically a literal recording of a slow ass space chase devoid of anything else, not even at least a scene where they explain why the chase was even happening in the first place, they would have seen that Haldo basically did zero things. Why didn't she just tell Poe her plan?!!!! This SJW purple haired lady didn't trust Poe because he made a little mistake in the beginning of the movie? Give me a break!!! Doesn't she know that Poe blew up Starkiller Base single-handedly with literally no assistance from anyone else?!!!! Seriously, because he did in case you didn't know. Since she didn't tell Poe of her plan for some SJW reason, it forced Poe to make another mistake by making him think it was a good idea to send Finn and Rose via Maz Kanatas skype message to Canto Bight which was first of all insanely risky, vaguely even plausible, and entirely boring and pointless!! Poe's leadership arc was completely ruined by Haldo. It wasn't his fault for sending Finn and Rose on a pointless and risky mission because he had no choice, therefore it was Holdo's fault. The plan could have been better thought out but he had no time to think, because SJW lady should have just told Poe and let him lead the Resistance because he clearly has better judgment!!!!!!!! Rose seriously should have just killed herself. Why the crap was she in this movie? She did nothing. She went to save the horses? Really??? She made Finn soft by making him think about animal abuse. Those animals were too CGI and lame, should have just let them die. Why would Rose even think about saving them? She's isn't even related to them. Bad character writing.. Finn, saved by Rose? Why would she save him? She clearly hates him if you weren't paying attention!!!!! What the crap am I watching? This movie makes no sense. It has no heart. Characters making choices left and right that are literally the opposites of what they should be doing!!!! There's no sense!!! Why in the hell didn't Rey join Kylo? Up until everything I have been watching, it was made so clear that Rey was turning evil and forgetting about the Resistance.. And then when Kylo asks her to abandon the Resistance and her friends and join him she says no? WTF????????!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lastly how dare they ruin my husband Luke Skywalker's legacy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In respect to true Star Wars Luke, he would never have even thought about hurting Ben. He would have tried to teach him to become good. No, actually he wouldn't even have believed that his vision of Ben being evil was real, because based on the original trilogy, Luke wasn't capable of thinking evil thoughts or having evil thoughts, let alone evil visions about other people. He was always thoughtful, charismatic, optimistic, and believed everyone was good. Logically, or should I say, if Luke was written according to his true character, Ben should have killed Luke right then and there in the hut because Luke wouldn't have had any idea Ben was bad in the first place. So out of character!!!! Oh yeah Rey is the ultimate Mary Sue!!!!!! She didn't even train with Luke! It's almost as if she has some raw strength that can't be explained and they didn't even at least tell us that!! Lazy writing............. 0/10 #BringGeorgeBack",1
3915,"My favorite Star Wars movie from a person that saw the first one in a theater, twice.The pacing was excellent, the touch to the past and legacy worked for me, and I enjoyed the action.However, it is clear that the climax split off just for future movies. Kylo was built to convert, but he didn't at time he was supposed to. And his turn to forsake the dark side, and simply take over, falls dead. I would have liked to see him  take a different path, for the next installment.",1
3916,"The reviews here is one prime example of why I don't like the pure nostalgic diehard Star Wars fans. You guys have obsessed over ""recapturing"" your childhood fantasies so much, anything short of a remake will make you go berserk, and the remakes (like episode 7) leave you feeling disappointed you were not a child again.Is this movie perfect? No, that is not easy. There are a couple plot holes and campy scenes. But as a whole, it was an excellent piece of story telling. It deepened past and new characters, fleshed out the universe, built excellent tension, and was visually/audibly stunning. I really cannot ask more from a movie.",1

3919,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the best saga movie. There's one thing that everybody should understand: DON'T LOOK AT THE PAST. KILL IT. We have finally a villain with a good characterization,1
3920,"Star Wars has always been about feelings, faith, and miracles. Most fans of it don't understand it, even more so today in the modern ultra-rational age where everything must be explained or it's a plot hole. Believe it or not I'm not an especially faith driven person either, I can be pretty cynical at times, but even *I* get what these movies were about. What's sad is this movie hits Star Wars' themes even harder than anything before it, so it's kind of ironic that its one of the most hated of the series.This hate is coming off of the awareness that Disney is milking Star Wars (which I don't deny), the old fans not getting the payoff they've been waiting for for decades, retcons of the extended universe, and the Battlefront II controversy. To be clear, Disney IS milking Star Wars, but it doesn't keep a movie from being good, neither does EA endorsing gambling for children. They make it clear throughout the entire movie that they're trying to break away from the past, trying to remake the Star Wars universe into something new, and you can feel that intention from start to end. As for the extended universe? It's just an impossible patchwork of philosophies, ideas and stories that couldn't in any way work together cohesively, let alone be kept track of. Imagine what kind of creative nightmare a movie crew would have if they had to keep track of every little fact from every comic, tv series, or book. It's a disaster waiting to happen, so they decided to create something new.I'm going to keep this short and sweet. If you've always loved Star Wars for it's deeply felt emotions and it's philosophy and musings on faith, go watch it. If you're a jaded, uninspired and unflinching skeptic towards anything that can be construed as 'illogical' or a plot hole, then stay home. The movie has incredible action scenes, some great laughs and some lines that make you think, and it doesn't shy away from displaying miracles or commentate on war from multiple sides. It even gets a little psychological thrillery at some point weirdly enough. I think the reason it's being hated so much is because they got too ambitious, and in the end, I think people are too cynical to accept a hopeful movie about letting go of the past and reinventing themselves, or learning the value of failure. Beautiful isn't it? How this movie sparked the very dark and light struggle this series has been about for so long. Anyways I'm giving it a 9 because this movie didn't change my life, pce.",1
3921,"Rian Johnson plays with the usual tropes of the Star Wars universe and adventure cinema in general and has tremendous fun with it, creating new rules as he goes on and bringing the franchise to new uncharted depths. Fun and abrasive, and coherent with the Star Wars spirit. A great send off to the former generation, and to Leia in particular.",1
3922,If only the people review-bombing this movie were around when the prequels came out,1
3923,"I thought Star Wars had permanently given up on doing anything remotely surprising or risky after the prequels and the Disney buyout, but TLJ proved me wrong several times over. For the first time in a long time I actually feel excited about a Star Wars movie, and that feeling is good.",1
3924,The last Jedi is one of the strongest written story arcs in the Star Wars universe but I have to say I am tired of waiting every few years for Lucas films to only tease me with a few minutes of Light saber action I love the story I really do but the films lack power because of the minor Jedi fun call it selfish but the best part in Rogue One was when  Vader wielded his saber for a few seconds at the end but you felt the power behind it. Hopefully Abrams can make up for my patient waiting to be captivated,1
3925,"I am a life-long Star Wars die-hard, and I really enjoyed this movie. Meeting Luke again, after a long, real life had taken its toll on his previously sunny persona, was very rewarding. His showdown with Kylo Ren was exhilarating and one of the best confrontations in Star Wars, an analog to the Luke-Vader exchange at the end of the Empire Strikes Back. The interactions between Rey and Kylo were really interesting, revealing more depth in each. Kylo turning on Snoke was a real surprise, as was his subsequent turn on Rey. All in all this was exactly the type of epic, internal and external battle between good and evil that has made Star Wars an awesome universe to visit and reflect in. There were some imperfections, of course. I didn't think that the side-trip to the casino fit very well with the flow of the film, for example. And some of the Leia-Holdo-Poe dialog was stilted. But overall it was a great movie, and I look forward to seeing it again soon :D.",1
3926,"This movie was great. Not perfect, but better than the Force Awakens and WAY better than Rogue One. It's definitely better than most Star Wars products, including Return of the Jedi. If you hated the movie, you can think what you want but I honestly can't fathom the idea of a 0/10 for this. The effects were great as ever, it was pretty well written, there were even some shocking moments. That said, I grew to absolutely detest Leia in this movie. She was quite unpleasant and kind of an **** Her aside, the movie was still great and deserves to be watched. Likely my second favorite from this year.",1
3927,"I think that most people who abhorred it just haven’t catched the big picture. What is most grand about Star Wars is its philosophy: this movie has brought up the Force cosmology, with concepts from Buddhist, Hinduist, Judeochristian and Taoist traditions. I got surprised in such synthetic way that the Force was managed to be presented as a cosmic regulator that balances the natural laws and the antagonisms and consequences of the beings’ free wills, and thus the movie adds more to it and helps to give understanding that it brings harmony by intervening according to each one choices to the dark or light side. Harmony where it is apparently chaos, balance in opposites, recurrence of life, death, freedom, limitations - learning and enlightenment events until sentient beings arise by means of providential opportunities and serve to give other opportunities to new fellow beings. Luke said it all, the Force isn’t just about lightsabers, fights and floating things (and maybe those are the things that some fans gave more importance to and felt for their lack in the movie), it exists by itself and manifests through those who can bring harmony at the moment; Luke wasn’t a coward or deserter, just as he told his mistake was done in a moment of pure instinct, of fear of losing what he created and loved, so he made a choice in an instant, and although he regretted it right after and couldn’t have imagined what would happen, he was trained and taught according to the Jedi lessons to know that one shall not give way to bad emotions and by them commit decisions to destroy others, since this perpetuates the dark side. So why wasn’t he able to control himself? He got grieved about the way he had learned and his power weren’t enough to avoid it, so in torment he exiled himself to order things up with himself, like an internal fight with reformulation of old concepts, he saw he had to find other ways than those he was trying, and die like this if unsuccessful, but he haven’t lost connection to the Force since he advanced a deeper understanding of it and Yoda was accompanying him. That can be a moral lesson to our lives and shows deeply the human potential, that no matter how trained we think we are there are moments when although we sight what brings bad consequences we still haven’t reasoned enough to change ourselves, master the instincts and then we fall, but yet there is a teleological order that makes bad turn out to become good, since it is what can make even “failure the greatest teacher”. It has happened during other moments in the saga with other Jedi, masters can fail that at any stage in their Jedi discipline, but it seems some fans negate this emotional aspect and want to see them as if they were flawless machines that had already controlled all of their human nature by negation and not and not by conducting them to an optimal point, or who think it is easy to keep with the Force once one reached it, instead of being a lifetime process of challenges (look at Yoda, he is good humored even as a Force ghost, he achieved the integrality of his nature, emotions and individuality, without self-annihilation, just self-improvement). Luke died with all his potential, spending all of his energies in a Force projection that kept not only his legend but the way of the Force going on, in a more powerful way than would be a lightsaber clash (like when Ben Kenobi simply went calm with Vader, knowing it would be better that way, his spirit continued one with the Force, acting as part of it, guiding people and appearing in decisive moments). Other controversy is Rey, who appears to frolic effortlessly with Force abilities, and that seems like the same backlash Anakin had in the prequel trilogy, when he was born with a load of midichlorians. Also, people didn’t like the explanation about her parents, which seemed to have given it a sudden end. Regarding these questions, people have forgotten one theory, in which just like Anakin and the Chosen One prophecy, she may have been Force-conceived, without parents. The midichlorians were an interesting addition to the Star Wars and are at first incomprehensible because they don’t seem to link with the soul and the natural omnipresent Force: that is because we tend to ignore the spiritual realm of Star Wars, “death, yet the Force”; people are born with a capacity of Force sensitivity that is normally directly proportional to the quantity of them and can be estimated by it, but the confusion comes when considering them to be the cause of it while we cannot affirm that. Instead, it points to correspondence and interconnection between matter and spirit, but the midi are not the only condition for the sensitivity and it could be acquired and developed with effort by means of the pre-existence of the soul, reincarnation, etc. Because of this and more, it is worth the 8.",1
3928,"I overeall liked the new direction they are taking things but wasn't so impressed with first half of the movie. The second half however, is amazing.",1
3929,"Fantastic movie. It brought me back to the original Star Wars circa 1976. The effects were running full speed like the original Star Wars did in its time. I took 1 point away. The villains were overly dramatic. However, the main villain Ben is in a way an anti-hero Hamlet. Perhaps the story is written for the actors as well as the audience.",1
3930,"This is a great movie. Many Star Wars fan boys are irritated since the film didn't follow what they believed should have been a different plot. The characters are interesting, the dialog and relationships between charaters are great and the light humor added in every so often is a delight. Many fans were irritated with how Snoke and Luke were killed but I honestly believe they're overreacting because they wanted something else from the film. The people who are giving this a 0 are immature and need to grow up, it's absured. Watch the film and create your own opinion. I'm delighted to see how well the new characters are developing and I'm so happy I didn't have to see an elaborate training montage for Rey, I mean come on, every damn movie has a stupid training montage. The negativity is just a bunch of fan boys over reacting for petty reasons. A bad movie? Not at all. This is an excellent movie that did it's own thing instead of giving people what they want. I expected something between the lines of what everyone wanted but I'm happy that the film exceeded my expectations. Watch the film.",1
3931,"It was good at points for the originality, action, acting, and twists it gave. The sideplot isn't good though and the storytelling on a whole could be better.",1
3932,"There were some decisions made about certain characters that seemed pretty lame. Snoke, for example, is just another pathetic, weak villain that serves as a mere plot point. Kylo Ren is pretty much the same that he was in the previous movie, except that he doesn't wear his mask anymore. Not to mention what they did to Luke. The lightsaber duels were also very basic and had no finesse to them. They looked like kids trying to hit each other with sticks. Apart from those flaws, I still enjoyed the movie. It's a good one if you go into it expecting lots of space action and enjoyed Force Awakens",1
3933,Star wars the last Jedi was probably my 4th favorite star wars movie right after the original three. It had some great cinematic scenes that made my mouth drop. It was very entertaining with many twists that i really enjoyed.,1
3934,"Not even close to as bad as people make it out to be. An on par Star Wars movie. Sure it's hokey at times, but so was Return of the Jedi. At the very least give it a try, and try not to expect it to live up to impossible expectations.",1
3935,"Somehow put my positive remarks without a score. Loved it. The naysayers are purposely being negative. Was a bit dark like Return of the Jedi, which is appropriate.",1
3936,"I enjoyed this movie.  The acting was pretty good, it didn't look all filmed on set as location filming is the best.  The story was a bit hectic with a lot of sub plots but overall really good.  I did get annoyed with all the emotional bits in the film and some of the 'cliche lets make it funny' statements but still not too bad.   People have to remember this is Disney.  SW has moved on from the original 5 movies and it won't ever be the same.  It will be different.  The original movies were awesome.  The new ones are good too but are not the same.  I look forward to more JJ Abrams directing in the future though.",1
3937,"Before seeing the movie I already noticed the hate coming from this and Rotten Tomatoes. I didn't go any deeper cause I didn't want to get spoilers but after seeing it I don't think it was bad. I liked it!I feel like most of the hate is from hardcore Star Wars fans who can't accept change in their franchises. It might be cause it's copying the original movies like Force Awakens was. Now we got them hating on people who liked the new one.The whole movie kept my attention with plots twists going left and right. The characters for the most part were good. There were a few **** moments. The biggest for me was how Leia survived space. I didn't even know she had a small amount of the force.I'm sure a lot of fans hated Luke dying. I felt if he was getting killed of that it made sense and he didn't go out like a punk.There is some questions I hope the next and possibly last movie. The biggest is how will they write off Leia since Fisher is dead?Overall, it was OK. Anyone who hates it must be mostly cause it's different from the original movies which is stupid. They should listen to the lesson they would trying to tell in this movie (Not sure if they did a good job to be honest) and let the past go.",1
3938,"The Last Jedi forces Star Wars fans to grow up. Heroes are not perfect, and the movie tells this story in possibly the best way in cinema history. This is the best film in the franchise and is something everyone should see at least once. Children may not like that their hero doesn't leap tall buildings in a single bound, but they have thousands of other stories that will cater to their adolescent hero fantasies.",1
3939,"I'm not a big Star Wars fan, but I have seen most of them over the years, and I must say I enjoyed The Last Jedi very much. Why all the hatred and dislike from people is beyond me. I guess this episode was not what they wanted it to be. At times it is a dark and somewhat depressing episode, but so is life. Everything is not always happiness and triumph. All things considered, it is a very good movie and well worth seeing. I would probably give it an 8, but in response to the haters who gave it a 0,(a zero?!!), I'm giving it a 10.",1
3940,"If it didn't have Disney in the credits then the scores would be much higher. Stupid complaints:Luke misrepresented - He was meant to be broken down, he had failed those he had trained. Could have done with a proper duel at the end though. Leia saving herself in space - Lol, didn't people know she was Luke's sister.Humour - Apart from the call scene at the start most of them worked, especially the Chewie eating the Porg scene and Luke drinking the milk scene. There was similar humour in TFA, yet now people complain. Porg - Quite funny overall, especially in the Chewie scenes. None of the aliens seemed like a Disney cash grab.Probably a 7-8, the lack of lightsaber duels and Snoke being completely disregarded the main complaints.",1
3941,"I've been waiting for this Star Wars movie for 30 years, and not disappointed one bit. Great on every level, and a huge improvement from TFA.",1
3942,"Put simply Star Wars The Last Jedi is a learning experience for all of us and the characters in the film itself. For us, it's about learning to accept that we are wrong, and that we can't predict the future of what's going to happen in a movie, though apparently most people have refused to accept that lesson. For the characters of the film itself, it's about learning who they will be moving forward, sometimes from characters many of us have grown to love, or from characters we may grow to hate, but it's all learning, and that makes it very interesting indeed. I hope as time goes on, and if people see this review, they'll realize this. The film is not perfect, but to review based on what you expected it to be instead of what it is, is a constant sign of failure. Star Wars: The Last Jedi easily earns a 9 from me.",1
3943,"So this coming from a long time Star Wars fan and someone who liked Force Awakens. This movie is a bit of a mess with far too many implausible moments (even for a Star Wars movie) that it ruins the strong parts. A certain scene with Leia especially. Snoke is way under developed and is a 1 dimensional bad guy. Kylo Ren’s role is expanded and is very good and Rey is very likable. The biggest issue I have is that the Force has turned into Deus Ex Machina and all sorts of new “powers” are invented in this film that are just far too convenient. The movie is good, not great. The Porgs are adorable and there is some good humor around them.",1
3944,I honestly don't understand the hate this movie is getting. While it has its flaws I'm pretty interested in seeing how this franchise will go moving forward. The story and character motivations aren't so black-and-white anymore. I think once the dust settles this movie will be remembered as one of the more solid additions to the franchise.,1
3945,"First, dispelling those who will claim ""not a real fan"". I grew up on Star Wars. movies and expanded universe. I loved this movie. Was it ""perfect"" ? Were there aspects that made me sad? Absolutely. did it still work in the context of the story and the universe? absolutely. Beautiful and poetic.",1
3946,"Very stylish and entertaining addition to the universe. I liked that it stayed true in some ways, but also wasn't afraid to push it's boundaries for the sake of the story. Since when does a spaceship on Star Wars worry about running out of fuel?",1
3947,"Thanks, Rian, for challenging the audience instead of just pleasing us with what we expected to see. You've given us a hell of a movie.",1
3948,"I just came from theaters! The movie is one of the best movies of the year!I ranked it 9 because it's freaking amazing! The action scenes! And... oh my god!! That slowmotion scene when the First order spaceship was destroyed!! That was incredible! I left with some questions, but that doesn+t metter. I believe that Kylo was lying about Rey's parents, and I think that Rey really doesn't know who are her parents. The plot iz amazing, soundtrack also (John Williams never dissapoints)! I can't wait to see Episode IX!!!",1
3949,"I do not understand why people are backlashing the Last Jedi. Rian Johnson made his film and made creative decisions and stood by it. He took risks and it shows. The film while not perfect, is wonderful to look at. It has powerful moments and the characters are complex with full detailed arcs. The performances are stellar from all the leads. So why are the criticism so harsh.Are you saying that this film is worse than the Fast and the Furious 8 or it's on the same level as Baywatch? Don't let your high expectations fool you. This is more than what the prequels gave us. The Last Jedi gives a proper homage to the original trilogy and tries to expand it. For me that earns my respect alone.The Empire Strikes Back was also a divisive film when it came out. Now is regarded as the best of the SW Films. Maybe time will be kind to TLJ.The Force is strong on Rian.",1
3950,"Episode 8 of the Star Wars franchise delivers not only hope and action, but a nail-biting and jaw-trembling experience for all. This movie is incredibly recommended for those looking for an exciting, action-filled, jaw-dropping sci-fi and fantasy movie.",1
3951,"This movie suffers from 'middle movie syndrome'.  That is to say that it upsets a lot of people because it doesn't actually bring any true 'resolution' to anything. In this case, upsetting 'fans' means getting very vocal, very negative response, because, Heaven forbid they actually think anything would go against what they want it to.  These ""reviewers"" can be safely ignored and discarded, as, they don't go into the film objectively, but looking for reasons to criticize the film.Johnson took this film and made it something that was rather long, but visually amazing. He had the daunting task of making this movie what it was, which was something that was a true work of art. From the interaction of characters to creating a new one, he did this extremely well. His vision shows, and it was a good one.This is a movie that you cannot just watch once and understand it. You simply cannot. There is so much to grasp and understand in this, you NEED to see it at least two, three times. Each time you do, you'll find that you get just a bit more insight into what's going on, into what the director had in mind, and what is clearly a great movie.Is the movie perfect? No. Of course not. No movie is. However, to rate something negatively because it didn't match your expectations is just childish. To rate something negatively because it hurt your feelings is just childish. To claim that the movie ""wrecked an entire franchise"" because it isn't what you expect is just childish.The critics got this one right, the ""fans""? Not so much. These are the same ""fans"", however, that drove an actress off of social media because they harassed her so much.   These are the same ""fans"" however, that have taken over social media and troll anyone who DARES to speak good about Kennedy, Johnson, Abrams, or the SW franchise as a whole. These aren't fans, they are trolls.",1
3952,"The eight chapter of the Star Wars series is a masterpiece. Teaching us how any character is vulnerable and changes between movies. Making the theories of which character belongs with each other and why they behave or seem the way they are.The Last Jedi is all about letting the past go and what the future will bring. It remarks the difficulty of letting the past die.It's all about sacrifice and what it's at stake. Rian Johnson once again, amazed me with his directing and his skill to make every character meaningful and rich of qualities.",1
3953,"There are plenty of middle-aged asshats who are out to troll this movie, but I personally loved it. Well-acted, great leads, amazing action. Go Rian, let's see some more from this universe please.",1
3954,"The Last Jedi is the prime example of what great sci-fi and fantasy is. Just like how the Emire Strikes Back flipped the original movie on its head, the Last Jedi does it with the entire franchise. The acting and cinematography have never been better in a Star Wars film. It truly is a gorgeous film. Fans are upset on the road we are now on, and people are afraid of change but fear leads to the dark side.",1
3955,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, I liked that it went in a different direction to the original trilogy. Yes, some moments were far fetched, but overall it was a fun movie with some great action sequences.",1
3956,"The Last Jedi is a 9, but I gave it a 10 to compensate for unfair backlash.It truly is bold and takes charge on new directions that forever change the Star Wars Universe. There is only 1 scene that truly drags on the movie, but overall The Last Jedi hits all the emotional beats it needs with an incredibly beautiful direction and the boldness to move the story forward unlike any other Star Wars film before it.It's ok if you don't like it, but it's something worth trying out. I absolutely loved the acting, writing, directing and almost everything about this movie. Can't recommend it enough",1
3957,"Just saw this movie tonight. I really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect but then if you want perfection it's not in a Star Wars movie and never was.There were a couple of goofy scenes, but then this is Star Wars. Mostly the humour worked for me, and the action was on point.",1
3958,"Star Wars was, is and always will be a fairy tale (in space)I really love Star Wars and i like the Episode VIII. Sure it has his deeps, but after all (and watching it 3 times) i decidet to give it my blessing. All the arguments against it are the same we have heard in the critics for Epsiode V,VI,I,II,III and RO after the played the first time. Folks, get your thumbs out of your butts and start enjoying the film, just ignoring the szence you did not like (or even hate) Sure it is not the best SW-Film but by far not the badest... and to be honest, there are fare more worser films than better films out there. After all... it´s just a film ;)",1
3959,"What I hate about this movie is how cool it is to hate it.Of course, it is not a perfect movie, but I think it is really not that bad like it seems from all that hate. This movie IS STAR WARS. It is not OLD STAR WARS but it still IS STAR WARS.Lots of people are saying:- that there are too many storylines to follow. I would not say so. Yes, there are quite a few of them but not that many that you would lose track of story because of it.- that some parts were unimportant to the main story. That is true, but not everything needs to go according to plan all the time.- heroes from the original trilogy are not shown as such. That would be really weird (and boring in my opinion) to look at people after 30 years and they would be still same. They are people and people change all the time.That is my opinion. There is much more but most of it is really the same. If you hate ANY movie just because it is cool to hate it, or you hate it because it is not same like movies that were made 40 years ago, I'm sorry for you. Acting is good. Visually it is good. The story is decent and engaging. It does not follow same rails like FA. And that is a good thing. This movie does not deserve to have scored lower than 5. There are much much worse movies out there.I said my part. Now go watch this movie and make your own opinion.",1
3960,"""Let the past die kill it if you can"", let everyone know it's not like the originals anymore. An original and DIFFERENT  take on the Star War saga that some people can contain the difference of it but hey its them.",1
3961,"I am genuinely surprised by the negative sentiment amongst fans. Complaints about lack of character development, gaping plotholes, Luke's portrayal, and certain details regarding a major plot character are all over the place. I strongly disagree with many of these points, and in part I think the backlash is due to the trailers and pre-released material not foreshadowing the change of pace to the fans. Here are my thoughts on the movie.When Star Wars 7 came out, fans complained about the lack of depth, the plot development which more or less mimics the 4th movie, and the fact that 'everything kind of just worked out' (blowing up a fortified planetary base with a handful of X-wings? C’mon…). Star Wars 8 on the other hand shows the flipside of the story. Where ad-hoc plans in the 7th movie all magically work out, the 8th movie is a continuous barrage of failed ideas and disrupted plans. Most notably, the movie exemplifies that heroic plans such as sabotage on a highly-secured ship are a risk to the master plan. Time and time again the plans made by our heroes don't work out and actually worsen the situation. With a strong Rogue One vibe, this makes the 8th movie unlike any Star Wars movie that was previously released in the original trilogy of 8. Further, the 8th movie does a tremendous job at portraying the inner divide in both the Resistance and the First Order. There is mutiny in the Resistance, a power divide in the First Order, and an imbalance in the nature of the Force itself which form the central theme of the movie(s).Lack of character development? Poe Dameron goes from being an impulsive troublemaker to a more considerate problem-solver during the movie. Finn learns about determination and to no longer flee from a problem when the going gets tough. Rey's naiveté is remedied as she learns about Luke's past and his wrongdoing. As for Luke himself, his story arc is remarkable to say the least. Yes, his portrayal early on in the movie is odd, but think about Yoda's quirky lifestyle in Dagobah when Luke first meets him. When he first gets confronted about an averted past he naturally reacts stoic. It would be anything but odd if he meets a force prodigy and immediately accepts to guide her given that we learn about his failure to mentor a prodigy before. When he realises the situation is dire, he still does not go back to the adage of a mentor tutoring a padawan, but instead teaches her both sides of the medallion which heralds a new breed of Jedi. As Hamil himself notes, ""Because if it was just another benevolent Jedi training young padawans, we've seen it!"" First Order commanders Kylo Ren and General Hux show fantastic character development throughout the movie. When Snoke is eliminated, Kylo seizes control of the fleet and Hux’ troops, much to the dismay of Hux. When Kylo fails to finish off the Resistance when they are cornered because of his personal vendetta getting in the way, Hux can be seen as livid. This power divide will undoubtedly come back in the 9th movie and should make a fantastic plotline on the power struggle of the succession of an empire.That said I do have a couple of issues with the movie. Firstly, Snoke's character is barely discussed even though he was the most speculated character after the 7th movie. In part this is because he is a plot vehicle to move Kylo and Rey's storyline along, but it remains odd that such a potent Force-wielder is not discussed further. I hope that Star Wars 9 at least gives us closure on this point. Secondly, Leia being blasted into space and then suddenly floating back to the ship was odd to say the least. Then again, the movie is drenched with unusual uses of the force which strongly require explanation. This will hopefully be a central topic in the 9th movie. In its own right, the Finn-Phasma duality was finished off way too swiftly, and it could certainly be exploited much more. The casino scene is a missed opportunity to bring back the cantina vibe from the original trilogy. Aliens are all anthromorphic in one way or the other. Where are the blobs, tentacle-things, and generally absurd aliens? On this note, why do the animals have to be as cutesy as they are? On the one hand they are fitting (foxes on a desert planet, puffins on a sheer-cliffed island? Sure), but in part it feels like they were trying to cater to an audience which doesn’t ordinarily care about Star Wars and it just feels jarring. Lastly, certain jokes in the movie were a terrible fit. Finn’s rebel scum line, General Hux being toyed with by Poe, and the screaming puffins just felt out-of-place.To sum it up, the 8th movie is a refreshing change of pace from the original series. There are a lot of storylines to work out in the 9th movie and a great variety of plotholes to resolve. It has several notable flaws, but to say that the movie is as bad as most fans make it out is unjustified. It’s daring, and perhaps this change of pace is not what fans had expected.",1
3962,"The Last Jedi is a major step forward for the Star Wars Saga, and is a triumph for a number of reasons.1) Characterisation. It's this - not plot - that is the key to any good story. Rian Johnson pushes these characters into new and fascinating places. Poe, simply a hot-shot pilot in TFA, is forced to realise that being a hot-shot isn't all that matters, and the way the film handles his and Leia's relationship is wonderful. Finn, still only interested in saving himself and Rey, realises that the struggles of the galaxy are bigger than him and commits himself to the Resistance. It goes without saying that Rey and Kylo have the most fascinating story - both characters more complex than the basic shades of light and dark this series is used to portraying.2) Myth and Legacy. Luke Skywalker is a legend, both in the world of these movies and in fandom. This presents a challenge. You can't have the same character you said goodbye to 35 years ago - that would be dull and pointless. He has to evolve and have an arc. But we've seen from AotC that having a beloved older character have their badass moment in the spotlight doesn't work. TLJ does something far more poignant. Luke is broken; crippled by the burden of his own myth, disillusioned by the cyclical nature of the battle between light and dark and wracked with guilt over a single moment of weakness. But by the end of this movie Luke doesn't pull out his lightsaber and cut the First Order to pieces. Instead, he becomes a true Jedi, refusing to fight anyone and pulling off the greatest force trick in history to allow the rebels to escape. More importantly, however, he finally allows his myth to take over, and gives the galaxy the grand spectacle it needs to find hope. (The kids at the end even play out Luke's last stand on Crait with makeshift toys. His myth has taken hold.)3. Subversion. What did you want? Rey to be a Skywalker? That isn't a story - Rey being a nobody who rises from nothing in a world where those with the real family legacy (Luke and Kylo) are crippled by it. Did you want Snoke to continue being mean and mysterious from the shadows until Kylo turned good and killed him in IX? That's been done - Kylo killing him and cementing his place as the series' villain is fresh and fascinating and leaves IX a blank slate. These broader points aside, TLJ contains some of the most stunning camerawork and acting ever seen in a Star Wars film (Hamill and Driver in particular are incredible). There are scenes here (the throne room, Luke and Leia, Luke's last stand) that are among the best in the series. Yes, it drags in places (Canto Bight in particular). Yes, it takes time and repeat viewings to fully digest. But Star Wars needed to be challenged if it was to grow as a franchise.It is valid to be disappointed if this was not the movie you'd hoped for, but that doesn't negate its quality. To say that it is a terrible film is simply wrong. You can disagree with its choices but you cannot deny the quality of filmmaking on display here. I think if some fans were to let go of the stories the wrote in their heads and try to understand the beauty and complexity of this one, they might even start to enjoy the franchise they claim to love.",1
3963,"""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" The Last Jedi is unlike any other Star Wars movie, for better or worse. At its best, it's a finely tuned mixture of action an intrigue powered by the unique vision of Rian Johnson. At its worse, it loses the essence of a traditional Star Wars movie. That's not the worst thing ever because this movie still works on many levels. It might not be your father's Star Wars movie but it's a new chapter many future generations will be able to enjoy.",1
3964,A worthwhile addition to the original movies that honors its legacy while adding something new into the mix.,1
3965,A great movie from the Star Wars universe. It was nice to watch him. It contains great scenes like Yoda and Luke. Yoda's return is the biggest surprise of the film and the film itself is quite controversial.,1
3966,"Because of jerks who can't accept a big change on the franchise the score of last jedi is low, but don't care about this, the movie is clearly good, alright?",1
3967,"I don't know why users aren't liking this movie. The last jedi is everything a fan would like. It continues to explore the new characters: Finn, Rey and specially Kylo Ren and Paul; it goes to places you didn't expect, and the space battles are the best in the entire franchise ( this movie really is a ""star wars""). Visually speaking, this is also amazing: the last battle, Rey's training with the psychodelical scenes and fast montages. The franchise is not made only for hardcore fans, but for all kinds of people, it's a blockbuster just like the original movie, so it has action and also comedy, and TLJ knows that. The problems for me are the runtime (too long), and Finn and Rose arc (this last character I didn't like specially).",1
3968,"Fantastic, intelligent, funny, brave 10/10. A masterpiece. I hope that other people change their minds in time. Themes are amazing, ideas great, directing spectacular. Have always been a gibing Star Wars fan. This was much better than the force awakens.",1

The diversity of the cast was welcome but there weren't enough aliens on the rebel side I thought. Or are there ever aliens on the dark side? I do not know. Seems like mostly humans. I think the people getting upset by this film are those who don't really understand the universe and maybe they just can't be pleased no matter what. I loved it and I will see it at least one more time in the theater possibly while wearing an oversized velvet sombrero (haven't decided on the color yet).,1
3970,If the force awaken is the begining of the third trilogys.Look alike new hope in second trilogys. The last jedi. I think it was debuted to the empire strike back same story same darkness theme.I like this movie because the empire strike back is the best in star wars saga. So that story came back to the starting point again. That the end it will be the same as return of the jedi.In the begining Lucas say the trilogys has 3 parts 1 new hope 2 clone wars and 3 rebuilt the old republic.In hand of disney.They dont want to end this for more money.So in the fourth trilogy there will be story of Ben Solo.How he came to the dark side.,1
3971,"Absolutely the best star wars film in 10 years, coming from a true fan. I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews here, this is just what the star wars franchise needed, a fresh funny and clever refresh with the feel of the original films. Awesome.",1
3972,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was a very good movie. The story was good although it was not as moving, not surprising as I expected. The characters are still good, and the action scenes are spectacular. Maybe it does not exceed the fifth episode, nor to the seventh but the attempt was made well.",1
3973,"Now on its 8th installment, the Star Wars franchise still manages to instill a sense of majesty. Writer/Director Rian Johnson has created a pastiche of film artistry, that borrows from the ethereal works of Akira Kurosawa, to the comedic stylings of Terry Gilliam. Star Wars: The Last Jedi carves out a fresh take on George Lucas's fantasy; injecting a blend of humor, action, and emotional depth that rivals any blockbuster released in the past decade. Though not a perfect film, which stumbles most in its ""Canto Bight"" sequences that look like something out of the pages of a young adult novel, The Last Jedi manages to thrill at nearly every corner, making a great effort to shed the nostalgic glow of the franchise, and dragging Star Wars into the modern era, even more so than its predecessor - The Force Awakens.",1
3974,"The best! Rly :)I liked it more from the previous part, I want more!Two more years of waiting :(",1
3975,"I feel deeply sad about the fan's backlash on this movie. Not only it is harmful to the work of a good director and a team of dedicatedd, competent people, as it also underlies how dangerous expectations can be. Shall we not criticize the Last Jedi for what we wanted it to be, rather than what it actually is, being that: a solid, entertaining and daring film, which isn't free from flaws, but acomplishes greatness within its most awe-inspiring moments. And I say that as a passionate Star Wars fan who also happens to love the art of cinema.",1
3976,"As a SCI FI movie, it was entertaining. If I make my review vague, the movie is good. Im only going to talk about one thing, the mood of the movie. There was too much comedic relief when it should never have been there. The original three had Han Solo and his sarcasm and interactions between his friends, as humor. It was done perfectly. In this movie, at any point they could, they added some joke that typically wasnt appropriate for the scene. It felt like I was watching a different movie entirely. When the very beginning reminds me of ""Space Balls""...something has been done wrong.",1
3977,"The story of ep VIII captures the meaning of all previous episodes. There are not only black and white choices. The final sense of EpVI comes amplified whit this chpter. A film never predictable whit profound moral. failure exists, it can also happen in the lives of our best heroes.",1
3978,Apparently everyone over 35 had an idea of what Luke Skywalker was going to be like.  I enjoyed the movie.,1
3979,"This is a brilliant film. Yes, it's different, but that's why it's called the sequel trilogy. It is very well written, and has plot twists inside of plot twists. It had me at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. I have been a fan of Star Wars for over a decade, and I consider this my second favorite Star Wars movie. Its characters are all fun and interesting, and the storytelling is very exciting. I really liked Mark Hamill's performance of old Luke Skywalker. Some people say that he's too different, but don't listen to them. To me he seemed very much like the old Luke. He changed a bit, yes, but he was still Luke. It's just that a whole lot of time has passed since we last saw him. I think the main problem prevalent in these reviews is how nostalgia is so powerful. It completely blinds people, causing them to absolutely love the old unconditionally, and vehemently hate the new unconditionally, merely because the new is different. It was the same with the prequels. People went into the theater expecting a nostalgia trip, and they didn't get one. So now, they're all upset about how ""Disney ruined my childhood"" and all that nonsense. Don't listen to them. Please. It was a great movie. Unless you're a picky nerd who's stuck in the past, you'll like it. Rian Johnson did a very good job of picking up where the last film started, and improving on it. The Force Awakens tried to be nostalgic, and look what happened, these same picky fanboys still got all triggered for whatever reason. They're impossible to please. They think they know how to make a movie better than these professional directors and even George Lucas himself. It's arrogant and annoying. No, Rian Johnson didn't ruin Star Wars. Neither did George Lucas, or anyone else. All that happened is that a bunch of nostalgia-driven fanboys ruined the movie for themselves by deciding it was awful before even watching it, and letting nostalgia cloud their memories and perception. Don't let them ruin the movie for you. Go watch it, and enjoy.",1
3980,"The most suprising Star Wars movie ever! Fantastic visuals and sound, great music and performances. Funny and sad. I was absolutely entertained. Don't believe the frustrated fan boys! Giving this film less than a 7 just shows that they don't have any idea of what a true Star Wars movie needs.",1
3981,"I understand those people who don't like this movie because this movie is really different and daring in star wars franchise but i therefore love it. I really bored the old story and the old template but this movie try to renew it. And it succeed. Rian Johnson packed it with a new story, drama, twists, jokes, exciting scenes, excitnig actors, and this is very good for this franchise. I think this is the best star wars movie ever.",1
3982,"This movie's similar to The Empire Strikes Back in the sense that it goes in directions you don't expect and keeps you on razor's edge the entire time. The first one played it safe to reel you in, then this one doesn't hold back in terms of playing with your expectations and giving you an incredible experience throughout most of the movie. There were multiple points in this movie where I wanted to applaud it right then and there. There's nothing quite like watching this movie for the first time with almost no knowledge about it, even if it isn't quite as good upon later viewings. The only reason this didn't get a 10 is because of a few issues I can't address in this spoiler-free review.",1
3983,"En primer lugar, dejar claro que Star Wars es y será un entretenimiento por lo tanto como este tipo de producto es genial como han dado un giro a la saga y una frescura con una estructura narrativa, lo que hace que se convierta, para mí, en una de mis preferidas. Gran película y grandes tortas a los fans más aferrimos. Me alegro.",1
3984,"Yes, there are a couple of story holes, the story that was brought up by J.J Abrams was all removed,  what the intent is, clearly there is no reason why in the first place, such big unexpected twists happen, other than that it being the most darkest Star Wars Movie so far, yet interesting still makes ground for the inconsistent story told here.",1
3985,"A fun exciting, visually striking movie with a great score, great characters and great action. The Last Jedi is very well directed, but very messy. There's so much **** going on. The subplots suck, Luke Skywalker is ruined, Poe is trashed, Finn is wasted, Rey and Kylo Ren hold this movie up. They make it worth watching. The Last Jedi is very disappointing, but it's still a solid movie and took Star Wars into a new direction. I hope the next one stays far away from the original trilogy and becomes it's own movie, not a rehash.",1
3986,"LOVE Star Wars and loved this next chapter! I understood some of the ""hater's"" points for not liking it...but even if I did hate this, I wouldn't have hated it THAT bad. I had a ball!",1
3987,"I don't know why so many people didn't like it. It was very entertaining, the Snoke kill was wonderful and not expected, setting up the real villain... It broke tradition and was great. I wasn't a huge fan of the prequels at all, but this and Force Awakens have been awesome. The casino section was the lousy part to me, otherwise it was a 10. All these complainers will be glued to their theater seats (and their internet warrior keyboards) when episode 9 comes out, I assure you. The original trilogy is so hard to compete with, and is in a class of its own, but the last two sequels have been fun.",1
3988,"I Hope someday people will realize how wonderful this movie was. Forget the negative reviews.The Last Jedi had a profund respect for Star Wars lore and characters, showing their failures with an incredible storytelling, but Rise of Skywalker throwed everything away.After Episode IX we know how lame this new trilogy really is. Sad.The Last Jedi was supposed to be a 10/10 to me... but Kathleen Kennedy, or Disney, or JJ Abrams, or whatever was responsible for Rise of Skywalker fu**** this trilogy.",1
3989,"The war between the critics and the Star Wars fanboys has waged on with the scores for this movie. So where does an average person fall into the mix? It's definitely a good movie but not as great as I had expected based on what the critics had said. Between some of the very odd decisions that were revealed to have been made by alot of the characters (most notably Luke) and the very slow middle portion of the movie, it felt like things dragged on a bit too much for my liking. I also don't agree with the fact that this was a pseudo-ending for the movies. There's very clearly going to be a 3rd and final one for this set of the movies and they set up for it fairly well. I just don't feel like the movie set things in motion very well with some of the storylines that came out of it. Of course the most obvious one was pushed to a new limit going forward (no spoilers....) but the other main part of the story just never really clicked the entire time and felt like nothing was accomplished. I wish I could say more but even just starting to talk about it would give it away and ruin the experience. It's certainly not a bad movie by any means. Yes it does take alot of liberties with some tried and true characters, and makes them seems fairly weak in response to those choices. But the movie itself was a good time. It felt very similar to how Empire did for the IV-VI movies. This is the transition movie for this part of the storyline. And while I'm sure people don't like how polarizing it ended up being, it did its part I feel like. I personally liked The Force Awakens and even Rogue One more then this one, but didn't feel like it dropped the ball like alot of hardcore fanboys have felt like.",1
3990,"Even better than Force Awakens.  Makes me even sadder for the loss of Carrie Fisher.  Fun, fast-paced, and a great addition to Star Wars.  (This from a guy who loved Star Wars since 1977 - and who hated the prequels and the revisions to the original.) We have a new generation of Jedi and Rebels!",1
3991,"It’s not that **** bad. Get a grip. If you think this movie is anything below a 5 you watched a different movie. There is that one pointless side plot but other than that, this movie takes its characters in interesting new directions and continues to boast an incredibly talented cast.",1
3992,"I recall seeing Empire for the first time back in 1980. Granted, I was 8, but I do recall being disappointed. For MANY years after, Empire was always the weak link for me. I loved Star Wars and Return of the Jedi, but not Empire. As I got older, I obviously realized how great it was, and now it's by far my favorite. It took me probably 15 years to get there, though. Being 45 going into this one, it didn't take quite as long, but I still left the theater feeling a little unsure about what I just watched. In a very broad sense, a lot of what I hoped to see made it into the movie, but almost none of it in a way that I remotely expected. There was also quite a bit that I did not see coming. I loved TFA, and I love the Last Jedi. It is NOT all that similar to what's come before, and with a little time to digest, I think that's precisely what loved.",1
3993,"What a wonderfull way to tell a star wars story. The last jedi transports us to the classics while mantaining a thrilling narrative and risking new plot twists. As always, John Williams shines in the soundtrack. It is a shame the majority of fans don't like it, especially since the main reason is because ""it does not conform with any of the fan theories"". Isn't it better to be surprised? Looking forward to see more Ryan Johnson star wars movies!",1
3994,"Whether it's trying to be original (or,I would say,spin-off) or continuing the mythology of  beloved characters,the middle film manages to tease fans what the franchise would bring the decades-old deconstruction of religious fascism, the fascism and anti-fascism on the most loved fictional universe  created by George Lucas. But I feel that The Last Jedi is a 150-minute too long trailer for the conclusion.",1
3995,"The best Star Wars movie to date. Some people are pissed it isn't a carbon copy rehash of the original trilogy, or that it features women and brown people in non-trivial roles. Those people should be entirely ignored.",1
3996,"I dont understand the fan backlash at all. It's an exciting and humorous film with a couple of plot problems and some poor editing. There are thing to dislike about this film, but there is also a great deal to like. If you're deeply invested in the star wars lore and charachters, you might be upset by its complete lack of fan service and errative plot. if you just want a fun time at the cinema, it's one of the best films of the year. I'm giving it 10 stars to counteract the astonishing brigading of undeserved one star reviews. This film is not perfect, but there is no way it deserves less than 5 stars. At worst, it is average.",1
3997,"I’m with the critics on this one.While there were certainly elements of this that I did not like (Leia jumping the space shark being the worst), and disenchantment over how Luke was treated, every time something made me uncomfortable, there was something else to snap me back and love it more. I have so much heart for the Yoda scene. Holdo light-speed collision: breath-taking. Leia standing in the Crait base doorway: stunning.On first viewing I thought that, while each joke was genuinely funny, there were overall too many. And I felt that they tied up too many threads, wondering where the story can go in Episode IX. But second time around all these little things fell away and were far more acceptable.I believe that this film will age very well. And that tearing Luke down to build him into something far greater will, in time, be seen as a fitting end to his character arc.",1
3998,Has it got flaws? Yes. Do certain plotpoints get a bit silly when you really think about them? Yes. Both questions are also true for every SW-movie up to this point. So the only relevant question left is: is it fun?Yes.Ps. watch it on a screen as big as possible in 3D (Imax if possible) to maximally suspend your disbelief and get sucked up by the SW universe.,1
3999,"Better than the VII...hard to do worst in my opinion but WTF Princess Leila AKA superman now, too much ""Disney"" moments and too much unfunny jokes. John Boyega character is a waste of space....doesn't bring anything to the story.",1
4000,"Fan boys projected their own ideas on a film...and are sad/mad that they didn't get to write a Star Wars movie.  Wake up.  A human writer in 2016 wrote this film, just because it is written this way does not change Luke Skywalkers legacy forever.  Its called ""a movie"" lol...people are acting as if Luke Skywalker is a real person lol...this is one of the funniest reaction in movie history.  Anyway, this was a great Star Wars film, better than the last one that felt like a complete rehash and copy of every other Star Wars film, and I even liked it a little bit better than TFA.  People have complained mostly about their beloved Luke Skywalker and an idealized storyline for him that probably did not come ""true""  (don't meet your hero's) and other more minor things such as the humor, and lack of in depth explanation on some of the characters.  Well the film is 2 1/2 hours I don't think there would be much more time to explain any other characters backstories.  That could be a movie unto itself.  It works for this film.   The humor is a little different than other Star Wars films, instead of Han Solo type sarcasm, there is a more subtle, off-beat, dead-pan humor through-out which I really enjoyed and mostly worked fine.   It also focuses a lot on ""the force"" and uses CGI to show what some of the thought processess of using the force might be like which they of course did not have in 1977 or even 2000.  Again...it really worked well and was an interesting take on the subject matter.  As is the case with 1980's the Empire Strikes Back...the 2nd one is my favorite in the trilogy and Last Jedi is my favorite Star Wars film of the last decade or more.  Unless you project non-sensical images of what a character SHOULD be or SHOULD do and act as if this is life and death and a real person lol...you should enjoy this movie if you reasonably like Star War's films to any degree.  9/10 and up there with the better Star Wars films and possibly the best of the new ones.",1
4001,"The movie isn’t actually as bad as everyone says. I loved Luke, Rey, and Kylo they were great!",1
4002,"The Last Jedi's determination to move forward comes with good and bad consequences. On one hand, there are genuinely shocking moments in this movie. Characters you thought were good have a dark side. Those who should be wise act foolishly, and a single decent act doesn't suddenly make a bad guy good. If you think you know which way this thing will go purely on a narrative level, you're probably wrong. For a Star Wars movie, that unpredictability is refreshing.What really doesn't help The Last Jedi is how grossly bloated it is with circuitous subplots, narrative cul-de-sacs, and detours that amount to little more than distractions. The movie's main event is actually a drawn out stalemate between Snoke's armada and Leia's pathetic forces, which probably wasn't a smart structural choice for a middle movie that would have threatened to drag even without a lengthy standoff in the middle.That sounds grim, but The Last Jedi gets many important things right too. Like The Force Awakens, it's beautiful to behold. It's also just the right amount of funny. Even the Porgs, which drew such a following before the movie had even released, provide the right amount of cute without feeling overused.",1
4003,"Right, so... A lot of people hate this movie because they thought they were gonna be right about every single moment in this movie. We all thought that Snoke would get a backstory, Rey and/or Kylo would switch sides, and that Reys father would be Luke. Instead, Snoke dies, no one turns (in-fact Kylo becomes Supreme leader of the first order), and Reys' parents would be Luke. Honestly, I came out of the theater thinking that this beat the Empire Strikes Back by a mile as the best Star Wars movie. Looking back tho, there is one big flaw with the movie: The Rose and Fin sub plot. In the movie, Fin and Rose go to a luxury planet called Cantonica to find a code breaker to get aboard a Star Destroyer. There it's revealed that underneath the planets first world core is a dark, sinister child slavery underbelly. They also free a bunch of horse animal... things from captivity, and it was VERY preachy about it. There was another scene where Fin was about to sacrifice himself for the resistance, and then all of a sudden, Rose crashes into him, and letting the empire use the Battering Ram Cannon. Ultimately, the subplot seems forced in most cases, was not handled well, and is the only thing keeping this from a 9 or a 10, sadly. But I'm going to say this to my fellow Star Wars fans, STOP OVER REACTING! YOU WERE WRONG, EVERYONE WAS UNPREDICTABLE, GET OVER IT!",1
4004,"I think the most difficult thing about reviewing any movie in the Star Wars franchise is that it is inevitable that each new film will always be compared with the original trilogy. It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter how big or small of Star Wars fan you might be--if you've seen them, you have strong feelings about either way.That being said, I really do believe The Last Jedi is among my favorite overall. While it does feel very different in tone, theme, and structure (somewhat), the film itself feels like an allegory arguing over its own identity in the Star Wars Universe and is executed in such a way that is bold, very respectable, and very entertaining to watch.Whereas with the original trilogy, and even the prequels, the film was setup to abide by a Greek Tragedy structure, centering around the biggest and most central players in the galaxy only. It is a story about family dysfunction contextualized in the center of conflict on a galactic scale.The Last Jedi solidifies that this is not the direction the Disney Star Wars Universe is headed in, love it or hate it. I just see this as different; it is Disney realizing there is no way to expand the Universe of their newly acquired property without separating itself gradually, and through these new films, to do so. In a story telling schematic, I think it is a bold choice that offers the opportunity to allow stories that, before under George Lucas, could and would never have happened. The dark undertones, both thematically and visually, make the film start to really feel like a war movie.Allegorical Representation I read into:The Resistance ship using thrusters only to stay just out of reach from the First order. I perceive this as the Resistance represents Disney making every attempt it can to lead Star Wars to a new place where it will be able to thrive and become wonderful for everyone again, Po is the audience trying to follow faithfully but skeptical of the decision making abilities of the new admiral in charge (throwing critical question after question), and the First Order is the first interpretation of Star Wars/also the ""negative Nancy"" that will never let itself be happy with the new Star Wars ever. Luke Skywalker represents the faithful Star Wars fan that is terrified to lose control over the direction Star Wars is heading in. Kylo Ren represents all of the fans that are only negative about the new movies; he wants it all to end, the Jedi and the Sith--he wants everything to stop. So much so, that Kylo kills the ""new Emperor,"" in a fairly anticlimactic way to avoid any chance of history repeating itself in these movies.Things I really appreciated in this movie:-Expanding the scope of the Galaxy, and how the wars effect other people (specifically, the ""more normal"" individuals)-Creating morally gray areas in the war, including the commentary that very briefly touches on the war profiteers. Especially when it is revealed that the ship DJ steals is from someone who sells ships to the First Order and the Resistance, it begs the question, ""Why are the wars at all?"" to be asked. -The way Luke is made to contextualize the original trilogy, it's almost as if Luke is saying the way that part of the Star Wars history line is perceived within the universe is that it is exaggerated, almost mythical, and somewhat misunderstood. This grounds the Greek Tragedy epicness in many ways; we are made to see Luke not as a super hero/master jedi that is without character flaws, but instead a single being who feels just as powerless in the universe as anybody else might. -There is a lot of emphasis on the fact that wars cannot be won by individuals, but by groups of individuals working together.The only things I really did not enjoy, or simply felt indifferent about:-Finn. While in the Force Awakens he's pretty great, his character in this one feels so out of place with the tone that was established. His dialogue were only quick whips, none of which were really at all creative. To boot, they gave him an arc that really didn't make any difference in the outcome of the movie. I just don't get it and I don't find him appealing. He feels like a really immature and goofy character for a film that is so dark and serious.-Porgs. Except for one gag in the end, they are the Minions of the Star Wars universe as far as I am concerned.Things I was confused about:-Maz Kanata's appearance in the movie. It was entirely unnecessary, and just didn't really connect to the story. It also didn't make any sense how she was (essentially) facetiming with the resistance. Who was holding the camera? How was this call being taken? Was the camera shot after she jet packs away from the camera?",1
4005,Do not listen to the fake Star Wars fans who hated this movie. The last Jedi was amazing it wasn’t bad at all. Those so called fans need to go away. Luke skywalker did so much in the OT Give him a **** breaking or Leaving. You are killing Star Wars and Lucasfilm. If you don’t like the last Jedi then don’t watch the movie and read comics. The last Jedi is my favorite movie off all time and a fun movie. It’s ok to have Jokes in the movie cause you don’t like jokes are you kidding the world Need,1
4006,"C+/B-I knew Episode VIII was going to be more divisive than VII because I knew Rian Johnson would never play it as safe as Abrams, and of course because the Internet is full of raging cynics and fanatics. I should be clear that I'm a lifelong fan of the series, but I make an honest effort to not be myopic about it.Both directors of the new trilogy are huge SW fans, each with a different mission as filmmakers within the series and each with their own sense of style and vision. Compared to Abrams, whose job it was to create new and likeable characters while thrusting them into a fun and familiar Star Wars setting (a job well done IMO), Johnson's job was to continue the arcs of those characters while somehow subverting expectations. I can't speak for other fans, but I had a strong personal need for the saga to expand on its ongoing narratives, themes and character dimensions in ways that were simultaneously new, familiar, interesting and unpredictable. I didn't want just another Empire the way we kinda got just another New Hope. I knew that to do that Johnson would need to take some risks, and as it turns out he took a lot of them with varying degrees of success. Not everything lands how it should've, but all the A-plot stuff with Kylo, Rey, Luke and Leia worked great for me initially and in retrospect.Without going into too much detail, VIII suffered mostly from one or two of its subplots, namely that of Finn, Rose and DJ. In spite of their subplot's flaws, perhaps the biggest payoff was one in which DJ helps Finn and Rose to understand that war is far more grey and nuanced than they previously realized, and that the concepts of good and evil are maybe a bit more relative than they'd like to think. This is a concept that is echoed in various ways throughout the movie's various arcs, and its a theme I personally adore, but I wish Finn and Rose had come across it in a more fun and concise way.One of the most common complaints I've seen of this film has to do with it's attempts at humor. Admittedly, I was caught off guard by it near the beginning, but I quickly and effortlessly found myself enjoying it, and did so for the most part for the rest of the film. I'm not sure I understand why the humor didn't land for so many people, at least not beyond the fact that humor is a very subjective construct. The humor of the prequels suffered greatly because it was so infantile and kid-centric. I think people forget how much humor there was in the original trilogy, but it seems to me that the new trilogy hasn't forgotten, nor has it failed to understand what made that humor more successful. The humor simply needs to appeal to the widest possible audience, younglings and oldlings alike. Was some of the humor too “meta” in this film? Who knows. One could easily argue yes or no, but I personally didn't think the humor was specific enough to be truly bad in a meta sense. Overall it seemed fine, and a lot of it got genuine laughs out of me.I have enormous difficulty taking seriously the opinions of those who say flat out that Episode VIII “sucks” or even of those who somehow loved it unconditionally, although there seem to be far fewer of those in the latter category. Either way, let's not kid ourselves into thinking there has ever been a perfect SW film (although Empire was objectively maybe the closest we'll ever get to one). Empire took plenty of risks that in hindsight paid off beautifully, and I feel quite comfortable saying the same of VIII. As far as risks go, the difference between the two films is that VIII takes maybe one or two too many. Its possible that a few more months in the writer's room probably could have fixed all or most of the film's biggest missteps, but as a realist I understand time isn't always as abundant as we'd like it to be. In the end, The Last Jedi is what it is, and it would have been folly to ever think it could have pleased everyone.I could follow suit with so many of the Internet's talking heads by nitpicking this film to death, but doing that seems unnecessary and beside the point of cinema. It might be a cynical view, but I think a lot of people kinda enjoy dissecting all the “bad” parts of movies more than losing themselves in all the “good” parts. I simply can't find it within myself to cut off this film's face to spite it's nose like so many people have. When considering the poignantly grey themes of The Last Jedi, doesn't it make more sense to embrace a more “grey” approach to how we experience films? To reference a specific quote from VIII, if darkness rises, shouldn't the light rise to meet it?With all it's jaw-dropping spectacles, touching character moments and fresh thought-provoking themes, its the sum of Episode VIII's parts that, for me, make it an enjoyable cinematic experience. I have no quibbles about recommending this episode of Star Wars, but I'd try to ignore the Internet's echo chambers. SW is a movie, not a religion.",1
4007,"Amazing simply amazing, it could have been better with giving some characters more backstories but overall I loved it and I can’t wait for Episode 9",1
4008,This take on a sequel to George Lucas' masterpieces show that no matter how good some parts of a movie are there are all ways flaws. I am pleased with most parts of the movie. Its just that Disney tried to show itself as a cultural diversity loving company by shoving as many non-white characters as they can. Don't get me wrong i'm all for cultural diversity and feminism (not the stupid kind) but when its as blatant and forced as in this movie I can't stand it. Other then that I loved the acting and visuals and the comedy is more then usual but I still love it. The action is nice but the movie moved at a slightly shorter pace then its brother The Force Awakens.,1
4009,"Let's start with that I am not a Star Wars fan. Generally speaking I am just fine with Star Wars as a whole. So well! I came to the movie and here is why I like it and classify it as a great, entertaining one:- it has a really good, not oboxious humour- acting (especially of younger members of the cast) is very good (and pay attention to the fact that creating a role in such a hyped movie is a really hard task even for experienced actors)- it lasts for about 2,5 hours and I wasn't bored all that time, they managed to keep me invested- it lasts for about 2,5 hours, they could've made a shorter movie and still did great at the box office- shots in this movie are great, many times very artistic and... static which is actually good in action movie because when action finally breaks in, it feels much more realistic and makes your heart go wild- it's quite unpredictable but also coherent, you don't feel like ""well, that's nice but why they've done this or that, wouldn't it be easier this or that way?""- thay managed to make a new, nice planet (and it isn't sand or lava, or jungle)- CGI is very good and used only when needed- there isn't !@#$ ton of action and pew-pew-pew all the time- I find it a nice polemic with older Star Wars moviesIf it would be the first Star Wars movie I've ever seen this movie would make me feel that SW is a very nice thing to know and would encourage me to watch more. I understand that many people feel anger with it because ""it is not the old saga!"" and also because a super-corporation like Disney produces it but concidering the fact that there are many movies that try to make money out ONLY from your nostalgia and add nothing to they products (great and sad example is Hobbit - produced by the same company which produced LOTR and directed by the same guy who directed LOTR) but a lot of CGI and running, and action... Star Wars - The Last Jedi is very good example how to deal with such a task without turning it into a mindless pile of references people like.May the force be with you! Peace! :)",1
4010,"Amazing Star Wars , forme is better than episode 7. Ryan Johnson make a great spript with more myster not a copy of empire stike back; Kyo",1
4011,"Star Wars:  The Last JediDirected by   Rian Johnson  Cast (in part)    Mark Hamill  Luke Skywalker Carrie Fisher  Leia Organa  Adam Driver  Kylo Ren  Daisy Ridley  Rey  John Boyega  Finn  Oscar Isaac Poe Dameron  Andy Serkis  Snoke  First Thoughts:  I was excited to see this film since I’m an original, waiting blocks for the 1977 Star Wars film.  And I was NOT disappointed!Though Rian Johnson’s story and direction are somewhat controversial in some circles, overall I liked the direction we are going in.  We left Rey with Luke in The Force Awakens and find Luke as a dissolutioned former Jedi who just wants to die on an island in the armpit of the galaxy far far away.  And Rey, shocked by this attitude of a man she’s idolized, tries to wake him up.  You can’t walk away from trouble and though you may have inadvertently caused it, you still have responsibility to make it right.  I feel that’s the lesson between Luke and Rey.Legends change – we find anyone can use the Force, not just certain individuals.  And Rey has the most sensitivity and the most power, and is on par with her antagonist Kylo Ren.  Ren, like Luke, is a torn individual.  He has a Force connection with Rey who communicates with him.  That Rey tries to see Ren’s side of the story is telling and so is Luke’s tale with a lot to do with his relationship with both Ren and Rey.  Flawed characters trying to do what they think is “the best” but eventually Rey decides – in the main throne room of Snoke’s ship. Snoke comes across as a villain who seems to have all the cards in his favor.  His Dark Side Force power is more powerful than Rey and Ren.  They both have a plan for Snoke.  And their lightsaber battle with the Praetorian Guard is worth the price of admission! Forced?We finally get to see a final confrontation with Ren and Luke Skywalker himself.  Luke seems invincible, and Ren wants his blood.  How this turns out with shock you. Another controversial scene must do with the remnants of the Rebel Alliance attempting to escape from the First Order armada and are getting picked off, one at a time, as the Rebels limp towards their base.  There are side adventures with Rose (new character, she really steps up and takes the film) and her relationship with Finn – at first seems to have hero worship and later saves his life.  Final Thoughts”OK, I’m rambling , but really guys and gals remember this is fiction!  Some suspension of disbelief is required.  Johnson turns the Force mythology on its ear.  And who is the Last Jedi?  Can you guess?Highly recommended!",1
4012,"Don't believe the naysayers, this movie is great! Sure, it does different things to the previous movies, but that's a good thing. And it isn't very different from the previous movies. The usual themes are still present (family, hope, betrayal, trying to find your place in the universe), but many of the usual Star Wars tropes are gone or subverted. The script really shines, and while the story gets bogged down in places, it is still petty string. Much better than the prequels (people forget just how bad they were), and as good as The Force Awakens. As good as the original trilogy? Maybe, as time (and the third and final movie) will tell.",1
4013,"Love it. It's a classic Star Wars movie, but with something new in it. Maybe that's why a lot of SW fans didn't get it...",1
4014,"Absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. The twists and turns kept me hooked throughout. Bold moves for the future of Star Wars, and I think they are good ones. I can understand why some didn't like the Canto Bight storyline, but it was necessary, though it could have been a tad shorter, with that time going to the Luke/Rey story.",1
4015,"Great SW movie. Most expect it to be like the older SW movies. It was asked after TFA was released. I like this one because it was made by a director who grew up on the original SW. Yes there was some dull points in this movie. ( so did the original trilogy, empire was an amazing movie. As a kid I didn't like some points)  Overall I enjoyed this movie. I think Kylo is well acted and some just don't like him for some reason unknown. I see this as the Saga going into a new generation and taking a different direction.",1
4016,"it is a amazing film of star wars, if you hate it you have to go to touch my balls to another part",1
4017,"I believe the last Star Wars movie before ""The Last Jedi"" to be this controversial, bold, and risky was ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The visual is, as always, magnificent. Someone's gotta take over the franchise from the Skywalkers and the Solos, and I believe this movie did a great job in doing that. Rey's background is finally unveiled in this episode, and to the surprise of almost everyone, she's a no one (Hey, Darth Vader was a no one too!). That's bold. Luke has become a grudging, pessimistic, war-torn, reluctant old man. That's bold. It was revealed that Luke actually made Kylo Ren and destroyed Ben Solo by trying to kill him after sensing the ""great potential for darkness"". That's infinitely bold. Alright, there are indeed some dumb moments in this one, like the way Leia all of sudden was able to harness the force to safe herself, or the absolute zero chemistry of Finn and Rose (That awkward kiss tho...), or the occasional dry, unfunny jokes. But the only people that got ticked and enraged by Episode VIII are Star Wars nerds and fanboys. For me, as a general moviegoer, ""The Last Jedi"" is as good as any Star Wars movie can be. I like especially the dark turn of Luke's story arc and how he, Rey, and Kylo Ren questioned their integrity and moral values, how blurred the line can be between good and evil. This is a deep, provoking (For the better or worse), insightful movie that's worth the admission.",1
4018,"""Let the past die."" Nice to see Star Wars actually attempt to have themes beyond heritage. This film takes some incredible risks, deviating from the typical narrative structure while adding in some genuinely unexpected twists and turns, expanding the lore of Star Wars, and ends up not only emulating its predecessors but surpassing them. Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi' subverts expectations in some of the ballsiest ways imaginable. Rey, Kylo Ren, and Luke absolutely steal the show, and the minor plotlines, which at first glance seem largely dispensable, culminate in a very poignant and pointed ending that looks toward the future with fresh new eyes and new hopes. Star Wars has finally grown up.",1
4019,"This is the 8th instalment in the saga. Could it be better? Sure. Could it make more sense? Definitively. But there was one thing that it should've gotten right and (surprisingly) it did: direction. The Last Jedi takes the franchise in the right path, managing to give us a wider understanding of the Galaxy and putting the character's humanity at its core. Visuals are flawless, the premise is great and, even if more than one point in the execution feels superficial, the payback seems worthy.",1
4020,"People gets upset so easily nowaday, but the movie in entertaining nevertheless",1
4021,These reviewers are way too salty. Star Wars is for kids. It has always been for kids. Even during the original trilogy. Get over it.,1
4022,"All those fanboys should finally move out of their mommy's basement. This is a fresh and awesome new Chapter of Star Wars. I saw it with my 12 and 15 year old and they laughed, cried and clawed the armrest in suspense - just like their dad did some 30 years ago. Also, as a father of 4 daughters I think it's bold and timely to put so many strong female leaders front and center. Awesome movie, don't miss it!",1
4023,"I liked this movie, as I liked The Force Awakens. Now I must say that I'm not someone who is familiar with the full lore of Star Wars (I've only seen the 9 movies multiple times). I especially liked the visuals and some of the more poetic moments (Leia's flight but also the silence after the push to light-speed by Holdo), and the Luke part was all quite great as were the action sequences. As many others, I disliked the casino scenes and even in general, the new characters do not bring any value (Rose is irritating as is DJ's stuttering). I don't really understand the ongoing discussion about Snoke. Some people seem to think that Rian didn't like the character and so he killed him off. This is of course complete bs, do you really think Disney doesn't have a clear 3-movie arc for Snoke...? It has become quite impossible to make a Star Wars movie which pleases all due to the contradictive expectations. Looking forward to IX and the following trilogy (and the Han Solo spin off).",1
4024,"Best star wars movie since Empire Strikes back - thrilling ride from Start to finish, mind blowing movie.",1
4025,A refreshing take on the idea of the force.  Better writing then the love letter that was episode 7. Can't wait to see what Rian has in store for the next trilogy.,1
4026,"Solid addition to the series. Mark Hamill's best performance as Luke Skywalker, and great character building throughout. Surprises throughout. Some plot contrivances keep it from a 10.",1
4027,"This movie had well developed characters, amazing effects, and decent plot. I cared about and at times worried about Rey, Fin, Rose, Luke, Poe, and etc... The film was a bit slow at times (& it felt like a middle movie), but overall worth seeing imo. Disregard the large amount of negative comments, most of them are incoherent ramblings about.",1
4028,"I hardly ever write on (in?) the internet on any platform about anything, but I get the feeling people just plain don't understand this movie and/or just don't understand Star Wars. This movie is currently the second best Star Wars movie after Empire and after a few years of reflection might just be better.Why? Why is this movie so good and so misunderstood? Why has the reaction been so divisive? It all has to do with the Force, the Sith and the Jedi. What is the force? What are Jedi? What are Sith? There has always been something fishy about the whole concept of Light vs. Dark.When you re-watch the original trilogy you get a sense that Ben Kenobi is a character that is somewhat practical. He is an end justify the means kind of guy. That is NOT what people remember him as being. It is only after idealizing him and injecting oneself with a Dose of Nostalgia that we tint our lenses. We cannot see clearly. We let out emotions cloud our judgement. Luke is an idealist in the original movies. He hasn't passed the hardships that Yoda and Ben have and neither does he passed them ever in the original trilogy.The seeds are all planted in the original trilogy. Yoda and Ben are possible futures for the evolution of Luke as a character. Both Jedi Masters that went through hardships and turned them away from their initial ideal state. Both exile themselves. One becomes practical and the other a funny hermit. One gets serious, the other uses laughter to drown his sorrow.In the prequels you can clearly see Ben's and Yoda's idealized personalities. Ben (better call him Obi-wan or Obi) lives by the Jedi Code, he believes in the institutions of the Jedi and is one of the best devotees. Is not until the end of Revenge that finally Obi starts reflecting on his personality. The same happens to Yoda.Righteousness is important but also not anymore. The institutions that carried the Jedi were flawed. That is why Darth Sidious managed to do what he did. That he managed to do that is evidenced enough that there was fundamentally something wrong with the Jedi or at least, how they interacted and governed themselves in relation to the force.The THEMES of the movie are the culmination of all the previous Star Wars movies. People will start talking about this inconsistency and that inconsistency and how that plot point was stupid, and tell them this:Oh, it makes more sense that Qui-gon and Obi going through the center of a planet?More consistent than Ewoks beating the Empire?More credible than Jar Jar Binks becoming an Imperial Senator?More believable than Obi-wan never found by the Empire when he still uses Kenobi and wheres his Lightsaber?Any part less epic than Boba Fett dying at the beginning of Return?Any part more ridiculous than Luke blowing a Death Star by some photon torpedos that did a 90 sharp turn south to enter a shaft?Star Wars has also being ridiculous. It has always being Fantasy more than Sci-fi. It has always had humor. But, a star wars movie had NEVER giving us a more fulfilling moral and force complexities and dilemmas than this one. It is easily the best of every made after 1983. See it and love it. If you don't you will in 5 years.P.S. There has been a lot of garbage about political messages in this movie. These are the messages: Women can be in positions of power. Women can be shown in fighting squadrons just as often as men. There exist war-profiteers. There can be a female minority lead character. All really basic, basic, basic, basic concepts. These are 1920's French ideals.P.S.S. There has been arguments that this movie subverts what Star Wars is because it doesn't follow the Hero's journey. That is one of the worst arguments you can make about this movie. It does, it also evolves the concept.P.S.S.S. May the force be with you.",1
4029,"One of the best Star Wars movies. It's thrilling from the beginning to the end. And the director takes some bold moves that really pays of. There are only two weak scenes in the middle of the movie, where one is outright poorly conceived and executed. But that scene alone does not change the overall complete achievement of this movie. Amazing performances by Mark Hamilton, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.",1
4030,"I love this movie for the same reasons that many provide as support for their aversion to it.This is a majestic Star Wars movie that provides genuine shocks, and it explores an entirely new region of storytelling possibilities.",1
4031,"I am not some crazy fanboy, I just love movies and I really don't understand why so many people is upset... This movie was great. How can you hate a movie like this? There was jokes in serious moments? Yes there were few of them, but all of you forget the original trilogy, if you watch them again, humor is also present in serious situations, oh yes it is, maybe in old fashion but yes. I totally understand why Luke acted the way he did, and I loved the way he died, like Obi Wan and Yoda. The only thing I did not like about this movie was how Leia survived that attack at the beginning, I mean I know it is a fantasy, but again it was to much. And also, I wanted to see more from C3PO, R2D2 and Chewie cuzz everytime I see them there is a smile on my face. For me, this movie takes place behind episode 4 and 5, on third position. This is just my opinion... :) I know I will get a lot of dislikes, but it is okay, I just wanted to share this with you guys, there is still a hope inside me. May the force be with you...Sorry for my bad english",1
4032,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn't as bad as people say. I must recoginze there is some stuff that doesn't work, but it isn't strong enough to ruin the movie.For anyone who has seen the trailers, the story is mainly about the relationship that Ray and Luke develop and I must say that the evolution of their relationship is pretty solid and it works well. Something pretty important in any movie is to give all of the characters something to do, and everyone gets to do something in this movie. The fact that every character has a function in the story makes it long in a good way because we get to know what every character will have to face and go through in an upcoming sequel.the cinematography is beautiful ,the effects are great, the story is unique and different from the others, some of the jokes are good and some of the jokes are bad, and the social comentary given in the film about war is a theme of influence in the story.I would even dare to say that this new entry on the Star Wars saga is the best in the series, because it follows a new story that is different form any other of the other ones (and that is better than the prequels), that avoids cliches and keeps some of the elements that are proper from any other Star Wars film.The fact that the movie is different doesn't mean it's bad, keep that in mind. Because of all of this, the good and the bad is that The Last Jedi is getting an 8 out of 10Thank you.",1
4033,"Finally! A Star Wars Movie that is fun to watch, that dares to take new directions in this old, old Galaxy! I understand all the hate this movie is getting as it basicly tells all the fanatics that they were wrong, that there is no God, that Luke is not a hero, he is a person, a broken one and that the Force is not exclusive to a specific bloodline or immaculate conception (Anakin). For me, I think of it as a new beginning for the franchise, the one where Skywalker dynasty is not in the center of entire Galaxy and the Galaxy, the real people, start to fight for their own. Plotholes? When You disagree with the direction You will find them everywhere this is not an issue here, as they were not an issue in Empire Strikes Back. I recommend everyone to watch this movie, You will not be dissapointed! I only hope that creators will not chicken out and will continue to - boldly go where no one has gone before ;)",1
4034,"Not often does a flagship film, let alone a Star Wars film, take big risks. But The Last Jedi is one of the bravest, surprising and exciting films I've seen in years. The diverse reviews are testimony to that.",1
4035,"I like reading the reviews on here from the hurt Star Wars fanboys and fangirls. The Star Wars fandom is cancer. They act like they are entitled to see what they want in a Star Wars film. Wake up call, you don't own Star Wars. Anyways you complain that the newest is the worst one ever and then you go and pay to see the sequel. You theorize every little detail in the movies and trailers and set your expectations over the sun and then you wonder why you hated it. YOU are the reason that you hate this movie, not Rian Johnson. Anyways, now onto the review. The Last Jedi improves on the Force Awakens in many ways except pacing. This movie is a fresh new take on Star Wars that is incredibly entertaining and incredibly smart. This movie finally does what the other films preach about and it tells us to leave the past behind. It's important but the future is just as important. Now, the only reason why I like the Force Awakens more is that it has better pacing. This film really drags in the second act with the Casino scene and then after that, it becomes amazing again.The Last Jedi has really high highs and is a fresh new take on Star Wars. A",1

Обоснуйте объективно, чем вам не понравился фильм? Актёрская игра? Нет, это кино за 200 миллионов бакосв, здесь по умолчанию отличная актёрская игра. Сюжет? А чем он плох? Несколько сюжетных линий, развивающихся параллельно, пересекающихся и в конце концов сводящиеся воедино. Прямо как в ваших любимых Мстителях, что тут не так?

4037,"This is a different movies, by far passes everyone other Star Wars movie before except of course for Empire. Yes this is a different Star Wars movie. ""Things are not going to go the way you think"" Many of the reviewers on the site are salty that their theories didn't come true, and that Luke was a hermit to begin with and not a Grand Master Jedi that the Expanded Universe originally wrote him as. Although, yes he is that, but that comes before this movie. Before the sequels (Although the flashbacks do help show that) Luke is now ashamed for what happened to Kylo, he feels responsible, and hurt. He feels like he let down Leia and everyone else. He has taken full responsibility for it all, he has gone to the island of the first jedi temple to simply get out of the way and die. But that is until Rey find him, at first yes he is unwilling to teach he, but then he agrees, now I cannot wait to see him return in Episode 9 as a force ghost and see Rey take over, who is the true last jedi, and teach a new generation of Jedi. She has the books, Lukes saber, and she is ready to take the screen and fulfill her destiny. Yes at first glance Snoke is a bit of a waste. Most people salty that he wasn't Bane or the Emperor, but it doesn't really matter who he is, or if he comes back or who he was. Kylo Ren has overpowered his master, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, but Snoke was arrogant, and didn't count on Kylo betraying him. Adam Driver did a fantastic job at portraying this. You think he will turn and help Rey, but he tricks her, and try to turn her. All I can say is this film was fantastic. The funniest thing about this movie is how salty people are that their fanfics didn't come true!",1

4039,"This is one of my top 5 favorite Star Wars movies. Even though it is not as great as The Force Awakens it is still a great addition to the Star Wars franchise. I loved addition of the new characters. The return of Mark Hamill as the iconic Luke Skywalker was fantastic as well as a nice end to his character. The cinematography was very nicely executed. The writing, story, and screenplay were all spectacular. The visuals, action scenes, animatronics, and puppets were gorgeous especially BB-8, R2-D2, Yoda, and the Porgs. The costumes, makeup, and hair were beautiful. I loved all of the new creatures in this one especially the Porgs. The acting was stupendous especially Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, John Boyega, Kelly Marie Tran, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Laura Dern, Billie Lourd, and Domhnall Gleeson. Frank Oz and Lupita Nyong'o's voice over performances were great. Also John Williams musical score was amazing. R.I.P Carrie Fisher the best Princess ever. A+.",1
4055,"LOL i am literally laughing my head off at the SW fans who are losing their minds.  I LOVED this movie so much more than Force Awakens, i cried, i laughed, and I THOUGHT during the whole thing, i felt Luke's pain and suffering, and Rey's void and feeling of being lost in the universe. When she says the Resistance needs you to Luke, you know she just wants to get the answers she has spent her whole life wondering about.  Even Canto Bight, despite some awkward scenes was just fine, it did what it did, and we moved on, there is a rich class in the SW Universe, and they profit off war.  Even better, we didnt even the code breaker we went there for, we got the criminal.  Nothing happened the way you expected it to, and it was great!  The longer i watched, the more i realised i had no control over where it was going, and man is that cool, i like a good story that i feel i have to read to know what happens next.  For instance, had Luke been over-powered and Goku-level strength, i would have been ok with it, but i would have left the theatre thinking ""oh yeh, duh, luke strong"", but instead i left the movie thinking 'Luke loved the lives of others so much, that he removed himself from the universe to prevent the death and suffering of more people, in hopes that the Jedi/Sith issue would go away""...i think alot of the people who have been into star wars for years just wanted fan service, as if they deserved the reward for being fans, but being a fan of sports team means you stay onboard even when they dont win the world series every year.  So ignore the people who were disappointed here, some make good points, but a low rating is not deserved for this movie, it really was very good.",1
4056,"Some parts are pretty dumb and so are some characters but the action scenes make up for it, and really that's the only reason I watch star wars.",1
4058,Worth watching. A solid entry into the series and has some amazing moments that really draw you in.,1
4060,"First of all, I'm glad that the story isn't a rip-off from Episode 5. After watching Episode 7, I thought Episode 8 would have a lot of similarities with Episode 5. I became more confident with my assumption after watching the last trailer when there was a scene of Walkers on a white surface (which I thought would be a copy of the Hoth Battle in Episode 5.). On the opening crawl of the movie, it says the Ressistance were being invaded by the First Order, which I thought is a sign that the movie would be like Episode 5 when the Rebel base was invaded by the Empire.It turned out, the story is almost completely different from Episode 5 and I was so glad it wasn’t a rip-off like Episode 7. They have brought something totally fresh and new to the Star Wars franchise. It’s filled with complexity, character transformations, and a lot of plot twists.Speaking of plot twist, there’s a hell lot of them. For instance, I didn’t expect Snoke to be killed so early. I thought he would survive until the last movie (Episode 9). I was also really surprised that Rey’s parents turned out to be ordinary people. No one ever thought of that ! I love how Kylo and Luke told the same story about the murder attempt in different perspectives. There’s a bit of noir element in the story.I find the directing and writing style to be rather childish. Lots of camera zoom-ins, lots of comical jokes (which is not my type of humor), lots of parodies. I would say it’s made to be enjoyable for young kids, more so than the other Star Wars movies.Some scenes and features are quite unnecessary for the plot. For instance, the story could’ve carried on the same way without having the casino scene. I also think a lot of the things are too overdone and some are obviously made to please the fans. Leia flying in space is too excessive and it makes force-users seem less exclusive. The part when Walkers were attacking Luke's hologram is too childish and it makes me question Johnson's maturity. And why did Luke suddenly died for no reason ? It doesn't make sense. Spirit Yoda summoning lightning is just too much for me to handle.The characters are made sillier and more naive in this movie. For instance, after Luke was watching a nostalgic holographic video of Leia asking for help, he decided to change his mind immediately. It's amazing how a single nostalgic moment can radically change his decision. The part when was Snoke teasing Kylo constantly is also very childish.Another complain that I have is the design. For instance, Snoke's room is too bright and cheerful-looking instead of dark and gloomy like what villain lairs should look like. I also don't like how Snoke was wearing a golden-colored clothes instead of black like in Episode 7. Some clothes in the casino planet look too much like in real life for a Star Wars movie.  Overall, there are a lot of things to love and hate about this movie. I love the acting performance, the plot twists, the cinematography, and its innovation. On the other hand, it's filled with too much fan service, has some useless characters and plots (if not, annoying), and the directing/writing style is too naive for me to handle. I also think the movie could've been a lot better with shorter duration, especially with the absence of casino scenes.",1
4061,"Good sequel, but not the best. Too much action and too long. Not good as Empire strikes back nor Revenge of the Sith. Like The Force Awakens, it's enjoyable.",1
4062,"Pacing issues hold back a movie that, despite this flaw, is easily the best entry into the Star Wars saga since the original trilogy. It might even be better than Return of the Jedi. The vitriol surrounding this film stems from a disappointment that Luke didn't hold up to expectations built by the now de-canonized expanded universe novels. He's not the perfect superhuman here, which creates a far more compelling story of faith lost and regained. Look beyond the fanboy rage here, this is not only peak Star Wars, this is a great story of the reckless new generation finding their roles as leaders and taking charge.",1
4063,"The Last Jedi is a fun movie with a lot of heartfelt moments in it, it understands what Star Wars needs to survive and executes the respective character arcs almost flawlessly, however it is bogged down by some uneven pacing and an uninteresting B plot.",1

Easily my second favorite Star Wars movie",1
4067,It took me a while to accept The Force Awakens into my heart and to understand it's logic but once I did I was able to remove my nerd hat and enjoy the Last Jedi. My advice to other nerds is to just try and leave your hat at the door and make yourself believe the film is going to awesome and it will deliver. The problem can be going in with too many expectations. Forget your outrage about gender politics too.,1
4069,"Warning: This review doesn't contain any spoilers per se, but it does mention stuff you specifically won't find in the movie.I know this film is very controversial. There are choices I feel were misguided. But at the end of the day, I just came to be entertained and the film was very good at that.It looks great with some visually arresting shots and sets. Snoke's throne room and the salt planet are especially eye-catching. Action is very impressive, including one of the best fight sequences in Star Wars.The cast is all likable. Especially liked the new character of Rose whose determinism contrasts well with the reluctant Finn. Dialogue is good.One of the strongest aspects of this film is that director Rian Johnson manages to defy expectations about what will happen. On the other hand, he seems so intent to go his own direction that he fumbles a little with carrying on the plot. He seems almost resistant to continue what JJ Abrahams set up in the last film. You still don't learn Supreme Leader Snoke's origins. Not even a single line of dialogue. (Though I'm not entirely hating the character even if he is a clone of Emperor Palpatine. He's got a bit of style and drive to him.) The Knights of Ren are barely mentioned. Supposedly the First Order has several force-using fighters, so where are they? Phasma was set up in the first film to be a big villain, but she is barely in this. Unlike some people, I don't mind the casino planet and the Resistance infighting. (Though I do agree that the reasoning of the rebel upper command could have been better reasoned.) Still, I think those subplots could have been easily shortened.I get that a lot of fans may feel betrayed, but I found this to be a stylish sci-fi action film.",1
4070,"This movie has single handedly destroyed my interest in Star Wars. I had seen all the movies in the Theater, ALL of them. Phantom Menace 4 times! The prequels were masterpieces compared to this. Since The Last Jedi I am completely disinterested, I did not see Solo, not out of a wish to actively boycott it, I just didn't care anymore.",1
4072,"Objectively a top 4 Star Wars movie of all time and arguably #1, but that's more subjective.  Absolutely nailed it on all fronts.  Widespread critical acclaim was warranted.  While the online reviews from fans got bombarded with haters, they don't really reflect how the broad audience felt about this movie.  It's phenomenal and the majority of people who watched it agreed - just most can't be bothered to write a review like this.The people who hated it (and bombarded user review sites) fall into three categories:#1 - They didn't get it.  They don't understand the character of Luke and can't come to grips with the fact this portrayal made perfect sense.  They have an idealized idea of who the character was from their childhood and can't understand that the character always was deeply flawed and human.#2 - They are borderline sexist/racist.  No way around it, but the tiny irrelevant pocket of people who hated this movie (the thousands of haters out of 150 million that saw it and loved it) often cite their frustrations with having female leads, an asian character or some perceived political agenda.  These people are idiots and can safely be ignored.#3 - They have just grown out of Star Wars in general.  No shame in that.  Some of these grown adults nitpick details of this movie without doing the same to the originals.  The originals are packed full of plot holes, nonsense, and childish humor - because Star Wars was and has always been a series primarily made for children.  The tiny group of people who hated this movie are mainly projecting frustration with the fact their adulthood has robbed them of the sense of wonder that makes this series so delightful and enjoyable for the millions of people who still love it.",1
4074,"Como película de ciencia ficción se sostiene muy sólida por sí misma,sin embargo, como película de star wars es un completo y total desastre al igual que su horrible antecesora.",1
4076,"I don't care what people think about this movie, Rian Johnson did nothing that the fans wanted and I think because of this, this movie is AWESOME, the story has very mature themes and it can show that star wars isn't and shouldn't be dumb action movies for the average moviegoer. But whatever, the fans got what they wanted by destroying this movie and **** with solo. JJ Bland Abrams is coming back for episode 9. This is for me still the best in the franchise. Really looking forward to the new Rian trilogy.",1
4077,"The Last Jedi did for me what I never expected. This film changed the way I saw Star Wars. The Force evolving in such a unique way, the mythology of the Force, and an end battle that gave me chills.I don't care how many people hate me for this, I think The Last Jedi is a masterpiece.",1
4078,"All’s well….The Last JediRetread Score (15/20) – The island scenes are a new take on the Dagobah motif but the opening scene and the attack scene at the end feel to much like a retread of Hoth. (But a much better job than “The Force Awakens” which really struggled in this area.)Light Saber Duel Score(20/20) – Well conceived and well executed.Light Saber Turning Score (10/10) – This is where the movie really hooked me.Depth of Characters (10/10) – One in particular but no details to avoid spoilers.Dialogue Score (0/10) – Serviceable but not memorable(definitely no “I know” ‘s here.)Pacing Score (15/20) – I thought the movie was going to end 3 times before it did.Ending Score (10/10) – But when it did end, well done. “He is our last hope. No, there are others.”80/100 – “All’s well that ends well.”",1
4079,"So, since a year has passed since one of the most decisive movies ever has come on out, and I've decided to finally review it. Why? I know for a fact this review will be down voted because it's a positive review, I know for a fact i'll be hated for loving this movie, but you know what? This is my review. I know it won't change anything, I know it's just one review, but it is my review, and like those who have given this movie a ""10"", and a ""0"", my voice will be heard as well. This is not the worst movie ever made by human beings, this is not the soulless cash grab the world has created, but it is NOT the best Star Wars movie, it most definitely has flaws, and it is far from a perfect movie, but with all that being said, it is still strong. Yes, the opening crawl isn't that good, I think setting it a few days after ""The Force Awakens"" wasn't an advantage, but after this crawl, we get John Williams amazing score blasting with a gorgeous trumpet chant, and, in my opinion, a funny joke from Poe, and Hux. I much prefer Poe to be a jokester, rather than no nonsense, because A. We have Hux to play the straight man to all of this, and B. Oscar Issacs delivers this moment very well. I think it's alright to laugh in a Star Wars movie, if Han Solo taught us anything. We then get an impressive space battle, and yes I've heard the complaints of the bombs dropping in space, and how the defy the laws of physics, but this is a universe where Lightsabers exist (which defy the laws of physics), and their exists an energy in this universe which allows people to lift rocks, and bend people's minds with the slight of a hand, so pardon me if my suspension of disbelief is a bit more for me to see if this universe didn't create technology to drop bombs in space. Also here, we get a beautiful moment where we see Rose's sister make a heroic sacrifice, and it's done with little to no dialogue, which is the strength of Star Wars.I know people have a problem with how Luke is portrayed, but it makes sense. How else would you act if you had failed your nephew, and you lost all your students when you were supposed to be the one who were to make them become the next guardians? I know Mark Hamill said he didn't agree with the choices made for Luke, however A. He later stated he was happy with how the film turned out (Amazing how people forget to include that part) and B. Sorry, he's just the actor. Sure he originated the role, but their were other actors who played Luke after him, and their will be more after him. He doesn't get a say over this character, unless he was the writer, and director. That's how it is in Television, Film, Theatre, and Voice Over. I will admit, I will agree with those who don't like this movie about the casino scene, but I won't lie, I am impressed by the mix of practical and CGI, and this obviously took a lot of time and effort to make. The one criticism i'm shocked by is how people don't like Luke's ability to use the force, but what happened if we said the force can't shoot lightning, or couldn't bring down entire ships? We limit what this all powerful force can do. Saying Luke, one of the most powerful Jedi, and THE SON OF ANAKIN SKYWALKER, can't force project himself the across the galaxy is on par with saying the Aliens in ""Signs"" weakness is wood, and water, it just makes no sense. Look, if you hated this movie, I'm sorry you had such a terrible time, and felt the need to blow up about it, and I hope you won't be this upset again. I will not however agree with how people are treated. I have a friend who was an extra on this movie, and she told me entire shooting days took longer than they should because Rian Johnson was meticulous about everything, he even looked at every extra's costume so a clear character was shining through them. He also loved using practical effects, and she said she saw many people wanting him to use CGI, but he felt it wouldn't be a Star Wars movie if they did so. I will admit, some of the stuff he has said, like the ""Your Snoke theory is wrong"", is definitely not cool, but anyone in his position would be fighting back, especially if death threats were received.  I love this movie, and that's where I stand, and I'm super excited for Episode IX, and I know fans are making wonderful films like 'Star Wars Theory's' Vader film (still waiting for part 2). I'm happy with what i'm getting from both fans, and Disney, and in the end, was I entertained? The answer is yes. Thank you for reading, and may the force be with you.",1
4080,"Look, I totally understand that there are problems with The Last Jedi and Rian Johnson made some unwanted decisions.  I'm gonna leave it at this, the movie has potential if the movie was edited differently and certain scenes were cut out and some deleted scenes were placed in the place of those scenes.  If the casino scene sequence was cut, and Rose ended up being a hacker who was once a criminal and gets them onto Snoke's ship.  So, with that there would be extra time to insert the deleted scene when Rey runs to the village she thought was in danger and has a nice dialogue scene with Luke.  The Last Jedi, while I didn't like it at first, could've been made better if a few changes were made that would've been easy to make.  I'm not part of the toxic fan base that claims this ruined Star Wars, I just think that Rian Johnson would've been a great anthology film director and J.J. Abrams should've directed the whole trilogy.  This is actually what I think LucasFilm wanted, and J.J. didn't want to direct them, good thing he's back.  So all in all, The Last Jedi is a decent and confidently made, but fails to remember that part of making Star Wars is fan service.  I want to see Rian Johnson come back and prove himself with an anthology film, which I believe he is better suited for.  Maybe bring him on to write the Obi-Wan movie with Ewan McGregor and let him make an Oscar worthy movie with good action, like Looper.",1
4084,"It's pretty laughable to see all this negative reviews stating that this is the worst Star Wars movie ever, that they ruined Luke's character, that there are too many jokes, that none of the fan theories were true...Guys, calm down you are exaggerating, A LOT.Obviously this isn't a perfect movie, nor a great movie, I personally think that it's far from being as good as Empire, New Hope or even The Force Awakens, but this is still a really competent movie in many aspects including the writing, the acting, the special effects and the score.The acting is really solid, mainly because of the direction, let's admit it, Mark Hamill is a very average actor, but thanks to a good direction, he gave a really good performance, same thing with most of the cast. The writing is competent, granted, not great or anything. The visual effects are amazing just like the previous movie and the score...Come on, it's a Star Wars score.Let's now get into some of the flaws:First, there are pointless subplots that could've been cut or could've been shorter, like the Casino scene, everyone says it's a pointless scene and I agree.Then we have the character development, most of the characters don't get any development and they basically stay the same as in the last movie, I didn't learn anything new from characters like Finn, Poe or Snoke who are wasted in this movie. New characters like Rose are really forgettable (I don't hate the actress like many of you a**holes did, she did the best with the material she had which was very poor, and yes, I agree that this character did the stupidest thing in the movie). But we get a new character arc for Luke and Rey. Hate me, but I loved Luke's character. It seems like all of you expected a Luke like from the comic books or other non-film Star Wars media, that's an overpowered wise man, but that would've been the most boring and predictable thing in the world, so it's refreshing to see this character in that ""leave me alone, I'm tired of all that Jedi stuff"" mood. He was honestly the best character of the movie, the best written and developed character.So, that's The Last Jedi for me. It's not a great movie, it's a really good movie from a filmmaking perspective. I like Star Wars movies, I'm not a hardcore fan so I could give a flying sh*t about the comic books and all that stuff, what really matters to me are the movies and The Last Jedi is certainly a really good entry, not as good as The Force Awakens or Empire, but certainly BETTER than the prequels, you wanna know why? There's no bad acting, there's no cringeworthy writing, there's no ""I don't like sand"", there's no overuse of CGI that makes the movie look like a Playstation game...So yes, hate this review all you want, but you must stop using your fanboy glasses and admit that this is far from being the worst Star Wars movie, RELAX!",1
4086,"Third favourite Star Wars film to date, it takes risks and succeeds with most of them.",1
4087,"Let me just say that it is an amazing film. The only problem I have with it though is it kinda failed to show growth in characters and changed some completely (like Luke). However, I feel the best parts of the movie are the last 30 minutes, the battle in the throne room, and all the time with Rey, Luke, R2-D2, Chewbacca, and, of course, the Porgs on the planet Skywalker isolated himself on! :)",1
4088,"I love this movie. It's been over a year and a half since it was released. I'm writing this because as soon as I got out of the avant premiere, the hype didn't let me think clearly because I loved it too much. I think Rian Johnson's proposal was very well captured and gave it its own identity in colors, dramatic tensions, unexpected twists and giving us an important reflection on what ""force"" means. A blow to the center of the jedi ego. And Luke understood that well and his omnipresence levitating in a Zen position left me with an image that was engraved forever. But it is not the only one, this film is full of glorious moments. 1. The beginning is powerful and reaffirms the concept of resistance and sacrifices for an ideal, as with Rose's sister. It also shows us the risk of a badly planned attack with Poe at the head and that Leia lets him know.  2. Leia using force (helped by Luke). Although this scene was not well achieved from the visual point of view, it was a blow for those of us who thought we were losing one of the banners of resistance. 3. The mental encounters between Kylo and Rey gave an unknown and quite interesting dimension to the connection between two people who feel with great power the force. The dupla that both generate is very powerful. 4. The encounters and disagreements of Rey with the Force. Visually it was wonderful as Luke lets him know how the force is present in everything and that it is not something that is dominated, but something that is internalized. Rey lived it from both good and evil. 5. Snoke's death and Kylo's battle with Rey united and then facing each other. I can see that scene over and over and always end up amazed. It is one of the epic moments and again in colour, dramatic tension and the batten fights themselves make it spectacular. One of the turns that tells us that Snoke was not as powerful as he made himself look (and that with the trailer of episode 9 can be confirmed) and in which you don't know what will happen. I'm sure we all think that Rey could join Kylo in that fragment of tension. Very well accomplished all this. 6. Linked to the previous scene. The collision of the resistance cruiser with the new order cruiser at the speed of light was PRECIOUS. The intensity of the scene added to the tension of the encounter between Luke and Rey. Epic moments in a battle that gave no dramatic truce.However, I think that, despite the good I pointed out, the film falls into two big problems. The first has to do with the risky presentation of a skeptical Luke who apparently gave up. As for the substance of what I wanted to convey I think the message was fine, but it didn't look genuine. Not at least the Luke we knew. That's why a lot of the fans were disappointed. However, I don't find that it takes the strength out of the film, because clearly it wasn't about the old glories anymore and the dialogue with Yoda I think fixes that risky and controversial decision a bit.The second problem has to do with gaps in the script and the loose presentations of Finn and Rose's story and their search in Kanto Byte. Seeing it in retrospect ends up being left over in the film.  Sub-Admiral Holdor was clear from the start about her sacrifice without telling anyone. Thus, the intervention of these characters became irrelevant, even the fight with Phasma. Finn might even have saved the day with his sacrifice, but Disney was not able to make that decision. The kiss that the characters give each other feels very foreign and out of place to what was happening in the film.The third problem has to do with disney humor. The dramatic tensions were very well achieved and within the epic of the projection of Luke's strength, when he is shot from the AT-AT and dust is shaken when nothing happens to him, he felt little serious and that bothered me.Taking stock, and exactly 7 months before the release of episode IX, I think it's a film, because of the low, controversial about Luke's treatment and the stories of Finn and Rose. In the rest, I feel it's a great movie and very entertaining. The tension between Kylo and Rey stands out above all else. The meaning of the ""force"" is a direct nod to what Yoda and Obi Wan once taught Luke and the message of endurance is more than recorded with the final scene of the boy who brings the broom closer by the force. It was never necessarily a matter of being pre-terminated, but a matter of learning.",1
4089,"At last we can see Luke Skywalker in action, he was depressed, alone, waiting for death, and the depiction and acting of Mark Hamill was great. The conflict between Rey and Kylo, was very well driven, the characters arc with Poe and Fin are interesting and are real. The ending is epic, how anger can blind your vision and the analogy of the spark that will light the fire that will extinguish the first order. One of the best of the saga.",1
4090,Ce film m’a déssu vraiment déssu. Après avoir vue tout les annonce je m’atendait à plus de ce film. Cette fois ses Daisy Ridley qui écrase tout les acteur. Andy Serkis fait lui aussi une perfformense d’acteur. Je trouve que le suprème lidère Snoke meure beaucoup trop vite avec tout l’étendu de sont pouvoir. Et surtout cette histoire de la prinssece Leia qui revien dans le vaisseaux mète de toute la flote avec la force ces complètement nimportequoi. Mais j’aime bien la bataille de fin. Aussi l’histoire de faire revenire le masque de Kylo Ren pour qu’il le détruis lui même dés le début du film ses nule. En tout cas le film n’e mérite sèrtènement pas 85.,1
4091,"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is in my view the best Star Wars film—and the first great Star Wars film—since The Empire Strikes Back was released nearly forty years ago (though some fanboys out there seem to disagree with me and the majority of critics who love the film; that’s fine, but I won’t bother addressing their gripes specifically as I don’t find them the least compelling). The array of female performers, maybe more than any Star Wars film to date, in particular shine in Episode XIII, the late Carrie Fisher getting a more substantial and interesting role than in Episode VII, and Daisy Ridley as Rey continuing her strong-willed, fascinating arc into potential Jedi-hood. And out of a nice array of new characters in important parts two are female. This film is well pieced together with drama, humor, and wonder, and both with freshness and familiarity. It’s an exciting, intriguing journey the whole way through. The Last Jedi tops The Force Awakens in many respects, and ranks among the best science fiction films I have seen in recent years.",1
4092,"Pretty ridiculous. There are a lot of unesccesry & wtf moments. An example of that, is when Rose Tico nearly kills Finn after he was about to risk his life inorder to many lives. And then Rose kisses Finn while people are dying in the background.",1

4099,"At moments this movie is sublime, at other's it falls seriously flat. The interactions between Luke, Rey, Kylo and Snoke are incredible. The scene with Yoda was perfection, same with everything throne room and the Luke Leia reunion on Crait. Thats more than enough for me to redeem it from the seriously flawed side plots and gags   Loved the blue milk scene though.",1
4100,"Totally unexpected outcome, packed so much story and action, okay a little bit sloppy in parts but still very entertaining!",1
4101,"Fan hate about this movie doesn't make much sense to me.  After the replay of A New Hope we had in 2015, I was really pleased with a bolder and original episode.  The only major flaw I saw was Admiral Ackbar's callous death.  But I see no point in complaining about a jedi milking an alien.  And Rose isn't that bad.  It's the second best Star Wars, in my opinion: The Empire Strikes Back is still unsurpassed.",1

It's a great Star Wars movie, and it just beats out Rogue One and the Mandelorian as the best thing to come of the recent spurt of Star Wars stuff to come out since Lucas thankfully gave up the reins on his creation. People suggesting the prequels are better have no bloody taste.",1
4105,Esse filme é um dos poucos filmes de Star Wars que eu posso considerar realmente ótimo,1

I really don’t see how it spits on Star Wars lore or any of that garbage and I’ve been a Star Wars fan since 1989. What Luke does is absolutely heroic and heartbreaking. Well-acted and very interesting, The Last Jedi is a perfectly entertaining entry in the Star Wars saga.",1
4107,"Despite what those in the fandom menace may suggest, The Last Jedi is far and the way the best Star Wars movie ever. And it's not particularly close. It's a blast. It's nuanced, challenging, the character development is brilliant, and it turns Star Wars on its head. It upends everything we thought we knew about Luke Skywalker, the intergalactic civil War and the Force itself. A perfect Syfy in general and Star Wars specifically.a perfect sci-fi in general and a perfect Star Wars specifically.",1
4108,"I love this movie. I know that's not a popular opinion, but just hear me out. I fully admit that I didn't like this movie when I first saw it. I was AMPED to see it when it came out. I saw it opening night in the theater but was REALLY disappointed when it was over. Just recently I went back and watched it to recap to get ready for Rise of Skywalker. After watching it wit fresh eyes, now I love the movie.For me, I think the reason I initially didn't enjoy it was that my expectations of what I WANTED or WAS HOPING to see is not what I got to see. The story didn't go the way I wanted or was hoping for it to go, and as a result, there were characters I wanted to find out more about but didn't. I think that was the main thing. ONCE I PUT ASIDE MY OWN BS, I was able to watch this movie and really enjoy it. I think it is a good movie and addition in the SW franchise. I only wrote this review because it's roughly 2 to 1 negative reviews to positive reviews. I am just hoping that you, if you're reading this as a Star Wars fan, might read this, give it another shot, and be able to enjoy more Star Wars.",1

The Last Jedi was basicly Rian giving JJ the finger, that's my feeling about it and i support Rian with his movie. The Last Jedi was a true Star Wars movie, it felt like Star Wars and i felt excitment watching this movie and was really surprised in all the interesting plottwists. It is my favourite Star Wars movie behind The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

4130,"This film finally moved things forward and innovates, instead of rehashing past films (like in TFA).  I see so many fanboys upset that Luke is dark in this film but his humanity is part of what makes this film great, and provides Luke a full character arc.  It's also so disappointing that Rise of Skywalker retcon'd Rey's past, as I thought leaving her unlinked to any majoy bloodline made things so much more interesting.  THJ set a beautiful table that was unique and special to this new trilogy.  Too bad JJ came back to overlay tired overplayed storylines to conclude it in Skywalker.

4133,Sorry if you didn't like this movie. It was pretty good. Would not be surprised if TROS falls below the ratings for this one in the next few months.,1
4134,"Enfin des prises de risques coherante et un développement de personnage intéressant, l episode 1/2 de Lucas etait vraimemt Pas bon, ça fait plaisir de voir un épisode 8 aussi beau visuellement et avec des personnages intéressant même si finn et rose leurs intrigues et un peu inutile et malheureusement finn est un personnage qui a du potentiel mais on ne s en sert pas ..",1
4135,"Been a star wars fan since I was a little girl, and I'm late 30s now, and this is one of my top 5 SW movies. Loved Adam Driver's acting holy smokes, and the scenes with him and Rey were fascinating. The story development really kept my attention, I felt the awe of Episode IV all over again. The cinematography was the most eye droppingly beautiful thing I've seen in ages, so gorgeous. You can tell the writer and director believed their audience was intelligent.",1
4136,"To be honest, out of all of the sequel, this one is my favorite. I used to cringe at it but it’s different than I remember and I love it.",1
4137,Awesome Episode. Just Geat Episode of All saga. Best episode. Were awesome. It's my movie and Snoke good new villian. 10/10.,1
4138,The Last Jedi is actually my favorite star wars movie ever made. No other movie has given me such feelings of euphoria and excitement. Truly Rian Johnson knows how to handle our characters with care and love.,1
4140,I like the movie. I was very surprised by the cinema and the message that the film gives at the end is very beautiful.,1
4141,"Terrific as a stand alone film. Disappointing they didn't have a clear roadmap with the new trilogy. This trilogy is missing a cohesive storyline and director. Perhaps a Rian Johnson dedicated trilogy would work better. Definitely over angry fan boys claiming their childhoods are ruined by something happening to them in their adulthoods. Good film, lame fanbase. Better stoned.",1
4142,"Great visuals, interesting characters, great dark atmosphere but it has some boring moments.",1
4143,Nie ktore watki były super a nie ktore do kitu jednak ogladajac  ten film bylem usatysfakcjonowany wiecej watkow jednak mi sie podobaly ale jednak o mojej decyzij zapadl fakt zobaczenia luke skywalkera w stanie glebokej depresij oraz jak patrzyl na zakon jedi po swojej porazce  jaka bylo prawie zamordowania bena solo,1
4144,"A great film that brings risk to the franchise, introducing the four acts and carrying messages such as that it can be important for the future without having a great legacy. A film very undervalued by the toxic fandom that has worked this saga for decades.",1
4148,"I thought it was a good movie, and I don't want to let it have that horrible score that users give it, of course, I still respect them, but I liked the movie. I feel that the 3 disney movies are rather similar, but they have different things; however, this is not my favorite of the 3, but I want it to go up at least a little and to ask people to stop giving it such bad scores, at least a 2 or a 3, and with explanation, but not unexplained zeros",1
4149,"The most divisive but also the boldest this new trilogy has to offer. Rian Johnson pushes the boundaries and takes the series by the horns and attempts something different that to me felt very satisfying by the end credits. Thematically minded and character driven with an excellent score and visual effects to die for. It's a shame that the dire Episode 9 failed to build upon this with something even more bold but for me, this remains the highlight of this new trilogy.",1
4150,"The Last Jedi is the only good movie in the Sequel Trilogy, it honors George Lucas' Star Wars, while at the same time honoring his real life and his discarded drafts for the sequels, and criticized JJ Abrams lazy remake narrative in 7.Like the creator of the Saga, George Lucas himself, Luke Skywalker has been in exile for a few years. After being betrayed with an apprentice obsessed with remaking the past, you could say that Kylo Ren is JJ Abrams, while Snoke is clearly Disney. And of course, Rey is the fans despertely begging George Lukas to return and fix the mess. There is some message that buying a last name or IP like Star Wars or Skywalker, doesn't make you great. It does not give you the right to be a great storyteller just cause you have the name. So yeah it's a great message for Rey to know she doesn't need to spend trillions in buying the Star Wars or Jedi copyright to be something great in her life.Of course the Abrams led sequel is horrible, because it says quite the opposite. Rey needs copyright to be great.This dissilusioned Pole version of Luke Skywalker, sorta like Dr. Manhattan too. Is also a great criticism on religions. People think that being baptized is enough. And forget about the meaning of the religion itself, they blindfolded follow it without questions.Then is great at explaining Kylo Ren's weakness, Luke didn't trained him to be a warrior. He trained him to be a pacifist, like himself. Then someone burned and Massacred Luke's Jedi temple, and Luke remained pacifist, while Kylo Ren sought a powerful militar power to prevent another massacre, ironically becoming what he sought to destroy.At the end he wants Luke to prove that violence is the only way to create peace. But of course Luke just distracts him. He never fights, him and it connects with Leia'$ message about the importance of running away sometimes, and taking time to prepare to fight.Is very meta-meta analysis, it doesn't stop to explain the previous movies for the casuals. It makes sense that Luke would resent the Prequel Jedi failures (Lucas the Prequel themselves), and be hesitant to do more, before being ready. And it makes sense, as a passing of the torch",1
4151,"A divisive albeit very well produced entry into the Star Wars canon, The Last Jedi offers the freshest take on the Disney sequels, taking risks and innovating where the other movies played safe to satisfy half of the fandom.The film is striking thanks to its incredible cinematography, acting, vfx and art direction; it offers its audience with riveting plot twists, actual character development and properly directed scenes making for this cinematic experience an enjoyable one (as long as one is willing to go with the lighter tone/new direction of the film which can be divisive for fans).It is worth noting that some sequences and plot points didnt seem to work as well as they were intended to; The Canto Bight chase and the Finn/Rose sequence on Crait can tend to halt the narrative or take one out of the experience.",1
4154,"Rian Johnson uses Kylo Ren, Rey, and Luke Skywalker in a different and innovative way, especially on adding a character development for Luke's persona. On the other hand, he creates a simple and dry story for the other characters such as Finn and Paul, subverting sometimes our expectations just for the sake of its. Different from JJ Abrahms or Lucas original piece, Johnson talks about mythology, the idea of a broken hero, and most importantly, the failure.It is a deeply flawed Star Wars movie, but trying to say something with only a third of screentime worth the time seeing. However this little screentime is way better than any ideas from episode 9 or the prequels.",1
4156,"An underrated movie. While it has many problems like what they did with Luke Skywalker, I still enjoyed it.",1
4157,"If you take ""Star Wars"" from the title this isn't a bad movie / romp for a Saturday evening.... However if you look at it as a star wars fan it has its flaws / plot holes. However I like that it points out you don't need to be a skywalker / palpatine to be apart of star wars. There were other jedi & sith… Maul, Ashoka anyone?? 7/10",1
4158,Probably the best Star Wars movie since episode V times; reformist but not too much with one of the best directorial installations of the last few years; new characters well studied and very interesting the new narrative implications for the old,1
4159,"While I am not here to claim the movie was perfect in every way, this movie was awesome. It took all the characters it introduced in The Force Awakens and developed them in a wonderful way. The character work, set pieces, and action sequences were all excellent.",1
4160,"Going into this movie I had one wish, I thought ""Please don't be a repeat of Episode V."" The Force Awakens mirrored A New Hope, and while it made sense to reassure returning fans, and give any new fans a fantastic story to start with, it disappointed me a little how safe they played it. The Last Jedi took all the expectations I had going in and threw them out the window.    Now most people are upset by this. They wanted all their questions answered more or less the way they were expecting. I feel the exact opposite, and yes I am a long time fan of ALL the previous movies, not that I should have to qualify my opinion with that. This movie was exhilarating. I can't remember the last time I turned to my friend in the theater with my mouth open in amazement because I'm so shocked about what just happened. It made the movie exciting, and the stakes higher, since I no longer felt completely sure about anything that was going to happen. Movies are ultimately just entertainment, and it certainly succeeded in that regard.    The visuals, acting, spectacle, sound, etc was phenomenal. The entire scene in Snoke's throne room made me want to cheer. I enjoyed this movie the whole way through, and I am excited about what direction the new Star Wars will take in the future. For all the people who want to nitpick every detail and piece of lore, Star Wars doesn't belong to you. It doesn't even belong to George Lucas anymore. If you don't like the ideas of the people who work very hard and do their best to make the best movie they can then don't watch them, and leave the rest of us alone.",1
4163,"Star Wars is now just yet another superhero franchise, and trust me, it's about as much fun to watch as it is to gargle boiling cat pee. I'd go into every little thing that, as a long-time fan bothered me about the movie, but honestly and without exaggerating it'll take less time to tell you what's actually good about it:-The special effects are well-done and as a result the battles looked and sounded great.-Mark Hamill was almost able to make chicken salad out of the chicken sh-t script and was fun to watch.-Phasma is cool.-The stuttering thief was a very well-acted character.I'm not kidding, trolling or joking, that's pretty much it. Look up a screenshot of Carrie Fisher looking old, tired and pissed off from this movie and you'll see pretty much what every face over 20 looked like as I was coming out of the theatre.",0
4165,"This is a terrible ""Star Wars movie"" as it does not respect the established lore or characters. It wastes or abuses the established characters in order to highlight the new, poorly developed characters. It also a terrible movie in general; It features horrible logic flaws, ill timed humor, pointless subplots, terribly obvious and sloppy scientific flaws and characters who seem to act almost randomly at times with no consistent motivation. There was nothing about this movie which made me want to see it again and almost no scene that was not ruined by a flaw in character, plot or execution. This is not the Star Wars movie You were looking for; Move along, Move along..",0
4166,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the eight installment of the Star Wars franchise and I have to admit it, that movie was pretty darn good and somewhat, very familiar to Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi brought so many good things in this installment, including new characters, brand new backstories, and a direction that may inevitably impact future Star Wars movies in general. Since this film is directed by the guy that directed Looper and few episodes of my all-time favorite show Breaking Bad (Rian Johnson), has brought in a very unique approach that made this latest installment very mature than The Force Awakens. After seeing this film, I was blown away of how epic and surreal that movie has turned out to be when it comes to the action intensity, performances, and the sound mixing. This film is awesome compared to Empire Strikes Back, but not as masterful as The New Hope. And Disney.... please don't ruin Star Wars!",1
4167,"I watched A new hope when it first came out in a theater and it changed my life. Particularly the Luke Skywalker character, I have been a lifelong fan and have loved all the movies, read the novels, watched the cartoons, purchased the toys, collected memorabilia, attended SW events etc. etc. I loved the prequels, (except maybe the midichlorians thing) and really liked, I mean really loved TFA and all the new stories and possibilities it created. I didn’t have a fan theory, and I wasn’t looking for nostalgia coming into TLJ, I just wanted the story to continue. Instead what I got is the character assassination of Luke, all the interesting new characters become irrational and pointless and a bunch of plot holes and new cannon that makes the suspension of disbelief more difficult for this and all the other past movies. The visuals were Amazing, the fight scenes and the space fights were also probably the best in the franchise. And the porgs were adorable. The new planets were visually stunning and super interesting for future media. But I just can’t get past the narrative; the actual story being told itself, mostly characters making decisions inconsistent with their personalities, pointless side stories.",0
4168,"Not recommended. Rian Johnson might not be a bad director, but he made a bad movie. It's not worth getting angry about, but it's telling that he thinks Empire Strikes Back would have backlash today. Clearly he didn't get Empire, who thought giving him creative control over this movie would be a good idea?",0
4176,"This trilogy is just feminist and SJW propaganda at it's finest. I think the actors did a good job, specially Adam Driver, but they can't save the mess. I like Daisy Ridley as Rey, too bad she plays the stereotypical and generic strong female protagonist (Mary Sue) with no development or weaknesses, just innately the best at everything. Then we have the multicultural and inclusive good guys, that fulfill every quota, against the evil white males. Action scenes are good if you can ignore the many cliches and deus ex machina that take away all tension.This movie is an example of being capable of the best and also the absolute worst. The final Luke moment is one of my favourite Star Wars scenes, but then we have the blatantly filler Finn and Rose adventure. While I don't think the plot decisions were necessarily bad, the change of directors made the trilogy lose all sense of direction.",0
4178,Would be a somewhat decent standalone film but it lacks continuity and the film is supposed to be a franchise film. Casino scene completely unwanted and Snoke shouldn’t be killed off just like that.,0
4179,"This thing killed star wars, it deserves to be remembered as a total disaster ....3/10 itself, but 0/10 due to the damage it caused to the franchise",0
4180,"Terrible movie, wasted my time watching it. I really don't understand how they could ruin a franchise like that",0
