0,"Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece.",1
1,"Absolutely,  positively the greatest movie ever made. Every frame is perfection from start to finish. It will never be bettered. There is nothing more to add.",1
2,"The Godfather trilogy (and I'm one of the few who rates III up there with I and II) finds a wonderful balance between a well-paced story and some terrific crisis moments for its characters. For those who may be concerned about whether or not they will enjoy it, I'd suggest watching The Godfather (Part I) while keeping in mind that this is a story about Michael wanting to go straight, to be good. To society and to his family.",1
3,"It's easy to see why this is the highest rated film. The acting is on another level, the directing is not only gripping and atmospheric but it doesn't cut from one thing to another. Everything that's important is shown, all the dialogue, all the detail. The story is obviously what makes this film so great. Although not an action movie, some of the scenes make the typical modern Hollywood blockbuster look laughable. The film is not only well-directed and clever, but also easy to follow. The story isn't over-complicated with a bundle of events which have no connection. The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because it's over 3 hours, and for a film that long you'd expect more to happen. The film can be cut down by about half an hour without losing any narrative or quality.",1
4,The best movie in Metacritic really is a great movie. Francis Ford Coppola made and aced a great film which is better than his sequels. Really well thought and made into a top hit Mafia-detective movie. One of Ford's best movies.,1
5,"I find some negative reviews to be pointless  either yammering on about how ""long"" the movie was, slow is another one (though many of these reviewers being kids and not quite used to the expository routines of late 60's drama) and committing the reviewers sin of comparing it to other hyper-spastic (almost cartoonish) crime dramas like Scarface and Pulp Fiction  though exceptional in their own right.  There is a quality of this film that tributes a long forgotten style of story telling within subtlety; the end result a beautifully woven opera of deceit, betrayal, loss and violence. It is and will always be a film that reaches the highest levels of fiction, wherein the film is preformed....and not spoon-fed to the audience. heaven forbid you'd have to do some actual thinking in order to complete a relatively easy 3 hours of story telling.",1
6,"Violent, well scripted and large, this classic American recounts a dark period in the history of america so perfect and convincing with perfect performances from all his cast this movie will likely be immortal.",1
7,"A masterpiece. How can the Earth continue without Coppola's The Godfather. One of the most iconic films ever talked about worldwide and acclaimed well by everybody, it's more fun to talk about it.",1
8,"This film is simply a classic, look at Brando, the only disappointment for me is that, this is the only film he features in!. It is the making of Al Pacino, he graces the screen, the Godfather perverts Pacino into the dark side, but the process proceeds to ebb away at him . Robert Duval sits in the back ground, but his loyalty to the family shines through, he doesn't win best supporting for this , but easily could have!. Quite frankly, watch this film, a few times, eventually all the detail soaks in. It really is one of the best of all time, once you've seen this, watch the other two, they all for me are classics, learn from them and enjoy!.",1
9,Unexpected death constantly interrupted by elegant music and scenes of rose garden. It is a little bit annoying how dumb women in this movie appear to be.,1
10,"The Godfather is the perfection of cinematography, with a unique and special gangster style, a respect for the unsurpassed work and a family, a family that revolutionized cinema.",1
11,"The Godfather is, without a doubt, one of the greatest films to have ever been made. The acting by all characters is superb. The plot is convoluted and twisting enough to keep you interested, but not until the point that it becomes too hard to follow. The cinematography and visual effects are equally impressive. While much of this movie is grounded in reality and thus the visual effects are usually pretty standard, there are a couple of shots that are absolutely amazing for the time.Brando and Pacino's performances of this movie steal the show and both help make this film the masterpiece that it is. In addition, the screenplay is one of the best I have ever seen. Oftentimes, in these crime/mafia films, they tend to run on for too long and the viewer becomes bored. Despite being a three hour movie, not only was I glued to the edge of my seat each time, but each scene felt integral to the story and themes that the film is trying to tell. Further, it feels as if every single *action* taken by a character has an impact on either a theme or the outcome of the movie. This level of screenplay has not been matched by another film that I have seen.In addition the cinematography of this film has resulted in several of the most iconic scenes in all of cinema being brought to the big screen. The number of quotes, iconic scenes, jokes, and memes that came from this film is absolutely amazing.Whether it is the greatest movie of all time or not, The Godfather is a must see film that has had one of the greatest impacts on modern society and popular culture out of all the films that have ever been made. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys cinema.",1
12,"Inspired by the Five Families of New York City, The Godfather tells the story of how the Corleones are pushed against the wall by their rivals and other upcoming gangsters who want to make money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him, and their retaliation and its consequences. Alliances are formed in secret, murders are plotted, enemies are butchered or blown to pieces without remorse. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) and his sons Sonny (James Caan) and Michael (Al Pacino) are the main characters. The actors bringing them to life have succeeded in their jobs so supremely that these characters have become the stuff of legend. Don Vito's backstory from the novel was pushed into The Godfather Part II, and that was a practical decision as the movie was already three hours long. Sonny and Michael display their acumen for running criminal activities when the reins are handed to them in their turn. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is the consigliere, or the most trusted adviser, of the Don. We are transported from 1940s NYC ripe with Mafia bosses one-upping each other, to Sicily and Las Vegas. The characters are never shown to traverse great expanses of land or sea in search of destiny or whatever. Neither are they shown to be engaging in life-or-death situations where they have to come out on top using their wits or physical strength or endurance. But the change of settings does meet the requirements of the epic genre. Even though we don't get to see large scale gunfights or something like that, the fact that the Corleones are in all these places helps to form that opinion. The story is essentially about a single family, and you get the impression that the message here is that family is important, and that the lengths you're willing to go to to protect them knows no bounds. The Corleones' peace is fazed when a gangster offers them a deal in drugs. Don Vito expresses his disgust and refuses. This triggers an unexpected ploy for gaining power and upper hand and turns the conflict into a fully fledged gang war. Some characters are displaced, forced to take up arms, or caught in the crossfire. Another calamity strikes when things seem to have cooled down. Finally, the Corleones deal with their enemies effectively and ruthlessly. The victory is theirs, but if it is worth it is for the audience to decide. The Godfather's success lies in its rich story and characters. Often times, great stories come about by accident. The setting complements the plot and the characters, and becoming a character itself, creates a blend that is greater than the sum of its parts. These characters and plot could quite easily have worked in a medieval setting of dynasties warring for control over a kingdom, or any other setting for that matter, but the fact that the setting was New York City and the control over the city meant control over the most lucrative criminal activities, which is a decadent scheme, and immediately paints even the good guys in a bad light, was what in my opinion made The Godfather much more intriguing and enduring. There are many enemies to deal with. The film doesn't develop them at all. The Corleones are the only ones who are explored and developed as characters. At first it seems like it is a story of a group of people who have virtually everything they could ever want and the film would only chronicle their exploits as they vanquish this enemy and that. This changes as we move forward and witness the bloodshed. No good movie can come into being without good plotting, believable characterization, classy cinematography and memorable dialogue, and here it is all brought together nigh perfectly. The production design was impressive. The houses and their interiors, and the cars and costumes were fascinating and left me with a desire to be able to witness that world firsthand. The secondary characters may not have seemed to be given much screen time to develop them but the cast is so huge that if they had done it the movie would have been at least an hour longer. The score is so simple and true to the story that you don't need me to tell you that it may be the most memorable score ever. A lot of time is spent in contemplation and silence, as the characters decide what the best course of action should be in response to a particular problem. The dialogue fleshes out the characters very well. The Godfather is essentially a film that looks into the lives of the gangsters at the top of the hierarchy. We only see the comings and goings, and not the handiwork, of the men who carry out the orders of their bosses. No shootouts during the gang war are shown. The intrigue that directly affects the main characters is in itself so destructive and deadly that not once the exclusion of the ordinary mobsters bother me in any way. The Godfather cannot be dismissed as being merely about a mob family and a bunch of criminals. Given his later career, I think it's safe to venture that Coppola was born to make this movie.",1
13,I'm not a writer or a critic so I can't really tell you why this movie is perfect... but I know it is because of how I feel every time I see it.  I'm moved.,1
14,"The Godfather is simply the god of films, it was a privilege to watch the Oscar winning performance of Marlon Brando, who conquered the role Vito Corleone. The film was a different class and is filled with incredible plots that is delivered in a fantastic mafia way. I recommend it to everyone even if they aren't into the gangster style films, it was no doubt the greatest film ever made. Each character resonates with you and the brilliant anti-hero role of Michael Corleone was a true gift to watch, which Al Pacino does not get enough credit for and was a genius replacement for Vito his father who's character was very difficult to equal.The scene in the restaurant between Michael, Sollozzo and McCluskey was magnificent and couldn't have been done any better, the suspense was outstanding from the bit Michael came back with the gun to the part he left the table with bullets in both men.When talking about leading you into movies, the Godfather pulled you in straight away the acting from Brando was intriguingly flawless. The first scene straight away brought the character Vito Corleone to life! We were never sure what Vito would say or what Michael would do, or how Sonny would react, which made me fall in love with the movie. And of course a big hand to the director Francis Ford Coppola, who brought us a film of pure gold that bestows the control of power from one generation to the other and character development of Michael was something special, when his father was shot the change took you by storm and when Sonny died he looked past justice and finished what his father had started, it was displayed with no fault what so ever and t all in all could not have been any better. The film take's you down the road of the powerful family crime dynasty and will blow your mind.The Godfather, is an offer you can't refuse.",1
15,"The thing I love about The Godfather is the accurate portrayal of the mafia. There aren't gratuitous scenes or extreme Hollywood drama. It is a timeless classic, and honestly I have seen it 50+ times and never get sick of it. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is impeccable and some of the best acting I have ever seen.",1
16,"it might be a long movie but you dont want it to end. The best gangster film of all time no doubt marlon brando improvisation made this move,and the movie is joined with 2 other amazing films which makes it the best triolgy. Al pacino as per usual at his best its a young al  pacino that you see another rang of his brilliant acting skills",1
17,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather."" If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion. Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable. Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist. The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked. Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience. We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens.",1
18,movie doesn't continue fast. it tells you everything. you learn about their life. dialogues talk to you. it is very realistic film like our lifes. acting is perfect. i understood again why marlon brando is the best actor. it teachs you about life lessons. it is summit of all movies,1
19,"I cant understand when somebody says negative about this movie.To me,it's perfect,the best picture of all times.Idea,director,actors,music,composer,make up..everything is ideal!!! I'm lo vin it!",1
20, The movie is perfect. Everyone who gave it a 0 are probably the same people that watch Fox News and think global warming is fake so there is no point in arguing. Either you know movies or you don't.,1
21, Great Movie,1
22,"Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece.",1
23,"This movie does not deserve a perfect score.  It's a boring overrated movie, seriously, how can anyone understand what Brando is saying with all that cotton wool in his mouth, let alone get away with it, he must have been laughing all the way to the bank and taking the p@ss out of everyone with this movie.",0
24,"If not the greatest movie ever made, than certainly the greatest gangster drama movie ever made. You have probably heard that bin said before, and well, it's quite true. Now, if your a critic, you pretty much have to like this movie, even if you didn't. I certainly did like it because, one, it gives great performaces, especially by the great Marlon Brando, and it has a tremendous screenplay that goes deep within its drama and plot points. Thrilling also,""The Godfather"" is probably one of the best movies of the 20th century, and if you haven't already seen it, go get it and watch it. 10/10 [R]",1
25, Thanks to Marlon Brando who made this movie the best of all times up to date. It keeps getting better the more often you watch it.,1
26, Best movie ever! ,1
27," If this movie seems slow to you, you've probably been watching too much contemporary television. This is how movies ought to be paced - organically, and earning their progress. When The Godfather is slow, it's because it's trying to share something with us, either a nuance, or a bit of great acting that deserves a few more seconds of screen time. The cast is amazing. The score is famous for a reason. Its scenes became cliche for a reason. It won't make you feel better about the world, but damn is this a great example of storytelling.",1
28, this movie is perfect just for the LOOSERS that do not not understand a msterpice go ahead and see some homo intented film like the lord of the rings,1
29," The first time I saw this movie, when it first came out 33 years ago, I left the theater after one hour or so, I was bored and confused, perhaps I was too young for this film. Today I consider the Godfather to be the best movie ever, I'm a fan of the film and I know every character and detail. Of course I seen it a hundreds times, in fact it",1
30, Perfect.,1
31," Simply put, awesome movie.",1
32, Is there really anything better?,1
33," This is a perfect score movie for a reason, it is the best movie that has ever been concieved. The score of 80 is not counted as it is an uncerdited and therefore and not from any professional critic, it should be put amongst the user reviews. As for people giving this film a 0/10 I am quite sure that you are pathetic little people that live their lives on the net and hang shit on any movie with any substance or critical acclaim. The impact of this movie, considering it was made in 1972 still has great affect. My sister watched this movie for the first time just a couple of weeks ago and for someone who thinks Legally Blonde is a good movie to say this is one of the best films she has ever seen just proves it is excellent. Coppolla is a legendary filmmaker, many should take a leaf from his book.",1
34, Excellent movie.,1
35," This movie is the best ever, and it shows its cinematic screenplay brilliance as well as its incredible, dynamic script, a great, amazingly-told storytelling, and a remarkable cast. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star in this four-star crime drama.",1
36, Absolutely unmatched in its immersiveness. The opening wedding sequence is possibly the finest exposition of any film I've ever seen. This is a film that needs to be shown on the big screen every couple of years.,1
37,I think this the best movie ever made. Ths is the #1 in gangster films. #1 in movies all around. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,1
38," One of the best movies ever along with Godfather II, and other classics...Marlon Brando shows off his range and acting versatility by transforming from being a '50s American actor to a convincingly Italian mafia man. I first thought he was Italian, and I was surprised how un-italian he was prior to his role. So good, that he would adopt this speech into his everyday talk for the rest of his life. That man was a legend. Pair him up of Al Pacino, who was a budding star, and now legend (though he has plateaued ever since Scent of a Woman, when he won an Oscar for saying Huah!, when it really should've been for this role, or as Tony Montana in Scarface, in Dog Day Afternoon, in Carlito's Way, or other). Pacino is startling brilliant as a seemingly normal young man who reluctantly joins the mafia, but then takes over the family business and runs it like his own after it was passed down from Brando. James Cahn was absolutely phenomenal as the hotheaded Sonny Corleone, and Jon Cazale as the weak-minded brother Fredo. This movie changed the gangsta movie landscape giving a third dimension to previous cop-bad guy, go kill movies, and really gives an insight of what they are about, that being loyalty, trust, bonding, and later turns into power, corruption, greed, and eventually the downfall of Michael Corleone. None of them are the typical good guy, but all of them are interesting as characters and it engages you wholly into the film and thrusts you into the dialogue, making you never want to take a bathroom break. This is what makes a classic, and if you don't understand the concept of this, than you don't know movies.",1
39," This movie is possibly the best movie off all time. It has all of the element of a great timeless classic. It has big stars/soon to become big stars, a great director and an amazing plot! It rightly deserves to be number one!",1
40, Great Movie,1
41, Best movie ever! ,1
42,"This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece.",1
43,"Fantastic film, although rather overrated. The characters are almost perfect, the story is almost perfect, and the dialogue is almost perfect. Everything else is just good. No more, no less.",1
44,hell i dont even need to write a review for this movie everything was perfect! but since i need 150 charecters i will give tiny details this movie has great great acting the story is beutiful and everything else is amazing,1
45,Truly one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. It may take a few viewings to fully grasp the film. I certainly didn't care for it on my first viewing. But it will gradually pull you in with each viewing. 4-star Classic!,1
46,"An American classic, and one of the greatest film's ever made. Director Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The film chronicles a ten year span (1945 to 1955) in the life of the Italian-American Corleone crime family of New York City. Won the 1972 Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Coppola and Puzo).",1
47,"A cinematic masterpiece.  In the top 100 movies list for a reason.  For those people (You know who you are and I'm not going to individually name you) who gave this movie a bad review, simply put you have no brain or very simple minded maybe brain dead moron movies like Freddy got Fingered or Dumb and Dumberer (yes the prequel to Dumb and Dumber because the first movie might be way to complicated for you) is better suited for you.  This is why I hate forums like this because some idiots of the world need some face punching for their insulting stupidity.",1
48,"As epic as you can possibly get. Combined with Part II (I recommend watching back to back in one sitting), there is no way you can top the film-making here. Some of the most memorable characters and dialogue to ever hit the silver screen. Marlon Brando's career was gold even before this, but this applies him for sainthood. Robert Duvall and James Caan are fantastic and Al Pacino broods well among these great actors. Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece here (and then he did it again with Apocalypse Now). It's possible he owned the 70's.",1
49,"You hear all this hype surrounding The Godfather, such as ""it's a masterpiece,"" and the movie is included in countless critics and moviegoers top 10 movies of all time. I'm afraid they're right. The movie is a masterpiece and a beautiful piece of art that surpasses most films I have ever seen. From a technical standpoint it's flawless.",1
50,"Its one of the greatest films of all time for a reason. The acting is amazing, The story telling is great. It has a few minor flaws (such as when Sunny beats up Connie's husband, that was a terrible fight scene). Yet all the minor flaws are completely forgetable because the movie is that good.",1
51,"Que obra maestra. De lo mejor que ha visto el cine en su historia. Una excelente dirección, guión, historia. Todo, absolutamente todo. Algo realmente impresionante.",1
52,I'm not going to try and insult audiences who have loved this film for over 40 years by telling you this is a bad film - it was just never meant for me. I personally found it to be one of the most intensely boring films I have seen in a while. I suppose it's the genre I have a problem with: crime and gangster films seldom interest me. This one is no different.,0
53,"""The Godfather"" is one of the few gangster films that connects the members of the Mafia as a family. The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much. His voice also was barely understandable due to his croaking voice mumbling what sounded like English. Ultimately ""The Godfather"" still stands up as the best movie in the American crime genre.",1
54,"An excellent adapted script, an unforgettable ensemble, an amazing score, excellent quotes, and unforgettable moments, The Godfather is nothing short of a masterpiece!",1
59," Godfather isn't a terrible movie. On the contrary, its a movie with a ton of unrealized potential that executes with the grain.",0
61," I HATE this movie. What a load of boring drivel. From the beginning to the end, this film neither exited or engaged me. The characters seemed utterly false, the story utterly mundane. There have been far better ganster films - the untouchables, donnie brasco, hell - even bugsy malone is better than this. And the worst thing is, everyone seems to love it. Why? WHY? The best movie ever? This, better than Pulp Fiction? This, better than LA Confidential? This, better than Scarface? this is a bandwagon ""best film ever"" and each of you knows that you are lying and following the trend. Oh, and the length of the film was just the icing. It should have ended about 3 times before it did finally end.",0
62, very very over rated movie and could not get into it i would give it a 7 but beacsue its supposed to be the best movie of all time and kinda sucked it get 0 points from me,0

67, Did not care for it. It insists upon itself.,0
68," HORRIBLE FILM!! so boring, this metascore is clearly rigged, it is impossible for 100, as that means absolutely everyone rated it perfect! Grrr.",0
69, Too overrated.either the the revievers were paid to give it good scores or they were threatened by the mob.,0
72,"All though those three hours were a bit exhausting to me, I would still say that watching ""The Godfather"" was exiting and thrilling, and I would recommend it to everyone, just so everyone could see what the buzz over this film is all about.",1
74, Masterpiece of $&!%. The ratio of 10 ratings is a excellent example of how dependent peoples minds are on the status quo. If you were to watch this movie without ever hearing about it you would most likely find it to be a well scripted dull movie and nothing more.,0
75," Wow. That's all I have to say, this film was just horribly overrated.... I mean it's not a bad film or anything, but it is too boring and none of the characters are really likable.",0
76," I don't know where all of you get off. ""Oh I like The Godfather.. you know, and The Beatles, and bread, and water, and breathing"" please can we get out of the mentality that we have to venerate this movie. Sure. Watch it once. Recall that the baby boomer generation will revere it until they die off. I say at that point we don't show this movie to kids born in the 21st century. next!",0
77, Ok if by 100 you mean its worth seeing if you get paid $100 dollars but I would not even see it again for that much worse time of my life and the only reason i didn't leave is because it was raining out side. This movie was the worse I hope critics get shot for saying other wise.,0
80,"I saw it on TV so it was a lot less violent.  It is the definitive mafia movie, even if they were never allowed to say the word.  The mafia would not have liked it.",1
81,This is the only movie I've ever watched that has put me to sleep. I imagine that the entire movie could have been put into about 1/8th the time and still have retained all of its meaning.,0
82," The most overrated and boring thing i have ever seen. It was just a bunch of stuff that happened for three hours. No point, no meaning, no feeling. Get off the bandwaggon!",0
83, Completely over rated ... nuff said.,0
84, This movie sucks.,0
85,"I would say The Godfather is very overrated. It has terribly tedious delivery, and is basically just three hours of guys in suits sitting at a table talking about business.",0
86, This movie sucks.,0
87," Excuse me, how did this movie get a 100, the metacritic calculation failed to factor in the last entry which would inevitably knock down the score to a 99. I personally have never seen the movie but I am just pointing out the fact that the critism of the movie is very bias towards it being perfect and classic. [Ed: Sean, take a look at the scoring explained page re: normalization.]",0
88,This movie doesn't have any lightsabers in tit and no Optimus Prime. VERY BORING there isn't even Jar Jar Binks? Like what the heck! THIS IS THE ABSOULTE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!,0

90," I can't believe i've I never had seen the entire movie before the other day it is amazing. I got the set of dvds and all of them are good, but the first is the best. It now is up ther with Revenge of the Sith, King Kong, Lord of the Rings, War of the Worlds, aving Private Ryan and many others it is amazing see all three.",1
91, The Godfather is incredible Francis Ford Coppola has made a one of a kind movie. All actors score big on the screen.,1
92," I can not see what is wrong with this, but i can see what is brilliant about it!! fabulous acting with rich enduring story telling. how it tells you about the mafia with the Michael the son (Al Pacino) wanting a life for himself really gets you into heart with the idea of loosing family in the dangerous business of crime operations.",1
93," You talk about the realness, here you find it, honesly i can't say more because this movie more than more.",1
94," Greatest movie of all time. To those who believe the Metascore is off, should probably read how scores are calculated. They are WEIGHTED, as in Variety (the irrelevant little publication) doesn't count for much. Definitely deserves the 100.",1
95," A masterpiece. a fantastic cast, with the possible exclusion of Kay Adams. a very memorable performance by Marlon Brando. as Brando once said ""it is the audience really that is doing the acting.""",1
96, Yeah deff the second best movie ever made.,1
97, This film is a work of art.,1
98," The Godfather is the best moive of all time! Respect, Power and Money.",1
99," This is cliche, but it really is ""the perfect movie.""",1
100," This is easily the best movie of all time, then would be part two, but I can't stand watching part 3, it, just like far too many other movies, ruined the trilogy.",1
101," The people who gave this movie a ""0"" are either trying to be subversive, or are completely moronic. My guess is that they are trying to be the former. Whether you like The Godfather, or thought that it was overrated, it certainly doesn't warrant a ""0"". There are far worse movies out there than this wonderfully acted epic. As for the voter who said that Scarface was a better movie...now that's moronic. While The Godfather is a true classic, Scarface is a poor man's Godfather. It is, at best, an overblown, long-winded film, chock-full of a mugging Al Pacino (has Brian DePalma EVER made a subtle movie?). Even then, I still give it a ""5"". But Godfather gets a ""10"".",1
102, If you gave this a 0 you are the ones that love movies like Baby Geniuses 1 and 2. This movie was great and you have bad taste.,1
103," Its a slow and very long movie but patience is a virtue.This is not a movie for the impatient people.This is an instant classic movie that has a great moral story and all Italians will love this movie.Marlon Brando was perfect for the role of the Don.The acting,dialog and action was brilliant.Its the second best movie ever made after Scarface.",1
104," Two reasons I don't give it 10: the book is so good (especially leading up to Michael's leaving for Sicily), that it is unfair to give sole credit to the film. Having watched the film after a few years, I now find the pacing a bit slow (yes, perhaps due to the kinetic pace of many films today).",1
105," Coppola's playfulness is given full reign in several imaginatively retro montage sequences. Newspaper headlines pass over shots of hands passing the spaghetti bowl at one of those impromptu feasts that nourished the underworld. Equally potent is the quick cutting between images of Michael, at the baptism of a godchild, promising a priest that he will renounce Satan at the same time that his enemies are being gorily gunned down all over town. Coppola knew how to create monsters - Michael and his father - and make us gleefully root for their triumph. Michael, especially monstrous because with his education and early vow to stay clear of the family business, his slow evolution into cold-blooded killer seems more unforgivable. The collaboration between director and actor here is magical. We actually see Michael's face go deader as the movie progresses, and his eyes seem to narrow as if Michael can no longer bear what he sees around him and himself. If you've only viewed ""The Godfather"" on television, you owe it to yourself to go out and see it on the big screen.",1
106," It is one of the greatest movies ever.All aspects of this movie are brilliant. Almost every scene is a masterpiece. Al Pacino's acting in Godfather Part 1 and 2 has to be among the best in the history of movies. In particular, he is so real and believable in the scene at the restaurant in the Bronx.",1
107," This film is one of my all time favorites, and this film has Marlon Brando in, in my opinion, one of his best roles. A must see for any one who can watch it.",1
108," I will give it a nine because nothings perfect! But it is a great movie, people who put 0's and 1's are retarded... sure there are better movies out there, but who's comparing? someone even brought up Scarface as being the better movie... please... that was garbage compared to this. Overall the story and characters were perfect, yeah it's long and has a lot of story to it... but thats what I loved about it. I don't agree w/ the 100 rating on metacritic, because its almost impossible to get a perfect score on here. But it is a great movie! better than the stuff the industry is pushing now.",1
109, The Best Film ever without a doubt. If you haven't watched it you cannot function in popular culture.,1
110, Greatest American epic ever! Quite simply American cinema's finest moment.,1
112," It has to be said that not everyone will agree on a film and critics do tend to overrate films like this. I have to say though this film is something else.... Im only 17, not part of the baby boomer generation and this film was just something else. It's not perfect but it's definately one orf the greatest films ever made, and the tension and shocks in some of the scenes are incredible. Last point; anyone who considers the characters unlikeable, did you skip scenes? Al Pacino's slow descent into a life that he doesn't wants, Marlon Brando's performance as a mob leader who uses logic and politics rather than murder, plus his last scene with his grandson... wow.",1
113, I finally got to see this movie yesterday and it was great. Even after all the cliches it caused.,1
114," THE most overrated movie ever! Ya it has a nice story,and a nice set of actors. But it's way to long. Some of you are saying that if others dont agree this is the greatest movie ever there a moron? Lol. This movie is not all that. Scarface is better. More action,a good story,long,but not to long. The only reason people are saying this is the greatest ever,is because there trying to follow the crowd.",1
115," Superb movie. Not bored for even a second. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan as also Robert Duvall all were superb. immortal classic.",1
116," While perhaps not the greatest movie of all time, despite it's rank as such among many, it is in the top 5. Marlon Brando plays the almost sympathetic character very well. My biggest qualm is I just felt the turn of Al Pacino was a little quick to happen. It seems to me he went from nice kid to sociopath, way more unhinged than his dad, almost overnight. Still an incredible movie and cinematic experience.",1
117, Brilliant.,1
118," The greatest and most influential mob movie ever. Even after 36 years, nothing, bar its sequel and Scorsese's 'Goodfellas', have come close to matching its absolute perfection.",1
119," What's there to say? A perfect movie that I was accustomed to watching on VHS or cable, both of which had the color washed out. The DVD release has the color beautifully restored; the color, alone, allows you to rediscover The Godfather again. The special features are fantastic. Coppola walks you through the movie, slowly and expertly. The deleted scenes are wonderfully shot. What's not to love?",1
120, This has to be among the greatest movies ever made. I don't think any of the sequels even come close although I hear many prefer part II. Every scene is memorable.,1
121, Really one of the greatest films of all time I don't need to add more,1
122," I think the grammar inaccuracies, lack of spelling prowess, and vapid intellectual acumen of those who gave this film a bad rating prove just how good it is, simply the best film ever made. I admit ""Return of the King"" is a close second, but.",1
123," The greatest movie ever made. The only blockbuster ever produced for thinking adults. All the performances are outstanding and the direction is peerless. Manages to turn a good summer novel into a dark, brooding masterpiece.",1
124, While it is long i would consider it a classic. while it is brutal and violent and almost sadistic it has a well written story and amazing acting amplify a timeless crime drama,1
125, I have always loved all the Godfather movies.,1
126, Certainly overrated but a fine film nonetheless.,1
127," It is an excellent movie, but there are point in it where the acting could have used an extra oomph, like the scene where al pacino and his would be wife are walking down the sidewalk in the park, iwasn't impressed with the lack of intensity nor the lack of emotion from the actress. also, if you do the math, the score for this movie should be a 99 since 1380(the total) divided by 14 (the amount of reviews) is 98.57 a.k.a. a 99. I'd like a recount here!",1
128," BEST MOVIE EVER!! It had its flaws (too much diaglouge) I can see this movie over and over again. Plus I'm part Sicillian! Marlon Brando stole the first one though, excellent performance and Al Pacino wasn't bad himself. If you havent seen it, buy it. A must-have for your movie collection!",1
130," I ruge anyone who doesn't like this or found it lacluster to watch it again. I didn't much care for it the first time, that's because I didn't understand the plot or characters, so I could't be emotionally involved, regardless of how great the directing, acting and cinemetography was. The more you watch it, the more you uncover, and the more you can appreciate it.",1
131," A masterpiece that is in my opinion the best movie ever made. It is a violent movie but shows the bruatlity of the mob and how violent and vicious some of them were. It is a beautiful and tragic movie that shows how a son who originally would have hated to be in the family buisness came to the family buisness. We should be all thanking Mario Puzo for the amazing story that generated thousands screaming when the horse was in the the bed and Francis Ford Coppola who in great detail showed the personalities of the characters in such great shape. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall have great strength as actors and each has a different trait that is either hard or soft. The Movie will remain one of the best ever made forever and if you can top this then you have to be pretty damn good.",1
132," There's no question this film will be considered a classic a century from now. One can only hope that an actor is born that will surpass Marlon Brando as the Godfather, or that a film that equally captures the American spirit will be made over the next 100 years.",1
133, The most perfect American film ever made.,1
134, All three films taken as a whole proves to be the greatest achievement in cinema history.,1
135, 11 out of 10,1
136, This is the best movie i have ever seen in my life. People knew that back in the 70's and still today it is unmatched in quality and realism. The length of the movie was perfectly acceptable otherwise we would never get the whole story. Anyone (and i mean anyone) who gives this movie lower than 5 should be watching bio-dome and should be banned from any movie rating sites.,1
137," My absolute FAVORITE movie ever. Anyone with even a little bit of patience and an IQ over room temperature will recognize that this is an absolutely incredible movie. I honestly cannot think of any flaws, even minor ones.",1
138," Puzo, he forged an epic tragedy about America, capitalism, family, greed, treachery and love. He showed us ",1
139," One of the greatest of the best films of all time, a true masterpiece.",1
140," Ryan J, if Godfather is a ""0,"" how would you rate Bio-Dome? I bet you're real proud of yourself giving the highest rated movie on Metacritic a zero rating.",1
141, I first saw this movie when I was 18 a few years ago in 2003 and I loved it. This is a movie that will never get old. Everything in this movie is at its best. From the acting and music to the story it's self. This gangster story is the best of the best and is also one of the all time greatest movies.,1
142, A great set of movies.The new blu-ray version's are worth picking up.,1
143," What a movie, what a cast. I love this flick so much, it blows me away every time I watch it. James Caan at the toll booth is one hell of a scene. Best movie ever made anywhere. It even pips Kubricks 2001, no mean feat.",1
144," I like the film, but I still think it's overrated. In my opinion it's a great gangster movie with excelent actors and a cool story. However I don't think that this is the best movie ever as some parts of it are simply too long. I like it but it doesn't blow my mind.",1
145, It,1
146, I saw this movie when it first came out and it's been my favorite movie of all time. The key to the story line is how the family loves each other even though the business they are in is violent. The story line is the best part. No other movie has come close to having all that this one has to offer.,1
147," Goodness gracious me, it is not the best movie ever made. Sure, it's on the top 10 list, but not the number 1 greatest, at least for me. The Godfather was a brilliant and outstanding setup for Part II, and for that It was good. There really was no big storyline to it though. Part II there were many thing happening. But The Godfather just had Marlon Brando walkin' around saying random things with his, somewhat annoying, but kick ass voice. It was just family problems. Oh no Michael was sent to prison, Johnny was murdered, and Michael took over the family business. In a nutshell, that's all it really was. But it sure was a good movie. A beautiful, amazing setup for Part II. It's worth watching, but you have to be In the mood, and when you are, you'll find the picture breathtaking. Sometime you wonder if they even made it in '72, thinking they did it sometime in the '90s. But the film was very well done.",1
148, By far the best movie of all-time and every other film in the genre tries to live up to the standard of this movie... they all fall short.,1
149, Plague on the houses of those who claims The Godfather is NOT the best movie of all time!,1
150, Greatest movie ever. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were excellent.,1
151, I am an aspiring Director and my works are all fresh until one day I watched this Film and after that I needed to clearly define my approach to the Films to stop imitating 'The Godfather'. This Film has set huge standards in film making. A very Influential Movie on all dimensions.,1
152," This movie is a classic and the greatest movie of all time in my opinion. Coppola creates not only some of the greatest moments in film history, but also creates characters that have amazing depth only surpassed by literary works. Despite being long, not a single piece of dialogue is wasted. It is a masterpiece of art, not just film. To the negative reviews....just rate it on it's merits, not some feeling it's overrated. As to the Metascore, read their rating system. They weight specific reviews and then normalize. With their system it's gets a 100. This is one of the few films ever made that deserve such a rating.",1
153," Although not my favorite movie of all time, I acknowledge it as being, perhaps, the best movie of all time. The acting is spectacular, Marlon Brando giving an excellent performance and Al Pacino (before he becomes the boss) is outstanding as well. At around 175 minutes, it is a very long movie and at some points does drag on a little unnecessarily, but these moments are very rare and all of this comes together to form probably the best movie of all time.",1
154," I think it is a good learning experience reading user comments for movies. It shows that there will never be a unanimous consensus on greatness. Some will always disagree. However most of those who disliked the movie are clearly very young. If you say a movie like Donnie Brasco or untouchable or Scarface is better you fail to realize that these movies owe there inspiration to the Godfather. Sooo many movie makers were influenced byu the Godfather that if you see the movie too late in your movie watching life maybe you just can't get it. I saw the movie growing up and have watched it many many times and am still mesmerized by its greatness. believe me I was watching it long before it was apparently ""trendy' to like it. Me and my high school buddies would have Godfather movie nights well over 20 years ago and loved them with no preconceived notions other than we loved them. As a teenager I liked Scarface, it was amusing, but even then i knew it is no where near the movie that Godfather is. I guess I am just fascinated by the diversity of human opinions. Rarely will everyone agree when it comes to personal taste. However if you can't see the effort, thought and artistic care put into the Godfather I suppose it is one's loss. Thankfully there are endless movies out there to be enjoyed.",1
155," The greatest movie of ALL time, hands down! those who dislike, know nothing about cinema.",1
156," The greatest movie I have ever seen. Strong realistic character development, complex plot, analytical evaluation of human nature, twists, classical depiction of mafia characteristics with great casting (including one of the greatest performance in world history by Marlon Brando and career making performance by Al Pacino) and directed by one of the greatest visionary director Francis Ford Coppola makes this film not only the greatest gangster movie of all time but also the greatest movie of all time. Reading the comments of other users I have found that some people rated it very poorly (even some gave the movie 0). They think giving the movie 10 rating makes it overrated. But for them I want to say that either they haven't understood the movie or haven't actually watched the movie. Considering public rights it can be said that anyone can give any rating in their accordance but giving this movie 0 rating is a social insult in my opinion. Many people think Scarface and Goodfellas are better than this film. But I strongly believe that Scarface has neither strong character development nor any good story. Yes it has some cheesy lines and some eye-candy violence which makes it a ""notable"" gangster (also a reason is that it is based on a true character) film but definitely not a ""great"" film. And yes Goodfellas is a great film the characters of the film are all villainous in nature. They don't appeal the sympathy of mass. Along with it neither have the classical approach as The Godfather has nor had any complicated story which the viewer will go on thinking long after the movie as The Godfather. So I think rating this movie 10 is just.",1
157, Really good.,1
158," One word for this movie, Unbelievable, deserves the 100.",1
159, Beautifully haunting. perfection on screen.,1
160," The single finest achievement in American film making. Perhaps, Ryan N. should have a nap.",1
161, A very dramatic film. All I have to say is that I loved it! A succesful movie.,1
162," Unlike a certain comment made by one of tv's favorite charecters. The Godfather is a masterpiece!! This is one of those movies that eventhough you own a copy wether it be on VHS or DVD . As soon as you find a tv station showing it during your usual channel surfing, you can't help but to watch to the point where you are even putting up with commercials. You have it on your shelf but yet you dont want to get up to pop in in your player.. when the commercials come up you use that time to go to the bath room instead of reaching for your copy. That is in my opinion the essence of a great film. Great acting. great writing. The film stand out as the best in american cinema. After Citizen kane of course.",1
163," Ultimatest movie ever, if you don't think so your a moron.",1
164," Any ratings of below 8 are ridiculous(i.e little kids giving it a 0/10. Morons). This movie is an instant classic, with a riveting storyline and plenty of action. If you don't like the atmosphere of the movie like many of the reviews I have read here, please go and watch Grease. Or just go away.",1
165," It's disappointing that some kids want to be rebellious and give it a 0, because as the last reviewer said, nothing's perfect, so nothing is so bad its 0. I do not believe this is the best movie I've seen, i enjoyed goodfellas more along with a few others (Saw, Old School), but this is the classic and will always live on. So if you're in a rebellious mood, please do not review, it's a waste of time for you and any person who reads it.",1
166, Truly a dark masterpiece with so many famous scenes and lines it passed directly into screen legend status. Created a genre of movies.,1
167," Not what every critic hypes it up to be, but it's still well done as far as acting and writing. By the way, in response to a random comment by Mike C., ""global warming"" and fox news have nothing to do with movies...and global warming's been proven to be fake by many scientists, they just can't go too public with it or people like you threaten to kill them (not making that up, it's actually happened to a guy).",1
168," I've only ever seen bits of it and its ok but i read a comment from James K who said ""Did not care for it. It insists upon itself"" and had to say is that not from family guy when they are in a panic room like setting and peter says that about the godfather?",1
169," Someone please kill ryan j... You deserve to be stabbed repeatedly in the eyeball with a rusty soldering iron. The godfather is the classic perfect movie, period. It stands with the best movies such as pulp fiction, goodfellas, ect. So ryan, think b4 you give a movie a 0 u stupid retard.",1
170, One of the best films ever made. You dont need to like the genre to acknowledge its one of the best.,1
171," It's a very good movie.It is perfect the acting of Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan etc. I love this movie, but I don't now why it's one of the better movies of all time. I recommend it.",1
172," Brilliant film, perfectly juggling the strong racial themes of the italian mafia, with the deep meaningful knowledge they are just men playing a deadly game.",1
173, The best gangland movie ever made.,1
174," A despite of the boring beginning, the plot gains more and more emotion while the story is being told. At the end, you look back, and realize this was one of the best movies ever.",1
175, Possibly the best movie ever made.,1
176, this is a great movie. Most people who do not realize this are simply unable to grasp the complex themes and ideas it conveys. While the are entitled to their own opinions I feel that they should just stop wasting their time bashing a masterpiece and go watch some Micheal Bay movie and call it the s**t.,1
177, One of the best movies ever made and anyone who says other wise was most likely born after 1995.,1
178," First time I have seen it, I wasn't impressed at all, not paying much attention. Years later, although I have just learned english in highschol, I have watched the trilogy online, also looking at the script, then I have read it (every fan should, a lot more in depth) and also all the other novels by Mario Puzo I could find online. It changed my life and I have to continue watching them once in a while to bring the feelings back.",1
179, What the hell is wrong with kids these days! The Godfather is the daddy of all movies. The Godfather is hands down to greatest movie ever seen on a TV anywhere in the world ever. That was misspelled horribly I am sorry. But The Godfather is amazing so up yours kids!,1
180," People who rate this less than a 9 clearly haven't the first idea about filmmaking, and probably think Micheal bay is the worlds greatest director , go watch transformers and for all you who says its shit (the godfather) not everybody can just switch there brain off and watch a movie that has only 1 purpose and that's line already rich studio dickheads pockets with more money, the likes of saw transformers all that eye candy retard shit has nothing to do with the art and craft of filmaking ,nothing to do with an artists vision but instead its just a cash cow ,if you don't like the likes of transformers and that shit than your a slave,art is about an artists vision,an what he or she wants to show you and wants to say,not what they think you wanna c,u idiots probably think prison break and 24 are better than the wire and the sopranos.",1
181," I have to agree that this is the finest piece of cinema ever made. Fantastic acting performances, an enthralling, deep story, and all the atmosphere of a childhood Christmas. In my opinion, anyone who gives this less than a 9 either didn't understand the movie, never saw it or is just being too elitist to recognise greatness. I for one still get chills when the theme music fades in as I load up the DVD yet again. A show-case in how to make a classic. It saddens me that great art such as this is called ""borin lol"". Epitomises the word ""epic"". Nothing, bar its successor comes even moderately close.",1
182," Wow. The best movie I have ever seen. Period. If you have seen this movie you shouldn't be allowed to rate others, because it will influence your rating so much. Watch it.",1
183," Brilliant performances by Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. This is one of the greatest films of all time.",1
184, Possibly the best movie Ive ever seen. Excellent!,1
185," THe Godfather is a brilliant piece of work and those who see it as dull and boring have no taste for Drama. If entertainment means bullets flying at every second, than The Gadfather was not the choice for you.",1
186, An incredible piece of work easily one of the best movies ever made if you put this up against modern movies like American gangster or the new star wars series this will wipe the floor with them.,1
187," Bob N is an idiot. This movie is great! And by saying that I don't mean ""great"" as in ""good movie"" I mean ""great"" as in ""a movie revolutisionizing every aspect of the gangster genre"" A lot of people thinks it's too long, (Too much movie to handle) but with a little patience and a mature mind you are sure to find this movie exciting and unlike anything else! Fantastic!",1
188, The critics and the people agree: Best Movie Ever.,1
189," The Godfather shows what goes on in the minds and realities of underworld men. It shows their good side, and it shows their ugly side. Al Pacino plays his character flawlessly. The movie is a masterpiece in drama and respect, and it is my favorite Al Pacino movie.",1
190, The acting was so incredible in this movie it wouldn't matter what the plot or story was.,1
191," First of all, i want to start by saying that i didn't like it the first time i saw it, really. I was confused and even a bit pissed, i was like ""so this is the one of the greatest movie ever?!"", and that's exactly the problem this movie (among others) can have; it's reputaion. I remember i had high anticipation and was very excited and eager when i started wathcing, and that distracted me and totally ruined the experience... Then later, i accidently found it starting on TV. As i didn't like it before i didn't plan to watch, but actually a few minutes later i was INTO IT till it ended (""Don Corleone"" then the door shuts, i LOVE that moment that i have to mention it. That doesn't count as a spoiler, right?), i wanted to say something like whoa! but i was speechless. So what was different this time? well, i was relaxed with a clear mind, no anticipation, no distraction, i was just enjoying a movie, and what a movie it is. I've seen it many times since, and a good way to seperate the ""really great"" movies from the ""just ok"" is how they stand repeated viewings, i've found that many movies i liked lose their appeal or even make me wonder ""i liked that BS?!"", but the truly great movies get better, and The Godfather is one of these. So, for all the those who are confused about it or don't know why it's praised, i understand where you're coming froml, you may want to be a little more open minded and see it again. Or maybe wait till you get a little older, watch more movies and know more about filmmaking if you're too young (i was 16 when i first saw it, i'm now 20 and i view movies very differntly now). Now, there's no point in talking about the movie itself, you can find thousands of reviews all over the web and i won't add anything new when i say how perfect it is. I just wanted to tell my experience maybe someone find it useful. By the way, about the whole ""best/greatest film ever"", i don't think there's such one, but giving it a 0 without giving valid reasons or arguments is just a sign of immature behavior. Another thing, i'm not surprised with people who say Scarface is superior, i know how many hardcore gangstas, wiggers, badasses and 'tough' teens surf the net. Scarface is entertaining and i like it, but it has too many flaws form a very simple story to thin characters to over the top botched action scenes. It is probably remembered for the memorable lines. Tony Montana is a VERY FLAT character compared to Michael Corleone, and Scarface lacks the depth and complexity of The Godfather, maybe that is the point.",1
192," This is truly the greatest movie ever made, a hallmark in American Cinema. Al Pacino's class is unsurpassable. He is the greatest anti-hero actor i have ever seen.",1
193," I love this movie. I don't think it is too long. I think it has subtle layers to define the whole story. If this isn't the best movie ever, it is in a short list at the top.",1
194," There will be never a mob movies so well made. This show us how the Mafia is organized with an amazing attention to detail. They really turned it into something that is human. It is not like other mob movies, from the latest years, that is just a bunch of killing scenes without any sense. And Marlon Brando acting is the best I ever had the opportunity to see. He is a man that is cold when needed but that show his emotions when talking about family. He shows us that even a mobster isn't much different from the common people. I think that, above everything, this movie is about family, although being an mob family.",1
195,this is a great film . its basically the story of the old generation of the mob being taking over by the new younger generation. great performances are done by all . the story telling is pretty well done all be it there are some slow downs where things seem they drag on abit to long and gets alittle dull. for the most part though its a entertaining story that will be wached for years to come .,1
196,"The Godfather is, what I think, a vastly overrated movie. However it does have its strength, and upon a second viewing I was able to enjoy it. But it's its sequel that's the true masterpiece.",1
197,"The Godfather is the first in a trilogy of gangster movies. This movie practically made gangster movies popular. The Godfather is a great, artistic, famous gangster movie.",1
198,Oh! I was there was a rating scale of more than 10 on Metacritic!The Godfather/Il Padrino...Best Movie Ever Made...No wonder it's on top!101 from my side if I was to score like a  critic instead a user!!!!!,1
199,"The best movie ever! Perfect everything perfect charachters, story, and score! Its amazing and fun to watch! The charachter developmnt is great and so is everything else!!! The best movie ever!!",1
200,"The script by Coppola and the novel's author, Mario Puzo, opens at the wedding of the Godfather's daughter. This richly textured montage immediately sets the tone for the entire story. The Corleone family represents the ideal American family -- loyal and loving. All families have flaws, and theirs has to do with the family business. Everyone in the family, except the young college kid and war hero Michael (Al Pacino), is involved in the family's illegal business. Murder being the price of entry in their trade, the Corleone clan has long since been desensitized to violence by the requirements of their jobs. Only Michael appears untouched by the evil around him. Michael tells a frightening family story to his future wife, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), but distances himself from it. ""That's my family, Kay,"" he assures her. ""It's not me."" Anna Hill Johnstone's costumes for Michael almost always include preppie ties to reinforce his putative innocence.",1
201,The Godfather turned out to be my favorite movie of all time. Before this movie I didn't like long 2:30 plus movies but after I watched it I had a whole new view of films. This is a near perfect movie for real.,1
202,"I think anyone that says anything bad about The Godfather is saying it for the sake of being different from everyone else. It's a great movie, it has a great storyline and it's characters are universally regarded as some of the best in cinematic history. The actors in it, especially Pacino and Brando, are amazing in their roles as Michael and Vito but they're not the only stars of the show as Cazale and Caan shine as Fredo and Sonny.",1
203,There is a reason why its considered one of the greatest films of all time. The Godfather is as near perfect as perfect can be and its great from start to finish.,1
204,"A piece of cinema that will live on until the world is burnt up by the sun, if it will be for the fantastic story, rich characters, great performances, gritty mafia realism or just the fact that it is a catchphrase goldmine. One thing is sure, this will live on in history as one of the best cinema pieces ever.",1
205,"Great movie, go watch it. I'm tired of the bickering classics like this get today that apparently don't ""stand the test of time"". what is this test of time? is it color, better sound quality, special effects? Hopefully people  will realize one day that these things add to a movie. A beautiful story like this is still great today and unlike special effect junkie movies such as G.I Joe, Transformers, ext... this movie will still be great in another 30 years from now.",1
206,The most underated movie ever. It deserves well beyond 100 out of 100. All of the people that gave it bellow 80 are either mentally disabled or can't tell the difference between a good and bad movie.,1
207,"Some people wonder why this film is considered a classic. If you seriously can't get that from the moment Nino Rota's unbelievable main theme starts playing and from one look at Marlon Brandon's face half obscured by shadow then you obviously never will understand what ""classic"" really means.",1
208,"Wonderful film, wonderful direction, marvelous cast, record-breaking performance from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. Great Direction of Francis Ford Coppola, loved the opening scene, and the five-heads-of-mafia-families' round-table meeting.",1
209,"phenomenal. obviously one of the best movies ever made. great acting, great music, great screenplay, great directing. i cant express my excitement with just words",1
210,"This is probably the greatest movie of all time,  it involves the pillars of storytelling.  Love, Family, Conspiracy,Triumph!!!  All of these elements are weaved flawlessly through the telling of the Corleone Family.  There is no better movie out there that can compare because most NOT all cannot combine these elements because the story is to shallow.  This movie is why I love to watch movies of all genres, it is the measuring stick to all films.",1
211,"In my opinion the best movie of all times. Everyone who wants to learn cinema should watch it at least once a year (so I try). Some films are ""must seen"" but this one is THE must seen.To MikeC. well, I am sure global warming is fake, but still give it a 10... and never watch Fox News.... anyways it is true that if someone votes this film with 0... well maybe he shouldn't be considered human....",1
212,"This movie takes more than 1 viewings to really love it. When I first watched it I felt for the characters, but by the end I was like ""That's it? Where's the big payoff?"" Then I watched it 2 more times and found the genius of this movie. This is a required viewing for anyone.",1
213,I will list every way in which The Godfather is not perfect: the lighting in the car that takes Michael to the big meeting with Sollozzo is a slightly too red and artificial looking.  The movie is perfect in every other way.,1
214,"its certainly the greatest movie of all time. the character building,showing aspects of human nature, an emotionally satisfying story as well as providing entertainment for a 3 hour movie is phenomenal. It showcases the brilliance of Francis Ford Coppola in his early years of film making which sets the mood for the entirety of the film.",1
215,Between the people saying this movie sucked and the ones saying it was amazing I must inform you all this movie was both good and great. It was good in how amusing it was and how it made you feel watching it. It was great in how it changed films forever and how it was amazingly groundbreaking. The Godfather is widely regarded as the greatest movie of all time... but it IS not however regarded as the best movie.,1
216,"Boring? Really? I'm twelve and I watched the whole thing in one sitting, not to mention it's my favorite movie. So, seriously, go watch some of Al Pacino's latest films if you don't like this. You'll probably love ""Jack and Jill"".",1
217,"Qu'il est bon de voir et revoir ce chef-d'oeuvre qu'est incontestablement Le Parrain! Ce film qui surpasse tout long-mÃ©trage racontant des histoires mafieuses (Scarface, Donnie Brasco, Les Affranchis...) qui ont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©s jusqu'Ã  ce jour. Il est sÃ»r que le rythme de ce Parrain est plutÃ´t lent (sans compter sa durÃ©e de 2h58), mais c'est justement cela qui fait son charme : pendant 3h, on se prÃ©occupe bien plus du destin d'une famille de la mafia plutÃ´t que de ses agissements violents et inÃ©gaux. Ainsi, les protagonistes sont travaillÃ©s, Ã©crits et interprÃ©tÃ©s Ã  la perfection! Mais Le Parrain peut Ã©galement compter sur sa bande son et sa mise en scÃ¨ne (jeux de lumiÃ¨re, photographie, dÃ©cors, costumes, maquillages...) qui le rendent authentique et envoÃ»tant de bout en bout. Un vÃ©ritable pilier du cinÃ©ma!",1
218,"this is a brilliant classic mob movie, that everyone should have definitely watched before they die. most people will love this movie. a well deserved 10 out of 10.",1
219,"The greatest gane if all time nothing can compare to this movies greatness. Creating the perfect anti-hero, The Godfather is a movie like no other.",1
220,What a movie! Francis Ford Coppola's epic thriller â,1
221,"""The Godfather"" is one of the few cinema classics that deserves every bit of the word it's always labeled with, masterpiece. One of the greatest films ever made, only to be surpassed later by its sequel.",1
222,"Pacino?, Brando?, Duvall? What else can you ask for. An absolute classic, arguably the best film to hit the screen in the last few decades.. if i had a list of 100 best films it would be 2nd. just behind The Godfather II which i would say is just slightly better with De Niro's portrayal as the young Vito Corleone.",1
223,A terrific movie showing the life of olden time mobsters and what they encountered. But I warn you don't watch it if you are under the age of 10. A great film i love it I really think it might be the best movie I've ever seen and I think every human being (above the age of 10) should watch it.,1
224,"To simply put it, The Godfather is an film that is honed to prefection. It is so good that I no longer have words to describe how amazing the film is. Pure greatness. The Godfather gets just about everything right in this compelling masterpiece that will be forever remembered and emulated, the godfather of modern films. I can see why this film is so big, so revolutionary, so influential. No other film stands a chance against this monster of a film. The acting is top-notch and the plot, the plot is amazing with a crime-epic tale that will always be remembered, immortalized forever. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give stellar performances in their greatest movie ever. The amount of emotion in The Godfather is amazing too as the you clearly feel each character's emotion and are drawn into it. The moments staying forever in your mind because it is so amazing. The Godfather reinvents the way I look at movies, my view of them has changed forever as I see how masterful this film is. It crushes every other film, no other film will ever come close to knocking The Godfather off its pedestal of greatness. Flaws, this sounds mundane but I cannot say it any other way, there are like ZERO flaws in the film. I scrutinized but could not find any at all. The good aspects deeply mask the film's bad aspects so a perfect movie has been created in a sense, that is amazing. I have not given a movie a perfect 10 out of 10, I have not seen a movie worthy of the all-time high but that changes with The Godfather and it is well deserved. Overall, The Godfather is a flat-out amazing film that will always be beast and smoke every other movie out there, this film will be a film that everyone will mention when asked ""what do you think are the greatest movies of all time?"". The Godfather is pure perfection of films honed to the highest aspects. This is not a great movie, this is a revolutionary film, I love it. Breakdown for ""The Godfather"": Presentation: 10, Plot: 10, Acting: 10, Script: 10, Lasting Appeal: 10, Verdict: 10 out of 10, ""Masterpiece"", the best movie I have ever seen.",1
225,"The Godfather is one of the greatest films of all time, no doubt. It is fueled by one of the greatest acting casts of all time, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. If you don't like it because of it's violence, please be selfless and don't rate it. The Godfather is a story about the mafia and it's corruption on society.",1
226,"This movie is easily one of the greatest ,if not the greatest, movies of all time. From start to finish, The Godfather is as perfect as perfect can get.",1
227,"Listen up naysayers. Yeah. It does deserve a perfect score. Family. This film gives new definition to the word. The love that the Corleones have for each other in this film is so strong, yet it is also complicated. With a family business that is built upon a foundation of violence, the Corleones are destined for tragedy. Starring Marlon Brando as the Don, and Al Pacino as his son, Michael, this film is the unquestionable magnum opus of Francis Ford Coppola. This is the premier mafia motion picture.",1
228,"Whenever I asked if this was a good film or not, I either heard it was extremely good or ""I haven't seen it but yeah, it's good'. And when I finally found the time to sit through it, I couldn't believe what I had been missing. This is the greatest crime film I've have ever seen. Everything from the directing and acting to the soundtrack and, even thought its over two hours, the pacing.",1
229,"This movie is fantastic, but it is old. I say that because I mean to say that it is of a style that's not so popular any more in Hollywood movies, where tone and feel take priority over raw action. So if you need action on a drip feed to avoid falling asleep then this movie isn't for your situation. It's a methodical story, over a long time period, and even is a little fuzzy on how much time is passing at a few points. I don't think it takes away from the arc of the film. I do understand if a person isn't always ready to watch a slower film though, so my advice if you can't stand the opening section is to turn it off and try watching it another time. This is a quality film, but the modern audience has been trained away from this style quite a bit, so wait for the moment to strike you instead of forcing it.",1
230,it gave me wood...................,1
231,The Godfather is the reason that we watch movies to this vey day. It really defined a film as not just entertainment but an art form. One that is to be respected and admired and everything about this film is incredible. Especially Brando's performance as Vito Corleone. Pure art.,1
232,"no one is arguing this is a bad movie you would have to be an idiot to argue that but one can defiantly argue it is an overrated movie. A wonderful movie probably in the top 20 movies of all time but to be honest i liked part II better even thought it was longer it was more interesting. there are many scenes in this movie that it wcould have done without and the whole love interest in Sicily  was just unnecessary, uninteresting,and unrealistic.",1
233,"This movie surprise me on its level of greatness, i'm 17 years old and I never did watch any classics movies before but when I watch Godfather, I was like ""what an epic movie this is"", its surprisingly awesome movie for 1972 and even better than most movies release today in the 21st century. Godfather is like the God of gangsters movie.",1
234,"This film is a masterpiece. Has great plot, fabulous actors and magnificent story. I liked it a lot. The film on the restaurant is really good. I liked it in general but i think it's over-rated too. Though it's a good film and a must-see",1
235,"The Godfather is a very good movie. If there were not many dialogues in this film I would have rated it with 9. It's not for 10 I think. And, it's 3 hours. You can see that it's getting boring in some parts of the film. The best movie of the trilogy was the second.",1
236,"This is the greatest movie ever made.  Marlon Brando gives the performance of a lifetime, again.  Each supporting actor gives a stellar performance.  It is superbly paced, and the running time doesn't fell long at all.  If you have not seen this movie, go now and watch it.",1
237,"Realmente una maravilla a todo nivel, más que una adaptación de una novela, es una creación cinematográfica en sí misma, dada la participación de Mario Puzo. Merecida toda la gloria que tiene. La música se lleva buena parte del mérito, dada la mística y magia que le aporta.",1
238,"The movie doesn't start out great, mainly just character introductions telling us about what type of people they are and their relations with the mafia. After that though the plot kicks in, and it really gets going, the violence is menacing, the story is engaging, and Al Pacino's character development is wonderful. Basically if you're willing to get passed the first thirty minutes or so, it's a great watch.",1
239,"(100/100)Best Crime/Mafia movie there is. Best movie there is even. The Godfather will be remembered as the movie you need to watch if you want to be a director, cinematographer or scriptwriter. This movie is something truly amazing.",1
241,"A Masterpiece film with Great actor marlon brando acting and al pacino , i see this film just like real life with no camera",1
242,"Just needto start the movie, and then you will be gone with cartels. Just start the movi. ",1
243," One of the best of the 1970's after Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, McCabe & Mrs. Miller.",1
244," This is literally the perfect film, there is no other way someone logical can put it.",1
245,"This is the definition of a masterpiece in cinema. If ill concieved by any one person then that person is actually ill to the point of ""dead man walking"". The best actor of all time (Marlo Brando), gives the best performance in movie history here as Don Corleone. Stick Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino to a project of such magnitude together and you have yourself a film! PERFECTION!!",1
246,"The movie started off with Marlyn listening calmly to the person explaining him every excruciating detail of the tragedy his life had to suffer, the scene won the place in ma mind with that very cool and calm scene with no other movie starting off that way it had a special beginning, next came  Al Pacino the way he explained how he would end both the commissioner and the drug lord to James Caan was thrilling than ever! However the best part of the movie was wen Pacino shoots them and calmly walks out out the restaurant. The detailing of the part, the scene, the role was LEGENDARY!!!!! Marlyn played his role to his best and it was no less than STEAK SAUCE!!! None the less Diane Keaton was heartbreakingly awesome with her role in the movie no one else could have done that better. Over all the movie was awesome with a full rating of 9.0 znd a MUST WATCH tag. Im looking forward to be a movie critic hope you all would help me :)thank you.",1
247,"I must say, this is one of the best films of all time. There is nothing wrong with it. The plot is fantastic, the characters are very flowing. Al Pacino's performance is outstanding, there's nothing I can say to him. One of the best masterpieces of Francis Ford Coppola.....",1
248,There arenâ,1
249,"I dare Hollywood not to remake one of the most important movies that still can be talked for a generation. The Godfather, the Citizen Kane of Gangster movies, and of course, the J.R. Ewing of American cinema.",1
250,"This has to be amongst the best films ever made, sublime in every way. Magnificent.",1
251,"Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a lifelong passion and love for film. A combination of writing, acting, cinematography and a thoroughly engrossing plot have undoubtedly created one of the greatest pieces of cinema, point blank. A mixture of drama, thrill, crime and even comic value have been masterfully scripted into a film so full of suspense and charm that it undeniably crosses the mind of ever film fanatic or casual movie lover out there.Each and every scene of the film is carefully filmed to create a whole different world for the viewer to get involved in, these scenes are intense, personal, but most importantly, completely focused on who is onscreen, each character has their moment, and they each make their mark on this legendary film. Perhaps the man who left the biggest mark was Marlon Brando, who plays the titular character, an underworld crime family boss who we are introduced to as an over the shoulder view, he scratches his face with the back of his fingers, he rolls his eyes, strokes his cat and talks in a muffled tone, all through the brilliance of Brando, who used cotton wool to perfect the speech, and rolled with a cat running on set, something not scripted, but perfect for the character Brando created, the everlasting memory of Vito Corleone, a man that when he opens his mouth, a respectable silence falls upon the film, acting at its best. We are at his daughters wedding as the film opens, from this there is a message set for the film, family,  a man who doesn't spend time wit his family can never be a man"" says Vito, one of the many quotes which made the film so memorable, but it also shows the true heart of the film, each of the sons this man has fathered look out for each other and all take part in the family 'business'.This business is told as a memorable reflection from Michael, played in perfectly calm but conflicted fashion by Al Pacino, who is the family member not quite sure what he wants, not part of the business, but suited for it. We are immediately thrust into the struggles of each crime family as they attempt to get stakes in a new market, something which Vito refuses to be a part of, put also something that almost costs him his life. With this, the eldest and hot-headed son steps forward, Sonny (James Caan) who ignores the wishes of the consigliere Tom (Robert Duvall) and seeks revenge on those who wronged his family.In the midst of all this there is a warming tone of a film, with some truly touching performances and some unforgettable turns as gangsters in 1940s New York. James Caan is well casted as the good-naturedbut short-tempered Sonny, who wants power, but also seems to want whats best for most of his family. But its Al Pacino and Marlon Brando who excel the film to remarkable achievements, Brando creates a character that simply couldn't be replicated or remade, and Pacino plays a conflicted but right-minded youngest brother, he gets what he wants and Pacino shows excellence in his eyes and confident speaking.A true journey of emotion, heartache, acceptance and love, the film explores all areas of what it means to be true to oneself, but also to forgive and forget, this is a truly remarkable feat and a masterful film that has given us some of the most memorable characters we have ever known, but also set a standard in the film industry as a force to be reckoned with, even as the years since its release tick on.",1
252,"I'd never seen the Godfather prior to this weekend. A friend of mine asked how I can consider myself a movie reviewer, when I haven't even seen the film that is widely considered to be the best of all-time. He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated.",1
253,"Absolutely brilliant! That is all I can say!  This is in my top 10...this film is perfection! A classic! If you haven't watch it yet, you have to do it! I could expand and say more but I don't really want to...judge yourself!",1
254,"Cold, calculative and distant; The Godfather's deliberate pacing, restrained acting and unemotional cinematography make it much more than a great gangster-crime drama - It's a fascinating study of the human psyche. Perhaps, the only dramatic aspect in this movie, at least in the conventional sense is Nino Rota's haunting score.",1
255,"I'm one of those few people who watched The Godfather very late. Nevertheless, it had an impact on me like it did on many others. I loved and cherished every moment of this film. its beautifully written, directed and acted. It's one of those few All-Rounded Movies, thus it comes as no surprise that its beloved by many.",1
256,"When it comes to The Godfather, there is no matching it. No mafioso gangster film will ever be able to surpass it. It's devastating action and complex family moments are intricately designed. A classic and an unparalleled ensemble.",1
257,That's a movie to always remember. It becomes alive every time you watch it. The story is a diamond necklace. And with the finest actors it becomes the finest movie of all time. I really feel ashamed not to give it a 10. It's the greatest in my opinion.,1
258,"I have had this movie for many months but i never got time to watch it.Yesterday i did and i think ,like everybody say ,it is one of the best movies made ever.Al Pacino who was not very popular at that time make his breakthrough performance and he is just great in the role of Michael Corleone.About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters.It is based on Mario Puzo's novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too.There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e.When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse.Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo.Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo.Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone.Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll.The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo.I loved the setting and style.James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton & Talia Shire did great jobs too.Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvellous.I have read everything that Coppola dis to make this movie so outstanding.Maybe the best gangster movie ever made.Thanks Paramount,Francis Ford Coppola and every Cast-crew member related for producing this chef-d'oeuvre.",1
259,Absolutely an amazing film. With spectacular acting by a marvelous cast and amazing filming by Coppola. The use of shadows in this film in itself is a visual spectacle. This film shows an amazing glimpse into the life of the early 20th century mafia. A true classic that everyone should watch.,1
260,"How somebody could not give this a 10/10 is beyond me. This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and everybody else were fantastic in their roles and Francis Ford Coppola outdid himself here.",1
261,"Perfect in all the departments 'The Godfather' is a masterpiece by Cappola. Fulfills, in fact sets, a new definition for an all time classic. If you are a true movie lover, you'll adore 'The Godfather'.",1
262,"The critic score says it all. It is either you love this movie, or you didn't understand it.    see this",1
263,"This is a punchy, brutal and gripping tale of family values and business that offers an unrivaled insight into the world of the mafia. All the talk of honour sends a shiver down your spine, at the seriousness  and intimacy of the bond between a man and his godfather. Armed with a great cast, and beautifully written script you cant go wrong with a film like this. A true classic",1
264,I forget The Godfather  is in my list of masterpiece Taxi Driver (1976). Carrie (1976). The Silence of the Lambs (1991) . 12 Angry Men (1957). To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) . Scarface (1983). Seven (1995) .,1

GoodFellas (1990) . Raging Bull (1980) .Casino (1995) there masterpiece movies, what i don't like are the silly remakes why a new carrie movie ? this is the 4th movie carrie the made it's just stupid ,Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are absolutely perfect ,they both got Oscar nominations out of it, for God sake!",1
266,"The best film I have ever seen. May get a fair amount of criticism nowadays but to think that this film was made 40 years ago, that's pretty incredible!",1
267,Excellent movie! The Godfather is the perfection. Excellent plot and everything else. A must-watch masterpiece. That's the only 9 which I gave (games included).,1
268,A ceaselessly compelling and undeniably perfect film with unforgettable iconography and legendary performances everywhere. Classic.,1
269,"One of the best ever, strong at every level whether its from directing to any pinch of make-up it suceeds.",1
270,"The Godfather requires a level of maturity to completely understand the story. It's not for everyone but once you realize it's to your taste you will get pulled in the story and 3 hours will go by unnoticed. Having said that, it's not an action film, it's a drama. So if you disliked it because it didn't excite you, you clearly went to the wrong movie. A masterpiece, deserves it's 10/10 score for producing a brilliant, memorable mob drama!",1
271,"Everybody knows how good The Godfather is meant to be, and while the 100% may not be fully justified it is definitely a work of surpassing excellence. Francis Ford Coppola perfectly chronicles the late life of Don Vito Corleone also known as The Godfather. Simply witnessing all of the hugely famous scenes and impeccably written lines is an enjoyable experience. Yes it goes on for 3 hours but sitting through the whole thing is undeniably worth it. Some scenes are much more gripping than others, basically Marlon Brando's screen time is the best thing about it. However every second is interesting and almost deserves the 100%, I found it to be masterfully acted and with some brilliant direction, but the most impressive aspect of The Godfather is undoubtedly how engaging every second is despite going on for 180 minutes. I would say it's worth watching but it's cult status ensures you were going to anyway.",1
272,"This is the closest thing one can get to achieving perfection. This movie showed that you don't need consistent foul language or gruesome violence to make a movie. While there is some violence in it, this movie was nothing like some other mob movies out there (Scarface comes to mind). This movie presented a shadier side of the American world in a classy, interesting way. I could go on for an hour about why this movie is so perfect but I think it can speak for itself. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I would highly recommend doing so.",1
274,Um filme tão denso que você pode passar anos e anos assistindo e ainda se surpreender com as camadas da história. Muito mais que uma aula de cinema: Uma verdadeira lição de Vida.,1
275,"The Godfather is a masterpiece. With superb storytelling and incredible acting, this film is not only the greatest crime film ever created but possibly the greatest film ever!!!",1
276,"If you ask me: ""what is the best movie of all time?"".  I will say: ""It is NOT The Godfather"". Yes, a lot of people around us say it is the best movie they have ever seen. But most of them literally know that they know and undersand few about this movie and they are repeating what others say!!!",1
277,"The perfect film. There's not a better overall film out there. Not Citizen Kane, not 2001, not Casablanca and not Raging Bull. This film is a work of art and it's sequel is the greatest sequel of all-time(sorry Empire Strikes Back). The Godfather is a masterpiece.",1
278,"Simply the best movie of all time, I know it sounds cliche, sorry to disappoint   but the harsh truth  Movie more closer to perfection  doesn't exist.",1
279,"There are movies that I cannot judge with no bias as to its popularity. This is one of them. Consistently said to be one of the greatest movies of all time, what I found very fascinating about it are Marlon Brando, and the movie's authenticity. I read the book after having watched the movie. So, each and every page I went through, I couldn't help getting Brando's image on my mind over and again. I mean, I am so absorbed in his acting that I started living alongside him for the few days in which I went past the book. And the authenticity, yes, it sure enough has enough to make viewer feel it's been made amid 1950s Newyork. And there were this one-liners  Offer you cant refuse and all. Add to the terrific things, Tom Hagen  yes, I still recall Duvall as Hagen  and Al pacino. Pacino in particular takes acting to a new level. Things only he can do with absolute coldness. It is a well made movie with one of the all time great cast giving out brilliant performances. I also would like to add, I still prefer the part 2 over this one, partly because of the fact that I am floored by De niro and Pacino in it and owing to some personal affection.",1

283,"Review Date: July 24, 2014. Movie Review #1: The Godfather If I ever get a job offer to write Movie Reviews and get paid for it, it is an offer I can't refuse. This movie is often quotable to those that have seen it and it is no surprise that this film affected pop culture to a certain degree. There was a time where it got a lot of dough and was a hit which in turn became the highest grossing motion picture at a time back in the 1970's when The Godfather succeeded in the box office. Times have changed and this film is no longer the highest grossing motion picture but still to this day, it still remains as a remarkable film. Is there anything that has not been said about The Godfather? Probably not, but that is not going to stop me from sharing my thoughts regarding Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. The Godfather is a tale of a New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son which carries a heavy weight. This film often gets praised for its acting and that's no surprise there. Even though The Godfather ended up as a trilogy, Most of the cast may have left a huge impression in the second Godfather film but the first movie still has terrific acting throughout the entire film. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corelone is very likely and arguably his best role in his film career. Even though the late Marlon Brando was a well-respected actor before and since The Godfather, He was not the only reason that The Godfather is a great film. The casting is a rather interesting one since it contains actors that either have been around for a number of years or actors that are quite new but had a couple roles. James Caan plays a hot-tempered Sonny, Robert Duvall has a great voice of reason in playing Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton plays her supporting role quite fittingly as Kay Adams, and Al Pacino's performance really makes Michael Corleone an intriguing character in the film and that carries on in the later films. The entire performance of every cast member feels natural even if there were a number of takes shot in the movie. Some may say that this movie has some of the greatest acting in the history of cinema, but I think that would be a bit of a stretch to make that claim. The entire cast makes all the characters believable and realistic in their portrayal. The Godfather might not be the most realistic portrayal of the Mafia, but it is certainly the most romanticized Mafia movie. However there are some realistic moments which is the brutality that The Godfather portrays, and Khartoum was the first example of this film's brutality. I also don't think that the brutality is a way of glorifying violence in the film, it is first and foremost a cinematic portrait of the Mafia, and it also serves as a thought provoking character study which carries on in the later films. It may be a romanticized portrait of the Mafia, and it may be a bit realistic in its brutal moments, but it doesn't feel out of place. Considering the film is set in the 1940's with the notion that it is a romaticized portrayal of the Mafia, there's a theme of moral ambiguity that allows the viewer to think and question about the character inside the movie, I find it strange that outside of the movie, it is possible that a viewer (and myself if I may add) finds the moral ambiguity fascinating in The Godfather. It carries on in the story that is told in the film. One of the fitting touches is the music by Nino Rota and it's a bit predictable that it has that Italian sound but it is extremely fitting to the film. Like the film itself, Nino Rota's Film score to The Godfather is highly regarded as one of the greatest film scores in cinema, I can say it's hard not to like. It definitely has the Italian feeling and it compliments the movie perfectly. I should add an interesting additional note that Carmine Coppola (the father of Francis Ford Coppola) did compose some of the additional music I find this kind of interesting considering that the Father and Son relationship between Michael and Vito was intriguely written. If that isn't interesting enough, Francis Ford Coppola put his daughter Sofia in the movie too with a cameo appearance as a baby boy. Some members of the family may have been involved in this movie and even the later Godfather films, but family also plays a theme in The Godfather. Another nice element that gives the film its elegance is Gordon Willis' cinematography. The film is shot well, the movie looks like it is in the 1940's. The cars you will see in the movie were cars made in the 1940's and this movie was only made in 1972 so it wasn't too difficult to find vehicles like that. The design is fitting for this film because of its setting. Overall, The entire movie is shot extremely well. Even though this is an adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel of the same name published in 1969. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola did write the screenplay, and regardless if the movie faithfully follows the book from the first page to the last, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo are contempt with the changes that are there from Book to Movie. Even though The Godfather is a considered one of the greatest movies ever made. I was very close in rating this film a 10 out of 10, but I noticed a couple hiccups in the film, even though they are small errors they are not influencing me to change my mind that I find The Godfather to be a terrific film, those who saw the movie at face value can unanimously agree that The Godfather is a great film. My philosophy of ""The 10 rating"" is that it is as great as it is ever going to get. They are not perfect because of a rating like that. There could be some mistakes, and some miniscule flaws that can be found but are excused. Even if that were the case, they don't ruin the movie whatsoever. There really is no such thing as a perfect movie. Francis Ford Coppola pulled the strings with the terrific acting, excellent cinematography, fitting music, believable characters, and an intriguing plot. It is not only one of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces, it is one of the masterpieces in cinema This film gets my Thumbs Up, it's a 5-star film. My overall rating of The Godfather is a 9.9 out of 10, it is an excellent film.",1
284,"I do not believe this is the greatest movie ever made. I do believe it is the greatest drama ever created. The Godfather is beautiful. The characters give believable and moving performances, and the story itself is gripping.

It always hit the right notes, and doesn't miss any of them. It has not only reached its expectations, but also made numerous benchmarks for American cinema.

299,"What can be said? 'The Godfather' is one of the masterpieces of cinema, where every element is perfected and congeals to create something that is a work of art - the score, aesthetics, characterisation, directing, script and acting. It catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to the forefront of the New Hollywood wave, was the breakthrough for such stars as Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton etc. and cemented Marlon Brando's status in the pantheon of cinematic legends, though his work as Vito Corleone here is more supporting than leading. There is dissent over whether this is rightly considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. For me, it is not the greatest movie but is among them and the length is certainly felt - when first watched, 'The Godfather' is a draining experience. But it ages well with repeat viewings. It meets the definition of classic and then some. It is memorable and masterful. If Part II overshadows it, it is only because Part I was so damn great nobody thought it could be topped.",1

310,"The Godfather Reviewby Al Carlson The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.The Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2.This film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.",1
311,An absolute masterpiece. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel is perfectly directed and masterfully acted. A never-aging classic that proves that cinematography can be an art.,1
312,"The best,most quotable,well done,gory, Romantic,amazing you will ever see. I'm just going to wait here until you go and see it.Even if you don't bother with the other two Godfathers,this one is worth seeingSome day I may call upon you. That day may never come,but for now,consider this a gift,on my daughters wedding day.That day has comme, and I nose call upon you to watch this movie",1
313,"One of the greatest crime films ever made. This is what I call golden cinema.

314,The first Godfather was the movie that set and saved the Directors carrier. The cinematography makes amazing use of the cameras at the time. The development of the characters are slow yet very well done. the only thing I have to say is that some of the scenes in Sicily were not needed for the story.,1
315,"El Padrino ya es un clásico del cine. Sin duda una gran película y la mejor de las tres por varias razones:Marlon Brando (que se marca un papelón), Al Pacino, que en mi opinión está mejor que en las dos siguientes por su papel de iniciado en el mundo mafioso, y la trama, creo que tiene un punto interesante que a la 2 le faltó y no digamos ya a la 3.

316,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola.

317,"My favourite film of all time, and the true ''Godfather'' of the gangster film genre. This film has it all; memorable characters and scenes, terrific acting all round (James Caan as Sonny Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael are amongst the best acting performances I've seen) and a wonderful and gripping storyline. And it's all beautifully filmed; the dark and smoky interiors of the Corleone's retreat (complete with Godfather sitting in the corner in his armchair, face shadowed), the family wedding, Michael's exile in Sicilly and of course the tense scenes at the hospital, and the famous restaurant scene, where Michael turns killer for the first time.Totally memorable, and no other film I've seen is quite as perfect, polished or stylish as the Godfather.",1
318,"A very powerful and well done movie! So unpredictable, so suspenseful, so full of offers you cannot refuse. A masterpiece that changed cinema as we know it! There is no way anybody could ever consider this movie boring unless they expect explosions every 10 minutes.",1

This is the moment when the masterpiece talked, even the movie sometimes make me a little bit blowing -that's mean confused- but the movie has never wrong. In turn, it take some capable of beauty, and I say ""the movie was rising, a thousand thumbs up""",1
320,"I assume the negative reviews of this movie are people having a laugh. Its one of the greatest movies ever made, FACT. After reading some of the reviews I just had to write my own, one particular 'review' by, lets call him Brian McInnis, is the most moronic piece of rubbish I have ever read, what an idiot. Anyway its definitely the best gangster film ever made, its actually almost perfect, miles better than anything from Scorsese. Unbelievable cast featuring undoubtedly the greatest actor of all time, Marlon Brando in an unforgetable performance. There has never been another movie like it and there never will.",1

This one is worth of your time.",1
323,"Such a freaking classic. Don Vito Corleone: You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?. the godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is.",1
324,"Arguably the greatest movie ever made.  A cast of relative unknowns (Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall and John Cazale) join with the great Brando, who was in a low point in his career.  Perfectly written and flawlessly directed.  Pacino plays the role of Michael perfectly understated -- so understated that the studio wanted to fire him.  (Apparently, he wasn't yelling like an Italian should.)",1
325,"Like the modern Shakespearean tragedy, the Godfather is very symbolic in storytelling that out bests other great movies before and after. The story about the loss of innocence caused by the life of the mafia and loyalty to the family. Its one of those few films that is still clashing with Citizen Kane as the greatest film ever made. Marlon Brando plays his iconic role well as the Mafia Don Vito Corleone of the Corleone family, a wealthy and powerful family crime syndicate, who falls into despair when his idealistic younger son Michael, in a chilling performance by Al Pacino, decides to turn away from a bright life, when other rival drug lords and fellow gangster organizations declare war against them, and the ending is tragically unbearable as Michael's life of idealism is corrupted by greed, power,and violence as Vito lays dying from the wounds of his assassination attempts. A film so utterly powerful and legendarily well told, its one of those rare films that has a powerful story and well domineering performances that makes it so great, it is the reason why its talked about everywhere. Francis Ford Coppola has made his mark in cinema history bringing Mario Puzo's shocking gangster fictional novel into a monument of pure entertainment. A fine film featuring additional A+ performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and the late John Cazale as Michael's friends who are divided emotionally by innocence and gangster-hood, a important element that makes this a film shadowed with irony and grief. a important masterpiece of life and sin and if thought it couldn't be any more tragic wait till you see part 2",1

328,"It could be argued that Francis Ford Coppola's film of Mario Puzo's bestseller, at once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino). The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you've never seen it, you know the lines (""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""), and some of the scenes (the horse's head). But there's more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche. With a period setting evoked by amber-tinted photography and Nino Rota's elegantly decadent score, The Godfather has dated a lot less than most films of the early 70s. It paces itself deliberately, making its moments of action and horror more telling for the leisurely paths it weaves between them.

Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather."" If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion. Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable. Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son). Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience. We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens.",1

This movie is chock full of stellar performances, beautiful shots, and a compelling family saga.

The settings, along with the score, are near perfection.

This film is absolutely a must-see.",1
348,"Usually i like slow paced films, but at some point a movie should draw interest or emotion. There are almost no story peaks that are exciting, suspensful, emotional or whatever. When people die for example, they get killed suddenly out of nowhere, so even before these moments the movie builds up no suspense. Many scenes are far too long and forgettable, like both the weddings and many more. Even the horsehead had no relevance for anything. The acting is solid but never reaches any remarkable levels. Not one of the characters is truly likeable, what makes it difficult to feel for them. In the end i am also a bit disappointed of the camera work: too many wideshots, too less facial close ups and missing overall aesthetics in look and scenery. I feel bad for rating a classic movie like this so low, but i cant see the brilliancy of The Godfather.",0

Entre ellos un maravilloso Al Pacino.En conclusión, es una película que me ha costado ver, pero que es de obligado visionado, es una maravilla.

354,"Yes, it is one of the all-time greats, even if it is not very inspiring and presents a fairly dark view of life.  Puzo and Coppola make us feel sympathy for the Corleones - yes, they are gangsters and killers, but they only kill those who want to kill them.  They refuse to get into heroin distribution, preferring to stick with the supposedly harmless businesses of gambling and prostitution, and this is what leads to a gang war.  They are mindful of their place in society, and are respected in their community.  Some great male acting here - Caan, Duvall, Brando, Sterling Hayden too as a crooked police captain.  I supposed I didn't totally buy Michael's transformation from rejecting the family business to becoming its leader - it just seemed like he wanted something else.",1

I was not sure if this is truly a 10 or more like a 9.7 or something like that, but what it's definitely true is the fact that this movie is a masterpiece, done with the utmost care and ability, and that it represents the best that can be offered in the big screen. With a cast that can be said the best ever, some of the most recognizable lines and tropes of cinema, iconic sets and scenes, a music score that makes you feel and relive the scenes as you are listening, and a conclusion that even without the sequels, feels like a full and total emotional and deep story, with characters so real that they almost leap out of the screen, Mr. Coppola is truly to be commended for creating such and incredible and fascinating ride. Recommending this movie is truly an offer that can't be refused. A must watch for any person that even considers a moviegoer. Extraordinary!!",1
357,"'The Godfather' is routinely considered one of the greatest films of all time for good reason.  Francis Ford Coppola shot 90 hours of footage, whittling it down in the editing room to 3 hours of run-time, turning what the studio expected to be a pulpy gangster flick into a soaring epic.  Brando and Pacino and Caan and Duvall and Shire and Cazale and Keaton all get well-deserved credit for lending their talents to the film.  But make no mistake--it's Coppola that makes this marionette puppet dance. His screenplay--written alongside Mario Puzo--is masterful.  His camerawork throughout the movie is ingenious.  And his editing of the film is legendary.Sure, a lot of people consider 'The Godfather: Part II' to be on equal footing, but I'll go to my grave arguing that the original was the purer and more compelling picture between the two.",1
358,"J'avais dû voir ce film en diagonale ou alors je ne m'en rappelais plus (les privilèges de l'âge) et tout ce que j'avais en tête, c'était l'incroyable numéro de Marlon Brando avec ses bajoues, sa voix de vieillard asthmatique et sa diction, son phrasé traînant, ses mimiques ou plutôt sa mimique particulière, cette moue perpétuelle qui le fait ressembler à Droopy... alors qu'il parle de respect, de service et d'offre...Le début du film m'a replongé illico dans ce qui paraît une satire du mafieux archétypal, le mafioso fondateur, le patriarche de sa tribu, en un mot : le parrain ! Drôle donc, hilarant, à se taper le cul par terre... puis les minutes s'égrènent, le personnage se précise et les heures passant (oui, presque trois plombes entières le bousin) la stature de Brando, imposante, s'impose d'elle-même : on ne rit plus, on se tait... et on admire. On respecte.A posteriori Brando apparaît alors comme le seul acteur capable d'imposer un tel respect à son rôle et à le rendre en fin de compte aussi charismatique qu'humain. Bien entendu, le reste de la distribution... n'est pas en reste avec sa pléthore de jeunes stars (dont Pacino et Caan) et ses rôles secondaires solides comme l'indispensable Robert Duvall par exemple.La mise en scène de Coppola s'impose également d'elle-même malgré sa tendance à s'étirer un peu trop : elle demeure tirée au cordeau, l'ensemble est cadré avec soin et monté avec intelligence.Bien entendu, Le Parrain ne serait pas ce qu'il est (une histoire de famille et de fureur) sans la musique enquiquinante de Nino Rota, habituellement abonné aux fariboles de Fellini mais qui livre et module ici deux thèmes nostalgiques et mélancoliques à l'envi.Le film a donc bien vieilli et ne vieillira plus et fait partie malgré ses tics, des ""classiques"".",1

381,إنها التحفة السينمائية الخالدةباعتقادي أن روعة هذا الفيلم وبقسمه الأول بالذات تتجسد ليس بالقصة فقط، بل بالأداء العبقري وبالأخص لدى الدون كاروليوني (مارلون براندو) تلك الشخصية الجذرية والبرغماتية في حماية مصالحها وبذات الوقت أخلاقيتها العملية وراديكالتها الطبقيّة. ذلك التناقض الشديد بشخصية كاروليوني جعل الفيلم ككل قوم على معادلات الانغماس بالشر كقيمة ثورية تحدد مفهوم العدالة بطريقة خاصة.الفيلم بأكمله يقوم عى هذا الحامل القيمي وهو من أمتع الطروحات الفكرية والأدائية في تاريخ السينما,1

387,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.Robert Hamparyan275 W Market St #1000San Diego, CA 92101(619) 550-1355",1
388,"A masterpiece. You should watch it. Incredible actors, incredible story, incredible movie",1
389,"Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest directors of all time and to say that this film is his masterpiece is no small thing, dark and calculated, whether in the excellent script of Coppola and Puzo or in the inspired direction or in a scene of a wedding in which ""nothing"" goes wrong or in the death of a character so brutally and yet balances moments like these, even if distant so perfectly is sensational. The godfather is one of the best directed, written and acted films in history.",1
390,Classic! Copolla and the actors made a beautiful job.I love the way they get back to Italy and show the roots of Mafia italiana.,1
391,Iconic. Well made and well acted (especially Pacino) but some scenes do not hold up as well and it is a little too long.,1
392,"bence müthiş bir film . kendi kriterlerime göre herseyi fazlasıyla karşılayan ,dönem atmosferini muhteşem görsele cevrilmiş,sunduğu konuyu en üst segmentten yani mafya filmlerine yaklaşabilecekleri seviye olarak görülebilecek bir. film",1
393,Ce film s'ouvre sur une scène qui m'a beaucoup impressionner. Une scène subtile et qui est très utile pour une autre scène du film. Cette adaptation du roman de Mario Puzzo est pour moi très convaincante. Marlon Brando mérite amplement son oscar. La mort de vito Corleone est pour moi la meilleur de toute l'histoire du cinéma.La fin est excellente comme tout le reste du film.,1
394,"THE mob movie. Bar none, this one sets the tone for all others. Sure, there have been gangster movies before, but they are pretty formulaic (okay, I'll give you James Cagney in Public Enemy and bonus points for Tony Soprano eating ice cream while watching it), but this brought humanity and depth to the genre in a way not many others have since. My only contention is that the sequel surpasses the original and should be above it on this list.",1
395,This one is just a timeless classic. You need to see this one to truly appreciate the old school mafia themed stories.,1
396,"Bom, Quando eu ouvi falar neste filme, eu pensei ""E mais um filme de Gangster"". e também lembro de fazer aquela cara de arrependido quando vi a cena inicial. eu considero este o melhor filme de todos os tempos. não só pena sua magnifica historia, como também, a ousadia do Francis Ford Coppola para fazer o filme de sua maneira. e um filme que nos ensina muita coisa. principalmente, a valorização da família e a lealdade.",1
397,Amazing movie. Probably the best i have ever seen. Super unpredictable and interesting.,1
398,Possibly the greatest movie ever made. Amazing acting. Amazing directing. Amazing writing. I love this movie.,1

400,"This is such a mesmerizing movie with such greatness in everything like the performamces, the cinematography and the direction.",1
401,"The performances are masterful and set the bar for a generation. Coppola was a tyrant filmmaker at this time. Alike many during the 70's, he went through a lot pioneering his craft. His family oriented warmth bursts on screen like fine wine that gets better with age. He captures the essence of classical beauty. A pulverizing, romanticized and epic sensation to endure The Godfather. Like a smooth cappuccino, it brews the perfect blend. Most noteworthy, I gleam at the artwork that is the Apollonia storyline.",1
402,"Masterpiece,iconic,classic!great slow burn and calm!the way story goes it was amazing the music was phenomenal,the screenplay was way too slow but engaging!the acting was iconic everyone were amazing!the family feuds the gangsters society feuds the business deals everything themed movie perfectly!at start the wedding was boring and slow as it was intro then from the johnny's case and horse scene from then it was hell of ride the encounter the way whole family deals .the vengeance  and the most amazing the change in character of mike it was amazing the way he changed from no **** being gangsta to being The Godfather at end and ending was amazing as all mess is cleared the way cleverly and iconic to watch how vito with family!climax cut scene was chills as mike became godfather and his wife see's him and the door closes!overall its the most iconic movie and classic!",1
403,How should i talk about this iconic movie?What a wonderful amazing cting performance by all the actors espicially Marlen Brando.,1

408,It's not spoiler commentBest film for ever All timeI don't have any thing to say,1
409,"Hands down the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. Words can't even describe how much I love this movie. Don Corleone changed my life! This movie (and the others of course) taught me so many things I never knew about life. Nothing can ever beat this movie. The acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino was just world class; it was a match made in heaven. The other actors and actresses were absolutely brilliant as well. How Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for best supporting actor is beyond me. This movie contains the best quotes/lines in film history and its all there in this 3 part masterpiece. It contains life lessons you won't get anywhere else. The first part was my favourite because of the introduction and development of the characters. It was confusing the first time I watched it but that's with every film that has a huge storyline like this and everyone goes through the same thing. I learn new things every time I watch this film and it was nothing shy of a masterpiece. No other film will be able to beat this mark my words. I still can't get over how AMAZING this film was. ""A man who doesn't time with his family can never be a real man"" WHO ELSE is going to tell you that in life?!? Nobody except Don Corleone. This movie made me more wise now (19 years old) than if I was 55 years old and didn't watch this movie. I thank my father for recommending me this movie because if it wasn't for him, I would still be an idiot.",1

414,One of the best movie i've ever seen.it shows anythings a movie should have in.,1
415,"I mostly have to give this 8/10 because I think The Godfather Part II is even better. It is a masterpiece; at times, a little slow, and perhaps a shorter run time would be justified (even two-and-a-half hours).",1
417,How do people dislike this movie?  It's a cinematic masterpiece and is an American cultural phenomenon.,1
418,"Simplesmente incrível. As atuações de Marlon Brando e Al Pacino foram perfeitas. Só que assista quando estiver bem disposto, pois o filme é bem lento.",1
419,Best gangster movie with best acting performance from each and every character and my 10th best movie of all time,1
420,"I really should have watched this movie earlier, wow. Where do I start, the movie's got one of the greatest plots with a dazzling cast who give their best performances especially from Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) he gives the best performance from start to finish. Also, the movie gets more brutal and bloody during some important scenes and they work quite well. The cinematography for this movie is honestly amazing and the camera work is pretty decent and all. Finally, the movie's got a beautiful score which sounds and works amazingly in this bloody brutal movie. Overall, I honestly enjoyed this movie and I don't know why I didn't watch it sooner but overall, it was honestly outstandingly brilliant, worth the watch.",1
421,"This Godfather!That's enough, I have no words to explain How it is a gread epic",1
422,"Not really much I can day about this movie. From the dark contrasting cinematography, to the superb storytelling and directing by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola respectively, and the instantly recognizable score by Nino Rota. The greatest movie... ever.",1
423,"Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Absolutely, positively the greatest movie ever made.",1
424,So much has been said about this that to you don't have anything more to praise. This is such a beauty. A gold standard for gangster movies.,1
425,"""The Godfather"" really shows the audience what a tragedy is, and the powerful expression of the tragedy itself. Other tragedy stories seem to be self-confident under this reflection.  Even though this story about inheritance is covered in a crime film, the spirit conveyed in it applies everywhere; the old godfather played by Marlon Brando is certainly the biggest cast in the movie, but the core of the story is  Suspected on Mike played by Al Pacino, looking at the three parts, they are all about the growth story of Mike as the core; the lie at the end of Mike seems to confirm that the lie is the power to sustain everything, the cornerstone to sustain everything  .",1
426,"While having a reputation for its slow pace, The Godfather's performances and tense atmosphere make every scene a pleasure to watch. In the end, the duration feels just right. The film does border on sentimentalism at times, but never departs from its earnest depiction of sociopathic barbarism that masquerades itself as ""honest business."" The mafia is shown their true colours as backstabbing power-hungry dangerous men with no place in any civilized society-do not let their style and presentation fool you otherwise.",1
427,"Not just a classic, but a goliath that redefine all cinema industry. No matter how many times you watch it, only gets better!",1
428,I can proudly say The Godfather is the best criminal film.It is one of the greatest Coppola`s films.One of striking films during Coppola`s golden era.,1
429,This movie is kinda really bad I mean who even is this godfather guy? he's not my godfather,0
430,"This is the greatest movie of all-time and I will explain you why no other movie compares.First of all, I think that we need to separate greatest movie of all-time and best movie of all-time. Many movies can be considered the best movie of all-time, but only The Godfather can be considered the greatest movie of all-time. The direction was almost perfect, the story is almost perfect, the character development is almost perfect, the cast is almost perfect, the use of lightning is almost perfect, but that's a movie that's almost 50 years old. When this came out, there is technical aspects that were never been done before. Some would argue that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie of all-time for the same reason, but I think that while Citizen Kane is also an awesome movie on the technical level, it is also a movie with a story that not many people could relate to and appreciate like The Godfather. Everyone that's reading this review should go and watch gangster movies from the 50s-60s. All I'm gonna say is that they were not very good. The Godfather completely changed the gangster film and influenced many great movies like Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, Casino, The Departed and even to this day movies like The Irishman take influence directly from Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. That's what makes it the greatest movie of all-time for me.Thanks for reading my review of The Godfather.",1
