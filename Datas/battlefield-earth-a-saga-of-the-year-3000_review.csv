0,"""Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000"" has everything messed up. The story is messy and disjointed, (with breath-taking slo-mo action popping up in the wrong time every 5 seconds), the dialogue is cheesy and obvious, as well as for the movie's choppy editing. It sure did deserve a lot of razzies....",0
1,"Watch ONLY 3 Minutes of the film. maybe, maybe not. Maybe see how BAD it looks for everyone who likes Sci-Fi film. This is one ofthe WORST movies I've seen.",0
2,Umm... No. Just don't do this. Ever. It's Passion of the Christ for Scientology. Don't watch this if you don't want to feel like you are clawing your eyes out with sharpened fingernails made of poop. So just avoid this movie at all costs.,0
3,"The worst film I have ever seen. The writing is absolutely horrible. The acting is very poor. I mean come on, John Travolta and Barry Pepper can be good actors, they deserve better than this crap! But most of all, the film is just downright ugly. The characters are ugly and the film-making concepts that they used for this film are awful. I mean, why is every shot at a slant? This film just makes no sense whatsoever.",0
4,"Wow, this movie is bad, first John Travolta's acting is so over the top you will die laughing, the cinematography is the worst ever, almost every shot is leaning for some reason, the special effects are crap, and nothing makes sense. This is one of the worst movies ever.",0
5,"Ugly, dumb, and predictable, Battlefield Earth has shown what it got to deserve the 0 rating. From John Travolta, this is his worst movie he has ever done so far.",0
6,This film has so many wholes you could practically see right through it. The performances are so bad and the director was so lost with how to create an action scene. I see why this film won the worst film of the decade at the razzies.,0
7,"There are so many reasons why you should avoid Battlefield Earth: 1. Never make a dull and sleazy script from a novel.2. A film needs more marketing campaigns.3. Throw it in a landfill in New Mexico. The film is so bad, I will not ever rent or buy a bad box office flop again. I think John Travolta needs to learn a couple of lessons from Pulp Fiction because every time when a critic comes to harass you, that's the reason why sci-fi and adventures don't mix. It's still one of the most disgusting movies since Showgirls and The Adventures of Pluto Nash. No sequel, no nothing. Total B.S. ""Battlefield Earth"" is so bad, I got a good review in a good way.",0
8,"Battlefield Earth can be quite accurately summed up by just describing how John Travolta appears -  bloated, clumsy, unintelligent, overbearing, uninteresting, ugly, ridiculous, pathetic... The list could go on, though there is a lot more to get to. The plot is mostly cliched, contrived nonsense; the characters look stupid, do stupid things and say stupid things; but where Battlefield Earth fails on such an IMMENSE scale is the direction. Seriously, the direction is ABHORRENT - never has a big-budget Hollywood movie been directed so awfully. The camera is almost permanently stuck on an absurd diagonal, making it very hard to concentrate, and also causing borderline motion sickness. On top of that, the colours and the lighting are so ugly that it almost defies you to continue watching. Every scene is either in this dull and lifeless blue, or a bewildering menagerie of green, yellow and purple. It's just baffling how anyone could look at this steaming pile and find it anything but excruciating! In addition to this abomination of direction is a cast of grossly unappealing actors, including the emotional flatline, Barry Pepper; the half-asleep Forest Whitaker; and of course, the ham and cheese deluxe, John Travolta. All the adjectives in the world fail to even touch on the complete depth of hopelessness that Battlefield Earth exudes in all facets of production. Let it be the saga of the year 2000, so that all will know of the first mistake humankind made in the new millennium.",0
9,This was a terrible movie. One of the worst movies i've ever seen. Almost as bad as alone in the dark.................................................,0
10,"Just No..Never Will Win A Single Damn Thing..One Of The Worst Movie's I Have Ever Seen",0
11,The worst movie I saw in my life.The second place goes to Lord of the Flies.I do not like the plot of Lord of the flies;but Battlefield Earth has the worst director and the worst actor:John Travolta(only for this movie).,0
12,"In my opoinion this is the wprst film of all time. The camera angles are annoying and the fuxking scene transitions with the ""wipes"" is annoying as hell. John Travolta's character is just really stupid and cheesy. The slow motion is **** The script is really poor with lots of plot holes and the design is just really bad.",0
13,"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 is possibly the worst movie of all time, it comes complete with and incomprehensible plot, wooden and cheesy acting (the best kind) and some terrible camera angles. Now if you roll all of these aspects together into one little deformed ball you will create the greatest disaster to ever hit the big screen. I would recommend this movie only to people who like to torture their own brain for 90 minutes (like me.) 0/10- Train wreck from Hell",0
14,"Horrible, and difficult to watch the entire movie. Once was enough. I don't often have a reason to rate anything this low, but this is one of those times. I can't find anything about this movie that has any redeeming qualities and I like John Travolta, just not in this movie. I think as a parody of sci-fi it would have been better!",0
15,"Terrible same with every body's acting in this movie AWFUL JUST TERRIBLE IT'S WIERD AND STUPID SO IS THE BOOK this movie should be banned from shelves and HBO! The Screen play acting setting and cinematography department of this movie just made a star wars and star trek rip off IT DESERVED AND WON A LOT OF GOLDEN RASBERRYS AND I SHOULDVE AND IT DID --- SPOILER BELOW --- At the end someone blows up travolta's planet the bomb that travolta planted then barry pepper locks travolta up in a sell where he is surrounded by more than a million brick of gold than Forrest Whitaker is behind them gives the gun to pepper turns out he switched sides and than travolta is pissed that he changed sides and that the movie sucked terribly",0
16,"These reviews aren't lying. This is one of the worst excuses for a film I've ever seen. Everything, from the acting to the costumes to the special effects to the story to the script to the plot holes to the action to the cinematography to the lighting, just sucks. This is the worst movie I've ever seen.",0
17,"Battlefield earth now has another battle to deal with, keeping fans interested as this movie has bad dialogue, story, effects, characters, this is one of those huge messed up movies.",0
18,"This is a movie that disgusted me to my very core. At the same time, the messy, awful, hodge-podge story is nothing short of unintentional comedy genius.",0
19,"Hilariously AwfulThis is truly one of the worst movies ever made. But at the same time, It’s so f*cking funny.",0
20,This is the most watched movie since Star Wars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
21, Well... the film is bad. BUT it is not that bad then I thought after reading all the critics. Or maybe it's only not so bad  because it is some sort of fun to see such a bad film. I had a good time!,0
24,Battlefield Earth is the mother of all bad movies. If Cigarettes can have messages informing customers that they can die from it then I feel like they should have put that same warning on the tickets when this movie was released.,0
25,"This film had me rock hard from start to finish. John Travolta has never played a more convincing role; I think he really explored the roots of his own life in this motion picture. The ending was simply ""golden""",1
27," This film is great. You must be a psychiatrist or on medication if you hate this film. My buddy Jon Travolta does an excellent job portraying Bob Marley. I can't wait to show it to Suri when IT takes over and our Xenu comes back. Haven't you all suspected? THIS film is how I converted Katie. I assure you, watch this film and your E-Meter will be off the chart. Just pay 400 thousand dollars to the only true religion and 5 bucks to your local secular video store and you too can be a scientologist! Thanks for your time, and Viacom, f.ck off! I'm fine without you!",1
28," Best bilingual scifi movie of all time In a country where bilingual English/Spanish signage is scoffed at by the illiterate provincial masses, I don't expect a movie as brilliantly bilingual as BattleField Earth to have been embraced. Just as I am ahead of my times for my ability to speak Chinese, so BattleField Earth is ahead of its time in presenting the inhabitants of Psyclo as non-native English speakers who need to tech their enemy their language before they can communicate with him. That aspect was misunderstood by the uni-lingual American masses. In a world where only 7% of the people speak English as their native language, I find it insulting to see SciFi movies where Romulans and Naboo-ians speak perfect English. The ""cultural elite"" often praise themselves on watching foreign films with subtitles, yet the same people scoff at the best bilingual scifi movie of all times - BattleField Earth. BattleField Earth gets 2 thumbs up from this critic.",1
29," I was expecting it to be different having read the book. I thought it was not bad at all , i don't follow critics opinions, especially were sci fi is concerned. a worse piece of crap was hitchikers guide to the galaxy but you don't hear nothing about it, or Vin disel's attempt at sci fi. that moovie sucked so much i forgot the name.",1
33, A very funny comedy with two of the funniest performances and two of the funniest characters I've seen from either John Travolta or Forrest Whitaker. What? It wasn't supposed to be a comedy? Too bad. It is what it is. I laughed myself silly!,1
35," Far ahead of its time, ""Battlefield Earth"" was never recognized for the masterpiece allegory that it is. The aliens in this movie are thinly veiled versions of Scientology proselytizers, and their adventures on planet Earth focus on the misunderstandings that often occur between members of the church and the general public. Travolta's character is an unsubtle archetype of every Hubbard-worshiping movie star that has come before him - his natty dreads and over-the-top delivery an uncanny riff on Tom Cruise's performance in ""Born on the Fourth of July."" His large bulk and space-faring ways can not fail to invoke memories of Kirstie Alley in a far inferior sci-fi flick, ""Star Trek II."" Indeed, the film makes a case for L. Ron Hubbard as the supreme pop culture Sci-Fi guru of our time, not the overrated Gene Roddenberry. Indeed, ""Battlefield Earth"" may very well be viewed in the year 3000 much as we look back on near-forgotten masterpieces like ""The Inferno"" and ""King Lear."" Watch for Will Smith's brief but hilarious cameo as a Bible salesmen. Other Scientologists making brief cameos include Tom Hanks, Bea Arthur, the kid from ""Jerry Maguire,"" and Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson.",1
37,"This movie isn't nearly as bad as all that. Sure, it's a bit cheesy but I liked the characters. I think it's done purposely with tongue in cheek, not meant to be a SERIOUS sci-fi but just a fun adventure; Sort of the same way how the Indiana Jones movies were inspired by those old serial shorts. It has pretty good fx and the actors are clearly into it. The story is cool though unoriginal, but I rooted for the humans to rise up against their alien masters. Don't over-think it, you'll have some fun. Ignore the haters, they just go for the obvious cheap shots. If you like sci-fi adventures, then you could do much worse.",1
39," Better than I thought it was going to be and I can still only give it a 2. It's shamelessly pandering to the same people that Scientology does, the not so smart segment of the population. Besides being a not very good sci-fi story in the first place it is also a bad adaptation of a bad story that is badly acted and badly directed. The best thing I can say is some of the acting is so bad it's laughable, especially Mr. Travolta.",0
40," Not one character was appealing. I enjoy science fiction a great deal but this reminds me why 99% of the time the movies are never done correctly or are able to be funded. Any made for tv movie would have been much better because at least you could blame a lack of funding, but this fails on such a large scale that its imeasurable. Never thought Id ever feel sorry for an actor before but Travolta this was just sad. Its his own fault though.",0
41," It's far from the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not very good either. I really thought the plot gave it pottential, but the lame effects and acting really ruined it. There are, however, two things that I DID enjoy about this move. As I said before, the plot was interesting and I really enjoyed Travolta's performance. Other than that, I will admit that this is a true, honest-to-God disaster.",0
42," I've seen many great movies and many bad ones, but this is easily the worst all around flick i have watched. by far. from dialogue to plot to scenery to tone to setting to costum design. it is bad beyond comprehension from start to finish. and in no way am i guilty of exaggeration.",0
43, Horrible and completely stupid. I´d rather use the time to stare at a rotten banana.,0
44, Sometimes you feel you have to watch something to see if its as bad as everyone said! I did and it,0
45, The most clichéd science fiction piece I have ever witnessed. Absolutely terribly written and the acting inspired no emotional reaction.,0
46," It's so bad, it's not even funny. Who gave this movie the green light? I would like to know, cause' they need to re-evaluate their jobs.",0
47, Almost as bad as 'The Lake House' :-),0
48," Every scene in the movie is flooded in either vomit orange, deep purple, or baby poop green. Seriously.",0
49," The hype is accurate! ""Battlefield Earth"" is one of, if not the worst film in the history of mankind. Ugly, stupid, repulsive, and disturbing in a manner not seen, since, well, the era of L. Ron Hubbard's crummy derivative writing and scam of a religion.",0
50," This movie was so bad it was amazing that the stars accepted these roles, in two weeks time the primitive people know how to fly fighter jets? It also moved way too fast and was so stupid how the tryed to talk, piece of crap movie, don't waste your time.",0
51," This is possibly the worst movie ever made, but perhaps slightly better than Ben & Arthur.",0
52, Geez why people give this a higher rating which means they should be put into a mental institution if they like this film. Cause this movie sucks as hell because if poor plot and poor effects in this film.,0
53," I've seen worse, just can't remember when.",0
54, So bad it's funny.,0
55,"Ha ha!!!! I get it now! after watching this overacted, non-linear, headache inspiring film, I get that all the good reviews in this section must be sarcastic!  Very good jokes you guys!  If you want to see a movie that is so bad that you can't watch it without a constant headache, then by all means, burn through a few hours of your life with this empty soda can that cost 75 million dollars to make.",0
56,This was a terrible movie. It had a terrible plotline and I could barely watch this movie. I couldn't watch this movie and it made me want to kill myself.,0
57,"Hail to the brilliance of Roger Christian. In giving us Battlefield Earth, he has crafted a master class of what not to do in film making. I don't think he will ever be completely understood.",1
58,"Too bad I went to see this one back in the days. It's the worst movie with John Travolta in it that I've ever seen. Not much story, nothing that was at least semi-believable or anything like that. Really bad, but I'm still giving it a 2 for some of the special effects that are at least somewhat enjoyable.",0
59,"An unbelievably terrible alien the film that has reached the level of terrible on every single aspect of the film from poor acting, a hideous color, terrible effects, the awful storyline with plot wholes, and the ridiculous angle shots.",0
60,"Movies like Battlefield Earth don't even deserve to be in Hollywood business. I don't even think the story was engaging and the acting was horrible as crap. The story that is copying Star Trek doesn't even work, not for even 4 minutes it doesn't. This whole 3000 bad special CGI effected world is nothing just a fake invitation to invite you to the most horrible movies John Travolta has ever acted in. I advise you not to watch Battlefield Earth, strongly advise you not to. Strongly.",0
61,"This movie is so exquisitely bad, it went all the way past the score meter into the negative dimension, came back from the other side, and settled on an almost absolute zero.The acting is horrible, the dialog is beyond childish, and the plot  while still making some sense in the book  is laughably ridiculous in the film adaptation. From start to finish, there is simply nothing to enjoy here.",0
62,Let's put this in simple words; this is the worst  movie I've ever had the unfortunate coincidence to stumble upon. It's all  bull**** Scientology and John Travolta ruins his status. Pulp Fiction was great. Why now do something where all he does is scream like a girl with f****ing asthma while mixing in KISS and Bob Marley.,0
63,"You know your movie's bad when even the unintentional comedy doesn't work.Honestly, you don't even need to sit through the whole thing to know why it's so bad. Awful story, hammy acting, headache-inducing cinematography, horrific CGI that makes early films look great, everything about it is just wrong. Don't do it. Please. Don't.",0
64,"Battlefield Earth, oh where do I begin with this movie? Either start off with the god-awful acting or the terribly written story. Set in the year 3000 we see a bunch of...cavemen. Then later on we get to see John Travolta in one of the worst alien looking attires I have ever seen. That's it! I'm not going any further with this movie! Watch it for yourself and tell me how it goes. A zero out of ten.",0
65,"I was able to sit through 20 minutes of this movie, only to find nothing but horribleness. Battlefield Earth has atrocious acting, awkward camera angles, and misplaced dialogue. This movie felt like if the Matrix met After Earth. Only that it is 10 times worse than After Earth. There is literally nothing that it is at least half-decent in this movie! 0/10 (unspeakable)",0
66,"Although I've only seen the trailer of Battlefield Earth, I still know how awful this movie is. There's bad special effects, bad makeup effects, and bad acting. I can see why it only made 29.7 million.",0
67,Yes  this is very bad film very very bad but i dont know i like it. I like movie setting in other world such as the lord of the rings and star wars. Not for harry potter.,1
68,"Oh my soul, who wrote this? A bunch of monkies probably. Battlfield Earth has terrible visuals, it horrendously directed, and it's terribly written. The cinematography in this film is some of the worst I've ever seen.",0
69,"Extremely underrated and overlooked.I think the main complaint of the Movie is that the Movie is based off A work from L. Ron Hubbard who invented Scientology and John Travolta  being A Scientologist  starring in the Movie.The Acting was nothing special,but was fine.The story is actually really intriguing and overall it was A great film who's really only tarnished by people scoring it so low which is the same and again I believe it is because of the Scientologist part.Maybe if people would get over that then they could truly see the Movie without blinders on.",1
71,"You might wonder how any movie with John Travolta in dreads could go wrong, but try as he might, the actor's conviction couldn't help this sci-fi clunker (based on a novel by the Scientology founder) impress on even a basic level. Unforgivably awful, it even lacks that so-bad-it's-good campiness that has saved other films like it.",0

76,"If you don't want your pretty day to be ruined, avoid this film at all costs.The acting is terrible, weak, features the worst of John Travolta in this decade, each performance is godawful. And the special effects, god, they suck so much, with the predictable, messed up and no-sensical story, the crappy dialogue, and the protagonist of the bad stuff. The camera, the camera is a pain in the ass to see... ALL of the film has a **** camera angle, the angle in a camera can be fine but it doesn't have to be in a cutscene in which characters talk. If not, it makes the film look horrible, but ""Battlefield Earth"" does that. It doesn't matter if the people are talking, the **** camera angle is still there. Actually, this film doesn't deserve to be called a ""film"" at all. This, in the time, it's similar to a cash-grab. Imagine being at the 2000s, and you spend your money to watch this ""film"", in the end, you could have spent your money in a different thing than to suffer 2 hours with this godawful ""film"", each actor is crap, as I said, the story is non-sensical, bad, messed up, the cinematography is the worst thing. Oh and yeah, the direction is bad too, everything about this ""film"" is bad. This went more to a rant instead of a review, yeah. I know. But this ""film"" is so bad that once you see it. You're with the same pain as like, after you take the hottest and spiciest chili/pepper of all...",0
77,"This has got to be the worst film ever in comparison to how much it cost. Everything about this movie is a hideous and illogical mess. It is by far the most painful movie experience I have ever had. While there are some other movies are just as bad, they are more enjoyable because of their inadequacies. This was just a long, boring, ugly and relentless assault on the eyes and ears.",0
79,"Ugly, shoddy, dumb, and desperate, “Battlefield Earth” shows that, even with a decent cast, it’s possible to make a film that somehow goes against everything one would want in a typical movie, as everything, whether it be the story, visual effects, cinematography, is so lazy and overly derivative of other films this is clearly trying to rip off, that everything comes off as shallow and almost insulting.",0
80,I have never seen a film that pissed me off as much as this. Battlefield Earth is an atrocious piece of cinema. Absolutely nothing about this film is redeemable. An absolute disgrace. Avoid this movie at all costs.0/10,0
81,"Now is this a good movie? No. Is this a movie that is so bad that it’s good. Yes. John Trovolta’s lines are so atrocious that it makes you laugh your ass off. If you are into bad movies, I highly recommend this.",1
82,"One of the worst movies ever made, Battlefield Earth is astonishingly awful in every way -- ugly cinematography, overuse of Dutch angles and wipeouts, overacting from every actor involved, horrible soundtrack, cheap special effects, and a script filled numerous plotholes and incoherences. It is so shocking that a movie like this exists and yet I'm kinda happy that it does despite my score.",0
83,"В США вообще какие то странные тенденции временами происходят. 10 лет назад все обожали афроамериканцев. Нужно заснять хотя бы одного, что бы фильм не обосрали. Сейчас все ненавидят мужчин-гетеросексуалов, что бы тебя уважали, нужно обязательно ткнуть в них палкой и показать какие это подлые, трусливые и мерзкие существа. Ну, а в конце 90х, я так понимаю, не любили постапокалипсис (многие постапокалиптические фильмы, в это примерно время, получили заниженные оценки).Вот я захотел написать о ""Пеле битвы - Земля"". Буду судить о нем со своей точки зрения, а не с точки шизонутого стада критиков!Если кто не знает фильм снят во книге Рона Хаббарда. Прочитав её за долго до этого я скажу, что фильм снят не по книге, а скорее по мотивам. Я увидел фильм в 2002 году и он мне очень понравился. О связи с книгой я вспомнил услышав слово ""сайкло"", в книге которую я читал их называли сайклосы. В фильме, я считаю, очень хорошо передана атмосфера романа. Сюжет, ну сюжет состряпан из самых ярких эпизодов книги. Скучную торговую жизнь после уничтожения ""сайкло"" опустили и не зря, я думаю. Хотя можно было бы рассказать о происхождении самих сайклосов, почему они такие злые и подлые. Но тогда, я думаю, фильм бы шел часа 4, а это не допустимо:)У некоторых главных персонажей изменили роли и даже расу, я писал в начале.Самих сайклосов сделали не такими какими я их представлял, основываясь на прочитанном. Но скажу ещё раз фильм по мотивам.Скажу ещё раз фильм мне очень понравился, прекрасные актёры, прекрасный грим, не плохие эффекты. Кто обсерал фильм, тот либо ничего не смыслил в постапокалиптической фантастике, либо делал это по заказу или личной неприязни, либо просто как дурак ""за компанию""!",1
84,Just Trash. Bad Storry. Stupid character design. Edetid wirh Windows Movie Maker,0
85,"I saw a bit of this years ago, not the entire film but enough to see it was boring. Finally having watched Battlefield Earth in full I can honestly say this is John Travolta's worst film along with Face/Off and Broken Arrow. Battlefield Earth is slow, the humour is awful, the explosion scenes are okay but besides that the action is awful. No story, and no character development and it looks depressing. Poor acting and it made zero sense.",0
