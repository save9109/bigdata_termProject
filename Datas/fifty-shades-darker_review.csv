0,"You should stay away from this utter garbage. It’s even worse than the first one. The writing, acting, directing, in a word everything in this film is uneven and awful. It feels more like a bad comedy than a romance/erotic movie.",0
1,"Anal beads cost less than a movie ticket,    so how about all the 45y old **** housewifes buy them    instead of watching  this trash",0
2,The only good thing is that the people are pretty and the technical stuff is fine. Everything else is terrible. It's just two people having sex and having awkward conversations.,0
3,"What a movie disaster! Bad, really bad! Where can I start? The script: it's repetitive, with totally forced situations and ridiculous dialogues, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have chemistry and showed in other films that the two are good actors, but, with a script like that! How can you act well if your dialogues are so stupid? For example: how can I take seriously a movie that at one point says ""You taught me to **** she taught me how to love""? The film is repeated again and again in terms of plot and not even the sex scenes are interesting. The movie causes absolutely nothing. The new characters lack depth and time on the screen.",0
4,"""Fifty Shades Darker"" was a horrible movie. The protagonists doing their usual things, the boring story and its forced change, of sure and no one is interested in this erotic sequel and the pure morbid it causes.",0
5,I Watched this crap about 2 hours ago and already forgot whats in it except the cheesy dumb teenager sex fantasies. The plot holes are deeper than Anastasia's Vagina.,0
6,"Whoops, the franchise just got worse. Plot points that go nowhere, the characters still act like idiots or jerks, blah blah blah, you've heard this before.",0
7,"It's not like a hate this garbage because i am a man.It has no value except the camera work.Should we talk about the tedious plot, there's nothing to expect to happen.Oh geez this trash can't even depict pornography well.The characters are boring, Christian being a psychopath and Anastasia is being her dumb self who has no reason being by Christians side.",0
8,"There's no accounting for taste! Not sure why this movie is popular, but it's not very well written, or directed. I guess this is a franchise that's here to stay, since it's cheap to make, and turns a good profit.Although for the more discerning viewer, I would avoid this at all costs. If you watch the trailer you'll know what it's all about, only it's a lot worse than it looks. Oh, and the reviews here scoring it a 10 are I suspect fake.",0

10,"THe type of movie that shouldn't exist, you don't even need to watch to know it's garbage, don't come with that **** of ''you need to watch'' no you don't, you can see the flaws in the trailer aready, stupid plot, completely empty characters and overral mundane, don't waste your hard worked money on this crap, go play some video games, your time will be spent way better",0
11,What i thought wasn't possible is possible as proven by the second installment in the terrible film franchise that explores no story and is fueled with the worst feeling of boringness within it,0
12,Fifty Shades Darker was more like Fifty Shades Dumb. The movie had a very unbelievable plot line and I also thought that the film was too dramatic. Fifty Shades of Grey wasn't that good so why even bother making a sequel that wasted the talent of good actors and actresses.,0
13,"Fifty Shades Darker is not a dramatic movie nor a thriller. Instead, it acts as a comedy, because it's 2 hours of nothing, with a crashed helicopter scene and a forbidden love (kinda, not really?) that doesn't make any sense. This movie throws some of the most loveable actors (same for the director) in one of the worst performances of 2017.The only good thing (mostly decent, not good) was the soundtrack with Nicki Minaj, Zayn etc. and that's it. In the end, 'Fifty Shades Darker' is another cash-grabby sequel, that has nothing to do with the book. And don't worry, it's worse than 'Fifty Shades Of Grey'.",0
14,"This sequel lacks any of the original's assets (I really liked it. See my review here). The narrative ended with her (Dakota Johnson) walking out on her billionaire beau (Jamie Dornan). Before long, they're back together, which leads to endless intimate discussions about commitment, boundaries and other boring drivel. The dialogue is embarrassingly pedestrian (I was predicting a number of lines before they were uttered). The sex scenes lacked any eroticism (but plenty of nudity) and the S&M component was PG-rated kink. The sprinkling of suspense and disaster feel contrived and add nothing. It doesn't help that the obnoxious soundtrack pounds home the character's emotional state with often ridiculously literal lyrics. Even the scenes of opulence lack visual snap. You'd have to be a true masochist to endure this painful experience. NOTE: If you must go, stay thru the early credits to see a preview of the next one.",0
15,"Deprived of any narrative intensity or tension, Darker lowers the series' status from bad to worse, and settles for simple ""guilty pleasure"" moments and laughable plot points.",0
16,"The only good thing about this movie is Tyler Hoechlin as Boyce Fox. And I can not even say if it was a role or a simple appearance.Give the boy more than 3 minutes on screen, three or four dialogues with Dakota and Jamie and that could save the entire movie.",0
17,"Признаюсь, первые 10 минут было даже... интересно.Но потом начались те же 50 оттенков коричневого, которыми был  первый фильм.Не тратьте время на это.",0
18,"Similar to the first one in almost every way.  The film is competently shot, but wow is the story a complete bore.  This is a soap opera mixed with pop song layered sex scenes just a complete waste of time.  The last thirty minutes tried to concoct a story out of nowhere but it is all around laughable.  Overall a well filmed ball of nothing. D",0
19,"Look what we have here. After the undeniable release of Fifty Shades of Grey, we all thought there wouldn't be a trilogy of this, but all they just want is more money (I am already aware of it being a book trilogy, but in reality, they made these for money) so they wouldn't just stop there. We all looked at this film to wonder if it's going to be better than its predecessor. Well, people, you're right but there just seems to be a problem in Fifty Shades Darker that isn't quite necessary whatsoever.",0
20,"Hard to believe there can be a worse movie than the first one, but they've managed to pull through. If the first one at least had the vague 'pro' of meeting the characters (as mediocrely developed as they were), this one has nothing. It's a shallow and boring experience from start to finish. And the only reason I assume anybody would like this, is because they can relate to some sexual desires of the characters, not at all due to the characters or the movie itself.",0
23,"Existem três modos de enxergar esse ""Cinquenta Tons Mais Escuros"", segundo filme da trilogia iniciada em ""Cinquenta Tons de Cinza"", baseado no livro homônimo de E.L. James. Ele pode ser visto como um drama erótico fracassado, uma comedia involuntária bem-sucedida ou como uma obra perigosa que justifica e romantiza o comportamento machista e possessivo.",0
24,"Much like its predecessor, this film brings absolutely nothing of value to the table. Deprived of any real story or fundamental tension, Darker does nothing for this already struggling glorified porn franchise but make it go from bad to awful the span of 118 minutes.",0
25,"After watching Fifty Shades Darker, I’m still not convinced of it being a love story. Sure the abusive relationship is over, but Christian still has that manipulative and possessive personality that affects Ana’s personal space. Buying Ana’s company unexpectedly and unnecessarily transferring money to her bank account, as well as knowing her account number is downright creepy as heck. After all that, he proposes her to marry him and she said yes. My primary reaction to that is “WTAF?!” She’s going to marry some dude who stalks her a lot and just uses her to fulfill his own desires.Plus, the disappointing parts of the film is the gender-biased sex positions. No woman on top?! Not even once??!! CTFO!!! This is why I’m appalled of watching films that deal with this kind of **** After knowing more of his former submissives and childhood trauma, my opinion on Christian Grey and the book series remain the same. He is nothing but a deep-seated sadistic and goddamn conniving **** and the books deliver a misconstrued concept of romance.I won’t be surprised if it's nominated for the Golden Raspberry Awards.",0
28,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Fifty Shades of Grey is better than this piece of crap. The sequel to the 2014 ""hit"" is so atrociously awful that it becomes hilarious by the end.",0
29,"Led by a dumb protagonist, anchored by a non-existent plot, burdened by tedious pacing, overlong, decorated with atrocious dialogue, force fed with an unfocused and uninteresting mystery, bereft of all the tension in the book (especially regarding the Elena subplot), and acted with no inspiration, Fifty Shades Darker can’t even be rescued by it’s occasional bursts of unintentional humour and a decent soundtrack.",0
30,"Why does this film exist, why have I seen it? Fifty Shades Darker is the worst film I have ever seen! The script is terrible! The characters are thinner than air, the plot is a rip off of a terrible movie so of course this film is gonna suck! The first movie was absolutely terrible, and of course, the second film is terrible. I have not seen the first film and I will never watch it, I couldn't even finish this movie. I went to see it with a girl that I liked at the time and she kinda forced me, so that's why I saw it.",0
31,"This movie was awful. Much more worser than the first movie. This movie was really boring, from start till the end. I don't recommend watching this movie.",0

33,I have watch the movie and read the book both are amazing. i think people should read the book and then judge the movie because If you are gonna read them you would probably like the movie too. Personally the acting of everyone was amazing and for Valentine this movie is a huge package to watch with their couples.,1
34,It's an easy target because of the concept alone. I think what the film intends to do it does very well. Don't care if it was just me or not... liked the way the film was shot with beautiful color and expressive talent.,1
35,"We care not a lick for these beautiful people, nor for their future together, as teased in a glistening mini-trailer for next year’s “Fifty Shades Freed” halfway through the closing credits. Yet to find yourself rooting for their union purely because they’re both so damn hot is to realize that “Fifty Shades Darker” has worked its shallow magic on you. “I was being romantic and then you go and distract me with your kinky f—kery,” Anastasia chides Christian at one point — to which the audience can only conclude that, with all due respect to her dreams of Austen and Brontë, he’s got the better idea.",1
36,"Really enjoyed Fifty Shades Darker?? & overall thought this 2nd in the trilogy was done nicely. It had all of the romance, emotion, suspense & of course the sex that the first one lacked. Great job with the screenplay because trying to get everything from the book into a 2 hour movie would dilute the story too much , so I understand why certain characters or stories were left out or changed. Would have maybe touched base with the psychiatrist as a character in the movie so you could truly understand how much emotional effort Christian is making to change for the better . I'm not quit sure why the critics are so harsh. Maybe they just don't understand the premise of this beautiful unique love story. Look ... this isn't supposed to be an academy award nominated movie, if you want that , then def see Lion, ( which absolutely deserves to win for best picture) . In any case , I enjoyed this movie much more then some of the critically acclaimed movies that I went to because of the critic's ratings. That's why if you ??Christian & Anastasia's love story then you will absolutely enjoy this movie. It went by fast, was a fun movie to see & like the books , I was sad it was over. I would even see it again . Def will purchase it when it comes out on DVD.",1
37,"The first movie wasn’t spectacular, but it did have its bright moments, including a good performance from its female lead and some sly comedy. This sequel had momentum, and brought the promise of possibility.its fists with growing intensity. “If Dakota Johnson can be into this, you can too. He’s doing a shirtless plank on a pommel horse. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?”",1
38,"Look folks, this is a guilty pleasure type of movie nothing more nothing less, it's an easy target and nothing about it is believable or realistic, and what does it matter. Do you go watch Super-Hero-Movie #4000 for its oh-so realistic depiction of daily life? Don't think so buddy. So why hold this movie to randomly high standards instead of taking it for the silly fantasy that it is. At the end of the day the acting is good and the actors can make you care about the characters, and if you're into this sort of thing you can have a good time or even laugh at the absurdity of it all, or both why not.",1
39,This was a great movie. It has every single thing from romance to thriller. I want to keep watching it again and again. It has all the elements and emotions. The songs were great. This should definitely go for the Oscars. A Truly wonderful romance story better than Shakespeare.,1
40,"Pensei que depois do primeiro, não teria mais jeito. Mas gostei desse segyndo filme, está contando mais detalhes do livro e os atores são maravilhosos. Mil vezes melhor que o primeiro e mais fiel ao livro também. Gostei.",1
41,Loved it. I believe this movie took on different turns which made it interesting. Maybe the first love scene was a little too much of jumping in the fire but sometimes feelings are over the top. I loved it.,1
42,Loved the Movie and the Book. Both are amazingggggggggg.. I mean the acting was superb and the dialogues were hearttouching Couples should really watch this movie in valentine.,1
43,"Film tek kelimeyle mükemmel. Nereden bakarsanız bakın filmin çok güzel olduğunu görebiliyorsunuz. İlk filmin aksine sadece Erotiklik yok. Ciddi anlamda aşkı hissedebiliyorsunuz, duygusal sahneleri hissedebiliyorsunuz. Filmi beğenmeyenlerin neden beğenmediğini asla anlayamayacağım. Çünkü Türüne baktığında film her şeyi karşılıyor. Romantikliği çok üst düzey veriyor, Dramı hissettiriyor ve BDSM kültürünü köküne kadar hissettiriyor. O yüzden nereden bakarsanız bakın çok güzel diyorum. Bunların aksine eski itaatkarlar konuya ek olarak heyecan katmış. Son sahnede ise Grey'i fotoğraftan kaldırma kısmı gelecek film için heyecan uyandırıyor. Filmi izlerken sıkılmayacağınıza eminim. Ön yargılı davranmayın ve saçma yorum yapan insanları dikkate almayın. Koltuğunuza rahatça yaslanın ve filmin keyfine bakın.",1
44,Fifty Shades Darker is a pretty decent sequel. The drama once again succeeds in entertainment for the people. The film isn't much darker and the sexual sequences in this film aren't as graphic as the first. Overall I saw myself enjoying this film.,1
47,"It's still the same bland, boring, lacklustre storytelling like its predecessor. Nothing more to be said.",0
48,"'Fifty Shades Darker' pretty much retains all the problems of its prequel: long, boring, empty and repeated scenes which all say the same thing except with a different lavish product-placement filled background. But this time there is no mystery, and the few new characters that are presented to us are barely given any focus.This is a new problem this film has. It wastes its focus on the wrong parts. Sure, Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) are the main characters, but the subject of Christian's condition is so milked that they simply have nothing to talk about and instead they repeat the same subjects and conversations over and over again. Occasionally we get a sex scene, of course, but they are all the same, yet treated with such attention that we are sucked into their void. ""Take me to the red room"" - Anastasia says at some point like its a big deal. She already was there.But back to the nude scenes. I thought of counting them, but then I remembered my lazy bottom didn't bother to count the number of cuts in 'Werckmeister Harmonies', a film I gave a 10; so, out of respect (and the fact that I didn't really care, to be honest) I didn't. The number is not important. At how boring these scenes are even two are too many. And there were more; that I know. I mean, I am a 22-year-old sexual hormone-filled teenager, and I am honestly sick of seeing Dakota Johnson nude stumbling around Christian Grey's opulent apartment/mansion/castle-whatever.But back to the nude scenes again (or rather one of them). In the scene where he finally takes her to the ""infamous"" red room, yet again we are presented with a boring, safe sex scene. I mean, he's got all that stuff lying around. Is like that episode of Looney Tunes where the rat exterminator comes in, proceeds to lay out all his tools on the floor, and then only uses a tiny trap and then leaves. That was funny and this scene was too (like many scenes), but here I don't believe the humor is intentional.There are three characters which are interesting: that is Leila (Bella Heathcote), a physically harmed girl coming to take vengeance on Anastasia; Eric Johnson giving a pretty good performance as Jack Hyde, Anastasia's boss and Kim Basinger as Elena Lincoln, the woman who first exposed Christian to sado-masochism. But we barely get any focus on them. Leila only appears in three scenes: first, a brief meet with Anastasia then she goes full Batman mode watching Christian and Anastasia sleep (I am still wondering how she got into the apartment) and her 'reveal' is a huge let-down. Same can be said for the rest of the characters.In the end, I guess the reason director James Foley decided to do this, was to artificially extend the plot and to make this a trilogy. This might be a good business move, but its a shameless one when it comes to the art. Yet there were moments, minutes literally, where 'Fifty Shades Darker' peaked my interest - like the scene in which Christian shows his dark side when Anastasia meets Leila or when she is harassed by Jack. But these are way too brief and instead we get a rich and empty showcase of opulence. This film could have been more. This really is a waste.",0
50,"Com diálogos absurdos e cenas embaraçosas que motivam risos automáticos, ""Fifty Shades Darker"" consegue ser muito pior do que o primeiro filme. Horrível, horrível...2/10",0
51,"Ah merde, j'avais enregistré le film sur TFmerde et en le regardant ou plutôt en tentant de regarder cet immondice pour cerveaux dégoulinants par les oreilles, je vois un avertissement qui dit en substance que TFmerde passe la version soft censurée pour toutes les audiences de grande écoute du dimanche soir...Et donc alors, pas de cul ou tellement édulcoré qu'on se croirait sur la chaîne papale. Putain. Bon, remarquez, on ne rate rien je crois, car la gonzesse n'est pas au niveau et ne se signale que par sa banalité affligeante. Pas vraiment bonnasse mais pas moche, pas assez chiennasse pour autant : juste une meuf générique qu'on prendrait à peine pour une pub de liquide à vaisselle.Encore que, faut voir... parce qu'elle a une sale gueule. Sérieusement. Elle est vilaine et elle serait tellement mieux avec un sac sur la tête quand son bellâtre dopé à tronche de cake daigne la besogner de temps à autre. Et même lui attacher les poignets. Avec deux sangles en cuir. Oh mais quelle perversité, je vous demande de vous arrêter, je suis choqué !Bon, on l'a compris, c'est de l'érotisme made in Harlequin, cucul-la -praline, réalisé par un Flanby derrière la caméra. Idéal pour ronfler en somme ! et d'une bêtise qui s'ignore, une bêtise hallucinante.",0
52,"Worse is difficult...This film is the more-than-announced continuation of the Fifty Shades trilogy, and I think it's the worst of the three films. Despite the great success of the box office, in my view largely based on the previous success of the books by E. L. James, the film was precisely booed by both the critics and the public who paid to see it. As I did in the critique of the first film, I emphasize here that I neither read nor intend to read the original books, so I will only speak about the film, although I know that many problems related to the story told already come from the original material.After breaking up with Gray, Anastasia decides to resume with him, but under conditions. Her personality changed a lot from one film to the next. She is no longer that shy girl who is unable to break a plate that we saw in the first film. She discovered her own femininity, is more confident and dominates the situation with confidence, almost to the point of reversing sexual roles with Gray. This, in turn, seems lost and not quite sure where to step, in search of firm ground. This was what surprised me most in the story told by the film. The rest (the intrigues and jealousy involving Anastasia's boss and Gray's ex-lover, or even Leila's enigmatic appearance) does not have half the interest that this change in their personality had for me. And the film also has terrible dialogues and one of the most lurid lapses of continuity I have ever seen in cinema: the complicated lingerie that Anastasia takes to the Gray's charity party and that, already on the spot, in yet another sex scene, has mysteriously disappeared of her body, leaving only a simple lacy underwear. I almost burst out laughing. Is there anything good here? Yes, but little. The performance of the two central actors in the plot is noticeably less boring than in the first film, but, as seen earlier, the impersonality and the lack of passion and chemistry between them dominates; Marcia Gay Harden did a good performance as Christian's mother and Kim Basinger was also good at the little he had to doIt goes without saying that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film had a good budget and, therefore, good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props, satisfactory editing work and a good soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman.",0
