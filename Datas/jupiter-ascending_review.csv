2,"This movie was great fun. Lots of amazing visuals. Great stunts and action. Funny dialogue - I especially loved the Terry Gilliam ""Brazil"" scene. The plot is ridiculous which was extra entertaining. it has a real Fifth Element vibe - sort of camp and zany and over-the-top - but with a larger budget and much better visual effects. I'm looking forward to the sequel!",1
3,"To the Wachowski's - Don't let these reviews detract you from continuing your work.  This movie I believe is more of a a revelation masked in an action sci-fi film. This was the best movie since the Matrix.  Even my mother of 65 loved it,  my wife and friends.  As usual so many truths that are are currently hidden to us are meant to be revealed here in a way the general population can digest.  The problem is the population isn't ready for this material yet.   Therefore you see the negative ratings.  Everything from the symbolism of the bees down to the decadence of the ruling elite.  The underlying premise of this movie is closer to reality than most understand. As far as the movie and superficial material .. The fight scenes and action were the most exciting I've seen since the Matrix.  Very few movie makers can can bring chills down your spine like the Wachowski's.  The action and special effects already made this movie worth the price of admission.  I may even go back and see it again.  The architecture and style were unique and a pure joy to watch.  PLEASE Keep MAKING MOVIES!",1
4,"I enjoyed this film.  I felt that the storyline and universe was epic - reminiscent of Frank Herbert's Dune.    There was plenty of action, an interesting storyline and sneaky pop culture references that were amusing.  It felt as though it had been heavily cut, however, and could have easily filled another hour or so. I wanted to see more of the universe.  It felt as though we were just looking through at a small portion of what this universe had to offer and I had many questions I would have loved to explore further. I really hope that there will be a directors cut, expanding on this universe and filling in some of transient scenes that felt missing.  The acting was excellent and the dialogue between characters felt real and not forced.  It was artistic and beautiful without sacrificing the storyline, though I wish there had been more of it. Not as amazing and ground breaking as the matrix trilogy, but a great watch.",1
5,"Like it so much I went twice, good sci fi film. Enjoyed the chemistry and humour. Eddy was good at being a bad boy for a change. The second viewing was able to understand more of the film that I missed the first time round. Worth a visit to a big screen to get the full effect.",1
6,"This was a fun movie.  There has been a lot said about the movie itself, and they are right.  It is not cinema masterpiece.  What it is, is a fun, sci-fi action movie.  That is it.  Don't expect more.  I would love to see more of this world.  What we saw was very intriguing.  Though, this flopped so badly, I doubt we will see more of that world.",1
7,"I love the movie, and I want to watch it again. It has a very interesting storyline and effective actor's play, the visual are very impressive. Some people just could not understand the idea of story, therefore just ignore these critics.",1
8,"Not totally bad, but I was expecting for better. This is not very original movie, I reminded me of Thor, and some says it is similar to Guardians of the Galaxy (I didn't watch Guardians).",1
9,"Completely unrealistic plot on the most base level: unappealing Mila Kunis discovers that she owns the earth and is given planetary powers. She was working as a poor maid cleaning toilets until that became known to her. After a lot of adventure and saving the earth, she decides to go back to scrubbing toilets (literally) for a living as a maid. The sci if stuff is fun, but the basic plot is ludicrously unbelievable. A similar plot would be: a maid wins a billion dollars in the powerball but decides to throw all the money away and scrub toilets for a living instead. Yeah right.",0
10,"I really don't understand all thats bad reviews, this movie, even if you are not a fan of a hardcore sci-fi, must be a A+ just for be PURE CINEMA; incredible landscapes, a great and original universe, incredible action scenes, What people are looking for a epic sci-fi opera? I just don't understand.",1
11,"Finally saw Jupiter Ascending, and As usually, I wonder where the bad reviews come from. The movie is definitly not ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""Inception"", but it doesnt pretend to be either. In my opinion, it has some strong Luc Besson influences, and I would compare to ""The 5th element"". Its loud, its crazy, its fantasy, its wild. And it doesnt take itself too serious. After watching its grandeur with sets, spaceships and costumes, I knew I want the Wachowskis to do DUNE.",1
12,"Few movies are visualy as spectacular as Jupiter Ascending. The action scenes are awesome, the universe is beautifuly crafted and the plot is simple, but effective. Ok, Mila Kunis is not the best choice for a protagonist and could use some more acting skills, but overall, the movie is great.",1
13,"My girlfriend and I really loved this movie. We watched it last night and we were thoroughly entertained throughout the whole movie. Critics have once again proved that their opinions are worthless to me. The plot moved along well and held my attention completely. It wasn't difficult to follow. The movie is also a visual feast and contains some incredible action scenes. The acting was good. There was even some philosophic depth to the movie that I appreciated and enjoyed. I'll write a longer, more detailed review later if I have the time. For now, suffice it to say that we were very glad we went to see this movie.",1
14,"A visually beautiful film that easily rivals any other space/sci-fi flick that I can think of. Those who claim the story is confusing didn't pay attention (I thought it was quite simple . . . ) and if you go into the film expecting anything but a fun and engaging action-packed gorgeous space opera then you probably will be disappointed, but honestly I very much enjoyed it. I can't point out any negative aspect of the film.",1
15,"The headache inducing action sequences and their clumsiness rival anything Michael Bay has done. The movie made absolutely no sense and i can see their entire budget went to visuals and costumes and none to any professional writers. Channing Tatum looks stupid, Mila Kunis is a miscast and Eddie Redmayne is embarrassing",0
16,"Over the top to the extreme, an extended visual orgasm, complete with a Royal Wedding and giant flying lizard people. Yep, that sums up ""Jupiter Ascending"". This movie was not made for the masses. I went into ""Jupiter Ascending"", with low expectations after all of the horrible reviews but I was hopeful the Wachowski's would deliver something unique. On that note I was not disappointed. (Plus the movie gets bonus points for being original—not a remake or sequel—with a beginning, middle and end.) True, the film is dopey with characters named Jupiter Jones, Caine Wise, and Stinger (a guy who lives with bees). The dialog is flat and embarrassing, framed in a fairly simple story with a few twists and turns, And yes the story is completely unbelievable, nonsensical and disjointed with two-dimensional characters, and pacing/editing that exhibits a jumpy start and stop rhythm. But dammit, this movie was FUN and a feast for the eyes! With references to Alien, Blade Runner, Brazil, Cinderella, Dune, Men in Black, Planet of the Apes, Star Wars, Fellini's Satyricon, The Wizard of Oz, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and more, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a Science fiction/ Fantasy love letter to the genre. I'd say it's comparable to Pacific Rim from a few years back, another excellent, and rather silly science fiction/action film that under-preformed at the box office. Highfaluting, half-baked philosophical crap abounds, (there even seems to be a sub-text involving the virtues of cleaning toilets and maintaining regular bowel movements???) and I enjoyed the whole banquet. ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a deliciously layered candy bar full of nuts and honey and other weird things you probably shouldn't think too hard about. It's most likely bad for you but tastes so good! I want to go back and experience the film again and see how it holds up on second viewing. Probably too weird for mainstream audiences and too dumb for the art-house crowd, ""Jupiter Ascending"" has future cult film written all over it. Time will tell.",1
17,"I don't usually review movies but I registered here just so I could review this. This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Struggled through about two thirds of it but it's totally unengaging. The main character, Jupiter Jones appeared to be played by a cardboard cutout with no character or acting ability. This movie is visually cluttered and badly scripted. Reasonable basic premise and storyline, but then it's nicked from an old science fiction story, as most of these kind of movies are. I had my misgivings from the start when I saw it was by the creators of the Matrix, yet another reworking of an old science fiction idea padded out with yawn inducing visual and action sequences.",0
18,A visual feast for your eye but leaves your brain dead. The movie started promisingly but halfway through ends up in a mess. The story just does not hold up and the conclusion wasn't satisfying at all. It looks like none of the actors are really interested; just collecting the paycheck. Watching this movie is a complete waste of time.,0
19,"This is a really bad one. The story does not engage you at any point, you know what is to happen since it is so predictable, and there is no special acting, score or unique special effects to save it. Nothing. There are a few moments when the characters interact with each other on Earth that are actually a little bit more interesting than all the crap displayed when the effects kick off. Slightly entertaining with some snacks or a few drinks.",0
20,"Okay I enjoyed this movie, the actors did a good job in their assigned roles and the special effects were great, BUT if aliens started shooting up a city on earth there is no way aliens could cover it up, be real it would be on every news channel worldwide so writers you stuffed up on that point. ALso why would aliens 90,000 years ahead of us breed humans for the elixir of life, rubbish they would make it in a testtube. AND this supergalactic empire then turns to a hitchhikers guide segment about red tape admin...HUH. The subplot with his best mate was a wasted space he should have been commanding the starship not living on a bee farm. But I liked the small amount of tension between the leads however she is supposed to be a queen wheres her battle fleet, what she queen of a territory and no army, no sense but if you put aside logic and just have action and CGI then its pretty good.",1
21,Seriously worst film I have ever seen. Thought about giving it 1 star for the pretty effects but sorry the crappy story and acting actually makes it a minus 10.,0
23,I usually get incredibly bored watching most movies. I am happy to say I really fell in love with the characters and I would watch this again in theaters. Its hard to believe all the negative reviews.,1
24,"After all the bad reviews I was pleasantly surprised with one of the most visually dazzling films I can remember.  Best use of 3-D ever!  Derivative?  Maybe.  But everything they stole the did better than the source.  Except for Eddie Redmayne (who chewed, swallowed and regurgitated the scenery) the acting was quite solid.  The basic story was simple and familiar, making it fairly easy to follow.  The real star of the show was the world-building, turning something apparently heinous into morally ambiguous, which no doubt confused and frightened a lot of moviegoers, especially critics.  See it!  It's worth every penny of your IMAX 3-D premium ticket!",1
25,"Such wonderfully imagined concepts have never been so disappointingly unrealised. Some of the cinematography is sublime, but there are many moments which are poorly executed, and the same goes for the world building and costuming.  The performances are forced and clunky, the dialogue is awful, the storyline is full of lofty ideas that are barely explored, and the entire film lacks depth, with a resolution that is thoroughly unsatisfying. A terrible let down on almost every front. 2.31/10",0
26,"This was so much better than the critics are letting on.  Its not a perfect movie by any means,  but its a ton of fun and the visuals are amazing! It has a nice passing and actions sequences are fantastic! If this would have come out last June and gone head to head with Transformers 4 it would have crushed at the box office. Its absolutely worth seeing!",1
27,"I think if you go to theater open minded,There is potential that you will love the movie.Graphic effects were excellent.The story will really suck you in to the world which is really Interesting.I really loved it and would recommend you to watch it with an open mind and i Certainly hope you are going to love the movie",1
28,"All I can say is, after I watched the movie, I felt bad at all the money they must have spent in making this.  With all that money, they could have made a fantastic movie that could have been epic. Oh well.  One of those movies I'd probably forget.  So I'm writing a review to remind myself not to watch this again in the future.",0
29,"Jupiter Ascending is intriguing, enriching and holds a world of it's own, amazingly detailed backdrops and eye candy visuals leave even the simplest of audiences excited. The interesting story comes together well, with the occasional plot hole. However the films biggest downfall is the main leads that never really feel like the fit the genre. Jupiter is a entertaining movie that cry's for a sequel that we may never see.",1
30,"The visuals knocked my socks off.  Incredible!!  The plot was alittle weak but the visual effects were riveting.I am going to see it again! I want a sequel!",1
31,"Definitely not the clusterf--k so many people are claiming it is.  But certainly no masterpiece either. Visually stunning and thankfully the plot wasn't predictable (for the most part) like so many other sci-fi's.  Could have done without the tacked on romance scheme, and the main villain is typical fare. The movie strikes a nice balance of action and story, although action sequences run a little long.  The writing and dialogue could have been better, but it's passable.  Unfortunately the movie leaves a lot unexplained, which is sad considering the plot could have been a very interesting one. All in all, an entertaining, yet flawed flick.",1
32,"I disagree with all the negative critic reviews this film seems to be attracting.  It thought it was a lot of fun with, visually spectacular set pieces, an interesting central idea, a universe that seems fully-realized and thought-out, a strong female lead, and good acting.  Only real complaint was that the chemistry could have been stronger between the leads.",1
33,"Great Space based sci-fi movie, very dynamic and immerses you in a different -unique- universe... if you let yourself  to be ""taken"" by the story and avoid holding to some details, it is an exceptional movie, with great visuals, acting and effects. I do not understand why there is so much hate for this movie by the critics... I watched it and enjoyed it very much!! So, go to see it to enjoy it, not to judge it, you will not be deceived.",1
34,"Its not the Matrix for sure but it ain't half bad either. It seems that when a movie has the critical herd against it  then people wont admit to liking it even if they do. The plot is no more ropey than Guardians of the Galaxy which was a critical success. Visually on the big screen ,its beautiful. The actors are all very competent fulfilling their roles. Character nuance isn't the objective here. Baddies are bad and Goodies are good. A homage to Terry Gilliam is included and underneath it all there is possibly a subliminal 1 percenter question re the future of genetics..or maybe I imagined that. Its Cinderella in space with the added bonus of Sean Bean, one of my favourite actors. I feel a trilogy coming on and box office seems to want it.",1
35,"This is a true space opera, in the same vein as Battlestar Galactica and the like. The CG makes the entire movie gorgeous. Mila Kunis shows that she really is a solid actress...and Channing Tatum isn't bad to look at :D The weirdest performance was that of Eddie Redmayne; it's haunting, even overly dramatic, but it's hard to forget. The story is predictable, but it's still a highly entertaining movie. The ending leaves room for some interesting sequels.",1
36,The first half hour boring but the end makes it. The idea for the base story was new und makes is interesting. Fantastic outfits and I was full flashed by the CGI and visual!,1
37,"Good flick, very entertaining. Quick pace, good acting, amazing visuals, will go see it again and will purchase when digitally released. Can't understand why it's getting blasted. It almost seems as though they're trying to persuade people not to see it in hopes it will fail. Wonder who the Wachowskis pissed off.",1
38,"""Jupiter Ascending"" 10 Scale Rating: 3.0 (Awful) ... The Good: Visually, it gets a 10 as the film is a sight to behold. The effects are top notch and the fighting scenes are well choreographed. The space battles and dog fights are also well done. Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis try really hard to make this work and neither were part of the problem. The Bad: The supporting cast was not up to the task and just about every one of them (save Sean Bean) was terrible. The villains (Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth, and Tuppence Middleton) were especially dreadful. Redmayne's performance was baffling as he's usually a very good actor. In this film, however, he was hammy and over-the-top ... and not in a good way. The story itself is weak at best, full of plot holes and infused with comedic elements that just don't work. Silly would probably describe the film's premise best. Lastly, for a regular Earth girl, Mila Kunis sure can survive a lot, making death-defying escapes, bending the laws of gravity, and ignoring simple science while doing so. With the exception of amazing effects, it was just a terrible offering all around.",0
39,"Not that it would matter much: but possible spoilers about a real spoiler. I wanted to love this movie. I did not love this movie. In fact, my 3 rating is high, due to my love for the genre and the Wachowskis. I did love Speed Racer and the Matrix, and I've enjoyed the Wachowskis other movies if not loved. Jupiter Ascending let me down in so many ways. The first half of the movie I found great. Whenever we were on Earth I was pleased. Smiling in my seat. Wowed by the special effects. When we leave Earth it all fell apart. The acting was all very well done, even Tatums. I don't care how well the digital effects are, they just do not move me in anyway. While on earth the gravity boots, the makeup, the digital effects mixed in real-world areas or sets all fantastic. The planet Jupiter was good. The rest just felt so awkward and emotionless. Maybe because we have seen this before, for many years, starting with the oft besmirched star wars. Putting the search for realistic eyes in a digital world aside the story is a complete and utter failure after we leave earth. As if they ran out of story and decided to just repeat what they did on earth in space. More of Kunis character Jupiter falling and being saved by gravity boots. Lots more. This isn't the creative repetition as with the matrix that lets us see the computer world of the matrix is being created on the fly, no this is we have completely run out of time or ideas. Have these movie directors learned nothing from the past? we could have stayed on Earth and armed Jupiter's excellent Russian family and had them fighting with slapstick humor and it would have been a hit. they could have wrote in a story about humans that know of the plot but are helping it along for the love of money. Instead we get repeated extremely lifeless set pieces that we have already seen at the beginning of this movie. So instead, we have another grand missed opportunity. And that is a shame, because no one can do this like the Wachowskis, and every failure will stop more space operas from hitting the big screen. Tisk tisk Wachowski brothers. And tisk tisk to all of your friends who obviously know nothing, or are too afraid to say anything about the course of your creations to you. The moral of the story is you don't need to own galaxies and cleaning up poop ain't so bad as long as you have a wolf-man with flying boots? Did you know you were making such a bad movie so you tried to force feed us an ideal that would let us cope?  Signed: devoted but bewildered fan. I hope you make enough to get another chance. Only because you owe us fans now, you owe us big time.",0
40,"Jupiter Ascending is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen for a long while.It quickly hooks you into the plot with its great characters, fantastic photography with gorgeous scenes, loads of action and its interesting universe. Its plot might not be too deep, but I guarantee you'll have a good time with this one.",1
41,"Move was just awful. I had really wanted to like this move but it was just BAD. It's a really shame because the visuals are amazing the possibility for a scfi epic are there., Mila Kunis looks amazing in it but acted like she was still Jackie from that 70s show. They tried so hard to get the teen crowd that they dumb ed it down so much nothing is there any longer. Channing Tatum is not my favorite actor by any means but he was decent in this and he wasn't the problem, but he looked more like a Elf then a Wolf.",0
42,"While the movie gets an ""A"" for visual effects, the overall picture was bad. George Clooney once said that he felt the most important part of the movie is the dialogue. This movie is the posture child for the reason is why he is right. The villains all same the same old threats worded in exactly the same way. ""Don't fail me again."" whispers Eddie Redmayne to his henchmen...ppplleeaasee. The acting is standard, but don't blame the acting on this one. This one dies because of bad dialogue, editing and the inability to connect with the characters. I wanted to walk out 3/4 of the way through because I honestly did not care what happened at the end. The only thing that kept me in my seat was I invested the money and time to see this stinker so I felt obligated to stick it through. I think congrats are in order the director for making  the latest version of Battlefield:Earth, only in 3D. Save your money.",0
43,"Final Fantasy, the Movie, this is it.  This has three times the filmmaking talent, skill and panache of Guardians of he Galaxy, three times as good.  The plots are very comparable in emotional affect, not in storyline.  If you liked the original Star Wars or Guardians... you'll find that style of moviemaking updated and done better here. It is indeed the sci-fi portion of Cloud Atlas made longer with much better writing and better acting.  The two male villains leads are wonderful and effective.  Mila Kunis is more than adequate. I read all the Metacritic review thumbnails before writing this.  I've re-read them again now.  I think we have again the Steven Spielberg critical backlash effect here that arises when directors make movies the public wants and loves but offer no red meat for film critics.",1
44,"This is a revolutionary scenario and universe which is quite profound, rich, but didn't turn out on the screen because of too many cut scenes. There is an introductory aspect to the movie that feels rushed and confusing, which seems to the the reflection of the state of confusion that the main character is put through. More interesting is the fact that this movie explores the theme of the origin of our species as other movie did recently, such as Prometheus, the notion that we may not be the only intelligent society in the universe. The fundamentals themes remain those of the Wachowskis, very close to the Matrix and Cloud Atlas, a quest for freedom of choice, the fight for the release from slavery, exploitation of the body and mind of Mankind to keep them in an altered state which is the result of a manipulation scheme based on the power of lies and ignorance and the moral consequence that comes from the awakening from those lies. Requires intelligence and attention from viewers that can miss the point. This is not just an action movie with lots of CG...",1
45,"The Wachowski brothers are the most creative visual artist in Hollywood. And they are also great storytellers. Maybe they not excel in all of their casting choices, but still, Jupiter Ascending is one of those films that will keep go on to achieve cult status.",1
46,"Battlefield Earth for a new generation!  Wanted to leave the cinema after the first five minutes.  **** overblown CGI  effects, unintentionally hilarious performances, camp costumes and dire dialogue make this film an absolute chore to get through.  More fantasy/kids movie than proper sci fi - avoid this one like the plague!",0
47,"Obviously awful reviews were the deterrent. I went in expecting poor pacing, a shallow story, & terrible writing yet a plethora of relevant characters, good world-building, and a landscape inviting future adventures had successfully been established; as well as the pluses eclipsing the negatives. I enjoyed some of the tech & templates coming straight out of the RPG Shadowrun w/ a less campy Flash Gordon but less serious than the Matrix execution. The identity of the movie made a bumpy ride, but it always recovered. I whole-heartedly recommend Jupiter Ascending & believe a lot of lazy or cowardly bloggers/reviewers passed on forgivable negatives like wildfire. Frame of mind is always crucial going into a movie. I think going in w/ a purpose, to enjoy a space opera, expecting the worst will allow you to enjoy Jupiter to the fullest. The mistakes made with this one should pave the way for an even better sequel, which I look forward to.",1
48,"In these reviews, I notice two main groups of people - the ones who like a story, and the ones who like the eye candy. If you only like movies that tell a good story, you shouldn't even bother going - the story is pretty simplistic. The special effects, however, were spectacular. I also definitely liked some of the things they ended up doing with the Sci-Fi and how they introduced Jupiter to the greater universe. I also enjoyed how they explained a great deal of the 'aliens' being human while still including alien races. Despite the story being somewhat simplistic, the universe has great potential for expansion though I'm not sure another movie would be a good medium for it. I'd read the book though. In all fairness, despite the former, the movie and the action scenes got a bit tedious at times, but that's not hard to work around. Solid 3.5/5 in my book",1
49,piece of **** acting...piece of garbage...piece of banana peel...piece of junk...piece of did i already say that it is a piece of ****................,0
50,"I am amazed at the negativity surrounding this movie.  Granted it is a sci-fi picture which turns off a lot of professional movie critics, but seriously, its a sci-fi space opera, and its not supposed to have enormous depth of character, or a profound story line.  Its for fun, entertainment.  I found Jupiter Ascending fun and entertaining.  As mentioned in other reviews, the visual is on overload...from the world building to the fashions.  The story is very fast moving, and in this, I wish they had spent a little more time crafting the plot and having more emotion in the acting, particularly concerning ""harvesting"" or how long should society extend life past a normal 90 years.  It would have been fun to explore more of the world, but maybe this would be better for a game, than a movie.  There's something elegant about the movie.  Maybe its the way the bees react to royalty and the elegantly crafted and thought out world building.  This is probably not a movie for everyone, but it is a fun, fun movie to watch....and then to wonder about the creative energies that went into thinking all that stuff up...",1
51,"Do you wonder what the Fifth Element would be like if it were shot today? Hallelujah, at last I do not have to choose between a film that portrays a kick-butt on-screen relationship, and good fight sequences. Mind-blowing fight choreography, battleships, dynastic politics, reincarnation, and lots of eye candy concealing a nugget of pure space gold. Female characters...talking to each other like friends?? A female protagonist who is her own person? Female hero story ... that is... fun? Thank you Wachowski siblings, managin that is a greater feat than teaching Keanu Reeves jujitsu via internet.  I implore you, dear reader, see this future cult classic in the theater while you can.",1
52,it took me several days to finish this film because I kept getting bored. What more do you need to know about it? I can't remember being this disappointed by a film. From Cloud Atlas to this claptrap??,0
53,"This movie was actually rather good - better than the recent Star Wars/Star Trek claptrap or interstellar, not as great as Ex Machina, but a nice retelling of the Cinderella Story. Great sets and graphics, an ok soundtrack, very decent writing and good performances throughout. I can't understand the negative ratings all over, I'd have been happy to have seen it in a theater.",1
54,Not as dumb (or long) as Cloud Atlas but still dumb. I would feel like an idiot describing this movie so others can do that. This film was more like a Disney movie for kids. Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
55,"OK, I knew this was gonna be a bad movie, but all I need to say is Channing Tatum is playing a rollerskating dog-man with a gun that barks when it fires.... enjoy!",0
56,"Personally it felt like a modern day Dune. There is an extremely rich universe hinted at in the story, would it expanded on. Watch this without any preconceptions.",1
57,"Interstellar..  Watch that instead and thank me later. Poor choice of cast in this left me not caring what happened.  Poorly acted,  outside of the predictable action scenes there was nothing to see here.  Move along.",0
58,"Bravo, Mr. Wachowski. You too, you unfortunate wife-of-his. You've made yet another terrible sci-fi CGI-fest, devoid of fun, likable characters, or any good lines in the script. I will say to your credit that there are some charming parts, and the cast is pretty solid. But why on Earth, for the main villain, would you reduce Eddie frickin' Redmayne, an Academy award winner, to an awkwardly-dressed brat who screams half his lines and whispers the other half!? And Mila's character is **** too, so it's not like she gets a free pass. She does nothing throughout the film other than get saved, try to get close to Mr. Wolf-eared Tatum, and clean toilets. She makes Princess Peach look like Ellen Ripley! All the other characters in this film are either left without personality or ridiculous to the point of hilarity. The lines in this movie puts the stupidity of Batman and Robin to shame. ""I love dogs.""? Really? M. Night Shyamalan is cringing at that line! Even Patrick Star can't help but cry at the sound of hearing that! Overall, it's a poorly-executed, poorly-acted, and boring attempt at cashing in on what made Star Wars so great. Too bad Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski. Maybe next movie.",0
59,My score for this movie is between a 3 and a 4. I decide to choose what I choose and stick with a 3 for now. There's obviously no way Jupiter Ascending can be this successful in movies or ever will be mentioned in any list of great movies.,0
60,"Watching the movie about 2 years after release, there's not much to be said that wasn't already said. I do want to say anyway that I'm a little sad this movie got such negative scores and reviews. While I can understand those, I still believe the movie doesn't deserve such negativity.Bottom line, I enjoyed watching the movie, and I wasn't disappointed. True, there are better ones.Jupiter Ascending has its magic, it is very visually appealing and has a wonderful and fun soundtrack. The concepts behind the movie are nice, and again, it is fun to watch and experience.The problems with Jupiter Ascending begin with a rather dull script at times, and ending with it being a blend of ideas and things we'd already seen in some other fantasy and sci-fi media. It gets worse when it also involves elements of young adult novels.Oh well.For a movie which borrows so much elements and ideas from other works it has its bits of originality, the quality of the acting swings from mediocre to pretty good (at times), and as I said before it IS visually stunning.If you are a fan of the genre, if you don't expect anything revolutionary, and if you can stand the dull sides of the story, you should definitely give it a try. It's still fun to watch, despite the downsides.",1
62,"It is movies like this that make you say ""wow, people really do have some imagination"". And that is what sci-fi should be. Yeah somethings could have been better bla bla but still, it is a huge effort and thus it is entitled to be given an effort to watch.",1
63,I don't usually write reviews for movies but after finally seeing this one I enjoyed it so much that I decided to. As someone who loves sci-fi movies I have practically seen it all but  I truly enjoyed the unique sci-fi elements that Jupiter Ascending had to offer. While many other sci-fi movies explore the nearly infinite possibilities of space and time too this one brought to viewers several important lessons that tie into those infinite possibilities.,1
64,great movie.. have watched 3 times and could watch again.  Some are giving this poor ratings but I'd love to see a part 2. The movie started off fast and kept moving on from there.,1
65,"Yet another movie with bad reviews that I have enjoyed watching. Sure, the narrative is a bit overdone, the plot does not make sense occasionally... and even then I want more! It's a nice addition to genre lately occupied mostly by DC, Marvel and other established franchises.",1
66,Tremendous Science Fiction FilmGreat MovieRegards*************************,1
68,Incredible!  From the cast to the story to the special effects to the cinematography to the costumes to the action!  It was epic and I enjoyed every minute of it.  There are very few films that can completely transport you into another world and fascinate you with every element being thrown at you.  This is one of those movies.  I can't wait for the sequel!,1
69,"A fun thrill-ride with gorgeous design, if you're a person who's okay letting imagination run wild. Is it perfect? No. But what movie is?  Did it deserve such bad reviews and derision? No. Just sit back, stop over-analyzing and enjoy it.  I have to do it with every other movie as well.",1
70,"Take a little of Cinderella, first seen cleaning toilets, add her prince or even better put in some DC Comics Superman who can’t fly--well he lost his wings--but does have floating boots that light up and help him skate all over the planetary system. Be sure to have a Lois Lane/Superman flying scene. Oh yes give this guy some pointed ears like Spock fro Star Trek and make sure he leads battle after battle after battle after battle from Star Wars Never hurts to throw in some King Lear and/or Games of Thrones. When things get too hectic slow it down--very slow--and add a nonsensical love story. Here and there give the Cinderella/toilet cleaner/alien in Chicago a wise crack which would be funny in any movie but this one. Oh yes let’s not forget to throw in some Speilberg’s E.T.s and Lucas mutants. Directors/screenwriters Lana and Andy Wachowski  seem to have their second bomb in a row, after “Cloud Atlas”, and “Jupiter Ascending” is a $175 million seemingly unrecoverable mistake. At one time special effects made a movie-goer’s jaw drop but now they have become such a part of various genres they really don’t have the effect they had and in a movie such as this where they as wall to wall and constantly repeated is almost becomes laughable if not boring. Channing Tatum showed he is a first grade actor in “”Foxcatcher” while Mila Kunis earned her drama stripes in “The Black Swan”. Sean Bean has received several acting honors in his career while Gugu Mbatha-Raw showed her versatility last year in “Belle” and “Beyond The Lights”. Here’s hoping no Oscar voters will see Eddie Redmayne in this film or they may punish him when it comes to voting! There are many supporting actors in the film who will probably forget to put this movie on their resumes which is understandable. The music is annoying and/or unforgettable while some of the costumes even Cher or Lady GaGa wouldn’t wear. One suggestion, if you feel you have to see it, see it in a movie theatre as the only thing it has going for it is the first time they show a special effect. Ending on a positive note I want a pair of  Tatum’s floating boots, that light up, so I can go air skating up to visit you!",0
71,"This goofy, likely unintentional, homage to Flash Gordon and the naive science fiction of the 30's is huge fun, not to be taken too seriously. One of the better popcorn movies you'll ever see. The story IS coherent and easy to follow, if . . . . well fun  . . .  naive. I can't imagine anyone free from preconceptions that won't have a lot of fun with this.",1
72,"Who could have thought that the Wachowski siblings could come up with an movie even worse than matrix 3? Meet Jupiter Jones, a woman everyone tries to murder .. including gravity, since most of the time she's seen falling to her death hoping to get rescued in time by her wolf boyfriend at the very last second. Yes, spend 127 minutes watching Channing Tatum save Mila Kunis from: Shooting aliens with laser guns, falling, getting abducted, forced marriage, more falling, getting abducted again, even more falling and exploding. Good thing she ends up being the ruler of earth at the end of the movie. Because her ""children"" couldn't just take earth by force using their army and space ships and turn all humans into royal jelly ... Oh wait, they do have tons of money and giant spaceships. I have no idea why people keep defending this piece of garbage: Are you really satisfied by a flimsy story as long as the rest of the movie is overloaded with cgi crap? Wow ... just wow. Rating: 1/10( 1 Point, because Sean Bean didn't die)",0
73,"What a f*freaking piece of dog crap this movie was, oh my God. This movie officially kills what career the Wachowski’s had and wastes a great cast including Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean and Oscar nominee Eddie Redmayne. We are treated to a Star Wars prequel trilogy knock off featuring as interesting dialogue as The Phantom Menace did and the same poorly written romantic dialogue from Attack of the Clones, this movie sucks.",0
74,"An embarrassment of riches!!! …and what I mean by that is that this is a film about rich people that is just an embarrassment. “Jupiter Ascending” is the latest film from the Wachowskis and, despite what you read about their under-rated previous efforts (“Speed Racer,” “Cloud Atlas”), this one truly is….utter disaster. Remember when Hollywood seemed to start putting effects ahead of stories and starting insulting the viewers intelligence until some directors (read: Cameron, Nolan) started injecting mindblowing effects into incredibly intelligent stories. Well, guess who is insulting our intelligence again. What this movie is “about,” and I use the term loosely, is a young woman in Chicago who cleans toilets for a living who finds out she is actually a genetic descendant of the most powerful dynasty in the universe and simply needs to claim Earth as her own, which she left to herself thousands of years prior, before her “son” harvests humans to make a potion that keeps other beings in the universe young. You got that?  No? Who cares. The entire film is completely about special effects and scene after scene that shows elements ripped off directly from any one of the Star Wars films.  It is clear the entire film was thought of from the perceptive of “how could we get this cool scene in the film?” with very little focus on a story that is chronologically and logistically ridiculous. Case in point: Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis, in the span of about 24 hours, finds out that aliens exist, that she is galactic royalty impervious to the sting of bees and survives the most ridiculously unlikely air-chase ever shown on screen without a seat belt….without even batting an eyelash or one moment of hyperventilating.  I mean, I think most of us would freak out to actually meet an alien, first and foremost…even a muscular, hot one in the form of Channing Tatum…never mind the rest of what was thrown at her.  Yet, she takes it in stride, like it is completely normal. Absurd. Truly, the entire narrative rolls out like this…with space, time and basic logic (and gravity) being completely ignored in the development of a story so completely ridiculous, Oscar-front-runner Eddie Redmayne must be crying himself to sleep for accepting to be a part of this and giving such a silly performance.  In June 2014, when this film's release was pushed back by almost seven months from July 2014 to February 2015, what they should have done was rewritten the script. On the upside, the film is visually stunning, and they certainly used 3D technology to their advantage, not to mention that Tatum’s extended shirtless scene is, indeed, very entertaining while I don’t think I have ever seen Mila Kunis look so beautiful.  Unfortunately, she is at her best when she is dressed to the nines as a total rip off of Padmé.",0
75,I thought this was a very good movie. A bit slow on the action at times but it wasn't overly dramatic like the Superman movies. As I read these other lists of high metacritic scores I realize that people nowadays prefer the emotional baggage of the more dramatic movies. This one and many others like it that I would watch again get low scores but the mellodramatic or dramatic movies get high ratings. Makes you wonder just who is voting on these shows.,1
76,"The movie was worth the wait. The effects are stunning, the premise is compelling and I shed a few tears at the beginning.  The only thing I didn't like was the CGI aliens, they should have stuck with the cool cyberpunk look they had with the bounty hunter trio.",1
82,"Jupiter Ascending was the most FUN I have had at a movie in years. Spectacular visuals and an interesting contemporary heroic myth. While I did find the story was a little hard to follow at times and some of the action scenes where just plain dizzying, the overall experience for me was exhilarating and inspiring. I left the movie feeling a special kind of inspiration that I only experience after really great films. This movie is lot like a roller coaster and I understand that some people just don't like this kind of thing. However, I also think that many people are being overly critical of this movie simply because the Wachowski created it.  Expectation's were perhaps a little to high for some and others simply don't get or appreciate this type of art. Regardless, if you enjoy imaginative sci-fi, amazing special effects, and over the top action this flick will deliver.",1
83,"CRAP! CRAP! AND MORE CRAP!!! America is so starved of ideas for movies is just not funny anymore! Ok lets see what we can mix here for style oh - roman mixed with 1920's egyptian with a bit of trash modern try hard and space theme LOL, and then you shove it down our throats and make us pay money!! No wonder people aren't going to the movies anymore. Save your money folks",0
84,"You are at risk of insanity or terminal tedium! Do not go to see the film ""Jupiter Ascending"".  Whatever anyone says this is the most banal, badly scripted film I have ever seen.  You may loose the will to live if you sit through more than 45 minutes of this unadulterated bilge.  Any film where a master of the universe (even if he is currently up for an Oscar in ""The Theory of Everything"") comes up with the line ""My mother never cleaned a toilet in her entire life"" and a dinosaur says ""ooh you hurt me....."" is beyond parody. The lines are delivered in a drawl with some of the worst diction I have ever heard. This film is an excrescence, go see it at your peril!",0
85,"I wait for this movie since a year and a half, the premise of being a masterpiece. I saw it in IMAX 3D to maximize the experience and I'm not disappointed. This is a great movie, with a good storie, a lot of actions' scenes and specials' effects never seen before, original and graphically beautiful.",1
86,"Really very stunning. Easy to follow, the plot and story are NOT hard to follow. The FX are incredible. I was indeed on the edge of my seat most f the movie.",1
87,"All you need to know is that there is a wolf-man Channing Tatum clumsily floating around Chicago with his gravity roller-skates. Did he just grind that fire-escape railing? Oh yes, he did. Go see this movie NOW before it is gone. Be sure, this movie is an awful, horrendous, shameful, abomination, wreck of a movie, but you need to experience it yourself. It is like a mad-libbed collage supercut of twenty or so moderately famous sci-fi movies. Yes, it is so bad that it is good again.",0
90,"If you enjoy slamming your hand in a door, like many in our so skewed culture, then . . . THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU! That's correct, this movie is actually enjoyable, while still exuding thoughtfulness and depth. Incredibly good movie! A must own in fact!",1
98,"I loved this movie! I can't remember being this blown away since I sawthe original Star Wars. This is a stunning film - visually it'sbreathtaking, in my opinion it represents the future of movie specialeffects, in its own way it's as technologically mind-blowing as StarWars was - but also I loved the story and the characters. I wassurprised because I didn't like the Matrix film, I thought it was darkand devoid of emotions. But with Jupiter, the Wachowskis have climbedup to a whole new level. It's funny, engaging, surprising. I likedspending time with the good guys, and truly hated the bad guys at alevel that I don't usually feel in a film; that's what I mean byengaging. These were people I really wanted to spend time with and Iwas sad when it ended. It knew what kind of story it was (spaceadventure) and it really delivered. My wife said, ""This is the kind ofmovie you have to see on the big screen."" Yeah, she's right. It's whatmakes going to the movies great; it won't translate onto a small TVscreen. I can't figure out why some people are bashing this movie. It'sabsolutely terrific at every level. I can't say enough good thingsabout it. As I was walking out of the theater I immediately texted mykids and friends and told them to go see Jupiter. It's unusual that Irave this much about a movie. Go see it. You'll be glad you did. (Justin case you think this was a canned fake paid for review, I clobbered amovie last week that I absolutely hated, The Kingsman, which I foundoffensive. It's basically a zombie movie falsely advertised as a JamesBond movie. NOT. The Kingsman is disgusting and over-the-top violent.Yech! So now you know I don't write glowing reviews about every movie Isee.) Anyway, rush out and see Jupiter Ascending before itleaves theaters. I hope you'll love it as much as we did.",1
99,"What should you find in a blockbuster? Well in my opinion you should look at visuals and plot. This movie recieves 10 and 6 respectively. But it is a definite must see and this is why. Critics will ban it for it's plot problems but if you're not taking notes like them and enjoying the movie, you'll be so blown off that you won't see those problems. Just a clue at how the wachowskis excelled at building this fictional universe: You could spin off entire TV series out of and it could potentially turn out like a stargate franchise",1
100,"Beautiful but tedious. Q. How many chase/fight scenes can one movie sustain?A. 3 less than the number in Jupiter Ascending. It's pretty and I liked the universe they created. It is the actiony bits that drag down the film. It's like a simple pound cake with 3 feet of icing on top - I really liked the cake but was sick to death of the icing by the time I got done.",1
101,"This movie was a giant, floating turd in the punchbowl of my otherwise wonderful day off. I got a nap this morning. Ate sushi for lunch. Had some wonderful physical relations with my wife. And was hoping that my day would only get better by watching this movie. Well, fate is a cruel bastard, and after spending no less than $7 on a matinee ticket, I soon found myself giggling at the ridiculous fish-lipped villain and his whispery ways. The movie was so incredibly predictable that during the times that I closed my eyes for an unnecessarily long blink, I used my psychic powers to tell me what would happen next. They threw in some scenes of things breaking for no reason other than to add obstacles for Mila to jump and dodge. Well, now I'm home trying to salvage this weekend and stretch out time in hopes of getting back the 2+ hours of my life that I wasted. If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, DON'T!  You'd be better off getting a colonoscopy from your neighborhood crack dealer.",0
102,"excellent! seen it three times. watching it again, now. so excuse me... ",1
103,"this film is one overlong mess that throws tons of plots at you but goes Absloutly Nowhere with any of them. it feels like this films universe needs to be expanded but theres no comics, video games or short films to expand on the mythos so as a result it comes off as incomplete. the characters are not great especially Mila Kunis character who does absolutely nothing and expects Channing Tatum to come rescue her and the dialogue is insipid. Eddie Redmayne gives the least subtle performance of his career and the 3D was only really worth it in the last 30 minutes and even then it highlighted how much the film is relying on CGI. i will say i enjoyed Sean Bean's performance but his usefulness is very sporadic and i really think the Wachowskis should have only directed this film and handed over the screenplay to another writer because they haven't been on form for a while. as the film stands it's just bad and i really don't want a sequel to be made",0
106,"Terrible movie!!!  Beautiful visuals (which is why I gave it a 3) but such a stupid story, and ridiculously naive behavior by our heroine - who does nothing smart with her new found power throughout the entire movie!  (All she does is wonder where her boyfriend is.  Ughhhhhhhhhh.)  Maybe the story will appeal to pre-teens but any adult will find this story simplistic, ridiculous and lame.  A space-age Cinderella story with a twist:  she happily goes back to cleaning toilets at the end!  Oh, but she has her booooooooofriend, so I guess all is well with the universe.  OMG - SO LAME!!!  I can barely believe they did the Matrix series after seeing that horrible movie!",0
108,"If you want old school classic science fiction, with modern special effects, look no further.  This is a great film with many thought provoking themes.  Chief among them are the ideas that a vastly superior technological culture works behind the scenes to control society, and that we are just like cattle to them,  ripe for exploitation. On top of this you have a classic fairy tale theme of a commoner who becomes a princess and then a damsel in distress, who needs a knight to save her. The battle scenes are like beautiful choreographed dances.  It was very impressing and engaging. Most of the harsh critics appear to be your typical product of government controlled education,  with little to no imagination,  who've never considered that the world is bigger than the Kardashians or who won last Sunday's football game.  Either that or they are the usual psychotic Marxist, jaded professional critic, for whom life's primary purpose is to suffer, and experience mental anguish.",1
109,"It would be proof that the best visual effects and production value money can buy don't make a good movie except that even the visuals are nothing so great we haven't all seen before ad nauseum.  Creatively it's all tired recycled elements adding up to one hell of an excruciating bore with dire little skill in story-telling.And it does once and for all prove that this one hit wonder filmmaking team was exactly that.",0
112,"I was looking forward to this movie really bad but was hardly dissapointed throughout the movie. The ONLY positive thing about this movie are the special effects but thats where it ends. The storytelling was really awful and it was the first time in my life I wanted my money back after a movie. I felt betrayed and made fun of. How can they even allow this kind of BS. Gosh, it makes me angry.",0
113,"Fight scenes too long, over exaggerated explosions, some good moments but mostly corny/cliché with bad puns and dry humour. Channing Tatum looked extremely gormless throughout the movie as if he hadn't slept for several days. Designs for set/ships etc looked like Asgard on steroids, costumes were alright at times yet could have been taken form the Hunger Games/Divergent. Soundtrack was trying too hard to be Howard Shore at times and was quite bland and lacked intensity at key points. CGI was probably done on Google Sketchup. The main antagonist was really **** annoying and needed a drink of water and anger management. Story line made relatively no sense and was hard to follow and could have been changed halfway through the actual filming. Sean Bean really likes bees. Unnecessary giant lizards.",0
114,"I saw a 4DX showing of this film and thought it was AMAZING! I'd give the film an 8 as I enjoyed the story and the film as a whole much better than I was expecting, and an extra 2 points for the 4DX effects - 3D, wind, water, moving seats, smoke and smells. I thought it would be gimmicky but it was fantastic fun and really added something to the film. I'd definitely go and see it again. IMO is was as good as Star Wars 1-3, not epic but a decent movie and not nearly as bad as the critics and some reviewers made it out to be.",1
115,"The critics were right about this movie.  It failed on every level.  Poor dialogue, poor story telling, dull music, boring fighting action scenes, boring action sequences and dull characters.  I struggled to get to the end and the only entertainment I got from this film was joking about how bad it was with my friends.   It was a complete waste of money and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this film. The Wachowski siblings let me down big time on this film.  The story had some potential but they failed to make it interesting and I think the film deserves to flop.",0
116,"I gave it one point for the special effects.  But I am very sorry that such DGI effects talent went to a movie that didn´t deserve the effort.  I am struggling to find some redeeming feature in this film, but I am am very sorry to report that I can´t find anything at all.  Despite all its special effects, I am sorry to say that it is one of the weakest film I remember seeing.  And I am a science fiction fan, who enjoys almost all science fiction movies.  Not this one.",0
119,"Jupiter Ascending has some of the most beautiful space sequences in any film I have ever seen. Tragically, it is like that hot girl who can barely string together a coherent sentence. It gets a 3 for the beauty, but everything else is irreparably bad. The CGI orgy on the screen every five seconds made it look like a Michael Bay film and the subject matter reminded me of Star Wars if they removed everything that made those films good. The dialogue is cringeworthy throughout and absolutely brain dead moronic. The acting is somehow worse than the dialogue with Eddie Redmayne truly stealing the show. Wow was he horrific. He was the conductor of this massive train crash and he went full speed ahead on that crazy train. What may be the worst feature of the film is that it is two hours yet feels like it was ten hours. It was never truly slow, but just dragged on and on and never seemed to end. An incredibly stupid film that should have been killed humanely before it ever had $175 million spent on its production, Jupiter Ascending is impressively bad.",0
121,"There is no defending this film, it was BAD. I usually like Warchowski's films, even the bad ones, but this movie is an expensive waste of talent. While watching this mess all I could think to myself was all the starving people in the world and a hundred million dollars was wasted on this movie.",0
123,"You will never be so bored to watch $176 million burn, nor for less reason. How does the bad guy die? I didn't see that bit: partway through the action climax I pitched my 3D glasses at the screen and walked. 2 points for the art team, who did a great job with the brief 'just go nuts'.",0
124,"JUPITER ASCENDING couldn't be more banal, useless, and dull. But it is colorful. It's amazing how these 2 filmmakers can drain the live out of anything, even such personable leads. But again. lots of color.",0
125,"One of the worst movies of 2014-2015. Poor story, poor acting, only giving it a one for the gorgeous special effects. 90% of the movie was CGI, but the CGI was good. About the plot, it was repetitive, made little sense, and it looked like it was written by a 10 year old boy after it played Final Fantasy all day.Spend your money on toilet paper or something equally useful instead of spending this on this CGI bomb.",0
128,"This movie was surprisingly horrible. I can understand now why it was delayed 2 years in releasing. Though, I would think after 2 years they would have done much better at trying to improve it. The best thing about JA was the trailer. I gave it a 1 rather than a zero, as the special effects were very good.",0
132,this movie was a sad attempt to refresh the old theme of the movie Dune. Poor story plot due to trying to put a trilogy premise condensed into 2 wasted hours. the ending was completely horrible and did not even remotely fit the plot of the movie,0
134,"I was greatly anticipating a new Wachowski movie and went into the theater ready to love it. Unfortunately, what they spent on flashy digital graphics they should have spent on a script doctor. The acting (with the exception of Mila Kunis) is so-so at best... but we can't really blame the cast with such a flimsy plot and script to work with. The movie is a pretense to pandering ""fan-service""- randomly thrown together things from other genres to try and please multiple audiences. This movie was genuinely terrible and a waste of my money. Refund, please.",0
135,Here is my tip to Directors...Please don't make something seem big and cool like Jupiter when I can barely get past the beginning changing scene with Kunis and her girlfriend....and then you did a close up of Smitten Kunis and i was like......show me an futuristic structure...never watched anymore after that,0
136,"This movie was actually painful to watch, and I kicked myself for not leaving early. They blew their $$ on special effects, and forgot to invest in a plot of any substance. I'm an avid science fiction fan, but I could not give this one a passing score. Anyone who gave this a positive score must have been high, drunk, or both (which actually would have bumped my score up by one).",0
138,"This is one of those movies made for watching just once. It numbs you with effects, great sound, great visuals. But the most you watch it, the most you hate it. Probably will be a cult movie in 30 years.",0
139,"I heard someone say this movie ""ain't half bad."" Well, it ain't half good either. Aside from some eye candy- the effects and the actors, [spoiler alert] this show blows.",0
141,"Sorry, 15-mins in and I can't endure any more. What is wrong with the W'skis?! The Matrix trilogy was it for them?! When you're crafting a two-hour epic like ""Jupiter Ascending"" you better write the hell out of the first 10 or 15 minutes to ensure the audience has a reason to pay attention further - Screenwriting 101 people! Instead, we get a bunch of pregnant scenery, birthing on a steamship, action scenes that make no sense, girls talking of true love, and Mila Kunis not even trying to modulate her voice to anything other than ""Meg"" from ""Family Guy""! With those types of disaster markings in the first 15-mins, why, why, would I watch for another 2-hrs?! This surely must've been written for pre-teen girls, gee thanks, W'skis. Fail fast and fail often works in software development, not film-making.",0
142,"The visuals can't cover up how atrocious this movie is. It is so stupid and ludicrous. Above of all though, it is incomprehensible. I feel embarrassed for everyone involved, especially for the people on screen, because the acting is horrible.",0
146,"One liner, somewhat richer, but only a decent entertainer. A sci-fantasy directed by the Wachowskis of 'The Matrix' fame. Theirs lowest point ever as the filmmakers, but still not that bad flick. The movie lacked in many areas, and one of those is failing to have at least one stunning fight/war scene. I know it was only the beginning and there will be a sequel, maybe ends as a trilogy, but the story was very weak for an intro movie. Looks like one-liner, precisely to say kind of similar to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. I mean in a thin idea, the whole story takes place. Something like a space expedition for a chosen one, hopping from a planet to planet, seeking answers and protection. The title character, Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis, with the help of the Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) takes a risky venture when their lives were threatened. Finding who's behind and other truth brings the end of the narration, which runs for just over a 2 hour. Performances were okay, but kind of doubt their inclusion in the project. Mostly the cast was the younger ones, maybe except, Sean Bean. Many of them are only the recently emerged stars. So it was a big responsibility in a big budget movie and they did it. But the movie should have had at least one senior artist. The graphics were somewhat rich, and again the absence of the quality scenes and stunts lets the movie fall. 6½/10",1
147,"Boring, so boring. First a few things, Mila Kunis can't act, visuals can't make up for lack of an interesting story, a person talking softly to make them seem like more of a bad guy doesn't work. This movie was tough to get through, I nodded off at parts especially when they were talking so softly it's like they were being nice enough to talk soft so you could fall asleep easier. Also with all the info Jupiter is given about her life she doesn't seem to reACT the way you'd expect an everyday person would. If you're a big Channing Tatum fan he's shirtless at some parts, but he's just as bad an actor as Kunis. The only thing this movie has going for it is it's visuals and even they aren't  that great. If you like these two ""actors"" pick another movie with them in it. Jupiter Ascending should be descending into a bargain bin near you.",0
148,"Film immaginifico e visivamente molto bello, come da buone abitudini dei fratelli Wachowski.Sempre come da vecchie abitudini, il film ha diversi livelli di lettura, di cui il primo, il più facilmente decifrabile, corrispondente al normale linguaggio umano, è apparentemente rivolto ad un pubblico adolescenziale.Come prevedibile, la maggior parte della critica e dei comuni spettatori che per inadeguatezza si sono fermati al primo livello, ne hanno decretato con furore la stroncatura totale. Il furore è di certo indizio sui reali motivi della stroncatura, ma questo è il mondo di oggi...Gli appassionati di fantascienza di vecchia data troveranno miriadi di piacevoli citazioni ed omaggi all'epoca d'oro della fantascienza.",1
149,"Less than mediocre. Not for adults - perhaps teens, perhaps. No emotional weight of any kind. Main characters are irritating, if not unbearable.I can barely finish writing this review. Writing it reminds me of the film!",0
151,"An ambitious, delightful, mess. I watched this after the latest sloppy installment of Star Wars, and Jupiter Ascending is so much more fun and heartfelt.",1
152,"This was almost completely awful, save for a decent action scene towards the end. The casting is off: Mila Kunis seems bored trying to bring life to this dreck, while Channing Tatum is some awful futuristic elf-angel thing. The plot doesn't make sense, either. Jupiter is the ""chosen one"", but does nothing relatively close to what a saviour should be doing. Instead, she and Tatum fly around and do some random space junk I can hardly remember. Stay away from this junk as if your life depends on it, and don't feed any more of the Wachowskis' awful garbage.",0
153,"Cinema-goers need a fresh movie from the makers of  the 'Matrix' films, but this movie isn't for them they don't need to see the Wachowskis new blockbuster ""Jupiter Ascending."" If ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" were here they would of saved Jupiter Ascending's cheesy dialogue and it's unnecessary soap opera, we might of had a great film (almost). Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) was born under the signs that predicated her future greatness, but in reality she cleans people's houses and cleans toilets also wants endless breaks. Every single morning when her alarm clock goes off at  4:54, in the morning she says ""I hate my life"" before she spends her day scrubbing the toilets. Jupiter  doesn't know that she holds mankind's future in her hands she does not realize it yet. Caine (Channing Tatum) a genetically engineered hunter with the DNA of half-wolf and half-man, who arrives on earth to locate Jupiter, making her aware that destiny awaits her: Jupiter's genetic signature marks her next in line, extraordinary inheritance that could alter her the balance of the cosmos. The coolest scene ever in Jupiter Ascending which Caine has super cool boots my favorite scene. There are three heirs to the Abrasax industries dynasty, Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) tries to befriend Jupiter because Jupiter she has the key to an eternal life for Kalique; Titus (Douglas Booth) who wants Jupiter to marry him, so that he could kill her and take her inheritance away from Jupiter. Balem (Eddie Redmayne) wants Jupiter dead dead dead and now. The villain in this movie isn't really all that important or strong also the greatest in movie history, Eddie Redmayne who's a talented actor could give such a terrible performance he sounds like a British woman. Channing Tatum was missed cast and so was Kunis, obviously better actors could of have been in this B-movie. Mediocre movies have copied of the Wachowskis ""Matrix"" films, well this is a mediocre movie! Well even the makers of ""Matrix"" are copying of it, their also copying off of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"". If there's one thing The Wachowskis can achieve in their sc-fi blockbusters is create beauteous special effects and the art of an action scene. The score by Michael Giacchino is perfect and is elegant. Grade B-",1

156,"I loved it. Until I read the other reviews I didn't even make the Cinderella connection but yes! It was visually amazing, the story was lovely, there were funny scene, I was pleasantly surprised as I had fallen victim to the negative reviews that had painted it as trash and ""don't bother watching"". I mean, come on, the girl kicked butt while never messing her make up, Mr. Wise got his wings back, and they got to fly together. I was so pleasantly surprised, I'm with the other guy, I wished I had seen it at the theater.  I really had fun watching it, and it even had a fun lovely ending.",1
158,"Not sure what exactly the Wachowski's were trying to achieve with this movie.The idea is interesting, the casting is poor, the script weak and the delivery is woeful. Some nice special effects though!Not the usual standard expected. The Wachowski's appear to be attempting to dumb-down their accessibility and where this definitely succeeds in that respect, the overall package falls considerably short.",0
160,"It's weird... because at the same time that visually Jupiter Ascending is amazing, the story have huge gaps on it.I really don't blame the actors or the visual effects crew, but this universe was created so big, that even if they wanted to explain everything in three movies it would be complicated...Another thing is that if she is soooo bad ass as the story's tell us, why did she left billions of people die even after saving earth????? The killings continue, deaths continues, the life market continues... Good job Majesty !!!!!",1
162,"Such a shame, a damn shame. While the whole back-story of the Abrasax family, their business, the alien culture, rulers of space part was COMPLETELY ignored, we at least got to see Sean Bean not die. Considering the horrible character he was handed, he did what he could. That could be said about all the actors who were literally lost in the plot and could not establish a connection with the other characters. I don't blame the actors though, truly, they did what they could, but there was no substance, no story line, no anything besides visual effects. This movie had the potential to be amazing, a possible franchise but nothing of value was even hinted at. The origins of humanity (which is not Earth), the royal families in space, the type of businesses, Jupiter's past and inheritance, the Abrasax kids and the rivals in the industry.....nothing, nothing related to that.....Sweet lord, this could have been amazing. Not to mention, that the dialogue was mediocre, the technology they presented was brushed off with no insight and Tatum is some kind of human-doggy with the emotional range of a pissed off Edward Cullen. While, of course, Mila Kunis is there to be pretty, not breaking a sweat at the fact that she discovered in a matter of hours that she owns half the universe, her identity is uncommon, she jumps off of buildings, gets used very fast with talking lizards and alien tech. By no means would she freak out about, well, anything. Her job is to look pretty in alien couture and hit on Tatum's canine charms. God this was a mess. oh yeah....there was a faint hint of incest too.",0

La premisa es interesante, si no vamos a negarlo, puede salir un space opera interesante, pero estando detrás esos dos putos inútiles en el guión y en la dirección, la cosa no va bien. Primero empezamos con que la película carece de un trasfondo digno o bien desarrollado, porque estos señores en vez de hacerte un pequeño prólogo o cualquier recurso útil, para ponerte en situación de lo que esta sucediendo, lo dan todo por hecho, como si conociésemos a la familia Abraxas, que hay corporaciones intergalácticas, o la Egira, como si fuese Star Wars, que todo el mundo por cultura popular lo conoce o ha oído de ello, cuando esto ha salido de sus absurdas y ridículas cabezas. Luego tenemos que el desarrollo de la película, es un puto caos integral, pasan cosas en la historia que son relevantes, y dan igual, te la suda  lo que suceda, no hay tensión, no hay emoción, no hay nada, es una película vacía, sin alma, añadiendo además la confusión que sufres al ver que no te cuentan nada claro del trasfondo, que provoca al espectador que ni le prestes atención  o interés al film, porque la misma pelicula ni siquiera se digna en explicártelo, sino en darlo todo por hecho, porque presuntamente lo conocemos. Después las escenas de acción, los tíos cutres UTILIZAN LA MISMA SECUENCIA DE ACCIÓN TODO EL PUTO TIEMPO,  que es el Chanim Tatum haciendo piruetas con sus patines mágicos y encima terrorificamente mal filmado, Matrix estaba soberbiamente bien filmada, ¿que pasa?

164,"A young immigrant domestic cleaner’s life on Earth is shattered when she is discovered as the heir apparent to a dynasty of intergalactic landowners and planet harvesters, only to be pursued by the tyrannical head of the family whom she is determined to fight with the help of a genetically engineered super-soldier. Writers/Directors The Wachowskis (The Matrix, Cloud Atlas) bring their action-packed “space-opera” to the big screen in a film that’s been described as a cross-between The Matrix and Star Wars, we could not think of a more unmerited comparison. Sure you can expect all the action and effects that $175million will buy and some impressive visuals as well, but even there some of the effects are decidedly sub-standard and a couple of the entirely-CG characters are borderline laughable. In the aspects that all films are ultimately judged on, story & characters, Jupiter Ascending leaves a lot to be desired, the plot is fantastical and original while somehow managing to be completely predictable and is ill-served by character performances that are at times reminiscent of a 1950s B-Movie. There may be a parable in there about capitalism and the exploitation of the common by the powerful but that will be lost in all the explosions and laser-fire, ultimately it’s a journey of characters that you don’t care about and you know what will happen to from the beginning. Clearly the The Wachowskis have not lost the ability to dream big but with every film since The Matrix there must be a question about their ability to deliver on the promise, we can’t help but think they would be perfectly suited to writing for the many young visionary directors currently out there. We realize how difficult it must be to make major motion-pictures and obviously no one sets out to make a bad one but we can’t think of many redeeming qualities in Jupiter Ascending, this is not one of those films so bad that they’re good, it’s just quite bad. We suspect Jupiter Ascending will be confined to the vault where films like Battlefield Earth reside, all action and no substance, this is one of those films you should probably only check-out on a flight.",0
165,"n a word - nonsense. The heroine of a fool, a lot of actors who practically do not emit emotion , one actor who overdid it and finally - Ball freaks. Of the benefits of some special effects .",0
166,"Even 'Bit' from Tron showed more emotions than any single character in this movie. As a Sci-Fi fan I really was looking forward to this movie. And was then ending up fast-forwarding while watching, since after the 4th abduction from yet another (un-introduced) party I could not take it anymore. Why should I care, what is the story? The lone Lycantrop for rescue story is just absurd, I never got the impression he is different than any other soldier, they should have send Jason Bourne instead. Finally, just because our main character, the queen, is cleaning toilets this does not make her a good person, sorry! Good persons are defined by actions they take during the movie, and there was none of it, she just was captured a zillion times and then decided not to slaughter all humans on earth. I get more emotional if my hairdresser tells me from her family weekend, the immersion level for this movie is really zero.Bottom line: While visually appealing am I still surprised how little emotional attachment there is with any of the personalities in this movie. Looks like a visual effect hardware manufacturer wrote the script. It seems characters have no personality at all, are just there for hoping unmotivated into the next visual scene as a cursor pointing the way. It is yet another pancake movie, painted nicely, but as flat as it gets.",0
167,"I really expected more from the Wachowskis, moreso now that I've seen their Netflix series, Sense8, both of which came out in 2015. There is one good thing about this movie: the sfx, which raise the fx bar ever higher. Stunning is not even the right word for it. I enjoyed seeing Mila Kunis  in a starring role, but not...here. Even as a pure action movie, it fails. As sci-fi, it is derivative to the point of almost being as funny as some of the characters (and not in a good way). I am a Wachowskis' fan but just don't get that they did this big box kind of movie...after the brilliant and subtle Cloud Atlas?  Only gave it a generous 1 for the fx.",0
169,"Well, the Wachowski's prove one more that The Matrix was their ONLY GOOD FILM! Seriously, this movie is utter swill. Most of the movie is just people talking. And its not that having a lot of talking in a film makes it bad, but this was promised to be a summer blockbuster, not a drab borefest. Not worth the price of admission.",0

175,"Dear Jupiter Ascending, I am writing to you to drop my average film score. Do you remember when we met? It was in a lonely place, an alone-in-a-cold-dark-room-at-3am place, Google results on scifi action film I hadn’t seen showing 0. I tried to respect your ambition, but you kept talking about how The Chronicles of Riddick was really cool, but how you wanted to be more than that. Oh? Do you remember how The Chronicles of Riddick looked in the mirror and was like “oh **** too far” and then turned itself back into Pitch Black? Can you do that for me, Jupiter Ascending? Can you use one of your plotholes to go back in time to that night and change yourself into Pitch Black for me? No? You still have ambition? Fine, you want to make the world a better place then instead take all of that money you spent to make yourself and give Channing Tatum a temp job going around being charming and giving out hugs. Can you imagine that world? Channing Tatum charm and hugs for everyone and no Jupiter Ascending. Holy **** That. World. No you were not my worst, but you did ooze viscous mediocrity the whole time. It took three showers and an episode of Firefly to get me right. Dear Jupiter Ascending, please do not make a sequel to yourself unless it is Jupiter Recanting: Pitch Black 3, or Jupiter Is Sorry About Before Presents: Magic Mike World Tour.",0

182,"Very solid movie and history  from the Wachowski sisters. Don't listen to the haters who didn't understand most of the plot, it's true 1-2 things could be different in order to give the movie more solid argument, but the point of the story and the villains are great. Hope they make a sequel. See first before you make an opinion about it.",1
183,"Visually spectacular, with a well executed score, the art direction and production values are excellent, but its crime is the weak history and the main character, it is clear that the Wachowskis should have taken the 6 months of delay to focus on the script instead of the visuals, it is clear that after this debacle it will cost them to get back a budget of this sort.",0
