0,"I don't understand why this movie gets bashed so much because it's ""overrated."" So what? Pretend as though you never heard anyone say how good this film is, then watch it, and then talk to me. And don't even get me started on people saying, ""People like it just because Heath Ledger died!"" Again, pretend as though he didn't die, watch his performance again, and then come talk to me. An outstanding performance by anyone who was ever involved in this film.",1
1,"This super hero movie is a rare film that drills deep inside the character and the script more than the action. It may be boring to a few people who despise waiting for 2 hrs; However I promise you, Heath Ledger will keep you amazed the whole time. Ultimately, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterpiece, a film that doesn't just show off the visuals and action, but understands what deep pains and afflictions a superhero suffers.",1
2,"""The Dark Knight"" is proof that Chris Nolan saved the Batman saga. this is literally the best Batman movie we ever had in years! from the mind-blowing action, to the incredible acting, fantastic characters, strong script, layers of character depth and development, epic music, awesome special effects... i can't see anything wrong with ""The Dark Knight"". cause everything's the work of art, of a person who knows how to do the Batman saga justice. it's like if Christopher Nolan was like ""Outta the way, **** It's my turn now"". and he saved Batman, he brought Batman back to life again, and i thank him so much for that. also, Heath Ledger as the Joker: a phenomenon! other actors can try, but nobody's ever gonna top Heath Ledger's Joker. and Christopher Nolan still stays as one of the best directors we've ever had. ""The Dark Knight"" is a phenomenon!",1
3,"THE BEST MOVIE EVER! I just have to say that this movies are awesome, and so is Christopher Nolan. He's never failed us and he has made five movies and I bet all of them are possible contenders for best movie ever. So anyways, I liked how Rachel just gives up on Bruce for Harvey Dent, whom everyone deems ""The Better Man"" or ""The White Knight"". I also loved how the Joker is just psycho and he doesn't care for anything except bombs, gasoline, and crime. I believe he is just out there to prove a point. That even Gotham's best can fall. He even nearly completed his plan by corrupting Harvey but Batman/Bruce took the blame. I love how, in the end, Harvey's gun is pointed at the men ""responsible"" for Rachel's death (Batman, Gordon, himself) and how his mind is just twisted into thinking that they were actually responsible. I think Heath Ledger gave an excellent performance, all out, although it hasn't  turned out for the best. I'm sure we'd all prefer that this was never made or was never as good for the sake of Heath Ledger but, you got to admit, this is just such a good movie.",1
4,One of my favorite movies as a huge batman fan I couldn't be happier. The joker was easily the best done joker ever. Can't give this movie enough praise and can't wait for the next.,1
5,"The Dark Knight dares to be more than it should be. It transcends the barriers of being labelled a ""Batman movie"" or ""superhero movie"" by excelling in all areas: character, plot, action, writing, acting, directing. The Dark Knight is not  for fans of Batman or fans of serious drama. It is a film for everyone and stands as one of the most important films of the decade.",1
6,"Continuing from where Batman Begins ended peerless director Christopher Nolan reunites with Christian Bale for the continuing story of The Dark Knight. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman sets out to put a halt to the criminal activity that plagues Gotham City. Just as everything seems to be going their way the peace is shattered by a criminal mastermind known as The Joker. Batman may be on the DVD cover but this is really The Jokers movie. Following the death of Heath Ledger prior to the movies release there was huge hype regarding his performance and he certainly delivers. His portrayal is a far cry from the camp 1960s iteration and as creepy and disturbing as any villain in cinema history. Running at about two and a half hours in length The Dark Knight needed a worthwhile plot to go with the high quality action scenes and on this count the movie again doesn't fail featuring plenty of twists and surprises. The Dark Knight is without doubt the best super hero movie of all time.",1
7,"Regular readers of this blog know that I don't like super heroes, but Batman is the exception. As a kid he was the only one I thought was cool and the only one that i felt could be real. Apparently Christopher Nolan has the same idea. What I love about his take on Batman is that it's very realistic. Even the joker, as out there as he maybe, was a much more believable and realistic villain than the portrait by Jack Nicholson. As for the movie, it's an amazing story, with one of the best performances ever, by the late Heath Ledger who I really couldn't stand until this movie! As with all Nolan movies, it's a very visually appealing film, with a great story, and cast perfectly. I can honestly say that this is as good as it gets! There will never be a better Batman or super hero movie.",1
8,Batman's greatest foe yet is revealed in The Dark Knight. And he is amazing. The combination of Heath Ledger and Christian Bale is magnificent. This is truly the best superhero movie to date. Every little detail leads to something in the end. The special effects still remain some of the best and this movie was truly advanced for the year it was released.,1
9,"This Film is great,Christopher Nolan really knows who is Batman he made this movie one of the best films of all time.The Dark Knight has a good plot a great villain and a good musical score(Hans Zimmer).",1
10,One of only a handful of flawless films I have seen in my lifetime.    (To give this movie a 0 (Zero) is morally irresponsible.),1
11,"i have 5000 character limit for writing my opinion about this movie..is it enough?  Absoulately not... The best movie ever...awesome...fantastic...amazing... you can find lot of words like this... you feel every emotion in the movie.Every scene has another feeling.Love, action, humanity, movie gives every feelings to you. i advise all world people to watch this movie. Because you wil not see a film like this for 50 years",1
12,"Christopher Nolan is an absolute genius. Batman Begins was a great film, but this just about blows it out of the water. Nolan knows good acting, and some amazing actors are in this one. Bale, Freeman, Oldman, Caine, LEDGER, all greats. The action scenes are suspenseful and aplenty (with a batmobile scene standing out) . and the script is superb. Seriously, this movie is super quotable. Ledger was born to play the Joker, and everybody that says his acting is ""overrated"" will never be happy. Aaron Eckhart is also superb. The best superher movie ever.",1
13,I was so pumped for this movie to come out for years and then Heath Ledger's passing made it an even bigger event. I went to see it on opening day and I swear during a few of the joker scenes I got chills because it was so good. And any movie that can have that much of an effect on me deserves a 10/10.,1
14,"Absolutely stunning. This sequel is dark, sophisticated, and is better than its predecessor. It has emotion, powerful and superb acting, and impressive visuals. This film is, beyond any doubt, a must-see. Oh, and the Joker in the movie, is beyond fantastic.",1
15,"The script is well-written, the performances are splendid, and the action sequences give the constant thrills. From the colored pages of its comic books to the glorious big screen, The Dark Knight is the greatest adaptation ever made.",1
16,"The Dark Knight is a very tightly woven and smart movie. The plot is engaging, the characters are each unique and well acted (especially the joker) and the action is intense. Really, there is no issue with this movie. It's damn near perfect. You'll be interested and on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end of the movie.The Dark Knight is not only the best Batman movie ever, it is also the greatest super hero based movie ever. Do yourself a favor and go watch it.",1
17,The best of the franchise.  A perfect film from start to finish that never gets old.  This film is slightly better then the other two because of Heath Ledger his portrayal of the Joker is to me the greatest villain of all time.,1
18,One of the best super hero movies of all times. If you havent seen it yet then..just stop reading this review and go see it first. Strong villains against strong super heros usually make the movie and this is no exception.,1
19,This is my favorite Batman movie ever! Christian Bale did another great performance as Batman and Heath Ledger was amazing as the Joker. The plot is excellent and the action sequences were great. I cannot understand anyone who doesn't like this movie.,1
20,"A single movie, with so many unique particularities and a simple proposal: be original and different at same time. Nolan brings us a mature and surprising Batman´s universe, with characters well made, including the Joker, the most impressive of all. Heath Ledger gives life to a scary, cold, shocking and overwhelming villain, that faces all Batman's limits with an unmerciful psychological game at absolutely flawless and triumphant performance. With a tense, accurate and efficient score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, led by the realistic and audacious proposal from Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight is engaging and powerful, being the best adaptation of a comic-book to the cinema.",1
21,"This is my favorite movie. I like Christopher Nolan movies. This is his best movie. Good plot, fantastic acting. Heath Ledger is genius. Good effects, action, drama.",1
22,"This is definitely the best out of all the Batman movies. The plot is engrossing, the action is thrilling, the performances are exciting. Ledger deserved every bit of praise for his portrayal of the Joker; He's one of the greatest villains in movie history. This is a mature vision of the Batman universe, grounded in a splendid realism, while never losing sight of what made the original characters so engaging. Not only a good ""superhero"" film, but an enthralling crime drama. Nolan and the actors understand this material perfectly, and have made a movie that transcends the comic book stereotype. An enthralling action movie and a work of art.",1
23,"The Dark Knight is everything an action movie should be: thrilling, suspenseful, epic and chock-full of action sequences that sometimes are as amusing as they are visually stimulating. But it's also an emotional journey that's so intricately weaved into the fabric of the movie it doesn't at all seem out of place (or disingenuous). Ledger's chilling (terrifying, nihilistic) portrayal of the Joker is certain to go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest villains of all time and even then it might still be slightly under-appreciated. Nolan has succeeded in creating a genre-defying (and defining) film on such a grandiose scale, and with so little room for error, that he must be praised for what he truly is: a directorial savant.",1
24,"The Dark Knight is truly the best batman film to date. It starts with a great intro sequence and keeps the high quality trough the whole film.Dark and gritty the dark knight offers a thrilling plot with great characters, all of whom having their own motivations with the greatest villian of the entire batman franchise. Hans Zimmer also did great work with this soundtrack which fits perfect. A must see",1
25,A masterpiece,1
26,"The Dark Knight is the superior Batman. This is what 1989 Batman should have been.Smart writing, smart direction, and incredible action sequences. Heath Ledger is the true Joker.",1
27,"Taking, not just mine, but everyone's expectations and flipping them on their heads. Nolan managed to harness everything that was great in ""Batman Begins"" and augment those qualities to a near epic degree. He even added some newer things of his own creation into the mix. I speak, of course, of Heath Ledger's Academy-Award Winning Joker. Virtually every line out of Heath's mouth in this movie is amazing. In fact the entire script of this movie contains these little hidden gems that Nolan just flicks at your head throughout the entire film. However, it's Heath's performance that still reigns surpeme in this film overall. He and Nolan not only created an Oscar-Winning character, but a character that has had a pretty deep impact on pop culture. Aaron Eckhart did a good job as the tragic Harvey Dent character. All of the other actors were fantastic as well - including Bale's continually impressive Bruce Wayne/Batman performance. On a technical level, the production design and set pieces in the film were absolutely magnificant. I also felt Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did another wonderful job in crafting the score for this film. Overall, Christopher Nolan manages to create a sequel that is not only better than the original, but he manages to craft my favorite movie of all time.",1
28,"This movie has to be viewed in combination with Batman Begins. The two really complement one another. At two and a half hours running time, if they had included more character development for Batman, it would have been too long to be watch-able by today's standards. So let me go ahead and say that I understand the decision to give Joker as much time on screen as possible, as this being a sequel some other character had to be focussed on to keep things interesting. However, this left Bruce Wayne with too few scenes without the mask where he wasn't being smug. Batman Begins showed us the human side of the superhero, and that is why I loved it so much. He felt so real and authentic. So the reason I'm giving it such a high score is only because of Joker. If he had not completely blown my mind away, I would have scored it much lower. The supporting cast did a commendable job but nothing which would have earned the movie favourable reviews and critical acclaim.",1
29,"What a breath of fresh air. Such a brilliant step up from the previous movie. Fantastic performances all round. Ledger in particular was just amazing as the Joker. This is what a Batman movie should be. I would love to say more, but I really can not falter this movie in any way. As close to perfect as I could hope for a comic to movie film. Overall:This is Batman!",1
30,"One of the best superhero movies of all time. The Dark Knight is much better than Batman Begins, mainly because of Heath Ledgers mesmerising performance  as The Joker. I won't go on about just take my word for it that he's amazing. Batman Begins had a weak plot, this has one of the best plots of any movie ever, Christopher Nolan took a risk and made the plot political instead of pointless like Batman Begins, and it worked. The Dark Knight is a very enjoyable and one of the best movies of all time.",1
31,"After a great start to a new batman trilogy with ""Batman Begins"", Christopher Nolan goes deeper into the story and has created a true masterpiece. Not only as one of the best superhero movies ever made, but also one of the best superhero movies ever made. If one things for sure, not only is the story more thrilling but so are the characters. Especially the Joker and Harvey Dent. But still, the Joker (Heath Ledger) steals the show. It was truly the most villianous portrayl of the Joker I've ever seen. He keeps you on the edge of your seat with his tremendous acitng and his tremendously creepy new look. Plus, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) was surprisingly outstanding as well. Not so much like the Joker, but still, you got to love his performance. Also, the characters have definitely grown since Batman Begins. They've become more riching and engaging. This trilogy really has a great ensemle of actors, which is something that really works for the trilogy. Overall, this is the batman movie we've all been waiting for.",1
32,"It isn't an overstatement to call The Dark Knight the most sophisticated and ambitious work of its kind. Superior to all three Spider-Man installments and even its amazing predecessor in terms of conceptualization, writing, acting, and direction, Nolan's follow-up to Batman Begins is a dark, complex and disturbing film, not the least of which because it grafts its heroics onto the blueprint of actual reality rather than that of spandex-clad supermen. And while such a distinction may make little difference to those already eagerly anticipating the return of the caped crusader, suffice it to say that The Dark Knight qualifies as the first official comic book adaptation that truly succeeds in being a great artistic achievement in its own right.",1
33,"This movie changed the way I see Batman. This Part 2 of the trilogy was by far the best in the trilogy, and probably the best Batman movie I've ever seen. Sorry, Adam West, Michael Keaton, and George Clooney. And that voice!",1
34,"This thing has everything a movie could ask for: a complex set of themes that raise questions about morality and philosophy, but with enough action, memorable dialogue, tight pacing, and character development to not get bogged down by its complexity. Ledger's Joker is, needless to say, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. The whole cast brings its A-game, ultimately creating the best superhero movie and arguably one of the best films of all time.",1
35,"The Best action movie ever made, the best crime movie ever made, the best villain performance ever performed by Heath Ledger the Joker, I Think I can watch it 100 times and never get bored, Great work from my idol Director Christopher Nolan, thank you for this one.",1
36,"The Dark knight is definitely one of the best movie of all times, It put a batman on the sky, the performance of Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are OUTSTANDING!, All the characters played a strong role, this movie has everything, amazing soundtrack, and story, epic battles, best action fights!, the best movie of christopher nolan!this will become a classic movie.........",1
37,"Simply the most stunning, exciting and twisting movie ever made combined with a great cast including the best acted figure in any movie I've ever seen with Heath Ledger as the Joker. Never before a film was so cunning making a person feel crazy and godlike at the same time with Genius-Like Appearences at the Mafia on a Banquet or in a bank-robbery. Batman himself doesn't feel invincible and Two-Face has an awesome story to become what he is nowadays. Scarecrow has a little guest role (I love the actor), aswell as Morgan Freeman and an awesome Michael Caine.The Unexpected trick of the Joker, the two ships, everything is perfect. Easily the best film I've ever seen!",1
38,"First of all, there is no doubt that the reputation of this film, and Heath Ledger's performance, were bolstered by his untimely death. That makes no difference. This is an accomplished and subversive work, and the most fully realised of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy - its predecessor did little more than establish the foundations of this film, whilst its successor lacked focus or a satisfying conclusion. ""The Dark Knight"", on the other hand, is an expansive, complex and soulful masterpiece of film, which spearheaded the re-evaluation and acknowledgement of the superhero genre as an art form capable of producing stories as daring, layered and emotive as standard art house fare, or modernist literature and being good for more than just action and special effects. This film is masterfully designed, scored, edited, acted, and shot, reminiscent both stylistically and in terms of storytelling as the classic thrillers of the 1970s. Much like New York City in ""Taxi Driver"", Nolan's Gotham breathes, and so do the characters, who are understood as real people and compelled to act as such, rather than just vehicles transporting the viewer from one action set piece to the next. Both Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart are fantastic, offering nuanced and desperate portraits of virtuous men broken by their own goodness. They deserved Oscar nominations as much as Heath Ledger. As for Heath Ledger, it is an astonishing piece of acting whether he lived to see it on-screen or not. He is explosive, twisted, visceral, and utterly terrifying - and damn near impossible to take your eyes off of. Is this is a perfect film? There's one too many leaps of logic involved, so it falls short, but only by a minuscule margin. This is certainly one of the best films I've seen - a grand and operatic morality play, breathtakingly colossal, searingly intimate, and unbearably sad. Detractors may try to use Heath Ledger's death to discredit its success as circumstantial. I remind you: nobody from ""The Avengers"" died.",1
39,"So i thought the first film was pretty boring. Definitely not the case with this one. It's gritty, it's dark, brings brilliant character development along with far more interesting characters like The Joker and Two-face, and has the best plot out of all 3 films. A performance best by the sadly late Heath Ledger as the Joker, and Aaron Eckart and Christian Bale also bringing excellent performances. This film has a far more film noir feel to it (but obviously isn't film noir). Thr twists are brilliant and Ledgers transformation into the Joker is the best on screen performance to dub our screens yet. Film is filled with great visual effects also, awesome practical effects and great stunts too! A must watch!",1
40,"This is my favourite movie of all time. It's dark, awesome and has one of the best villain performances of all time, R.I.P Heath Ledger. Also I love Batman,he is my favourite comic book character.10/10",1
41,"This film is the perfect super hero movie. Gotham City is displayed so well visually. It is full of a great cast, and everyone is sharp in this film. I really need to see this movie again. What more can be said about the Dark Knight? Heath Ledger is dynamite as the joker which every knows by now. If you have not seen this movie yet go out and see it. You won't regret it.",1
42,"The Dark Knight is the closest any superhero movie has come to ""perfect"" with transcendent dialogue, a sturdy plot and marvelous casting including Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of The Joker all assured under Christopher Nolan's masterful direction.",1
43,"Forget that The Dark Knight is one of the best superhero movies of all time.. it is one of the best MOVIES of all time.  In actuality it doesn't even really need to be a superhero movie.  It is a tense, intellectual thriller from the master of such movies, Christopher Nolan.  Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker and I think his performance will never be topped.",1
44,"By combining epic action akin to Michael Mann, an endearing cast and a blisteringly psychotic antagonist; Nolan has dropped his hero in the realms of realism and forever changed the superhero genre.",1
45,"Easily the best movie of not only the Nolan batman trilogy, but of his entire career, this is without a doubt the perfect superhero movie. Its hero truly is a hero, not one who does what he does for the glory, but for doing the right thing, regardless of how much those he serves hate him in return. The hero is not perfect, as he does fall, showing even further his immense humanity. The villain is not a stock character who is easily defeated, but a man with a troubled and unclear past, whose genius seems to always win. The battle for Gotham's soul is fought between a strict moral code and nihilism, the immovable object and the unstoppable force.",1
46,"This film is a beautiful metaphor for the greatest struggles of life itself; I have recently discovered that Nolan's masterpiece seems to address the problems created by a figurative or literal multiple personality disorder. We have three different angles of perspective on life, all grabbing for Rachel, who represents love, in one way or another. Harvey Dent is essentially a saint, an idyllic hero driven by hope and compassion that has presumably only been able rise up to the challenge of fixing Gotham City due to the changes set in place by Bruce Wayne, who sees the world for what it truly is: a hellish, twisted roller coaster of synthetic euphoria and very real pain. He too, though, is driven by his positive emotions and, because he has hope in his heart that he can ""save the day and get the girl,"" he decides to do what he can to make the ride as comfortable for the rest of us as he possibly can, even at the cost of his own life. But The Joker sees things differently. He is, if not more so, just as intelligent as the Batman. He understands that at least for him, there is nothing to be enjoyed in life. Selfishly he decides that he must drag everyone else down with him. It's easy to catch the symbolism here, as it's almost literal (and it somehow harks back to the Green Lantern mythos, though I am unsure of whether this is deliberate): Harvey is the side of a man that represents positivity - hope, compassion, and love, which combine to form ""Order."" Bruce represents balance between all emotions, with a central focus on will. The Joker represents negativity - fear, avarice and rage, which combine to form ""Chaos."" Later in the Dark Knight Trilogy a fourth personality is introduced, but that is not what we are discussing here. The beginning is quite literally the chaotic personality's entry into the world, taking advantage of everything that he can in order to do... nothing in particular. That's what's so excellent about this story! The goons would be his friends in the real life interpretation of it, and when he kills them or has them turn on each other, this is the loss that happens when you ""turn to the dark side,"" or choose to give up on the world, as The Joker has done. But enough metaphorical interpretation, let's talk about the literal aspects of the film. The first noticeable thing to me was not the direction, the acting, the cinematography nor the editing or action sequences, but Hans Zimmer's score for the film, which was at first deliberately disgusting, with the use of what sounds like a wire being strung for eternity, abused violins and electric guitar, but ultimately beautiful, with the most moving piece of music heard in ""Like A Dog Chasing Cars"" since Krypton's theme in Superman by John Williams, and until ""Time"" from Inception - yet another Zimmer theme! Mocked as it may be, his dense string ostinato sequences left me breathless. But back to the story, I'm going to skip a huge chunk and get right to the meaty part. I wish I could cue Zimmer's ""Horn of Doom"" here to alert you to the impending spoiler. Don't read if you haven't watched the movie! Rachel is indirectly killed by Joker. While he is being interrogated, the timer ticks down to the explosion of two buildings, each with one hostage inside: Gotham's White Knight, and Harvey and Bruce's only known love. Here is the great metaphor of the entire trilogy: Hope. Moving on. Loving more than just one - something both Harvey and Batman are, at the moment, incapable of doing. The Joker takes advantage of Rachel's death and Harvey's disfigurement (as you may remember, half of his face is burned off in the fire of the explosion), and convinces him to embrace the chaos of the world around him, and essentially, give in to evil. He accepts this offer. Skipping ahead to the final acts of this movie (and it has oh so many), we have The Joker about to kill dozens if not hundreds of people on a couple of ferries, who represent the good and bad sides of society, and Harvey, the hero, twisted into wanting vengeance on Commissioner Gordon. Once again I will take a break from the story. Let's talk about the other aspects. Is this movie effects-heavy? Surprisingly, no. You'd think it would be, given that, it's Batman. But in fact, it relies on practical effects more than anything else. For example, when the massive truck that the Joker is in gets flipped, it is not done with CGI, but with a spring of all things, that shoots it upwards. I won't even say anything about the acting - I want you to watch it, because in all honesty, words could not do it justice. In my mortal explanation of one of the various metaphors presented by this film (and believe me, there are other ways to interpret it - mine is just the most literal, emotional example), I have butchered Mr. Nolan's work, so I will just say that you MUST keep an eye on Heath Ledger. THE VERDICT: Direction: 9.5 Acting: 10.0 Cinematography: 9.0 Editing: 9.0 Soundtrack: 10.0 Overall: 9.75",1
47,"This is my #1 movie. Ever since i saw it in theatres i've seen it over 80000000 times. I know every line from this great film. From the acting to the story this movie is solid, thought provoking and totally awesome.",1
48,"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects create a truly realistic experience.",1
49,"The Dark Knight that came out in 2008 starring Christian Bale, HeathLedger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman andMaggie Gyllenhaal is a superhero movie of Batman. When Batman, Gordonand Harvey Dent tries bring down the mob, they face a new threat TheJoker, who raises hell in Gotham. What unfolds is a 150 min of highpace crime thriller. The story is quite dark, complex and engaging. The cast is justamazing. Heath Ledger gave legendary outstanding performance in his lastrole. His each dialogue is just amazing. I kinda love every sec he isin on the screen. The Joker can be considered one of the best villainsof all time. Christian Bale is amazing in his best role of Batman.Though not as screen time as he had in the last movie (Batman Begins),but still he gave an amazing performance. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dentwas quite good. After Joker, Harvey had 2nd best dialogues of themovie. Pacing of the movie is awesome too. There won't be any part ofthe movie which feels slow or boring, mainly because every conversationis important. Action is kinda different and unique making it amazing .Overall The Dark knight is an OUTSTANDING movie. Plot:10/10Dialogue:10/10Acting:10/10Action:10/10Pace:10/10 Overall:10/10",1
50,"Outstanding movie with a great villain. Let me say The Joker is awesome in this film. They need him, and batman was pretty cool. From the first couple of scenes, I knew this movie would be good. This is an all-time superhero movie that you must see. There is also kind of a twist in the last few scenes that I won't spoil!",1
51," the best superheroe movie in all time, the joker is spectacular.",1
52," Wow. Ignoring the obvious hype surrounding Ledgers last performance, this really is the best damn acting I've ever seen. Ledger's Joker is phenomenally convincing as a complete psychopath. He's wholly likable though, and you never tire of watching him. So much better than the first - which had forgettable villains. As if the Joker was not enough but Harvey 'Two-Face' Dent is here as well, along with his perfectly justifiable transition from Hero to Nutjob.",1
53," I believe that those who criticise against this film are trying to find weaknesses, rather then look at what is pain-stakingly obvious, the power, the class and awe that this film creates, a must see, and in this reviewers opinion, the best comic to movie ever.",1
54," This movie is simply amazing! I am literally speechless. In my opinion, Heath Ledger is the best Joker! He deserves an Oscar!",1
55, People who gave this movie 0/10 are pretentious ignorant prigs. Don't go and watch anymore films EVER if you honestly believe this one deserves a 0 your on a different planet to the other 90% of us that loved it.,1
56," Absolutely fantastic, even more so when one steps back and realizes that this is based on a cartoon character. The philosophical and moral depths plumbed in this film are a strong undercurrent to the disturbing but nevertheless awe-inspiring actions of the players. The first truly golden (though darkly so) superhero film in quite some time.",1
57,"The first aspect of this movie that struck me was the fact that director Christopher Nolan decided to counter the trend of giving an eponymous title to his superhero movie, and upon watching it was for good reason. This is no superhero movie, at least in the sense we have come to expect. Nolan takes a turn for extreme realism and weighted expectation, giving us one of the most gripping and intense action movies to hit the screens in a long while. As far as we ave seen, the caped crusader has never looked so good.",1
58,"A masterpiece. A film which defies all expectation from a belittled genre and instead crosses over to become an epic crime drama which bears some similarities with Michael Mann's 'Heat'. The attention naturally went to the late Heath Ledger who delivered a definitive performance as the Joker but the cast as a whole should never be over looked. Christian Bale carries on the character from Batman Begins and delivers another great performance whilst Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman are also superb. The action is top notch as well, the score suits the style. It's hard to criticise the Dark Knight except to say that its dark and intelligence themes doesnt make it the most fun to view. However it is difficult not to be sucked in as the pressure builds and builds thanks to Nolan's storytelling and Ledger's madness. A modern classic.",1
59,"I love Batman. I have for many years. Still have my collections in mint condition. I liked batman begins quite a bit. But this film surpassed all barriers of action/drama and expressionism. Not only a great depicture of a fantastic comic book but a colorful and sincere look at the unbridaled (yet predictable) inner environment of the human mind. The acting was incredible. Bale was stellar. Freeman was outstanding. Heath Ledger took the batman symboled cake though. He made me think he was an actual sociopath, his completely even and scary portrayal revitalized a very old villian. The Direction was very good, with well transitions, and good camera shots, with depressionistic lighting. Good choice for a film like this. Favorite movie of all time, the greatest film i have ever seen.",1
60,"The Dark Knight is greatest film to date, and possibly, of all time. Christopher Nolan has done it again, and proved that a sequel can top the original in every way. An immersive, yet tragic story will keep viewers on the edge of their seats for whole two and a half hours of the running time. The film is beautifully shot, with scenes captured in the state-of-the-art IMAX cameras.The Dark Knight is, quite simply, brilliant.",1
61,"Where do I begin? The Dark Knight is not only the best sequal, its arguably the best comic book movie ever made. It picks up right where Batman Begins left off with the Joker's card in Gordan's (Oldman) evidence baggie. There's not much that I can say about this movie that has not been said over and over again. One thing I can say is, if you did not like this movie at all then your taste is a little poor. Perhaps I'm not one to judge because I did like G.I. Joe and Transformers 2. This film has so much more to like than the average comic book adaptation. Rather than focusing on setting up spectacular action set pieces like most movies of the genre, Nolan puts drama at the heart of this one. We've all seen the original Batman, so there's no need for the Joker to run around Gotham with a tommy gun. Without saying too much, I'll say that the Joker has a much bigger agenda in this film than he did the first time. From the start we are introduced to him in the midst of a well planned, and well choreographed bank heist. Definitely cinematography at its absolute best, thanks to Chris Nolan and Wally Pfister. We are meant to see just how intelligent the Joker really is, despite being the most qualified for a life sentence in Arkham Asylum. Never have I seen an actor capture the essence of a character from literature as perfectly as Heath Ledger did with his. There has been much debate as to which actor was the best Joker. In my opinion neither came close to Mark Hamill's voice work for the animated series. All jokes aside, the performances in this movie are beyond amazing. I honestly believe Heath Ledger would not have won Best Supporting Actor if he was still living due to Academy politics, but he more than deserved it, and I'm glad he won it. All of the other actors did phenomenal jobs as well. Especially Aaron Eckhart as Harvey 'Two Face' Dent. My only gripe was Katie Holmes not returning for her role, but over a billion dollars later, thats her problem. The plot of The Dark Knight addressed my only complaint about Batman Begins. There isn't anything I can think of in this movie that was unrealistic in the advanced world we live in today. The premise is believable, and the story draws you in and never lets you go. I also have to mention the composer, Hans Zimmer returning from Batman Begins. The musical score in the two movies was another thing that I thought was damn near flawless. No spoiler intended, but the way it ended left so much to the imagination. It appeared that the Joker would have had a guaranteed spot in the third movie, but now I think they should just leave that character alone. Chris Nolan has a large task on his hands for the third installment. Topping this sequal will be a challenge. Lets just hope what happened with the Spider-Man franchise doesn't happen to this one. The Dark Knight was beyond anything I could have imagined. It's a film that will be talked about for many years to come.",1
62,"Firstly, I have to admit that I've never been a fan of the Batman series, but this all changed with 'The Dark Knight' and 'Batman Begins' before that.Christopher Nolan is quite simply a genius, his take on Batman had me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie, some thing that didn't happen with previous Batman movies.Christian Bale is cast perfect as Bruce Wayne/Batman, but the man who really steals the show is Heath Ledger as The Joker, he was incredible, and apparently Michael Caine forgot his lines, because he couldn't believe how good Heath's Joker was.I'm definitely looking forward to the next Batman movie.",1
63,"This is not your typical comic book movie, it's more of a multidimensional crime saga. With great performances, especially Heath Ledger's iconic Joker, and Christopher Nolan's impressive direction and mind-bending script, The Dark Knight is a modern classic. 4/4 stars.",1
64,"This is the best superhero movie ever made. A masterpiece. Nolan shows again he's one of the greatest directors of al time. Cast is excellent, espyially Heath Ledger, the story is awesome, ..... How can David Denby give this movie a 50, I don't understand it. AWESOME MOVIE",1
65,"As a whole, it can exclaim itself as a sophisticated comic book film. Heath Ledger's Joker is what captivates us. He absorbs into this role with a type of noir-like version of the classic comic book character, becoming a murderous and calculating psychopath. The only comic book film that deserved any Oscar, especially for Heath Ledger.",1
66,"The best of the trilogy. It manages to keep your attention all the time. And just when you think the day is saved, it all crash down. Ledger plays the role of his life as the Joker, a new and wonderful vision of this batman nemesis",1
67,8.8/10................................................................................................................................................,1
68,"Even though its plot isn't perfect, The Dark Knight succeeds due to gritty, well-made action sequences, strong performances from every cast member (especially Heath Ledger as the Joker), and an overall unique and dark take on the story of Batman.  While it isn't entirely deserving of a perfect score, it comes extremely close. 9.9/10",1
69,"I prefer the the 1989 film for its comic book dark stile, but I watched it again and it's like a crime action drama. So the film is fantastic and awesome like the original, so yeah, I love this movie for doing some thing different and succeeding:)",1
70,Probably one of the best films you will watch today. As Christopher Nolan really pushed the boundaries with this flawless action crime drama. Batman has to deal with many familiar faces and doesn't disappoint with good acting brilliant action and a nice musical score.,1
71,Simply one of the best superhero movies of all time! This movie not only has everything a Batman movie should have it has everything you look for in any movie! Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is jaw dropping and will give you chills! A+ 10 out of 10,1
72,"There is so many good things that I could say about this movie. Aside from the brilliant acting, fantastic score, and amazing directing, the thing that Dark Knight does really well is the plot and development of the characters. Let's face it. A majority of super hero movies are terrible. But this film not only manages to be a good super hero movie, but a great movie in general. The characters are realistic and relatable. The villains have a clear purpose and goal. Everything about this movie is perfect. A must watch for any film fan!",1
73,This is the best batman movie ever. Great cinematography. Great acting. Awesome story. First scene in imax will blow you away. Great ending. I highly recommend owning this flick on blu ray,1
74,"BOX OFFICE: $1.05 billion dollars.$534 million dollars in US.Second Best of all time at the time of its opening in 2008.Best opening of all time with $158 million.REVIEWS (critical acclaim): 9.0/10 on IMDb.94% on Rotten Tomatoes.82/100 on Metacritic.Best Reviewed Superhero Movie of all time.AWARDS:103 Won-178 NominatedAlso nominated for 8 Oscars and Won 2 including Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger.The Dark Knight it's actually the movie that redefined the Superhero genre and it is even considered as one of the best Crime Dramas also,which is insane for a movie like this.Christopher Nolan's direction is just impressive and very interesting.He handled the characters so good and made one of the best on-screen villains ever,though Heath Ledger's portrayal totally stands out as the Joker,also making it in my opinion one of the best performances ever.Not to be overlooked are the other performances such as Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent who gave a very very good performance and brought charisma and seriousness to Dent and respectively Two Face.Christian Bale in my opinion is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne of all time.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes,the likes of Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman give very serious and great performances too.The action is so well handled and very well shot that keeps you intrigued/excited every time.But what stand out are the dialogue scenes,especially the best scene in the movie which is the Interrogation scene between The Joker and Batman.That scene tells us so much and we get a look/perspective at the Joker's world so well and what makes him scary/intimidating it's that what he says actually makes sense,it's true all of it.Plus the amazing transformation of Harvey Dent to Two Face it's mesmerizing.Seeing at what point he is at the beginning,fighting for justice in any way he can and how he ends up in the end,willing to kill Gordon's kids it's just insane but realistic and believable too.After that insanely amazing written scene in the Hospital between Dent and The Joker,we see his transformation making sense with the amazingly realistic dialogue.The Joker just wants to watch the world burn and this movie shows what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.Every moment that Heath is in it's memorable and insanely good,but the fact of the matter is that even when he is not on-screen the movie is still interesting and just as good because it's smart and rewarding by giving justice to these characters that had not been done rightfully before.The less prepared you are, the greater will be the experience of Nolan’s masterpiece.I could go on and on writing about every detail of this amazing movie achievement but I leave it at this because I think I have said enough.If you hate the movie,it's fine because maybe you don't like these sort of movies or you were expecting something else after all I mean every movie has haters.But no one can deny the fact that The Dark Knight is memorable,filled with great performances,action done right and great dialogue.﻿",1
75,"Simply fantastic! It's my favorite super hero movie and one of my favorite movies! Why? Well ,it's just so well written, with dark humor, intense action, a menacing villain, etc. There are so many memorable moments (the  bank robbery, the ""you know how I got these scars?"" speeches, etc.) and lines (""Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...stranger."" -Joker, ""Do you know how I got these scars?""-Joker ""No, but I know how you got these."" -Batman, etc.) I could go on forever about my love for this movie, but I have to admit that there are some kind of dull parts that could have been shorter or mixed with less dull material... or something. That's why it's not a ten. Aside form it being a little dull here or there, it's the perfect dark super hero movie and just an all-around outstanding film!",1
76,"'The Dark Knight' is easily the best 'Batman' story ever told, with stunning performances from all its cast, a dark and intriguing story, and the best incarnation of the Joker on the big screen. Obviously, the movie does have its flaws, like Christan Bale's gravelly Batman voice, and that some of the plot points aren't very well thought out. All in all, I think 'The Dark Knight' is the best Christopher Nolan 'Batman' movie, and one of the best comic book movies of all time.",1
77,"This film is just fantastic, my personal favorite film of all time. Everyone is perfect in their roles, and this is easily the best superhero film of all time, and it shows how Batman can be done brilliantly.",1
78,"“The Dark Knight” transcends the comic book genreChristopher Nolan has created yet another masterpiece this time setting the bar sky-high for comic book based movies in the form of “The Dark Knight”. Lead by and all-star cast with Christian Bale (Batman) , Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) , and Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth) reprising their roles from “Batman Begins”, the star power on its own is enough to make this a movie worth watching. However, it is Heath Ledger’s portrayal as the  psychotic tormentor “The Joker” that steals the show. Ledger’s performance earned him the first posthumously awarded Oscar for Best supporting Actor. Ledger justifies the hype around his performance time and time again as Ledger is creepy, darkly humorous, and downright disturbing as the the Joker. As much as the movie is brought to life by the terrific cast, the screenplay and action should not be overlooked. “The Dark Knight” is similar to other superhero movies in that it features big explosions and otherworldly combat. However, the “The Dark Knight” simply outmatches any other comic-book movie ever made even its sequel “The Dark Knight Rises”, due to its elaborate plot and characters. Nolan is masterful in his direction and justifies the two and a half hour running time as he twists the audience around just as they are recovering from the previous turn. Nolan has taken a movie based on a fantasy and turned it into something believable, something real. Batman has never been more human than he is here as he struggles more than ever to be both Bruce Wayne and a savior to the crime-ridden Gotham. Ultimately “The Dark Knight” is worth every penny and is a must-see film. Watch it for the action.  Watch it for Heath Ledger’s “Joker”. Watch it because it’s Batman, unless you hate Batman. But, why so serious?",1
79,"What a breath of fresh air. Such a brilliant step up from the previous movie. Fantastic performances all round. Ledger in particular was just amazing as the Joker. This is what a Batman movie should be. I would love to say more, but I really can not falter this movie in any way. As close to perfect as I could hope for a comic to movie film.",1
80,"WHAT I LIKED: This film has a famous reputation for a reason. Primarily, of course, its image is dominated by one of the best movie villains of all time, who not only serves as someone unhinged and terrifying, but helps to illustrate some very interesting themes. Amazingly, every situation played out by the Joker, brings Gotham (and the audience) onto a whole new desperate and frightening playing field, which in turns causes you to genuinely consider and question humanity all the more. In the end, it's this that makes 'The Dark Knight' the truly successful social commentary that it is, but it's not without some fun action either.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The themes and schemes are all very interesting, but the characters and plots aren't nearly developed enough for me to genuinely connect with the film. Instead, you watch from outside as Nolan uses characters and stories as a tool to portray his ideas; it's not a harmonious partnership between story and narrative, instead the themes exist at the expense of lots else. As a result, you'll be gripped be each scene, but in between you might feel a bit disconnectedVERDICT: A darker, deeper Batman that brings excitement and social commentary to the audience. It'll grip you in the moment, but when you're out of it, you won't particularly connect.",1
81,"The Dark Knight is not only the best superhero movie ever made, but it has truly carved out a place among the great films that have been made through history. This movie is a fun ride and a work of art. Christopher Nolan is at his best as a director here, and the performances, story, and themes on society are great. This is a movie truly everyone can enjoy, and needs to see!",1
82,"The Dark Knight is probably the best superhero movie of all time. The way everything came together; Christopher Nolan back to direct, the choice of casting (Heath Ledger), the performances, the writing, the cinematography, the practical effects, the action, and the music are all at the highest possible level of perfection. Theres a reason this film gets so much praise, its because its undeniably fantastic! If you haven't seen it yet, what are you doing? Go watch it now!",1
83,"A breathtaking performance by the late Heath Ledger and Chistopher Nolan as brilliant as always.This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first to the last second.No comic book adaptation, will ever be able to mess with this stunning epic.",1
84,Do I need to explain why this movie is good? No. 3 words is all I need to explain excellence: The Dark Knight!,1
85,"Quite literally the best hero movie of all time and overall one of the greatest movies of all time. The characters were portrayed so **** well, there's no other way to put it. Heath Ledger played a unrivalled portrayal of the Joker and Christian Bale as always - ""nuff said"". Every scene was memorable, the action was superb and the plot was immaculate. My favourite line - ""Why so serious son!""",1
86,"Greatest comic film of all timeEverything is on the ball. Acting, story, cinematography, score, action. You name it this film knocks it out of the park.Bale gives another killer performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne with a great performance from Michael Caine as Alfred. Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart were stellar as Gordon and Harvey.The stand out performance is obviously Heath Ledger as The Joker. He's scary, but compelling. Every moment he's on screen in a joy and he steals the show. A much deserved Oscar was given to Ledger post-humously for this performance.In the years since it's release this type of filmmaking has become taboo for comic movies, with films that put character and story above cringey jokes and a formulaic plot structure being panned because critics have decided that if it's not Disney, it is automatically bad.I honestly believe had this film been released in 2018 instead of 2008 it'd have been panned by critics for being too dark and serious and not having enough humor, and for the ""crime"" of not being linked to Disney in some way.",1
87,The Dark Knight in my opinion is the best super hero movie. Acting was superb by Christopher Nolan and the villain(the joker) was easily one of the best villains throughout super hero movies.,1
88,I love this movie! Definitely the best Batman movie ever! Heath Ledger really deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. This is a movie I will remember for decades!,1
89,OH MY GOD!!!!!!! this movie is awsome! by far the best movie ever. heath ledger is the best joker you will ever see!!! Too bad he died. i hope superhero movies an batman movies alike can be more like this in the future.,1
90,"The Dark Knight is hands down the best written, scripted and acted superhero movie of all time. The dialogue fizzes at all times, the character exchanges are more exciting than gunfire and there is a genuinely interesting psychological study at the root of it all. What does keep it shy of perfection, though, is the lack of a truly exciting action scene. The whole bat-bike / flipping truck scene comes close but ultimately when in combat, this Batman is a bit paint by numbers. Not that it hurts the movie too much because to paraphrase the Joker; ""You didn't really think I'd leave the fate of Gotham's soul up to a fistfight, did you?""",1
91,As perfect as a film gets you will only see a select few better then it. Nolan remains one of the best directors of all time ranking with scorcesse and a few others.,1
92,"The Dark Knight is among the deepest superhero films ever created. The thing that made it better was the villain The Joker, who helped make the film darker than Batman Begins.",1
93,"Seriously, the most legendary movie I have ever watched in my life. Characters, atmosphere, dialogs, music, action, depth... Everything is perfect! Thank you Christopher Nolan, for giving us this epic trilogy.",1
94,"Great stuff. . Epic story, good acting and production. Something as big as this can't help but attract negativity, but please be assured that it is a great effort. And remember, this is modern myth-making! These stories are our morality plays, our tales of gods and monsters. Please don't look at it as just a crime thriller or you will find implausibility!",1
95,"I actually love everything about this movie.  Characters, story, Joker's plans, tactics, scare tactics, music. Two-face, Joker, politics, makeups, costumes.I like Batman Begins, but only story about how Bruce Wayne became Batman, villains, enemies were odd. Batman the Dark Knight rises, I love the music, but, I didn't like all the rest of it.",1
96,"The Dark Knight is an entertaining movie that definitely does the comic book character, Batman, justice. The movie keeps its dark, realistic tone from the previous Batman movie, Batman begins rather than the campy and light-hearted look of Batman and Robin. The plot was interesting and gripping, wasn't plagued by too many boring scenes and the story runs at a suitable pace. It continues on from Batman Begins as the vigilante known as Batman continues to fight crime in Gotham City. Now I wouldn't have thought that the movie would be too long or not as long as Batman Begins because of no need to explain how Bruce Wayne became Batman but I obviously thought wrong. It's a long movie, maybe too long but at least it's a good movie to sit through rather than a pain numbing boring one. It's a typical superhero action movie with a dastardly villain causing chaos and killing innocent people. This villain in the movie is none other than the Joker. The Joker is played brilliantly by the late Heath Ledger. He nailed the Jokers personality with the way he acts and that make up he wears is freaky! He's a psychopath and a dangerous person but comes across in some scenes like the ""Magic Trick"" scene where he slams some goon's forehead (or eyeball?) into a pencil and makes it disappear - just like the Joker said he would do - as somewhat funny. I like when he's dead polite in the ""Party"" when he greets the party guests and wielding a shotgun and helps himself to a glass of wine (or some alcoholic liquid), picks it up, accidently tosses the wine out of the glass and drinks from it anyway! It's no Matrix in terms of it's fight scenes but they are good and well edited (unlike the last Batman film where most of the fight scenes were shot in extreme close up). The action scenes like the chase scene where the Joker is trying to chase down the truck transporting ""Batman"" was exciting to watch. The other villain, Two-Face is introduced pretty quickly and at least doesn't take too much time out of the running time of the film. The visual effects on Two-Face are authentic and make him seem more threatening. I noticed when seeing this film, there's 2 scenes that reference 2 scenes from the 1989 Batman and it was great that director Christopher Nolan referenced those 2 scenes in this movie. The Batcycle is cool and the Batsuit that Batman wears matches the dark stylish look of the movie. The music is dramatic and suits the film and sounded more epic in the cinema than at home. I know he talked like this in Batman Begins but why does Bruce Wayne as Batman, have to talk in a dull, broken and grouchy voice? Yes I know he's doing it to conceal his identity, but in the 1989 Batman movie, Bruce Wayne talked in the same tone while he was Batman rather than a different voice. Also one scene, which may seem epic, is very bright and may cause seizures! This is just a short review of a movie that I really enjoyed and I consider it to be one of the best if not the best superhero movie I've seen.",1
97,"With 'The Dark Knight', the super hero genre reached a new milestone:  a superhero film that is topical and gritty beyond belief.  It's the first Oscar caliber Super Hero film; a crime thriller masquerading under the guise of 'Batman', an acting powerhouse for its ensemble cast, an astounding action film and finally, a psychological drama, investigating the psyche of its characters. Heath Ledger, in his last 'complete role', created the Joker as one of the most frightening character in the history of cinema, and this is a PG-13 film! Christian Bale also cemented himself as the best of all the 'Batmen' in the last two decades.  But the real star is director Christopher Nolan himself, who has cemented himself as the auteur of this generation. The Dark Knight: one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.",1
98,"Christopher Nolan directs an epic, emotional thrill ride. Providing nonstop action incredible performances especially Heath Ledger who gives the best adaptation of one of the most memorable villains. This movie is one of the most unforgettable experiences you will have until the last one arrives. I give this movie 90%.",1
99,"The best superhero movie. EVER.I had a lot of expectations when I went to see this film. Batman Begins was so promising because it started on a darker and more realistic tone. The Dark Knight exceeds all expectations. It is darker, scarier, and a bigger ride.The old Batman movies and TV series were more joyful whereas the comic books themselves were more sinister. The Dark Knight is better than the comics. The atmosphere is bleak in Gotham City. Nothing but black thanks to the high crime rates. Batman helps decrease felony rates but Gotham needs a more normal person to take over. And that is Harvey Dent. However, the Joker marvelously played by the late Heath Ledger, is the only nemesis that stalls Gotham's hopes of being clean. And that path shows disaster as Harvey himself turns mad after the death of his girlfriend and the loss of half of his face. How Batman defeats both Joker and Dent is the main plot.But Batman isn't much of an adventure as it is a perilous journey in the experience of doom. It feels and breathes dystopia. There is no light. There is hardly any shelter. The music itself explains the tragedy. But then there was Batman. And that is what helps Dark Knight to succeed. How one person alone attempts to triumph in the lack of light. How he sacrifices himself to help his city from the depths of despair really makes him the Dark Knight.The cast has done a superb job in portraying their characters without going overboard. Christian Bale returns giving both sides of Bruce Wayne equal attention (the playboy and the hero) as he did in the first film. Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal also give fine performances. But it is the Joker that really makes the film terrifying. He is insane but believably played by Heath Ledger. The Joker alone is enough reason to see this film.But alas, people will say that it is the best part of the film even though there are several other reasons on why The Dark Knight is not just the best superhero film but one of the greatest films of all time.",1
100,"If ""The Dark Knight"" is an unique, fascinating masterpiece is thanks to the nihilist tone, bleak atmosphere and profound story that director Christopher Nolan exploits with great refinement.",1
101,"I thought this movie was unbelievable, especially joker. Everything was incredible from the special effects to the actors and of course. They got batman just right, because he has that serious feeling that is batman. As well as the joker with his sick and weird(slightly funny) feeling. Which is of course joker. And is of course one of my favourite comic villain of all time. In a way they are both perfect for each other. Serious and joke one cannot survive without the other. I give it two thumbs up. Best movie of 2008.",1
102,"This is the Batman film for the ages (with the 60s Adam West one as well). It is very dark, gritty and very distressing to watch: You really do feel all the pain felt by each character from each bone-crunching punch to every gun shot. Batman himself is perfect in the film, perhaps the best portrayal of the character I have seen or read and you do seriously feel his pain. But what makes this pain? The Joker. I know how many times it has been said before, but Heath Ledger's Joker makes the film what it was, and still is. This is one of the best movies ever made and really deserves all the positive attention it gets. From the perfect portrayal of its characters to the realism thrown in (boat scene, and questions about utilitarianism) and to the amazing special effects, this truly is cinema/ movie mastery at its best.",1
103,"An almost flawless film. This did not in any way feel like it was 2 and a half hours long, it was the fastest and most exciting two and a half hours I've spent at the cinema, and at home watching this on DVD. If you want a tightly woven story, replete with character threads, themes and actions that have serious consequences, this is definitely the film for you. Heath Ledger is most certainly the star of this film, delivering a solid and menacing performance, that makes you feel like you wouldn't want to cross this guy in real life. Also worth of high praise are Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman, both of whom deliver solid, dramatic and emotive performances. I can't understand how people can watch this film and say it lacks plot depth and texture, seriously, most of the people I know who reviewed this thing had to watch it multiple times to finally grasp and coherently understand all of the themes that permeate this movie, from escalation, terrorism, criminality, evil's triumph over good, there is a lot more to it than the negative reviews seem to be wanting to notice. The editing keeps a fantastic balance of drama, character development and action, and there is never too much of one over the other. A lot of the negative reviews I've seen seem to boil down to either ""over hyped"" or ""too long"". If you're not going to review the film on an objective level, then you may as well just not post a review. The only criticism I'd give of the film is the post-Rachel death scene between Alfred and Wayne, which was a missed opportunity and fairly unconvincingly acted by Bale. Other than that, the film is a must see.",1
104,"Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker and is really the only reason for watching this film (I re-watched his parts quite a bit). The acting is good and it looks great. The rest of the cast is ok, I expected better. To be honest, The parts without the Joker arent even worth watching and are pretty boring and generic. The addition of Two-Face works well for the story but I didnt not care for him as a villian or the actor who played him.",1
105,This movie is a what all movies should be like.  This movie features great acting and superb special effects   .  Heath Ledger's role as Joker is the best of all the jokers there have been.  Everything about this film is great and I loved it,1
106,"The Dark Knight is a well-written, acted and directed film. Nolan delivers again and hits it big in the adaptation of The Joker and how he toys with Batman. This film is dark, exciting and satisfying. The ending is the only part that falls slightly short but only because they cannot put The Joker in the sequel. This film does well in the aspect that it shows how Batman struggles in his internal fight between being morally correct by not killing The Joker or breaking his rules and killing the Joker. It is interesting to see Bruce Wayne's decisions as Batman and how they pan out. Well done. These reasons are why i gave it a 9 out of 10. If i could I would have given it an 8.7 but there are no decimals while rating movies on Metacritic. I recommend this film to anyone wanting to watch a good film that has 2 and a half hours on their time. Enjoy!",1
107,"The Dark Knight was a revolutionary movie of its kind (Superhero movies). It really brings out the darker side to what being a superhero is and how it can affect that person as well as the people around him/her. Not only was unique to other superhero movies but it was superior to them as well as many other movies in terms of acting, special effects and the lasting appeal. Honestly words dont describe how well Heath Ledger played The Joker, as well as the life and 'madness' he brought into this movie. Take the first scene of this movie, where the Joker and his men robbed the bank, and how he tricked them into killing eachother. I have never seen a more absorbing first scene to a movie. Yes I agree that Christian Bale could of put a little more then a deep voice into the Batman character, but being how he was, he really made the villains in the movie (Two Face and Joker) shine. This movie brought a lot to the movie industry and would be hard to top as a superhero movie. I think this movie outshone both the Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises in almost all aspects and should not be treated as merely any old movie. Overall it tops my list and I highly encourage everyone to watch it.",1
108,"Although it has its flaws, it is a wonderfully crafted piece of epic crime drama that explodes past expectations with an excellent script, exhilarating special effects, amazing acting, and powerful themes.",1
109,TDK is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Joker did a great job. The script is fabulous. Chris  did well. I think Christoper Nolan is something. I mean he is genius. This is one of my period favorite movies.,1
110,"This is a true superhero movie. An exquisite Masterpiece, in this film there is a touch of realism that bring you into the world of Batman. It is unbelievable seeing this film in comparison to Tim Burton Batman back in the 1990s. Nolan have took away the gothic and traditional perception of the characters and made it his own. Batman is no long wearing rubber suits, the joker is no long flamboyant, Alfred is no long just a guy carrying tea around the place and Harvey Dent is no longer the guy with a perfectly halfed red face. These characters changed for the better in this film. Heath Ledger is am absolute inspiration to all of us, when I walked into the cinemas on the opening night I didn't expect much, I didn't know who is in the film apart from the names on the poster and I thought ""it's a new batman film lets see how this one in compared to the others"" from the first second when the DC comic sign sppeared on screen the soundtrack behind it create a huge suspense, I have no idea where it is going to lead me then it starts, the glass shatters, the guns started to go off then the joker appeared. At that point that was the very first time I saw the joker, and ""holy **** I thought to myself. The look on the jokers face scared the sh** out of me I didn't know it is going look like that. It thought another Tim Burton joker, but I was completely shocked the action continues and does not allow you to have a breath. That's why this movie is so good thats why ""it makes the marvel movies look silly"" The stunts, the action, the story, the acting and the interaction between characters really capture you into this movie. Today this film is on DVD or Blue Ray but while The Dark Knight Rises is on screen, The Dark Knight is also playing in IMAX theatres so why no go see it on the massive screen again it's worth every cent!",1
111,"This is just a great film. It's over every superhero movie because of it's complex story, spectacular acting (Heath Ledger deserved that Oscar (R.I.P.) and entertaining action. I don't know why some people say this movie is just ""good"". That's complete jelaousy! F***ing haters.",1
112,one of the fantastic movie i have ever watched.... i am obsessed about it... everyone should watch this movie... have fun.............................,1
113,"Everything about this movie wins, the actors, the plot, the action-sequences, the soundtrack, and every other  factor that i've regrettably decided to leave out to keep this review brief. It's really surprising considering that every other DC film for the past few decades (Batman Begins being the obvious exception) has been quite the **** but from start to finish, the Dark Knight will have you glued to your screen, a must watch for anyone with a soul, and even more so for fans of Heath Ledger, the best actor ever :D",1
114,"You want action?! You got it!! You want a 185 million dollar movie that is perfect?! You got it!! You want the best f***ing batman movie ever?!?! YOU GOT IT!!!!!!!! It's just heaven for Batman and Cinema buffs alike. Hollywood should learn their lesson about making constant crap comic book movies. DC and MARVEL are the two big competitors while Dark Horse just sits quietly in the background and makes only a handful of movies that include the Mask, Sin City and the Goon which is yet to come out.DC has finally made a masterful super hero movie again. In an era where superhero movies unfortunately rule everything in the movie industry this is the golden light of the genre. Heath Ledger's performance made the movie for real. Without him it would still be great but not perfect. That's how important he is. MARVEL should learn from DC's masterpiece and not make another like MARVEL's Wolverine Origins. I hated that movie. The Dark Knight is a golden movie that nobody should miss out on. simple as that.",1
115,"is the best movie about Batman, because almost all the cast and special effects that could use very well. The actor who do Joker is fantastic, but the woman who makes Rachel she has attitude and is very ugly",1
117,"Easily the best movie ever made. Joker was more than outstanding. Christian bale was the best batman, the only reason the other users think he's just avg is because he couldn't do what heath ledger did.",1
118,"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is a quintessential masterpiece that I will never forget. Everything ranging from terrific narrative all the way to Heath Ledger's terrifying take as the Joker succeeded every way that the movie had done to satisfy me after watching it. Without a doubt, this is the best superhero movie of all-time.",1
119,"I was scrolling down this page looking at reviews for this film, surprised to see more negative than mixed reviews. I ended up reading the word 'overrated' a lot. I have absolutely no clue what these people are talking about, because this film is an absolute masterpiece of epic proportions. In my personal opinion, its the best superhero film ever made. And Heath Ledger as the Joker. Oh my god. Even if you hated this film, you have to agree that Ledger's performance as the Joker is stellar. He is, and always will be, the greatest Joker to ever come on screen. All of the cast is brilliant. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, the list goes on. I think the main reason I admire this film so much is that not only is it a superhero movie, it also fits nicely into the crime-drama genre. Batman has never seemed so real. A must see for superhero fans and movie fans alike.",1
123,"This movie is really just trying to disguise what it is. What it is is just another Batman movie. It added pointless layers of depth to itself so that critics could not write it off as another superhero movie. I liked it when it was just Batman beating the crap out of criminals, and not Batman being a political figure. I usually like Christopher Nolan movies, but he really was overloading this one and makes it complicated enough that the regular audience of Batman films (6-10 yr olds) wont enjoy it and end up calling it boring. In short, great as a superhero movie and confused as a political thriller.",1
140,Christopher Nolan is by far an excellent director while making this epic hit!,1
141,"If you removed Heath Ledger from this film then it would be trash. The only good parts of the film are with the Joker and Heath puts on an amazing performance that will make you go out and buy the film and re-watch it just for him. The main cast was rather disapointing, The entire film was a bit too long for my taste, and it was actually rather boring outside of the parts with the Joker.",1
142,"Really overrated by users imo. The only thing good about this movie is Heath Ledger as the Joker, which is simply the most untouchable performance of the year imo, and the only reason one should watch this movie.",1
143,"The thing about The Dark Knight is that there's so much build up going on through the entire movie. The movie does a good job of juggling multiple villians, like how Batman Begins was. Joker is the main villian, and Lau and Salvatori Maroni are the other villians. There's also a lot of bad guys in this. The action is a big step up in this one to as there's not only more action than Begins, but the quality is a little better. The last dilema with the Joker and the ships felt a bit rushed though, but the movie quickly picked up at the finale. The screentime for this movie is longer than a few other superhero movies at 2hrs.18min without credits. But the pacing throughout the movie is so well done that the movie feels more like 2hrs than that time. The movie is so intense at times it may be a bit uncomfortable. But the intensity is not violent as there's blood or a lot of cursing in it.  The plot and issues just make it feel intense. Overall the movie haves a couple of flaws but it's certainly awesome.",1
144," Movie was too long, and got kind of stale in the end....Kept wanting to kill myself every time I heard Batman's voice. Also if he would have killed Joker in the beginning he could have saved like 50 people. Batman lets his own personal heroics get in the way of saving people.",0
145, Heath Ledger was fabulous as you couldn't take your eyes off of him. He is much deserving of an OSCAR. But what this had to do with the fun that is Batman is what takes this movie down for me. Everytime Batman appeared it ruined what otherwise was a very serious dark movie. I don't know if I was alone but that is the way I felt. If the Batman character was removed from the film I may have given this a ten.,0
147," Sadistic, gratuitous violence and a rehash of borrowed ideas with no plot, horrible dialogue and worse acting. Ledger played a psycho well but his voice sounded like Al Franken, made me giggle, and made it impossible for me to get into his actions. An absolutely horrible waste of time.",0
148," Completely overhyped, absolute sh*t.",0
150," Under normal circumstances this movie might get a two or three, but given all the bloated praise it's gotten elsewhere I think the zero is warranted. It's way too long, way too self-serious, and often makes little sense. My girlfriend and I were close to walking out because by the end we were exhausted by all the explosions, heavy-handed dialogue and thudding, stupid music. Batman Begins was fun, but this is just a loud, pretentious bore.",0
151," Dour, self important, bloated, overly long and pretentious film. The pseudo philosophical posturing of the joker was obnoxious and unnecessary. Instead of leaving the audience to ponder the difference between good and evil, if there is such a thing the creators feel the need to spell it our in stilted dialogue hamtastically delivered by all but the character of Alfred.",0
152," I was the victim of the marketing campain. I payed 9 euros and left at the half of the movie dissapointed. Ledger performance looks good but probably overrated by his premature death. This movie, like many other hollywoodian productions is nothing else than a capitalist excentricity with no artistic and cinematical value.",0
153," Gotham is portrayed as a town full of sheep who can only be saved by some fearless leader in whom they all have to believe in the same way that Germans believed in der Fuhrer. There is no community, just huddled masses yearning to be saved. And who will save them? Maybe the District Attorney, by prosecuting criminals? But no, he can't prevail against the evil Joker, so it has to be a super-wealthy guy who is the head of a massive weapons manufacturing company, and who moonlights as a gadget-driven crime fighter. He also apparently holds the purse strings to the D.A. guy (and the film has no problem with that), so let's face it, folks, Mr. Super Wealthy holds the fate of the city in his heavily-armored hands. To justify this monster, we need a greater monster, just like Cheney needs bin Laden. That's where the Joker comes in. Mr. Super Wealthy even develops a system for spying on every single square inch of space within the entire city, all justified by Mr. Joker, since he's so very, very bad. In short, this film should be offensive to anyone who believes in our Constitution's Bill of Rights. As for the drama, the plot is full of holes you could drive a Batmobile through, which the film does again and again, filling plot problems with gadgetry as needed, which is all of the time. I saw this on an IMAX screen and the aerial city views were fantastic; hence the 1 point in my rating. And Heath Ledger was very good at portraying a psychotic criminal, but unfortunately having a character with completely insane behavior tends to liberate the plot from sensible constraints, and so ""what happens next"" trumps ""why did it happen"" just about every time. My view seems to be in the minority, but if you saw this and liked it, after reading this, please ask yourself why. One more thing: Quite apart from its politics, I honestly thought that it was a bore.",0
154," Pure bilge. All the talk about this being the darkest Batman film is pure nonsense: Batman never deviates from his task or even tries to kill the joker (as he did with a kamikaze batwing attack in Burton's film). I'm not going to bother commenting on the rest but suffice to say it's confused, pretentious and self-important when it's really about as deep as something written by a barely-literate 15-year-old. I can see the lad right now, his dedication to his art total as he writes countless pages of description for each and every explosion. Watching the action sequences is about as exhausting as reading such descriptions. I disagree that Ledger was masterful as the Joker: how can somebody whose only background is made up of a handful of simple lies be even considered as a character? All the joker is is a plot device to string all of the scenes together: a bit like a tireless football player playing keepie uppies for the film's entire duration: about two hours too long. Absolute tripe, only Quantum of Solace makes this look good. I'd give that a zero too, but wouldn't waste my time saying why!",0
157," Ledger was amazing... easily the part of The Dark Knight. However, the film was unnecessarily convoluted, lacked any substantial depth, and could quickly devolve into cheap Hollywood banality. People are losing their shit over this movie, and trust me when I say I really wanted to like it, but i just ended up being extremely disappointed.",0
158,"The Dark Knight is the most overhyped event in the past 10 years. Batman Begins was pretty good, but this? THIS?? Chris Nolan went experimental and tried to do a ""big movie"" about crime, anarchy and stuff, but kind of forgot its entertainment value. The film has excellent cinematography and does have good acting with a solid performance of Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger as the Joker is the most unique interpretation of a psycho killer with a level of craziness Johnny Depp can only dream of, but there is no point in having solid performances if there is no plot nor story. I am not going to write a plot overview for this movie because there isn't one. Did something really happen in this movie? Was there something worth telling? Sorry if you're a fan, but there was no point in making this ""film"". No story in a 2 and half hour long movie is dreadful, I'd rather watch something like Watchmen Ultimate Cut with a running time of 3 and a half hours than this, this film is interesting as long as the running time and then it's over. Can you recall any moment in this film? No? I'm not surprised, That is why I say this film lacked a story. Batman Begins will be remembered for being influential, The Dark Knight will only be remembered by its huge hype and overrated reviews.",0
159," Awful editing, trite and implausible storytelling, cartoonish characters, annoying Batman voice, to many eye-rolling moments, nerve-grating Joker lip-licking (to mock Tom Arnold??), too jumbled film-making, kowtowing to the whims of fanboys all equal a zero from this moviegoer who is grateful he didn't have to pay to see it.",0
161,"Overrated as Hell! I do not understand why people say this piece of trash is so good. Especially when they say ""It's a classic- right up there with The Godfather."" Uhhhhh...... NO! Some poor performances (cough, cough, Bale), an over complicated plot (just like all Nolan movies), cheesy lines, and some pretty awful action scenes all contribute to making this movie one awful pile of crap.",0
162,"most overrated movie i've ever seen in entire my life. it's not even close to classic movies such as the godfather, the lord of the rings, casablanca, citizen kane and etc.",0
165, Bullshit. No one would waste that much money to fight crime. So many things destroyed. How could anyone tolerate such loses. This is the real reason why I think Batman wanted to quit. It had nothing to do with remaining hidden. The story is flawed.,0
166, What happened to the Batman character as he appeared to be 3rd string in this very dark homicidal tribute to Heath Ledger AKA The Joker. No one cared about Batman as Heath Ledger was so perverted that all eyes were rivited on him. This movie is NOT appropriate for young children. Very little humor and way too much violence for my taste.,0
167, The movie had a lot of action and very creative in the way that batman used his bag of tricks. But things just didn't make sense. The joker was all powerful and he did things and things were done as if he could do magic. It was very frustrating to watch when things didn't make sense. I expected a lot more. Iron man was a lot better.,0
168," Typical summer action movie with lots of blam blam punctuated by bits of sadism. Thirty minutes too long. I was bored by the end. A friend actually fell asleep. Had they cut it shorter, it would have actually been a better, more interesting movie. But, in true Hollywood fashion, they had to connect all the dots for us hapless movie goers. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was top notch and the highlight of the movie. Rachel was not up to the part. There were some interesting moments but the end was one long slog. Wait for it on cable.",0
169, How can people like such NON sense!?! This movie is one big joke! The plot is so complex to the point where it doesn't make sense. And why does Wayne's voice suddenly go deep when he wears his batman outfit? A violent movie for grown up children is what this movie really is.,0
170," too many stunts, too much unnecessary violence and too much unbelievable scenes. reflects a huger society on violence and revenge. other than that, a good movie for a raged teenager that loves violent videogames ",0
171," This movie was nothing more than another Hollywood action flick, completely void of depth, character development, or a remotely interesting story. If you're a mindless ape who enjoys action and Stalone and all that then you will adore it. If you're a pretentious 20 year old who reads nothing but comic books and doesn't know a thing about films beside Hollywood mockery then you wil love it. And for those of you who stick up your noses and say ""you just didn't get it"", there is nothing to get, watch a film by Tarkovsky and maybe you will understand what depth and art put to film actually is. ANd if yuo're saying it is the best film of 2008 when all you have watched are pathetic American Hollywood films then just keep quiet.",0
172," Too long, too muddled, too rushed. It felt like there was enough material for 3 films. While in the Batman suit Bale speaks like McGruff the crime dog. While this is by far the best of the franchise, that's really not enough. Accolades like ""best comic movie ever"" don't really cut it because comic book movies haven't set the bar very high to begin with. The two face plot wasn't flushed out enough. Good job by Ledger though.",0
173," Batman Begins was excellent, but what happened to the characters? This movie is one over the top dramatic moment after another...and wow, 2 1/2 hours? I was looking at my watch after an hour. Seems like all these directors of superhero movies try to pump up the volume in their sequels--and they lose their heart and humanity. There was no drama and suspense--all big surprises. Heath Ledger is excellent, but he was the only one with any decent lines. This was an overblown mess and a big disappointment.",0
174,"A great acting job (heath ledger) does not make up for a terrible plot. no climax or depth to the storyline, made it impossible to have any attachment or regard for the outcome of any particular character. even with nearly 3 hour length, the movie couldn't go in depth in to any of the scenes and just strung together random high speed bursts of action one after another that still somehow failed to captivate.",0
175,"Il peggior Joker che abbia mai visto, niente a che spartire con Jack Nicholson, e poi vogliamo parlare di Due Facce? Un personaggio buttato lì solo per riempire una mezz'oretta di film in più",0
176," Agree with Ty Burr, Boston Globe: ""Ten tons of expressionist murk... Dirty Harry crossed with Hamlet."" They tried too hard, lost all depth of plot and texture. Just because a movie is ""disturbing"" does *not* make it ""art."" ""...Begins"" was much better.",0
177," Plodding and hamfisted. Terrible script. Good ideas, but ruined by having every thematic idea telegraphed over and over (and over and over and over...) in the least subtle way possible. Basically, it was like having anvils labeled ""important moral allegory"" thrown at your head every five minutes for three hours. That, and it occurred to me that Gotham wouldn't need Batman so much if the Gotham cops weren't so blindingly stupid. I mean come on--while transporting Dent one of the cops practically says ""This looks like a trap. Let's walk right in to it.""",0
178, The IMAX format is spectacular. Too bad I can't say the same for the film itself.,0
179, Way too violent and long. Much ado about nothing.,0
180," Batman Begins was terrible, and Bale brings his same I'm-so-cool ""acting"" into this one. I miss Michael Keaton.",0
181, Dark Knight ruined Batman - series should have never been written. DC should be ashamed!,0
182,So long.. so very long,0
183," This movie sucked such terrific ass that I just almost can't believe I sat through the whole epic length thing. I learned early on that I couldn't get too wrapped up in any of the characters due to the idiotic way people kept turning into caricatures of themselves. Usually I'm not a violent person, but I kept wishing people would just die and stay dead. Batman made you like him even less by speaking in a strange he-man voice that no actual person would ever use for any reason whatsoever. By the last time the hoary-voiced dark avenger fell, I hoped he would stay dead so I could just get the f*ck out of there.",0
185," Inept political thriller dished up as a Batman movie, lacking in imagination and a decent story. Ledger's Joker was the only praiseworthy element but even so, nothing spectacular. If the poor guy hadn't had died this movie would not have been so insanely overhyped.",0
186,"Self-indulgent pretentious crap. He ruined the Batman series. Mindless trash this was. Still hate it to this day. No wonder everybody hated the last one, its because this one was the set up to an even worse one.",0
187," Yes I admit Heath Ledger turned in a very impressive performance. Christian Bale was also good and there was some excellent technology and special effects. Drawbacks were the combination of it being generally a downer combined with being too long. A hero is someone you're willing to watch go through all kinds of hell as long as he is triumphant in the end. It is depressing that he has to sacrifice virtually everything including nearly his life, catches the bad guy, and yet still ends up persecuted in the end by an annoyingly over-righteous mindset. The chemistry with Maggie Gyllenhall is non-existent compared to Katie and she remains also irritatingly righteous where again, Batman seems to sacrifice absolutely everything in order to help people and yet it is still not good enough for her. Maggie also is simply not attractive enough for this role. As a comparison, when you walk out of Ironman, you feel good, when you walk out of Dark Night, you feel depressed.",0
188,"Nolan finally reveals his ability that it is not skill to bring forth a gritty ""realism"" to a comic book movie, but a lack of complete and utter imagination to fulfill a fantasy based character.  To be honest the film itself was not that bad, had it not been an hour too long.  Had the movie ended after Rachel Dawson died, and the reveal of two-face, it would end on such a somber ""Empire Strikes Back"" note, and really left the audience in a state of wonder and a need for me.  But instead Nolan decides to continue on for an hour where he plateaus with his boring action sequence, and than killing off two face in on of the worst ending in comic book history since Fantastic Four.  Too damn long, but of course, Heath Ledger shines bright",0
189, Confused & too long.,0
190," All right, I wasn't going to say anything because this is the internet. But all the morons here saying this film is ""art"" or the closest movies will ever get to art- how dare you? How could you say something so ignorant when you haven't bothered to study anything about films? Try watching films by Ingmar Bergman like Winter Light. Watch films by Andrei Tarkovsky like Andrei Rublev and Mirror. Watch Ozu films like Late Spring and Floating Weeds. I don't care if you loved the movie or whatever- I personally thought the film was hollow, worthless, and nothing new. But don't you dare say this is the highest the art form has to offer- it's barely a step above the lowest.",0
191,"The dark knight is not a superhero film but a film about a messed up rich guy who wears a clad black suit like a pornstar and some psychotic hippy clown criminal who has a confusing personality. That's right folks I'm calling this film not the best because it has no super in it and gives you a sad and disappointing view of real life. The plot, characters, and whole presence makes you so pissed off and the critics call it the perfect superhero film what a load of **** Yeah I just said it **** and who really cars if I say a few swear words, it just my own opinion. The most part that makes me angry is that health ledger's joker is the supervillain, I prefer the Jack Nicholson version and to give a dead guy a award for good acting is like walking off a bridge. I admit some of the action scenes were cool but I'm no batman fan. I'm a loyal superman fan and I think the man of steel is way better than this crappy film. So that's my review of a extremely overrated film that died so much in disgrace that it could never make me pleasant",0
192," Stupid Idiotic movie of the worst kind Jumbled plot, meaningless violence and sadistic We have hit real low for so many critics to give such high marks",0
193," A numbing movie. Why is everyone on the Ledger bandwagon? Yes, it was an enjoyable performance. But keep in mind how juicy the role was and that any number of actors could have given equally enjoyable performances.",0
194, Soooo long. So very very long. And too loud. Or is that just the cinema? Joker is great but hes not joker. Just a psycho with make up. U don't see the crazy fun house mad house joker from the original and its just toooo long.,0
195,"This movie is so dry, pretentious and humorless that my cat became depressed after watching it with me and starved herself to death. Also all the expository dialogue and mindless pop philosophy made me schizophrenic. I'm now sharpening my knives and ordering the Halloween mask from EBay. Close your windows, Chris ""Pretentious Hack"" Nolan, I'm gonna avenge my kitty!",0
196,"This is by far one of the worst movies of all time, I never liked batman because he has no super powers, all he has is money and weapons there is no fun because that means there is less explosions and that's sad.The story is horrendous, it's weak compare to the previous batman films, it has no style and it isn't fun like batman forever, the movie tried to be deep but no one cares because I as an audiance member want to see batman beat homeless people up, I don't care that batman has emotions, I wanted action and explosions, but even in the action scenes the movie fails completely because they use pratical effects, Christopher Nolan should know that we use computers for a reason now but he's such a pretentious dork so there is no intensity.The characters were awful, they were depressing and not fun, I remember the good old days where super heroes were fun and quirky like in batman forever, batman was too deep of a character to be interesting and honestly Christian Bale isn't fun enough to be batman, they should've pick Marlon Wayans, he fits the character perfectly and the vilain was forgettable.The dark knight fails on every single level, the story is way too intelligent to be fun, the characters are way too deep to be considered good, the soundtrack is too depressing and the effects look to real to be enjoyable, stay away from this objectivily bad film !!!",0
197," I'm baffled by all the superlatives being showered on this film. I'm a huge fan of Nolan, Bale, Caine, Oldman, Gyllenhaal but really, this film was competely uninvolving. Bruce/Batman was given short shrift in this screenplay, it's the wonderful Christian Bale who breathes soul into every miniscule oppurtunity he is given. There is no back story, no fleshing out of any character except Harvey Dent. The film starts as if we've caught it in mid-low. And honestly, this hype over Ledger's performance is too inflated. For me, Tim Burton's Penguin is the greatest villain in the Batman series - evil, tragic, repelling and attracting at the same time. Jack Nicholson's Joker could have done with an editing job, but my goodness, the portrayal itself was one of brilliance and insane originality. Ledger was an actor of great promise, but the praise over his Joker seems out of perspective & proportion. This edition of Batman was a case of overkill, OD'ing on the dark element (not a single touch of genuine wit), over-indulging on the philosophizing and the explosions/mayhem. All in all, a superhero film that takes itself too seriously. It's tragic that some of the finest young directors ( Bryan Singer, etc.) are frittering their prime years away on superhero franschises. Christopher Nolan, please come out of your Bat Cave black hole and give us something worthwhile to watch, again.",0
198,"This movie was brilliant, entertaining to the people who love in-depth conversations to the people who love explosions. So much drama, I dont see where it fails to have plot, basically its a simple battle of philosophies, nothing more, but nothing needed, he taints other people to madness, what more do you need? Even if it doesnt have plot, it doesnt NEED plot, suspense, action, conflicting philosophies, drawbacks to madness are all you truly need. It took Joker and evolved him to the next level.",0
199," Ledger was terrifyingly good. The plot is weak, the movie interminably long and vicious. PG-13 ? If this is entertainment, we are a society in trouble.",0
202, This wasn't Batman or a cartoon caper turned into a movie. It was a SLASHER movie with gore and way too much violence. How is this PG 13?,0
205," Actually deserves a 3, but there are too many 10's. What were people watching. I agree with all of those that thought it made no sense. The motivations of the characters were entirely random. This entry could be pages long with all the problems. Ya, Ledger was fun to watch, thus the 3. But the rest was terrible. At some point the viewer just gives up assuming any of it will make any sense. Where is Adam West when you need him?",0
206, This isn't a comic book movie; this is a superlative crime drama.,1
208," Very over-hyped. Batman is supposed to be fun, not philosophical thesis with bad action. And what's up with the Heath Ledger hype? He never was very amazing. Take a chill pill people. The hero had rubber years for god's sake!",0
209,"A Batman for the ages? No. Brokeback Joker in medical professional drag playing clinical terrorist unnerves like a Robin Cook hospital thriller, but it doesn't out-evil the Nazi overtones of Jack's Joker(Tim Burton's ""Batman""), in which the bipolar master criminal defaces great works of art to a devil-may-care purple soundtrack. Because ""The Dark Knight"" distances itself from the comic book, largely by demythologizing Gotham as a fantasia of improbable architecture and rebuilding it into a city that could host Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed""(a remake of Wai-keung Lau & Siu Fai Mak's ""Mou gaan dou""(American title: ""Internal Affairs""); the term ""internal affairs"" is sprinkled throughout the film), the notion of a grown man running around in a bat suit(nipples, or no nipples), comes off as nonsensical and extraneous, in a film spawned from children's literature that purports to be taken seriously; that wants to be mentioned in the same breath with a film by Scorsese, and not, say, ""Catwoman"". But ""The Dark Knight"" caught my attention late in the game when Batman(Christian Bale) asks Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman) to play Orwellian games with the public at-large. The evocation of the Patriot Act turns into an endorsement of conservative ideology because it helps Batman keep Gotham safe. The end justifies the means. The Dark Knight is our outgoing president and Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart) stands for America. He's ideology in the flesh. Which half, which face, reminds you of our country in terms of the war against terrorism and foreign policy? The filmmaker asserts that our president's legacy, regarding the five-thousand dead and rising overseas, will change from a war criminal into a fall guy, for the country with two faces, once hindsight is given the once over and the history books are written accordingly.",1
213," Much worse than the first. Since when did Batman become hated and a villain? I didn't like that Nolan tried to pitch Batman that way.... the only good thing about the film was Ledger's acting, which is first-rate. Too bad it couldn't have a lighter end.",0
214, I really wanted to like this movie but was very disappointed with it. It was long and rambling and I was bored by it. What a let down!,0
216, Bad. Ledger ruined the film. Re-edited to get all joker scenes in. If Heath gets an ocar it is beacuse he died and nothing to do with acting.,0
217, This movie was no good the plot was the same old same old,0
219, Batmanan has a speech impediment; the Joker needs a chap stick to nurse his dry lips; the script is sophomoric; the girl anything but sexy; the photography chaotic. Found it so boring I almost fell asleep. For a guy who adored the comic strip when he was a kid this just doesn't hack it.,0
220," EXTREMELY overrated. Too long, bland overacting on Christian Bale's part, a forgettable Maggie Gyllenhaal and two-face, pretentious scatterbrained writing and plot, not to mention it lacks the ""dark"" part in dark knight; completely cheesy. Speaking of cheesy, Batman's voice...wow. The ONLY thing that saved this movie was Heath Ledger, and now he's dead. The franchise is over.",0
221,"The dark knight will be the best movie of the year and possibly the best Batman movie ever. The only one that comes close is Batman Begins.  If you didn't like the first one, it is probably because your I.Q. is too low to see all that is going on.  My I.Q. is 148 and I still had to watch it several times before I fully understood the story and dialogue.  Only then can you appreciate Christopher Nolan's genius and the great actors that make the newest Batman sequel.",1
222,"I thought I was staying up to midnight to see a great COMICBOOK movie. I didn't. Instead I saw a GREAT comicbook MOVIE, the first one since Spider-Man 2! I can't fathem five supporting actors between now and the end of the year that could possibly shove Heath Ledger out of, at least, a nomination for the Oscar. I'm having a hard time thinking of five performances EVER that were better. GO SEE IT!",1
223,"Spot on. Actually, beyond my expectations. One of the few long movies that requires the time to tell the story well and that seems to go by quickly. The complexities of the sotry and characters is wonderful. Let's see if this Batman series can keep the next movie(s) up to *this* par!",1
225," I love dark movies -- Pan's Labyrinth, Apocalypse Now -- but Dark Knight isn't dark: it's sick. If you like horror movies like Hostel and Saw III, maybe this'll be up your line -- but come on: a cell phone stitched into a guy's stomach and rigged to explode crosses a line for me. There's no point, no message, just sick, disturbing sadism.",0
226," I like superhero movies. This is the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. Christian Bale gave the worst performance I've seen from him. Heath Ledger gave a mediocre impersonation of Jim Carrey mixed with Jack Nicholson. His make up was good, but that's about the best I can say. The movie had nothing to say. The dialog was bad. The special effects were okay, but nothing special and there was not an ounce of coolness in the movie. I am completely mystified by the high ratings people give this movie.",0
227, This movie is no fun. It satisfies the fanboys' desire to have their comic book heroes taken seriously. That's where I think all this fan adulation is coming from. But that totally misses the point. Where's the fun? Where is the superheroic fantasy adventure? The self-referential coyness? This Batman is scary and repulsive. The little boy in me doesn,0
230," trite, predictable, boring, long-winded. Christian bale's muppet-voice was the low point of the movie.",0
231, Has nothing over Batman Begins!!!!,0
232, A apt production for the Dark knight series. Heath ledger's Joker is quite possibly one of the best villains of all time. The movie sets the bar pretty high for all superhero movies and should be counted as one of best movies all time.,1
233, Overhyped and overrated. Not well done. If not for Heath Ledger dying this movie would have a score of about 6. Bad Batman film who was 3rd string.,0
234," Historically, the most overhyped movie ever released. This corny monstrosity beats any Michael Bay film in the size of nativity. Plus the amount of epilogs is just overwhelming. Everyone sacrifices for everyone, and the bad guy is flipping a coin for every hostage. Pathetic.",0
235, Very disappointing after the rave reviews - I fell asleep twice - mindless teenage twaddle.,0
237," Walked out after the 70 minute mark, there's only so much overlong pointless and ridicluously illogical action without plot one can take. Should have been called Transformers II. A pork chop labelled as a steak.",0
238,"A very average film. Heath Ledger created a fine Joker, but to compare him with Nicholson and favor him is insulting. He's essentially just playing a pretty generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker and can't really dazzle after a scene or two. Christian Bale is completely wooden in his role as Bruce Wayne and Batman seemed to be in the movie just to warrant this movie to be called a sequal. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are there to lend credibility and when they were on the screen, the movie was actually pretty great. Pitty though that they only got about 1 % of the movie's screen time. Aaron Eckhardt was given nada to work with and was equally wasted. But who can really be surprised. Just too many inane plot turns which just pulls you further and further away from wanting to find out where it all was heading. I Walked out after the 90 minute mark to get a smoke and didn't bother to walk back into the theatre. The evening was saved appraoching a pretty girl at the bar serving overpriced booze. We ended up at her place and we danced till the first rays of morning sunlight found their way through the raggid drapes covering a cracked windowpane. As she peeled of my clothes as if I was a ripe tangerine, she whispered softly in my ear a mantra of passion. Film:   1/****Night:  4/****",0
239," Extremely overrated film. Jack Nicholson did a much better job with the role of the joker. Chris Bale's acting was mediocre. A predictable plot. Definitely not worthy of all the praise it's been receiving. As far as batman films go, the last one (Batman Begins) was more satisfying.",0
240, Lousy movie; boring; bad guys are recasts of bad 70's movie; this only gets hype because of Heath Ledger's death. wish more people were brave enough to say so. a 10 year old could have made this a better more wicked movie. even the makeup on Heath was ridiculous.,0
241,"I really wanted to like this film, with all the pre-release hype and positive comments from critics/the general public it seemed that it would be a film with which could be engaged with at an intellectual level. Boy was I wrong! It turned out to be a poorly constructed political thriller with way too many plot turns than sense and a run time which would make even the most composed people become mind numbingly bored. Sure the movie had some great elements, a fantastic, and haunting score, ridiculous stunts, and a few noteworthy scenes by the late Heath Ledger, although the performance on a whole was average, certainly not Oscar worthy when stacked up next to the performance by Robert Downey Jnr. in ",0
242, Good acting does not make up for a poor story and worse plot. If you were a thief and a career criminal would you sign on to work for the fellow who murdered all his accomplices on a bank job? Would this same fellow have such a great following that his army of loyal criminal followers would plant explosives to implode an entire hospital and for fun plant more explosives on two ships to play russian roulette just for the fun of it...no money? What a crock. Dumbest story and most out of character foolishness I've ever seen in a Batman comic or movie. Bush's crazy terrorist run amock...yea right.,0
243," There's so much I can say of this movie, firstly it has too many useless sub-plots, we kind of saw this same thing in Spider-man 3 but at least those were connected to the main story. Second, it's a PG-13 film and it starts with an action scene, that's good, but it then throws in 20 minutes of politics and boring non-sense that would make anyone sleep. Third, it doesn't even have much to do with Batman, yes, it did focus on the Joker, Dent and Bruce Wayne, but at the end it only appeared to be focused on the environments and not the story. It's good that it doesn't go with the predictable ending cliche of most films nowadays, but hell, I'm a Batman fan, been one since a child and I couldn't even keep up with the film, when it ended I didn't even know what had happened. Definitely overrated.",0
244," Totally OVERRATED. Boring film, poor idea. Nolan should not continue Batman like this. Heath Ledger's performance was good, but he was not The Joker we all know.",0
245,"The Best of the Best of all superhero movie. I saw this. And i absolutely love the story and the actions scenes. This dark visual style of Nolan is so like and epic drama action superhero movie.  Heath ledger, you will be missed. For those of your who give this a 5 or less, you don't understand what is the true meaning of the movie is. then back off",1
248, Batman was used as a guise to draw us into a slasher movie. With HL dying the advance PR worked fabulously. If not for the PR this movie would draw flies. The PG 13 rating only goes to prove that the Motion Picture ratings can be bought. Do not bring any children to this bloodfest.,0
249, A boring action movie.,0
253, Pretentious and dull movie. Most episodes of Batman the animated series are MUCH better than this. It is too serious and too shallow at the same time.,0
254,"what a super snooze. the acting, especially from that maggie granny face gylenhaal, is atrocious - the one liners are cheesy without the kitsch factor. so done before, every inch of it felt like watching a 90's movie. dreary and drab. me and my mate left before the end i dont ever care to know.",0
255," Episodic, hard to follow, dumb, and the girl was unappealing. Yes, Heath Ledger was great, but the movie was not worth sitting through to watch his performance. The Batman movies are just aggregations of special effects shlock, fluff-candy for the masses.",0
256,The Dark Knight is a brilliant masterpiece that I truly enjoyed. It had great acting and a great plot. The action was great and so was the screenplay. This movie surely will go down as one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.,1
257,"I will admit The Dark Knight is a tough film to get into. The story is complicated especially for a film based on a comic book. The beginning is information overload and could turn some people off. However, once the Joker shows up and chaos ensues the film really picks up. You get into the story, which is great. The film is enhanced by some great performances especially by Heath Leadger. While some of the acting could have been better it is still good and nothing terrible. The story is lengthy and may have benefited from being two films; but it did not bother me as much the second time. The further you get into the film the better it gets. Overall, The Dark Knight is not just a great superhero movie but a great film. It has a deep story, good characters, and some nice filming to top it of. If you have not seen this film yet check it out its great. You do not have to like Batman to enjoy this film. It is an interesting take on some well-known characters and I love it. I enjoyed the Dark Knight a lot the second time around and I am probably going to see it again in the future multiple times.",1
258,"Christopher Nolan's revival of Batman has been well done, especially how comic book movies are done. It's better than it used to be and that's a good thing, but when you're dealing with some comic books, sometimes a 2-d image or costume doesn't translate well in to live action. The overall look of Batman's redesign falls into the pleasantly surprised category for me, although I did prefer the more ""flowing cape"" look, but that would probably be a mess when they fight. The Dark Knight is a pretty typical action movie, although with a good deal of twists that, depending on how you look at it, are more predicable than others, although there was one or two that caught me for a surprse. To me though, the movie was really about the Joker. Heath Ledger outdid himself there to the point that I don't think I'd want to see anyone else try to do a Joker like he did. He took a pretty standard movie about a deranged psychopath who hunts down criminals to bring them to justice and made it into a more nuanced movie about the motivations of two competing psychopaths (Joker and Batman, and if you think Batman isn't a psycho...whoa boy). The sad thing is that the other actors, and especially Bale (whom I'm a huge fan of since Empire of the Sun and American Psycho) have these characters with very little depth, and her comes Ledger with a well thought out, scarily authentic Joker and he just destroys any reason for me to want to watch any scenes without him. And that was probably my main issue with The Dark Knight, is that the other characters just couldn't keep up, but that doesn't make it a bad movie and your mileage may vary depending on how much you like action. There are some very, very intense moments between him and Batman, and they are excellent to see the two interact. Outside of that I found my attention wandering and I have found little reason to want to watch the movie again, aside from seeing Ledger's Joker one more time. Great for a comic book adaptation of a movie and sadly an amazing final performance for Ledger.",1
259,"The Dark Knight, thanks to its great continuation to Batman Begins, an incredible cast, amazing action, an excellent script, great directing, great score, and just the incredible filmmaking, The Dark Knight is not only one of the best comic book movies of all time, it is one of the best movies of all time. Never has a film with this much hype surpass its expectations, definitely go see this one!",1
260,Heath Ledger is the best Joker out of them all and has possibly the best performance I've ever seen. But Christian Bales voice ruins this whole experience. He tried too hard to sound like a bad ass that it transformed his voice into the sound someone with throat cancer makes.,1
261,"The most overrated movie of the new millenium.  I loved Batman Begins. In fact, it's maybe the best comic book film of all time. It has everything The Dark Knight lacks (interesting main, secondary and tertiary characters, villains with compelling motivation, a fresh take on Bruce Wayne and Batman). Here's what's wrong with The Dark Knight:No characters of any interest: Rachel Dawes is given nothing to do but die; Harvey Dent is a vanilla bore until he becomes Two-Face and then, right when he could get interesting, they give him short shrift (barely 10 minutes of screen time); Eric Roberts plays a mob boss like a thousand other movie mob bosses, completely forgettable (Tom Wilkinson's Falcone was at least written as a distinct individual i.e. memorable); the other crime bosses are so poorly defined I don't even remember their names. All the characters from the first movie are back exactly the same, doing the same thing (Alfred and Lucius giving avuncular advice as usual).The script is ponderous, cliche (we get the old ""you-can-only-save-one-them"" bit seen in the first Spider-Man and also Batman Forever), and poorly structured. Characters are introduced, disappear for an hour, re-appear then disappear for another hour (I'm looking at you Eric Roberts Mob Guy and you Taiwanese accountant and you, too, blackmailer guy).  Major events take place off screen (we're TOLD that Rachel and Harvey were kidnapped; it's like Luke taking off in his X-wing, then cut to everyone sitting around an hour later and someone comes in and says ""oh, by the way, Luke blew up the Death Star.""). The third act is a complete clusterf**k, overly frantic and confusing and doesn't work at all. We don't care that Two Face is running around killing people we've never seen or barely seen (some guy in a bar, the female cop, the other cop); they were never developed as people so it just looks like anonymous killing. I know they supposedly took place in the kidnapping of Rachel and Harvey, but since the film doesn't bother to show us the kidnapping, why should we care. I'll tell you something else about the script: I'm convinced they stole the idea of the Joker killing public officials from an Ed McBain 82nd Precinct novel called FUZZ. Go look it up.No, The Dark Knight is actually the weakest in Nolan's Batman Trilogy. Even The Dark Knight Rises has characters that you are interested in and a villain with a motivation that's more than just seeing the world burn or trying to prove everyone's as bad as he is, which they obviously aren't since he's a cold-blooded murderer. I will say this, the batcycle sequence is pretty cool.",0
263,"I'm sorry, but anybody who rates this movie under a 70 is an idiot and should not be able to review anything for that matter. This is why reviews are so pointless at times and inaccurate, there's too much opinion and bias going on. Look at the lowest reviews for Dark Knight, there own reviews reflect what they said about DK, they have no idea what they are talking about, they are just desperately looking for flaws that most of the  time are not even there. ""post movie disorder""?? Are you **** kidding me? How much of a pansy do you have to be? Dark Knight is one of the best movies of all time, and those oh so stupid reviewers who give it anything lower than 70 are in the minority as a shameful stain on reviews.",1
264,"Simply the best comic book movie of our time. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight is not only a take on modern comic book craze, but a look into the dark heart of a corrupt underworld (Gotham City), the action packed summer movie you've always dreamed of, the peek inside of a pyschotic sociapath, and one of the best mystery/detective films ever made. Of course you ask, how can a comic book movie based upon a man who dresses up as a bat do all those things and do them so spendid? Well it does, it just does. The Dark Knight is the best superhero film I've ever seen. It twists and turns with some incredibly emotional and eye opening sequences. We see the late Heath Ledger's take on the Joker, who (in my own opinion) is the best on screen Joker ever. Who takes the chaos in Nolan's first batman, and amps it up a million times more. There simply are no flaws I can sum up with it, while it may be long yes, the film never drags and always, always, always keeps you interested in the dramatic, psychotic, and scary events that take place. This film truly pushes the limits on what a PG-13 movie can do in terms of disturbing acts and merciless sadistic violence. Take on any factor in the movie and you will come out more than satisfied. It's incredible acting, so good that even Christian Bale's fantastic Batman is overshadowed by Ledger's Joker and Aaron Eckhart's twisted Harvey Dent. Maggie Gylennhal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachael Dawes who I must say was much better for the role, but your favorite old advisors are still here in Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and a few other familiar faces, and they all do fantastic. The dialogue and script is utter joy for a comic film, finding the perfect balance when to throw a few cheesy lines out, and when to keep it vindictive and realistic. The screenplay, the soundtrack, the camera angles, the action sequences, Nolan's directing, the story, I could go on and on and on and on, but I think my review speaks for itself. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight is a modern masterpiece, a sweeping epic that takes you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits roll.",1
265,Quite good,0
266,"A super hero must be Super not realistic, when a super hero story becomes realistic it ends been a good vs evil story, such an overrated acting and Director",1
267,"If i was a critic, I would give it a 74/100. but i am not, so I rate it a 7. Batman begins was much better. Heath ledger did act great as the crazy madman, but I don't think he deserved the Oscar. Overall, it was a great, intense picture. Still under Batman Begins, which I give an 86/100. let's see how The Dark Knight Rises will be.",1
269,The Dark Knight is the best movie since Lord of The Rings. A dark and sophisticated movie (especially for batman) that had strong acting all around with a joker that was the craziest of all villians. A masterpiece like no other and no question the best movie of the year.,1
270,"The Dark Knight [2008]I'm in the minority of the audience base where I say that I prefer ""Batman Begins"" than ""The Dark Knight"". However, that dosen't me from saying that ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, much less of a superhero movie, but more of a crime psychological thriller. I like how they decided not to put Batman/Bruce Wayne as the focal character in the movie, and although they practically did that in the Burton and Schumacher films, they were done poorly and mainly for toyetic reasons, while this film does it with a clear and specific purpose that is just done brilliantly. This is not a Batman film, it's a film about Harvey Dent, his story, his rise and fall towards the depths of corruption and chaos. The scene in the interrogation room and the final scene in the building are the clearest standouts. PS: I'm pissing my pants right now on how psyched I am to see ""The Dark Knight Rises"" tonight.",1

273,"Without Heath Ledger, this movie would've been forgotten the second it left theaters. It's a solid flick without him. But he was the reason that my eyes were glued to the TV. When The Joker was on screen, my heart rate slowed and my hairs stood on end. When he was off screen, I was simply waiting for him to appear again. Goosebumps.",1
274,"I really think people might have fell into the hype of this movie a lot too much, besides Heath Ledger this movie is not that good. I can think of one word to describe this movie and that word is OVERRATED.",1
275,"The dark knight is one of those very rare films that transcends its genre.  It's more like an actual crime thriller than a comic book movie.  It's dark, well acted, at times unerving, and probably as close to reality as a superhero movie can be.  Nolan's direction, especially in the action department, is nearly impecable.  The cinematogrophy is also excellent.  As everyone who seen this knows, the best part of the film is Ledger's joker.  It's probably the most disturbing  take on a familliar character ever devised.  However, I due have some nitpickings.  If you've seen the crow you know that Nolan has borrowed a few elements from that film including the look of the joker.  One other small problem is that when Bale is dressed as Batman in a scene where he is just talking to someone it seems kinda silly, especially with that voice he makes.  Also, in my opinion, Maggie Gyllenhol, (I think that's how you spell it), is too ugly for her role.  But ultimately the film is so far ahead of its superhero movie counterparts in terms of screenplay, directing, acting, and cinematogrophy that these things don't leave much of a negative impact.  It's a film that everyone needs to see, even people who can't stand other films in this genre.",1
276,"A sequel that's better than the original? Huh.This is probably the best Batman movie, even though Bale's Batman voice really sucks in this movie. Heath Ledger is the best part of this movie, he portrays the Joker brilliantly and rightfully deserved his posthumous Oscar. The action scenes are much better and the movie's very entertaining.Probably my favorite film by Christopher Nolan.",1
277,"An epic follow up to Batman Begins this movie is better than the first one since it stars Batman's most famous and iconic villain The Joker, now better than ever! One of Heath Ledger's best and last performance before he died. He will always be remembered for this role. Also Aaron Eckhart's performances as Harvey dent was good, while his performances as Two-Face was both haunting and awesome. And the way they brought to life that two-faced look was amazing. And the Dark Knight's costume has been upgraded so now he can move his neck and pack in more awesome gadgets. An absolutely incredible movie for every DC fan boy to see! All it took was some insanity and craziness to make this film so amazing. And don't forget to see it's sequel The Dark Knight Rises!",1

As a fan you feel it from the beginning, if it's a good Batman film or not; when you here the score and see the charaters acting. But it was the first time in my life that I felt asleep. There was no good story, no atmosphere and nothing special. The portrait of the comic characters was not convincing or interesting. I used to like actors like Caine, Oldman, Bale, Ledger or Eckhart, but not in this film. Nothing really fits and you sit there, eating your popcorn and hope, that the film will end soon. Production desgin, costumes had been boring in my opinion. The worst Batman film ever. Even Schumacher's Batman and Robin had been funnier or TDKR, where Batman droped an H-Bomb out of Gotham before sitting in Venice and having a drink with Catwomans alter Ego.",0
286,"According to IMDb; the dark knight is better the apocalypse now,citizen Kane, raging bull and 2001: a space odyssey and the forthgreatest film of all time. I think anyone with any understanding of film can see this is completely crazy. I don't hate this movie and I quite enjoyed it but it's very far from being any kind of masterpiece. When destructing Christopher Nolan's movie's I like to use David Fincher's terminology; Fincher theory is that there are films then there are movies. A film is using cinema as art and not just entertainment, such as; the godfather, mirror, There will be blood. A movie would be something of a guilty pleasure: the game, the raid, the dark knight. So then why is it the dark knight is so popular? Nolan separates his movies from the average blockbuster by giving them a sense of realism and reliability. The most obvious example of this is his very limited use of CGI and use of practical effects. At a time when CGI is common use in most blockbusters as it is cheaper and easier; you can see how audiences can be awed by this. Probably the thing that most separates his movies; is how he chooses tomake the viewer feel empowered. Where most Batman and superherovillains have been cliché and even cheesy; In the dark knight (and theother dark knight movies) the villains feel a lot more like modern dayterrorists then the average comic book villain. Post 911 you canimagine the impact this can have on people and the realism it gives.Though in Nolan's determination to make the viewer feel empowered hesacrifices making the dark knight anything more then a movie; he makes everything extremely obvious and doesn't leave anything for the viewer to work out for themselves. At times it can even be patronizing. During the part of themovie where people are being killed until batman takes off his mask; heis constantly being blamed by everyone, even one of the officers does so. I think this is a testament to how much Nolan trusts he's audience and how painstakingly obvious he thinks he has to make everything to get a point across. Even within expectations of it being a Nolan super hero movie, the dark knight still has faults. The main one being how anti climatic the ending of the movie was, I was expecting some kind of big send off for the joker but instead his send off was brief and unsatisfying. There's also the many the plot holes but I don't have anything new to say on that. In short Nolan offers somewhat charming comic book movie, that has all his usual traits; good and bad. And despite it's charm, at it's core it's a rather one dimensional Hollywood blockbuster; with the popcorn audience as it's target demographic. It may be the ""greatest super hero movie of all time"" but that doesn't mean a lot.",0
287,"Complete garbage, the story is weak and non-coherent. Why am I watching this complete pig dropping when the he could have eradicated the entire league of shadow from the first movie and then none of these villain could have been released. People love comic story with characters that never die. Oh yeah lets make a main character who does not like to kill and because of that naiveté, he created more villains who by the way are immortals because they never die. why do americans like this kind of story? because they are idiots and dumb.",0
288,"It's no accident that the skyline of Gotham City figures prominently in so many scenes in The Dark Knight, the second Batman movie from director and co-writer Christopher Nolan. It's seen from above when Batman glides from building to building, and from below as the Joker skulks through streets that the residents deserted in panic. But it's just as conspicuously present in the film's many scenes of executives and city officials meeting high above the general populace, like gods determining the fates of those below. Where Batman Begins was largely about the considerable personal toll exacted by its hero's decision to fight back against the forces of evil while adhering to a code of honor, The Dark Knight expands those weighty themes to city scale. As the film opens, Gotham still needs Batman (played again with intensity and vulnerability by Christian Bale), though its champion's influence hasn't been entirely positive. Organized crime has practically gone corporate in response, and a group of clumsy Batman wannabes have done little to stop it. Then there's the Joker, a mysterious new criminal who wants to foil the forces of law and order for reasons he keeps to himself. What the Joker lacks in transparent motives he makes up for with enthusiasm. Playing a self-described ""engine of chaos,"" the late Heath Ledger treats the iconic comic-book villain as a man who sees life as a dark joke, but takes care to tailor his punchlines for maximum impact. It's an unnervingly thorough performance, from the character's serpentine habit of licking his lips to the hitch Ledger throws into his stride that makes him like a wounded, angry animal. It's nightmare stuff with real-world roots, both in the randomness of his destructive acts of terror, and the imperfect systems designed to stand in his way. Basing his schemes on the corruptibility of cops and criminals, Ledger's Joker homes in on the few who appear beyond his reach, particularly Batman and district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), a fearless enforcer of the law poised to make real changes to the city. Matters are complicated by the fact that Eckhart now shares a bed with Bale's lifelong love Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, subbing in for Katie Holmes). But to the film's credit, Nolan isn't afraid to keep matters complicated. The script, which he co-wrote with his brother Jonathan, has the unapologetic density of a good crime novel, with major and minor characters alike getting their due. Bale and Gyllenhaal have only a few scenes together, but they establish a tangible chemistry, and Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman make significant contributions as Bale's confidantes and consciences. Nolan lets the film's spectacular action scenes seem like the natural consequences of the conflicts between characters, conflicts that build until Gotham becomes less a setting than a stage for an operatic conflict between tortured good and contented chaos. As strong as The Dark Knight's setpieces are—and they're all pulsing showstoppers of a kind not seen in Batman Begins—the real tension comes from Nolan's willingness to let that battle's ultimate outcome remain in doubt even as the credits roll. The film's capes and cowls suggest one genre, but it's a metropolis-sized tragedy at heart.",1
289,"According to IMDb The Dark Knight is literally a better movie than every movie ever made, except The Godfather Part I & II, and The Shawshank Redemption....WHAT?!Better than: Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Apocalypse Now, The Wizard of Oz, Seven Samurai, Cinema Paradiso, M, etc, etc.According to IMDb it is the FOURTH greatest film of all time.

I don't hate this movie, i quite enjoy it a fair amount, but it is very far from being any kind of ''masterpiece'' - It isn't even Nolan's best movie... When destructing this movie i like to use David Fincher terminology: Fincher theory is that there are films, and there are movies. A film is using cinema as art and not as JUST entertainment, such as: 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and modern movies like There Will be Blood, The Fall and Hero. (just to name a few) Then there are movies like: The Raid, Speed, The Game, and The Dark Knight, which are solely 'entertaining' films and nothing really more. Nothing to get inspired about, nothing to make you think, or ponder what has just happened. Nothing, which is fine, you wouldn't want movies like that constantly, but a movie that is solely entertainment can not be classed as one of the best movies of all time, let alone the FOURTH best. So, why then is The Dark Knight so ridiculously popular? Nolan separates his movies from the average blockbuster by giving them a sense of realism and reliability. The most obvious example of this is his very slim use of CGI and the use of practical effects. At a time when CGI is common use, in most blockbusters, as it's much cheaper and easier, this is obviously appreciated by audiences. You can see how audiences can be awed by this. Probably the thing that most separates this movie is how he chooses to make the viewer feel empowered. Where most Batman and other superhero villains have been cliche, cheesy or unrealistic, The Dark Knight (and the other Nolan Batman movies) have had villains that feel a lot more like modern day terrorist than the average comic book villain, which is usually just ridiculous if you think about it. Post 9/11 you can imagine the impact this can have on people and the realism it gives. Though in Nolan's determination to make the viewer feel empowered he sacrifices making The Dark Knight anything more than a movie, he makes everything extremely obvious and doesnt leave anything for the viewer to work out for themselves. At times it can even be patronizing. During the part of the movie where people are being killed until batman takes off his mask, he is constantly being by everyone even one of the officers does so. I think this is a testament to how much Nolan trusts is audience and how painstakingly obvious he thinks he has to make everything to get his point across. Even within expectations of it being a Nolan superhero film, The Dark Knight still has quite alot of faults. The main one being how anticlimactic the ending of the movie was, I was hoping/expecting some kind of big send off for the Joker but instead his send off was very brief and unsatisfying. There's also the many plot holes but i dont have anything new to say on that. A movie to be called ''One of the greatest film of all time'' it needs to excell in every aspect of filmmaking. The Dark Knight only excells at one, the performances, Heath Ledger's The Joker is excellent, he is truly phenomenal. But other than that, the direction is OK, the writing is very weak, and the movie is tedious, and overlong. The Dark Knight is good but grotesquely overrated In short, Nolan offers a somewhat charming comic movie, that has all his usual traits: good and bad, but despite its charm, at its core is a rather one dimensional hollywood blockbuster with the popcorn audience as its target demographic. It may be the ''greatest superhero movie of all time'' but that doesnt mean a lot, does it?",0
290,"Esta película ya la ví hace años, pero cuando la ví creía que no la había visto como es debido pues la vi en la televisión pública con cortes de publicidad y no de manera muy atenta. es por eso que ahora estas semanas previas calentando para el evento cinéfilo del año, Dunkerque, quería volver a ver a Nolan, la semana pasada fue Batman: Begins, y esta semana la película que nos concierne. Para mí sorpresa, no me ha gustado más que la primera vez que la ví ni me ha gustado más que Begins.La película no digo yo que sea mala o peor que otras de la saga o del propio director, si no que a mí personalmente es una película que me gusta, la veo y no va a más, la olvido rapidamente. Pero la película como película, como cine es brillante, desde el guión, el desarrollo de los personajes, el ritmo del largometraje... todo esta sensacional, pero como vuelvo a decir, ni la interpretación del joker que tampoco me sorprende (pienso que ese tipo de papeles para un actorazo como Ledger es un caramelo para lucirse, pero si Bale de Batman que cada día me gusta más...) ni ningún otro punto de la película son para mí uno de mis platos preferidos. Aún así peliculón, un 7.",1
291,"A part le costume, on se demande si on est encore dans un ""Batman""... Gotham est devenue un mélange de New York et de Chicago, une ville américaine générique, pleine de grands cubes et le Joker, le fameux Joker est un banal malfrat peinturluré à la va-vite. Il a le charisme d'un livreur de pizza et l'allure d'un clochard, il n'inspire qu'un vague mépris à défaut d'incarner un certain idéal de folie furieuse. Pas drôle pour un sou, on lui filerait juste deux balles dans le métro.Christian Bale est passé en mode ""pilotage automatique"" tout comme son cérémonieux majordome Michael Caine qui ne cesse de nous rebattre les oreilles avec ses reflexions moralisatrices. Idem pour Morgan Freeman, réduit au faire-valoir accessoire du justicier, une sorte de ""Q"" pour le James Bond masqué. Gary Oldman n'en mène pas large non plus et a l'air de s'emmerder autant que nous. Tant d'acteurs aussi mal employés nous font regretter un tel gâchis.L'histoire ou la tentative d'histoire se perd en maintes circonvolutions pour tenter de tenir les deux heures et demi de remplissage, ponctuées ici et là par un peu d'action qui fait la part belle à la Burnemobile et la moto batmolle.On pourrait être dans un James Bond ou dans un Jason Bourne qu'on y verrait que du feu, à part tout de même une mise en scène très correcte globalement mais l'ambiance déjantée du monde de Batman a définitivement disparu pour céder la place à une grosse machine prétentieuse qui se repose sur les effets spéciaux, édulcore ses personnages et délivre une oeuvre fadasse et formatée par l'ennui.",0
292,"probbaly the most political movie since Natural Born Killers, Torture, extradition, surveillance, Philosophy, Politics, anti-republican, This Movie will be the best Comic movie foreever with a ""horrible"" Heath Ledger , the best Batman the best butler, the best scientist... without CGI(not so much - harvey Dent), this movie ahould have a metascoreof 89 and not 82 it's like you would give a rating of 3 for zlatan ibrahimovic goal against england probably the best movie of this century (political, action, thriller, editing, colours, and especially the music)",1

295," What a fantastic film. Great special effects, a super performance by Heath Ledger. How these bloody American newspapers keep scoring this film at anything below 100% is beyond me.",1
296," This is a film that is one of a kind. I watched it multiple times and the structure of it should be taught in schools. I bought the script so I could learn how a movie was properly done. This is one of the best crime movies ever made and it happens to have Batman in it. The best part is it all seems like it could happen. Everything in this movie is done well, and for the naysayers...It just proves that some people shouldn't be aloud to vote.",1
297," It's very difficult to explain how great ""The Dark Knight"" really is. I'm still in shock right now! ""The Dark Knight"" is probably the best summer movie so far, and may be the greatest movie this year! Let's talk about the Joker first. We see him right when the movie starts, and even then, I fell in love with the character. The Joker is so maniacal, so cunning, and so bad ass that it's hard to not like him. He played the part so well that I almost forgot Heath was the one underneath the character. Heath Ledger obviously took the part seriously, and he gave us a living, breathing Joker. His performance is unforgettable. Early reviews praised Heath, and believed he may win an Oscar. I wanted to see for myself - and I totally agree. I hope he does win because he really deserves it. Throughout the whole movie, we get to see all of the Joker's crimes and schemes. I've got to admit that I was blown away by everything the Joker did. All of his plans were crazy, but at the same time smart, and many of them had twists. His final attempt was probably the best, and also the most psychological. The Joker pretty much made the film into a psychological thriller. You'll be surprised at how cunning the Joker is and also how much he thinks everything through. Even though he's effing crazy, you'll fall in love with the Joker. I was surprised at how funny the movie was. There were a few smart jokes from time to time, but the one that took the cake was, of course, the Joker. All the things he says, all the things he does, deserves a laugh. (I also agree that most of his quotes should be on t-shirts). So, Christian Bale reprises his role as Batman, and he definitely pulled it off again. Bale is great as Batman and Bruce Wayne, and he shows us how human Batman can be. His character is just as important as every other main character. Eckhart is simply wonderful as Harvey Dent, Gotham's ""White Knight."" Gyllenhaal is also a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. I certainly think that Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman received bigger roles this time than the last, however it kind of felt like Michael Caine got a smaller part. But even though it did feel like that, Michael Caine still made a big impression. You all have probably already heard about the film's second villain, Two-Face. Two-Face is Harvey Dent's (Aaron Eckhart) other persona. He become Two-Face after a tragic accident (I'm not going to reveal the details), and becomes disfigured. Soon after, he goes on a rampage to take out the guilty and corrupt. Two-Face's trademark coin appears in the film, too. He uses this coin to decide the fate of his victims. Heads means the person will live, while the other side (a scratched up face) means the person will die). Two-Face portrays a very important moral that we discover in the film: ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" That quote has a bit of irony in it, since it was also said by Harvey Dent in the film. Harvey Dent's character in this film probably took some inspiration from the graphic novel, ""The Killing Joke."" In the graphic novel, a character tries to prove that even the most upstanding citizen is capable of going mad after having ""one bad day."" The action in this film is amazing. The film doesn't just have explosions and violence for no reason. There's always a reason for them. Also, the stunts that were performed in this film was crazy good. In the trailer, there was a part where a truck flipped upside down and then crashed. You'll never guess what caused that to happen. Batman does some crazy tricks with his batpod, which pretty much just wowed and entertained the audience. Now let's compare this film to ""Iron Man."" Many have said how this film changed superhero films forever, just like how ""Iron Man"" did. But in my opinion, ""Iron Man"" never made a big impression to me. It was good, but it wasn't amazing. ""Iron Man"" just felt like another superhero movie, but ""The Dark Knight"" felt like an actual ""film."" So, did ""The Dark Knight"" live up to all the hype? I'd have to say it was even better than that. The trailers (despite how awesome they were) only showed us a fraction of how good ""The Dark Knight"" is; the film is so much more. The film has meaning - morals that we can use in life, and believable characters. Even with it's two and a half hour running time, never was the film boring. I had to sit near the front of the theater, and I was still entertained! It was entertaining and full of excitement from beginning to end. However, I kind of have mixed feelings about the ending. I didn't understand the ending at first, but after finding out I realized that it was a meaningful ending, but I don't know if I liked it or not. But still, that shouldn't keep you from seeing a fantastic film like this. Believe me, after you see the movie, you're going to want to see it again right away.",1
298, Simply amazing.,1
299," Although long, this movie keeps your interest. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best villain I have seen in a move in the past 3-5 years, at least. From his mannerisms to his dialougue, he was certainly sinister, yet, I couldn't get enough of him in this movie.",1
300," A different class of superhero movie!! Doesn't treat the audience like idiots with the normal linear storyline, instead it juxtapositions an array of character factions asking the viewer to use their brains. The film manages to make a better sociopolitical commentary post 911 than movies that have that as their sole intention and uses each character with success in that aim. Action, performances, visual beauty, humour, thought - this movie has it all!!!",1
301," Excellent summer blockbuster. The joker's destructive madness is the perfect provocation for a Batman who is forced to re-examine his own ethical code. Heath Ledger is brilliant as the joker, and Christian Bale continues to be superb in all his roles. There's a good story, which occasionally borders (even sometimes crosses into) the implausible, but it works extremely well. Of course it's going to be over-the-top in places; it's a film about a comic book superhero who dresses up as a bat! As such a film, it is relentlessly spectacular. If I'm honest, I doubt any of the low-raters truly believe that it deserves a 0 or a 1.",1
302," This movie was incredible. I would have stayed 3 hours in the cinema to watch the entire thing. I'm tired of how people complain the movie is too long, while to me it was the fastest 2 1/2 hours of my life. This movie was much better than bloody iron man, which was just filled with American cheese and a disjointed story. I think iron man is overrated, I think its good but doesn't deserve 79 on meta critic. I think batman begins was better than it.",1
304," It's one of the best films ever made. Outstanding performances, outstanding plot and the flawless traps -almost- of Joker that make us uncomfortable on our seats.. I gave this movie a mega 10.",1
305," When people said Heath Ledger ought to win an Oscar, most of the regular movie-going community passed it off as a rolethat would be, like Jonny Depp's Jack Sparrow, nominated but not awarded. That was before we, the public, were subjected to a crap infested year of cinematic self-flagellation. I would be amazed if the academy could even find another performance worth nominating this year. Hell, even Bale's performance, in comparison to the general talent, could probably beat out most of the crowd... That said, the movie itself was a must see, and it's flaws were compensated by the superb directing and performance of Ledger.",1
306," Very slow to start, yet you are rewarded with perhaps one of the most convincing villains in many modern films. The joker is fantastic, and i would recommend this just to see him.",1
307," This is the best action movie i have ever seen. my jaw was on the floor the entire movie, from the visuals, to the script, to the acting, every component was truly mind blowing.",1
308," Just saw it last night, amazing film, gritty crime drama....so realistic, Heath was amazing, as was Eckhart, Bale and Oldman. I can't wait to see it again on Friday!",1
309," 1st off: Ledger's performance was outstanding.. The Joker is psychotic and unreasonable and its an unfortunate tragedy that Heath ledger wont reprise the role.. in fact i pity anyone cast to replace him if they make a third installment. everything is was so so.. They really layered the script and it shows: Harvey Dent's part is thorougly developed and probably forced the movie ran about a half hour longer than 'necessary'. Fight scenes are typical western close-ups on hard to read action sequences and some of the best visual moments were already spoiled by overzealous trailer edits.. overall its a positive contribution to the franchise and a much higher quality movie than Batman Returns - Batman Forever. In my opinion this installment doesnt match up to Batman Begins very well and is definitely more 'fan flick' the mainstream movie.. Go see and judge for yourself but be warned, youre in for a long, bumpy ride.",1
310," Hands down, the best superhero movie ever created. The Dark Knight brings to life the real dark and twisted side of the Batman comics. It's about time theres a movie that comes out this dark. Everything in this movie is great; the drama, comedy, suspense, and of course action. Any professional critic who could rate this movie less than at least a 95 has no sense of what a great movie is made of, and should all be fired.",1
311," Best movie of the year to date. Possible Best Picture nomination. Heath Ledger is incredible and what you have heard in reviews does not even come close to giving him justice in what he does for the role as the Joker. He makes Jack's Joker look like a bad high school acting job. The movie is very violent and I am surprised it was PG-13. It is action packed from the beginning to end. I saw it in the IMAX theater and all of the action scenes were done in IMAX. It adds a whole new experience to actually getting out of the house to se this movie. It is one that you don't just go to the movies for you go to see it in IMAX! The entire cast put on a great acting job with a well written script and plot lines. I think it could be the best Super Hero movie of all time is a pretty easy statement to say. The 2.5 hours that the movie plays goes by so fast I wanted to see more but man it wears you out. Go, you will enjoy it.",1
312," It couldn't have been better. That's all there is to it as far as I'm concerned. From the astounding directing to the superb acting, it never misses a beat, and all the while it keeps you guessing. One of the best things about this is even I couldn't guess what would happen next, and I'm good at analyzing things like this. It does everything well and does it without feeling cliche or redone. And Heath may have actually been up to the challenge of topping Nicholson, especially in being so good while staying true to the comic's origins and feel for the Joker.",1
313," Undoubtedly, the best comic book movie and the best superhero movie of all time!",1
314, When The Joker wore the nurse's uniform---holy-smoke.....nearly fell out of my seat!,1
315," This movie is a beautiful darkness. It's impossible to say the movie is bad, its brilliant in it's genre. If you don't like it refrain from criticism of the movie, because it will be the darkness of the genre that turns you off. How ever if your open the beautiful darkness then see it. And if you say hate this movie, why so serious?",1
316," Best BATMAN made? Easy YES, the best! However, forget about that this movie has comic behind it. The movie itself has so many deep characters... so well thought it, and action scenes comes across as real. Quite a few twist and turns. The jokers character is VERY hard to come out in a movie. Jack did, had fun. But Heath Ledge WAS the joker, ever ycomic I ever read, their characters all transformed in Heath. This movie REALLY pays homage to the comics, If you're been reading comics for years, youll know why I mea.",1
317, Dark and exciting,1
318, Christopher Nolan takes a superhero genre and turns into a crime thriller. Ledger's performance combines Alex in A Clockwork Orange with Capt. Jack Sparrow; a semi-comedic joker who thrives on violence. The cast was great and i would like to see the feature again.,1
319," The first Batman movie to make Batman feel real. The joker could be in New York or LA just as easily as in Gotham City. Ledger's performance is fantastic, and goes beyond the villain that fellow Dark Knight actor Gary Oldman portrays in The Professional.",1
320, There is already so much praise for this movie that it kind of seems pointless to add my two-cents. But I loved it so much that I'm going to go ahead and post my first comment and rating ever since I discovered Metacritic several years ago. I don't understand how it got an 82. I would have thought at least a 90 based solely on Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker. See this movie. Don't wait for the DVD. Go right now to the nearest theater and see The Dark Knight.,1
321," This movie is, strangely enough, a political piece supporting the decisions of the Bush administration. Weird, but true.",1
322," While the movie is good, action-packed, fast-paced fun, it is incomparable to Burton's Gothic masterpieces. Also, I feel that the only reason the late Heath Ledger is so highly praised for his performance is because of his tragic death and not his performance, which is generic when compared to the surreal genius of Jack Nicholson's Joker.",1
323, The Dark Knight is easily the best superhero/comic adaptation movie ever made in Hollywood history. It offers in depth protrayal of the antihero personage of Batman and nihilistic madness of the Joker (Heath totally owns the role)- perhaps even transcended that of the original comics. The deliberate sparsity of special effects lends a unique realism and grittiness. The only flaw I feel (minor) is that the role of Rachel Dawes still doesn't fit in very comfortably in the movie but Maggie is still a tremendous improvement over Katie Holmes. An unforgettable classic.,1
324," Why so seriously overrated? I thought I was going to see the ""Citizen Kane"" of the decade based on the reactions of most critics and just about every fan out there. I have to suspect that what is driving the cult like praise for the film is the untimely death of Heath Ledger, who plays the Joker. ""The Dark Knight"" was a huge let down following the superb ""Batman Begins."" Continuity problems abound here. In one scene the Joker and his goons invade a Bruce Wayne fund raiser for the reelection campaign of crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent. Bruce notices the invasion of the party by the Joker and quickly hides Dent in a closet before he runs away to put on his Batman outfit and battle the Joker and his gang. When a frustrated Joker can't find Dent and his goons prove no match for Batman in a fight, he decides to take Rachel Dawes hostage. Joker throws Dawes from the building and Batman dramatically rescues her. After they fall onto a car the scene is cut, and there no explanation for what happens afterward. Surely, Batman wouldn't just leave the other people at the party up in the building with a dangerous criminal like the Joker. Surely, the Joker wouldn't give up trying to find out where Dent is hiding in the building and just leave. If he can't find Dent, then he is probably going to take a hostage and demand Dent give himself up, or the hostage dies. A glaring continuity flaw and not good film making. Ledger is good playing a very menacing, and completely irredeemable, version of the Joker. But he doesn't he have to do much more than look scummy and mutter his dialog in his menacing Joker voice. Good, but not award worthy. No point in trying to convince the Cult of Ledger mob otherwise, obviously. Unlike the previous principle villain in ""Begins"", Henri Ducard, there is no origin story about this version of the Joker, other than his passing references to a bad childhood. I wanted to know more, but there is no time for that in this movie. It's too bad they didn't give a good actor like Ledger more to do, other than look scummy and sound menacing. I enjoyed the movie most when Batman is fighting the Joker. But then it goes on for 20 - 30 minutes longer than necessary because Nolan decided to have Harvey Dent undergo his transformation into Two-Face. The movie would have been better with a more developed Joker character, and more screen time for Alfred and Lucius Fox. I really enjoyed watching Bruce interact with Alfred and Lucius in ""Begins,"" but here these relationships take a back seat to unnecessary filler, like Bruce's trip to Hong Kong, and his kidnapping of a businessman with links to the Gotham mob. A time consuming and an overall unnecessary scene. Overall, a step down from the high quality of ""Begins.""",1
325," Excellent action and effects -- of course -- and then some. The plot actually has something new to say about heroes in general, which is a surprise. The film adds depth to the Batman character without destroying the canonical legend. The final twist takes it right out of the common run of summer blockbusters. The only shortcoming, perhaps unavoidable, is the comic book texture all around. Ledger deserves all the credit he's gotten, although none of the other major players allows him to steal the whole show.",1
326," I was suprized by this Movie! Did not expect it to live upto the hype. It kept my attention the entire time. Ledgers lip licking Joker was creepy, evil, and entertaining. You could easily forget he's not real. The critics that gave this movie low scores should have the Jokers pencil trick performed on them.",1
327, Should be called the Joker Movie. He totally makes me forget the whole gay cowboy part.,1
328, Although there were some minor things that annoyed me about the movie (Batman's voice) I found it to be one of the best movie going experiences of my life. Not sense the Departed has a movie been this intense and still held together from beginning to end.,1
329, Great movie. Excellent performances and action.,1
330, This movie was one of the most amazing pictures I've seen all year. It was unparalled in the acting ability portrayed in the film.,1

333," This film lived up to it's hype, it may have been the best comic book movie I'd ever seen, no make that the best movie! Truly stunning effects, and the acting was outstanding. Anybody rating this movie low either has it in for someone involved with it or doesn't know the history of the comic book. A true must see!",1
334," Brilliant, dark, good versus evil. Heath gets the Oscar.",1
335," Oh my God, how did Critics give this an 82?? I've finally lost complete respect for them. This movie, was absolutely-amazing. If not for Batman's rumbly voice I would venture far enough to say it's perfect. Keith Ledger absolutely dominates his role as the Joker. The fight scenes where absolutely amazing. There was one plot twist after another. I'm giving this movie a 10 despite the rumbly voice, it was simply far too good and it deserves nothing less. A++, see this movie NOW!",1
336," Heath Ledger stole the movie, best Batman Movie ever.",1
337," The makers have taken the limp 'comic book realism' of the Batman Begins format and have improved on it. They have done this by shooting on location instead of soundstage, by replacing Katie Holmes with a far more savvy Maggie G, and by creating something genuinely intriguing in the Joker character. Heath Ledger's great performance is bolstered by certain flourishes in the script that display a dark tone beneath the bland 'good Vs eeeVIL' platitudes, one which is quietly playful, and definitly entertaining. While often diverting, I never thought much of the comic book fantasy genre, especially in efforts like Batman Begins (I don't care what people think, a critically admired director and a crop of character actors cannot turn the regular comic staples of leaden dialogue and a man dressed up in a lumbering superhero costume into something approaching realistic drama, no matter how jazzed up they make it.) It is fitting then, to eat my own words, because a chord has been struck in the portrayal of the Joker, that, while never done in a comic book movie before, could only be done in the hyper reality of such a genre. In the hands of Mr. Ledger the image of the character is fantastical and freakish, existing beyond ideals of good and evil, beyond mainstream concepts of humanity and the 'other', beyond...well, ok, he just doesn't give a sh@t. Its the magic element which makes the movie enjoyable, and distracts from the films' points of banality, which are few, but noticable. Batman himself, is boring, you couldn't care less about him. Personally, every time I see him talking/growling in his suit, i want to laugh, which doesn't bode well for the franchise me thinks. His Bat suit is also clearly too cumbersome to wear, especially in the fight scenes with group of gangsters/hoodlums. It takes him forever to punch out one guy. Despite all that, the best comic book film i've seen. Well worth going to the cinema to see.",1
338," This is not only the best super hero movie ever, but probably the best movie ever. Yes, right up there with godfather! I will also use this movie to gauge movie critics. Anyone giving this less than a ten will come under severe question from me and I just cant trust there reviews no longer. P.S. Heath lived up to the hype!",1
339,"This is easily the best movie of the year in my opinion and possibly the best movie i have ever seen.  Ignore the negative critics, they gave it bad reviews because they saw 100's and said ""Oh no this could get better reviews than the Godfather so i better make sure it doesn't"".  With excuses like its not fun or it's too dark, you can tell they can't back up their evidence.  Is the movie dark? sure but give me a break its a comic book based on a man who had his parents killed and is out for revenge in a way.  It's not as dark as people may believe, it's got a lot of humor thanks to the finest performance i have ever seen.  You can take all the hype and all you heard about Heath Ledger and how good he did but when you walk out you will still be in aw and it will still impress you.  From the way he walks to the way he twitches, it is a beautiful sight even if it's not supposed to be.  He is so good that you may actually find yourself rooting for him, but luckily Christian Bale is no slouch and like always he performes brilliantly.  These two actors single handedely made the movie from a great category to a classic category.  The only flaw which isn't too bad is the length but the more the better.  Also, there are so many probems that come up in the movie and so many storylines that like some critics said it is hard to obtain all of it in one viewing.  Like a great music CD, it's a movie that you could watch 10 times and on the 10th time say ""Oh wow i never noticed that before"".  This movie is an instant classic in my opinion and not to upset anyone but i find this much more entertaining than the Godfather movies.  Maybe its just me but i would rather watch this 5 times instead of watch the Godfather, even if the Godfather is a good movie.",1
340, Watched it twice..can't get enough of it...the best movie so far that I've watched this year...and in fact its a superhero movie makes it even better!,1
341, Brilliant! Best movie I've seen in a long time!,1
342," My new favorite movie. This movie was it. All of the actors were glossed over because of Heath Ledger's amazing turn as the best freakin villain ever (in my humble opinion). He brought a kind of anti-star power: stripped of his face, he's freer than he has ever been before to savor each moment onscreen as a character with a lust for life, death, and most of all, chaos. This film has been called a crime epic, and it is, but it is something much more; like No Country for Old Men, it is a philosophical struggle to find morality in this crazy world. Christopher Nolan makes the ballsiest film of the summer; one that's not afraid to be long, not afraid to be smart, not afraid to be deep. Also, they flipped over an 18-wheeler in the middle of Chicago. Ballsy. And it's gonna pay off. Hell, it already did.",1
343, amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing movie ... simple the best batman movie EVER ... Heath Ledger was PHENOMENAL. there has to be an honorary oscar or something for him,1

348," If any one thing is creepiest about Ledger's Joker, it might be that he actually seems to get more comfortable as the movies wears on. To the point that when finally hung upside-down from a skyscraper by Batman, he seems almost at peace. Here is someone who can't take off his mask; someone whose success ensures that Bruce Wayne can't take his off, either - even when he most wants to. But despite himself the Joker is a ""planner,"" and in fact a very good one. It isn't chaos that he craves so much as momentum. The comedy of his nurse routine (where Ledger really scores points) comes from his frustration at the slightest hitch in what is otherwise going completely his way. Meanwhile Bruce finds himself increasingly reverting to terrorist tactics to stop the madness. Each is more like the other than they want to be. It's why the Joker is the most dangerous of supervillans. He debunks the very genre that created him. His threat is to the IDEA of a Batman. That the madman comes so very close to being proven right is why this movie is serious business. And Heath Ledger's performance is why it deserves a 10.",1
349," I already saw it twice and I can say that it is the best movie of the year so far. Heath ledger gives an excellent performance combining different emotions and making the audience feel in varied ways. The batman was really what I hated about the film. Each time I herad that voice I wanted to go out from the cinema! It was terrible.......The special effects are awsome as well as the general production. Costumes visual effects and makeup. It was a very good film and I don't understand how people can give this movie a 1! c'mon be ralistic, if you gave this movie a 1 you should give hancook a -2??",1
350," Love it. Never bored, couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. Makes me really regret what happened to Heath as he clearly had some amazing roles in store for him. I never go to the movies, but man am I glad we forked over the $20 for us to go. Worth every cent.",1
351," Great movie from start to finish. When I thought it was over, there was still an hour left.",1
352," The film on it's own was good, but Ledgers Joker made it amazing. The best film of 2008!",1
353," If I could give it an 11 out of 10 i would, just seen it 2nd time now there's so much to it and yet its generally very easy to keep up with, they couldn't have made a more perfect Batman film. Surpasses films like Spiderman by miles. In my top 5 films of all time.",1
355," Darkly great wit great views and extremely well symbolizes sent by Cristopher Nolan, a very personal version of film super-heroes that is innovating a new style of the same theme. Better yet is the provision of Heath Ledger as Joker is a totally different and really appropriate for this movie. Majestically great.",1
356," It is definitely the most faithful batman movie yet, and without a doubt my favorite superhero movie. I've seen it 3 times, once in Imax, and I liked it better each time I saw it.",1
357," A bit overlong and overwrought, but entertaining as hell nonetheless. As a Batman purist, I was disconcerted at the death of Dent and the elimination of the Two-Face character. Overall, though, I was captivated, and boy, does my hometown make a great Gotham.",1
358," Epic - this may not be what some expect from a 'comic book superhero movie', but it's the best movie I've seen for a long time. This is an ensemble piece, where the joker may outshine the rest with his mesmeric craziness, but not by much - there's fantastic performances everywhere, from bale, caine, and particularly eckhart and oldman. It's a crime thriller following 3 men's attempts to save gotham city, beautifully shot, fantastic score by zimmer, and any flaws it has are so minor compared to what Nolan has achieved here, that it has to have 10 out of 10.",1
359, This movie seriously rocked hard core and I believe that the Joker is an AMAZING character!!,1
361, One of the best movies of the year. The Academy don't know nothing.,1
362," This is a brillant movie, packed with twists and turns, darken elements and much more. It certainly lives up to its hype and includes political, economical, and foreign affairs. The actors were brilliant. Christian Bale is brillant, in fact the best Batman ever.",1
365," anyone who DIDN'T like this movie is a complete idiot!!! a fantastic work of pure genius, except i didn't like the batman part (cos i hate that superhero rubbish), it was the joker that was worth watching it for. when i found out about Heith Ledger's death i wasn't as shocked as i should have been (and i'm from australia, where it was all over the news), but after watching this movie i finally realise how much skill he had as an actor, and i now feel sadness that i should have felt before that he is no longer here. you know that you're supposed to hate him in this movie and that he's the bad guy who's killing everyone, but he's so... cool... They cover his face with paint to make him look ugly, and they give him a character that you're eant to dislike, and you still like him. A fine way to go Heith, a fine way to go.",1
366, I enjoyed it. Especially the plot and characters were well designed. Also the messages of the film were well-conveyed. The only thing I did not like about the movie is the length of it. If it were around 90 minutes it would be better I think.,1
367," Ledger's Joker act was truly the finest acting i've seen in a while. The action scenes were really great, and everything else was just 'wow'.",1
368, Excellent movie. Never saw a superhero movie like this one. Mind blowing performance by Heath Ledger.,1
369," The Dark Knight is a decent movie that could have been great. The acting was exceptional. Ledger did a fantastic job, as everyone has said, but Eckhart deserves much acclaim as well. Despite this, Batman remains glued to the tried and true Hollywood formula, and runs way too long. The plot is razor thin and could have been told in much less time. The storyline is obvious from the get go and still seems to want to hold the audiences hand through out. All in all, the movie gets scored higher than it should (or would) because of Ledgers death. It is nowhere near as good as Batman Begins.",1
371," I think Nolan is bigger than this movie.this is a masterpiece no dobut,but I'v been waiting for this movie for a year and I expect from it even more than this.Anyway this is extraordinary film if you don't emphasis some of it's faults.The cast is brilliant(except Maggie Gyllenhaal) Nolan is almost on top and the plot is very fresh but Johnatan Nolan has written scenarioes even better before.I've never been one of Heath Ledger's fans and also I'm not now.but I won't forget his performance in this movie ever.Maybe you don't like the film but it is impossible that you could deny the Joker of Ledger is one of the best performances that anyone has done yet.This is not like a Nolan film.there is no flashback and playing with time we often expect to see in a film directed by him.Nolan usualy use some short scenes from the past when characters remember their memories but there isn't any of these short scenes in this film too.Either you like it or not you should accept it is the most different blackbuster ever made.",1
372," I saw ""The Dark Knight"" in the theatres-21 times. I tell you there has not been a solid super-hero movie that I have not liked and""The Dark Knight"" is no exemption, especially with Christian Bale as Batman. He is absolutely my favorite actor in this one and I for one hope he comes back to complete the trilogy. A friend of mine is getting me this movie as a christmas gift and I am looking forward to that. My dream is to someday have my own television station airing these kinds of movies and I will be excited about the up and coming ""Batman3"".",1
373, This is one of the best cast with an amazin cast and the best supporting actor role or best role ever done by someone. The joker was amazin.,1
374," This movie was one of the most intense movie ever! The Joker plays one of the best bad guys ever in Batman! Stanly K. doesn't have any idea, boring film? It kept you intrested all the time! I gave it a 9 because you do sort of get tired of all the violence and action. But, that was pretty cool too.",1
375," For the tragic death of Heath Ledgar what an amazing performance to end his career. I was never interested in the hole Batman movies. Then I saw ""The Dark Knight"" and it is now one of my favorite movies. Christopher Nolan what an amazing job. You found the right characters to play in the movie and boy did they do an amazing job. By far a 10 in my eyes.",1
376," Pretty good take on the Batman universe. Borrows some ideas and throws in some rather silly action sequences while trying a bit too hard to be relevant. A good movie, but I couldn't really see what all the fuss was about. There wasn't anything overwhelming or extraordinary about it.",1
377, This is the best movie ever made. It has everything you want in a movie. Excellent sequalt to Batman Begins. If possible i would give it 1000000000 out of ten.,1
378," Incredibly well done movie, with great action, better casting and good plot. I love this movie, dark like the real batman, gray like the real life. I can't stop thinking in Joker's character. It's a pitty we won't see him again.",1
379," ""The Dark Knight"" is the best movie i've seen this year. It makes other batman movies seem like they were were written by three year olds. If you haven't seen this your are missing out.",1
380," There are times when you know your going to see a good movie and then there are times you come out seeing a movies that was better than the hype and thats as rare as the Knicks making it to the playoffs but thats exactly what happened with The Dark Knight.From start to finish my seat had no more edge to seat on,Everyone and i mean everyone played there charactor to the bone and bought them to live but the real scene stealler is of course The Late Heath Ledger this was a role that any ordinary actor could play but 1 in a generation could live and not know they were acting and thats how brillent and am memorising heaths Psychopathic clown really is and the most Supporting Actor Oscor worthy performance ive ever seen. RIP HEATH.",1
381," When The Dark Knight trailer was first released it seemed that every American paused to watch it. I never saw the trailer, but instead I stood in line with loads of people dressed in crazy costumes to watch the movie at the imax version of the film. I do have to say that is was worth it. It was action packed and had a good plot, much better than its previous tale (I didn",1
382," Finest of Heath Ledger, best Super Hero movie of 2008. Acting, story, script & settings , all awesome. Must watch Action.",1
383," Best comic book movie ever made. Even saying that though is an understatement. The fact that it's a comic book movie is incidental. This is an epic drama. Similar to Heat in many ways. The visual style, the writing, acting, direction are all at such a high level. Heath Ledger will be missed even moreso after this film when you realize he was only 28 when doing this role.",1
384," Very Detailed and tons of everything you need in a movie. Definitely the highest of the summer, yet alone the year and maybe even the century!",1
385, This is the essence of the comics captured with film its simply spectacular I wonder how many times I will see this movie.,1
386, This movie is awesome! The Joker is absolutely insane.,1
388, Flawless. Absolutely riveting. Nolan goes back to the intensity first seen in Memento. One of the best performances by H. Ledger. In awe of his performance.,1
389," Fantastic movie, Heath deserves an oscar for his gritty portrayal of the Dark Knights arch enemy.",1
390, One of the most brilliant movies I have seen in my life!!!!!!! The action keeps your hurt pumping like hell... keep it up Nolan!!!,1
391, This movie makes all the other superhero movies look like Bio-dome. A true epic from start to finish.,1
392," Such a brilliant movie, heath ledgers playing as the joker is amazing as well as Christian bale playing batman. would have to say the best movie of 2008 that i have seen so far, heath deserves an Oscar for his role.",1
393," A superb movie brimming with darkness and intense. The insanity that Hedge Ledger brings to the Joker is so convincing, that you will never view a super hero movie as unrealistic ever again.",1
394," What a roller-coaster ride! Great editing, cinematography, and screenplay. I've seen it twice on IMAX (the best way to view it, if you've got it available). The first time left me dazed and exhausted. The second left me exhilarated. I'm not a comic book hero fan, but I loved Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight trumps it. Brilliant. Be careful, though...it's not for kids.",1
395," This is easily the best super hero movie I have ever seen. Heath Ledger played the joker perfectly. The fact that the movie didn't rely on special effects and CG to make it ""good"" is honorable. It really is difficult to explain exactly how good this movie was with words.",1
396," This movie will not only be remembered as the final display of Ledger's unparalleled ability to make his character truly jump out of the screen and into your soul, but it will be remembered as the defining moment for the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan has actually created a film that redefines the genre, that's something not a lot of people can say. Watching this film is an experience that is undefinable. This film is certainly at a constant climax and that is no hyperbole. Anything can happen in Gotham, and this movie portrays that with an all around perfect sculpture on which to build upon. No one thought a Batman movie could be ranked with some of the best crime dramas in the last decade, but I'm here to tell you that The Dark Knight is not only one of the best, it just might be the best.",1
397, Every seat was filled in our theater... and pure silence throughout -I've never seen anything quite like it.,1
398," Chris Nolan takes the story to a whole new level. Heath Ledger does more than you can imagine with the Joker and steals the show. It is sad that he is no longer with us, but his last full performance will always be with us.",1
399," Oh, now I remember why I never used to listen to critics. It must really enrage some of them that the most engaging and thought-provoking piece of fiction to grace a movie screen in years has turned out to be a summer popcorn super hero movie that people can actually get behind and enjoy to the fullest. This is a morality play that would have made Shakespeare proud, and unlike ""No Country,"" or the other Oscar-aspiring movies out there, this one does it with the style, flash, and heart that make people want to go to the movies in the first place.",1
400," The movie drags on. Much of the show was nothing we haven't seen in Batman Begins. Heath Ledger out-shined everyone else. The problem is that the movie didn't focus much on him. Two-Face appears in a short amount of time similar to Venom in Spiderman 3. Who is better, Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson? They take different approaches and each is special in their own way.",1
402," An outstanding achievement from director Nolan; Batman Begins was a great piece of work, but 'The Dark Night' easily surpasses it in every aspect. Christian Bale once again rises to the occasion and delivers a performance that is far superior to any of the previous actors that have donned the Bat Suit, and cements his reputation as one of the finest actors of the past decade. Heath Ledger is terrifying as the Joker, in a performance, that i think, warrants an academy award nomination. In my opinion, the best film of 2008.",1
403, Brilliant. The one to beat for 2008. Believe the hype.,1
404," This is a crime/drama thriller that just happens to have eccentric characters. Thus, it will reach a far wider audience than the normal comic book movie ever would. Heath Ledger as the Joker is one of the best on screen performances in recent memory.",1
405," Spectacular. I walked in the theater expecting one of the best films ever, and I did not leave with one iota of disappointment. Easily the best film this year and probably the best film I've seen in years. Ledger, dead or alive, is a shoo-in for an Oscar. Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't have a valid cinematic opinion in my book. Not once during his brilliant portrayal did I think about the magazines, tabloids, or the fact that he was dead. I was simply in awe of a phenomenal performance. Sorry, Jack Nicholson, but this is why they didn't consult you. This Joker isn't a wanna-be stand-up comedian. Hes a sociopathic anarchist who rings truer than any comic book villain ever captured on film. The movie probably isn't artsy enough to get a Best Picture nod, but it's guaranteed to get the Visual Effects and Cinematography Oscars. The comparisons to Heat are accurate. There are images from this film that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Don't even put this in the category of ""Superhero Films"" unless you mention Batman Begins. No way is any Spider-Man or Iron Man film even close to the realm of where this franchise is at right now. If you don't like comic book or action movies, you're not likely to enjoy this film. If you liked, even loved Batman Begins, then I find it extremely hard to imagine that you will leave the theater feeling dissatisfied.",1
406," It's good. At times, it was very good. But it tries to do too much, and the technical execution (like editing) suffer tremendously because of that. Even moreso, it's a repackage of the Tim Burton movie. Scene by scene, it's not that far off, seriously. Don't believe me? For those of you who didn't catch it the first time, see it again and take note. It's the original Batman, plus Two-Face, just not as goofy. In that regard, it's like buying Madden 09 thinking that you're getting something different from all other Maddens ever made. You're still going to buy it and enjoy it, but you can't take back the earlier version to subsidize the current cost. It is NOT the best superhero movie of all time. I think people are overracting because a) Ledger is dead and b) there has been a serious drought of good summer movies (Transformers and Indy were dismal). Ledger carries it, but he was diluted with side storylines. SPOILER ALERT: There were some really confusing moments, like ""how'd they survive that fall?"" or ""how did Batman get everyone's cell phone?"" And ""what's with all these lame Batman copycats, did they really need that, seriously?!"" or ""Why didn't the Joker notice the closet had a big metal pole keeping anyone from getting in or out while he was looking for Harvey Dent in a one-floor apartment?"" Come on, he's Batman's nemesis and he didn't think to check the closet? Some of those moments are just flat-out stupid, but Ledger's acting distracts you from them. And there's way too much Alfred acting exactly like Michael Cane in every movie Michael Cane has ever been in. It's an eye-popping spectacle of a film that can't quite figure out what it is, so it floods your eyes, ears, and mouth with a whole lot of Bat-isms that, quite frankly, you've seen before.",1
407, A complete masterpiece that never crawls and never speeds by. The danger seems real and the Joker is one sociopath that actually is frightening.,1
408," Words fail to describe this. My only distraction was the mild attempts at blockbuster-sylized humor every now and then, and teh fact that everyone made it out to sound dark and sadistic, when it was just psychological, not dark (as in my opinion.)",1
409," Flawed at moments but enough mind blowing action and amazing acting writing production design, cinematography, and directing to wash it out. A great movie.",1
410,Great movie had everything from action and phenomenal acting on parts of Ledger Bale and Eckhart.another great direction from Nolan overall great and ledger hands down beats Nicholson's Joker. Highly recommend!!!!!,1
411," This is the best movie not only for the summer but of all time,the story,characters,even actors are the best.",1
412, I say the movie is brilliant (as a comic book maniac and as a movie lover).,1
413," As close to a ""10"" that I would give any picture that is not flawless. It's hard to search my mind and think of a more captivating screen villain in performance or execution. This film has moments that will stay with me for a LOT longer than moments from any other comic book based film. I kept my expectations under wraps as I did not want to buy into over inflated hype. Well, the hype was NOT over inflated. An exhausting cinematic experience, but well worth the effort!",1
414," This movie was a masterpiece in it's own right. The atmosphere portrayed by Nolan and the cast created a world that not only was believable, but possible. From Bruce Wayne's psychological struggle with Batman to the world of Gotham that seems on the verge utter chaos. The cast really showed what acting is all about in this movie, the undeniable presence of the Joker brought a sense of instilled fear that will go down in movie history. The performance created by the Heath was so impressive that I never once thought there was an actor behind the makeup. I found no flaw or nuance in any of the actors at any point in the movie, I literally felt as though I was watching a ""comic-book"" tale come to life. The Joker is not a terrorist or a psychopathic killer, he is the complete and utter opposite of everything good in a human being. There is no villain or evil worse than a being that is the full embodiment of pure chaos and anarchy.",1
415,"I saw this yesterday around 3:30, and my theaters in Westminster turned into the Bat Cave. They took the old posters from last year and graffiti-ed all of them to promote the Dark Knight, which was brilliant and a great reception. Never have I seen something like that happen since Lord of the Rings. And the film made it all better. It's not every summer you get a superhero movie that is a masterpiece. This was proven last year with, you guessed it, Spider-Man 3. I was hoping that this would be not be another one of those types of movies. And thankfully, it wasn't. Heath Ledger, my God, you can't imagine. He does a great job in probably the best preformance from an actor, not just in a superhero film, but any film, EVER. If he doesn't get nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars this year (despite the fact he's dead), I will throw the biggest ballbaby fit I ever had and I will be swearing more than usual. This film is totally dark, and it's not like Fantastic Four or Spider-Man, it's crazy. There are some very gruesome images in this movie even for a PG-13 rating. Which means do not take little kids to see this film. The film is far more superior than Batman Begins. It has great action and far better acting than Batman Begins, especially for the character of Rachel Dawes. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a much better Rachel Dawes than what Katie Holmes was. And it was like they took all the flaws of the first and got rid of it. And it ends well. I say see it, or you are missing out. I give this a perfect 10/10.",1
416," This movie was phenomenal. Heath Ledger's Joker was genuinely scary. This movie had a dark and scary aspect, but a hidden bright side.",1
417, Astounding and powerful - Ledger is unstoppable.,1
418," Spellbinding performance by Ledger - Heath outshines Nicholson's Joker by truly becoming the villain, not just playing him.",1
419," Took 45 minutes for the Dark Knight to actually go from serious drama to actual action film. The ending went on for about twenty minutes longer than it needed to. Doesn't deserve tens. Sin City was far superior as far as comic-book/graphic novel adaptations go. I was dissappointed with this film. It was good, not great. And Ledger played a great Joker, but he's no Jack.",1
420," WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD Outstanding addition to this franchise reboot. The whole operation is vastly superior to Burton's (I'm convinced that hack should have been a painter instead of a director, because he makes beautiful pictures but can't tell a story worth a hoot). In my opinion, only two things keep this movie from being the best super hero flick of all time: 1) Confused action sequences. Nolan is a talented director indeed, but something tells me he skipped the film school classes on telling a narrative through action. The multiple Batmen scene, the car chase scene... there's little sense of spatial layout or timing; it's often just a jumbled mess. That approach worked for Batman Begins, where it was all about selling the fear and confusion. Here, it became distracting and broke the narrative. 2) Harvey Dent. I know others were all over his inclusion in the story, but I was less than enthused. First of all, his development and storyline robbed screen time from Batman and Joker, who were just a joy to watch. (If there's any complaint of Ledger, it's that there wasn't enough of him.) Second, it was in his sequences that the film got distractingly sanctimonious. It could have struck the same deep ethical chords with a little more subtlety than was employed here, and Dent was the worst offender. Third, his eventual disfigurement is so laughably unrealistic and ridiculous that it robbed the whole reality ""what-if"" factor and reduced it to the pulp nonsense of Burton's series. This movie would have been flawless if they could have worked all of Dent's elements into the other characters and done away with him. He is the one part of the money that made me notice how long it was. Otherwise, it's solid stuff. Great as both summer popcorn fodder and something a little meatier. Ledger's Joker is really a joy to behold - not so much for his wily mannerisms and oddness, but because of his take on the character itself. A thoughtful, believable performance to create a truly terrifying maniac. So close, Nolan, so close....",1
421," Good acting from most of the cast, especially Heath Ledger. He will be missed. But the movie misses the masterpiece mark as it's hero/anithero is greatly overshadowed by all of the othe characters in the movie; with the exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal who should have stayed home.",1
422, The best batman movie ever made.,1
423, Amazing.,1
424," All of Nolan's films require thought. His films are never just a ""whodunit"" but big resounding WHYs? What led to the ""why,"" etc. Memento was amazing. Prestige was truly good -especially if you have ever done reading on Tesla, his creepiness and genius and cult like activities leading to madness. Batman Begins is another WHY. Dark Knight is a How and Why when all known societal WHYs do not appply in the face of a new and deadly threat. Aren't the WHY's of life what eat at us on deep and universal levels? Nolan strikes this chord full force in Knight. The plot may seem jumbled, but like Memento and Prestige, which also seemed so, there is a constant theme...a constant moving towards something. As the face of evil comes closer and closer, we find that it is not that dissimilar from our own face...merely one thing or another and it could be ours. Nolan, I salute you. All your films have been great. The bst things is, like Knight, the more and more you think about them, the better they get. That, ladies and gentleman, is a great film. One that will last. One that grows as you think about it. NOTE ON SALON REVIEW: With the exception of Rope and Shadow of a Doubt, Hitchcock is highly overrated. Yes, he was a fantastic manipulator of fear. He was a great director, but his films are never deep or moving. They are interesting and gimicky, but they never (with exceptions) touch on deep issues. Please, don't compare everyone to old Alfred, the man who made films about birds, matricidal homosexuals, and everything else (shocking for the times) but dull. GO SEE DARK KNIGHT NOW BUT DO NOT BRING KIDS!",1
425,The best comic book movie i have ever seen if heath ledger does not win an oscar i will be pissed for the person that says that it is too confusing and long he can go back to watching the older batmans.,1
426," A near amazing first half kind of unwinds into a decent second half. The script and acting is strong across the board. Its the plot and thus pacing that start to unravel. Lets see how many post 9-11 references we can cram into the last hour. Heath was good but I don't find the role to be insanely challenging. Not the best comic book movie ever made. Wont be the best movie of the year, but well made and definitely worth seeing.",1
427," This movie was amazing! Heath's Joker blasts Jack's out of the water! Just enough of a pyschotic to make things interesting but not enough to totally creep me out. I can't think of a negative for this movie honestly. I didn't even mind that it was 2 hours and 40 minutes long, in fact I was so into the movie the time flew by! Havey's facial injury looked amazing...as well.",1
428," A powerful use of every resouce movie, Ledger is the biggest Joker oof our times!",1
429," Batman Begins was an all around great introduction, as well as a better film. However, this was a fantastic piece of work, and a much better improvement on the original four Batman films. There were a few jokes at the expense of the original films which were clever. I anticipate the third film if it comes to them actually producing it.",1
430, One of the most enthralling movies I have seen in recent times. It was miles ahead of all the recent superhero flicks for the realism and depth of the characters and the completely unpredictable direction the movie takes across the entire time.,1
431," Did not know what was going to happen at any given moment; in a world of cliches, that is the highest compliment, and one paid to what once once considered a B-level genre, the superhero movie. A perfect balance of story, moral contemplation, entertainment, homage, execution, technical achievement, and so on. Christopher Nolan's ambitiousness never once exceeded his grasp. Any minor flaw can be easily overlooked by the achievements of this film.",1
432," Wow! Amazing! There isn't much to say that hasn't been said, Bale is the best Batman we've seen but still took a backseat to Eckhart's great performance as Harvey Dent and there are no words to describe Heath Ledger's Joker. A final performance that will go down as one of the best acting jobs ever, let alone a comic book/super hero movie. I don't know if Bale is signed on for another movie or not, they could end it now and it would be perfect but if Nolan and Bale come back with a 3rd movie I will be in line on opening weekend.",1
433," I have maybe seen only one or two movies that I could sit through and watch over and over again and this one tops them all. I could watch The Dark Knight over and over and over again, it is filled with everything you couldve ever hoped for in a movie. Everyone stood up and applauded when this movie ended, it has emerged as one off my favorite movies ever. Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his performance as he possesses every element of a maniac and perfects it. A great story, great acting and great charachters make this the best movie of the summer, best superhero movie and one of the best in years",1
434, Conservative christians should praise Heath Ledger for the this performance; it will make you believe in the devil.,1
435," A solid sequel to Batman Begins, with Heath Ledger's outstanding performance as the Joker cutting a sinister edge onto the series. Without a doubt this decade's best villain. Go see this movie!",1
436," I watched in awe the balance of conflicts at the heart of the story -- hero vs. villain, hope vs. desperation, choice vs. chance -- all played out by characters struggling with their own agendas, needs and/or objectives. For those who revel in this film's symphonic nature, they will see the meter and pacing of these inter-twined conflicts as something spectacular. And for those who are tone deaf to this symphony, or who cannot seem to grasp even one of these co-mingled themes (these are the people who complain about a muddled story), there's the spectacle of it all. Thank you, Mr. Nolan, for not ""dumbing down"" this film. You have presented us your vision in its full complexity, and it works!",1
437," Absolutely amazing, be sure to see in IMAX to get the full experience but without a doubt the best movie to grace the screens in the past few years.",1
438," It was fantastic, 10 out of 10. Ledger made a lot of the movie, if he werent in it, it would've been closer to a 7 out of 10.",1
439," Marvellous. Spectacular, just.... I got speechless.",1
440," Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Overall the movie is excellent, but not perfect -- it starts to drag a bit about 2/3 of the way through, but then picks up again.",1
441," Simply amazing! See it again, its the best movie I've seen in a long time. Christopher Nolan amazes me with beautiful action sequences and well thought out shot compositions. Heath Ledger pushes the joker past what ever Jack Nicholson could have ever done and make him a villain we just hate, but want to watch.",1
442," Wow, this movie was incredible. I've got to say that this is the best comic book movie ever made. The story is clever and the performance by the actors are very genuine. This movie will make your heart pound, get chills, and actually leave you wanting more. But at certain points the movie falls short of greatness. There are some part where cliche and summer blockbuster themes come into play. I have seen this movie multiple times and it gets better every time.",1
443," This movie was not that good. Everyone is giving out 10s its funny lol. The joker was great, batman was equally as bad. This movie dragged, batman begins was a much better film. This film was too jumbled, only thing this movie did was make these people into jokers giving it a 10.",1
445," Not as much a superhero movie as a crime drama, a really good movie and with excellent performances. Ledger was of course excellent and disturbing as the Joker, but who REALLY stole the show (in my opinion) was Aaron Ackhart as Harvey Dent, who, without giving away anything, gave an amazing and memorable performance both in the first 2/3 of the movie....and the final 3rd, really, REALLY intense performance there. Pretty much everyone had their moments. The only flaw I'd give is that I wish Gotham City retained the really cool look it had in the last movie (it reminded me of Midgar from FF7...in The Dark Knight it looked just a hell of a lot like Chicago) and that Bruce Wayne himself didn't get a ton of screen time. I also thought the finale, which good, wasn't exactly as thrilling as the train fight in the 1st movie. Still, excellent, really good stuff.",1
446, Wow.... haha I wanted to give it a 10 but the people laughing in the theater kinda ruined my movie viewing experience.. lol seriously whenever something particularily disturbing happened they started laughing... either they're like pervs or something or that was nervous laughter =),1
447, this is a very good movie.After lord of the rings this is the movie i liked very much.really amazing,1
448," I've seen the movie two times, and i'll definetely see it again. It's one of the best movies i've ever seen. I agree with an Oscar nomination for Heath. You can never notice him on the film; it's the pure Joker. In general, all the perfomances were splendid. The visual effects and the music are amazing too. I'd recommend that film. Greetings from Venezuela.",1
449," This movie was entertaining but after all the hype I was disappointed. Very little screen time for Batman. Maggie Gyllenhall, a good actress, was miscast. The editiing and the dialogue left a lot to be desired. Heath Ledger was good and deserves the praises he has received for playing a strange deranged character.",1
450, I saw this Movie on Friday the 25. Wow. What a great movie. Wonderful job by all.,1
451," Amazing in every sense of the word... I'd elaborate, but see it, and you'll know exactly what i mean... Great.",1
452," it was dramaticly shocking. Absolutely different from the earlier batman movie. But it'll be better if they didn't use a very difficult plot to understand that basically people won't understand and make some people think that's boring. But still, the best heroe-movie plot i've ever watch",1
453, The Dark Knight is a great great first rate crime thriller. The one thing this is not is a superhero movie. This is an epic crime saga. From the rise and fall of Harvey Dent to the very personal war between Batman and The Joker the film takes you on an emotion and adrenaline fuelled ride for 2 and a half hours. And the last laugh truly is the Joker's in a non typical hollywood ending. Heath Ledger stands out in every scene and delivers a truly iconic performance and give us a villain for the 21st century (an oscar has never been more deserved). Also a special shout for Christopher Nolan has worked wonders yet again on a franchise that looked dead. 10/10 The best movie since The Departed,1
454," Phenomenal, best movie of the year if not best movie of the past 9 years.",1
455," This movie sets new standards for superheroes movies. Finally an adult take on supes, and not the usual brainless kiddie stuff of, as an example, J.Schumacher's Batman or whichever Marvel movie. Not for children tough.",1
456," Amazing, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, couldn't have been better.",1
457, This beautifully acted and portrayed thriller succeedsany expectation i ever had on the movie. heath ledgers acting is just phenominal and stunningly perfect!,1
458," This movie was great, way better than Iron man. I haven't seen Batman Begins yet, so that might have been what made the beginning of the movie a little confusing. But ""the dark knight"" is one of the best movies I've seen this year. even people who don't like superhero movies will like this, because it is a true crime thriller. Heath Ledger's performance was incredible.",1
459," I'd give it between an 85-89. Much darker than the original. One of the biggest issues I had was how they changed up the actor for Rachel, it just kinda makes it harder to get into for me, cause you know its a completely different person, the Joker was pretty unique and I think Heath Ledger did a really good job. The 2-face sideplot was pretty sketchy, I think the change was way too sudden and seemed pretty unrealistic with human nature. *SPOILER*He wouldn't shoot the Joker who was obviously the primary reason for what happened, but he shoots batman and tries to shoot Gordon??? and with Morgan Freeman's character, he quits because batman hooked up a sonar system that invaded peoples privacy for a day when the city was in a crisis state????*SPOILER* There's some plot flaws, otherwise it could have easily been a 9.5.",1
460," Amazing. One of the most entertaining, well-crafted films in the modern era and easily the best comic book/superhero adaption ever. Despite a stellar cast, Ledger rises above and is spellbinding in his perfectly conceived, original interpretation of the Joker. Bale again perfectly channels the quiet rage of Batman. Oldman, Freeman, and Eckhardt are all fantastic in their roles. Gyllenhaal is a definite upgrade over Katie Holmes. Nolan has created the definitive vision of Batman's universe and has brought more realism, philosophy, and poetry to a comic book character than previously thought possible. Balancing the depth of his themes with spectacularly executed action sequences, Nolan has produced a masterpiece. Looking forward to Nolan's third installment!",1
461, Amazing! This film has become my faavourite film of all time.,1
463," Just about as good as you could expect an action movie to get. Far better than what could previously be expected from a comic book based film, as a matter of fact, far better than what could previously be expected from any action-crime-thriller. Excellent performances by all involved, and especially Heath Ledger, who far surpasses the hype surrounding the film.",1
464,"All the performances were great.  Ledger is a far better Joker than Nicholson (but anyone who knows anything about Batman would know that was the case before seeing the movie).  His performance is bang-on for what the Joker is supposed to be. The rest of the cast is solid, particularly Oldman and Eckhart in the less flamboyant roles.  My criticism of the movie is that it takes far too long for it to really go anywhere.  It spends almost two hours before we really get going.  Additionally, the main idea of the story is rehashed over and over again.  Okay, we get it, the Joker doesn't have any good reason for doing what he does.  Now lets get some, you know, story here.  I think that the archetypal aspects of the comic are missing and that's what weakens the movie. All that said, the movie is still well-worth seeing, probably more than once.  It is not, however, the perfect film that many make it out to be.",1
465," Absolutely amazing movie. Heath Ledger's performance is stunning, and makes me all the more miserable about his death. Christian Bale as usual is a great actor, along with all the other performances in this movie. I cannot understand how someone with the name 'The Terminator' could say there is too much violence for his/her taste. You seriously need to change your name, as the only thing you terminate, is your credibility. A zero for a score? This means you think this is one of the worst movies ever made. Your opinion should be rated a '0'. As for the reviewers that rate this movie anything less than 80%, I cannot understand it. This movie is definitely worth AT LEAST 80%. Worse movies have received better ratings than that, and this movie definitely deserves at least 90% in my book. I almost gave it a '10', but I thought, the perfect 10 is nearly unattainable, and there were SOME issues I had with this movie that keep it from being a '10'. All the same, I've seen the movie three times now, so that says a lot about how good this movie is. As a side note, people who rate this movie '0'-'3', had better have some GOOD reasons why it deserves such a low rating. Too much violence, or a beef with a certain actor or actress is NOT a good enough reason. What did you expect the JOKER to do, pull a flower out instead of a knife? And if you hate Batman so much, why are you watching a BATMAN movie? It's like watching a Spiderman movie, but hating Spiderman the whole time. What is the point?",1
466, One of the best movies that I've ever seen. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. You have to see it in Imax.,1
468," A dark and disturbing masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless. I was kept guessing till the very end. Nothing felt like it was for certain. It had parts that made you laugh, and feel like a total jerk while doing it. It showcases a villain different from the norm. Anyone that doesn't like it can go watch some crappy, generic superhero movie. Spider-man definitely wasn't bad, but this completely made me forgot that it was a superhero movie. It's easily the best of its kind.",1
470," Fantastic film. A superhero movie that actually had a really good plot, and tugged at my emotions. That Joker fella is sick and twisted.",1
471, Amazing. Breath taking. One of the best movies Ive ever seen. Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances I have ever see. It is indescribable. Go see it. You owe it to yourself.,1
472, you need to see this movie more than once to really understand and appreciate it... but you should it's amazing.,1
473," AWESOME. At the end of the movie, the audience in the cinema stood up and gave it a standing ovation. Pretty cool, a bit gay, but hey ... cool.",1
474," GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!! First of all all the hype on Heath Ledgers performance is much deserved. You were not watching Ledger you were watching the Joker. He was in my opinion flawless and anyone who thinks otherwise is blind. Ledger became the Joker and for me stole the show hands down. I would have never expected such a performance from a former teen movie actor. The movie itself was dark, the pictures were fantastic, the music throughout the entire movie keep the suspense going. What an awesome job by all. Bale is cool, calm, and strong. I loved him as Bateman even down the the McGruff voice that one reviewer pointed out. He went from Armani tailored Bruce Wayne to Bateman. The only reason I noticed the length of the movie was because I needed to take a tinkle with 40 minutes left but there was no way I was going to miss a minute so I sat there in agony but it was worth it.",1
475,Could have lost 10-15 min.- a little long....,1
476,"I think that this is a classic. A brilliant, darker, and menacing portrayal of the Batman legacy. Its much more true to the graphic novels and comic books, and I'm surprised with some of the bad reviews.  All through the movie, you get the sense of immediate threat, and its quite stark just how rellevant its themes of terrorism are to today.  Brilliant acting, and obviously Heath Ledger steals the show, which some critics don't like! The fact that the bad-guy is the most interesting and best acted character isn't bad. What about Javier Bardem in ""No Country For Old Men""?",1
477, The best movie ever. Heath Ledger was a great choice for joker and was really funny. I would see it 100 more times with out being bored it was very unpredictable.,1
479," This is the best superhero movie I have ever watched. Ledger was stunning and scary as the Joker and Bale has to be one of the better Bat-men that I've come across. Overall the film had an epic feeling to it. The greatness of Batman stems from the fact that he is ready to sacrifice his image and be seen as the villain just to protect his city. As for the people who think that its too dark and depressing, that's the way Batman is supposed to be. That's why its called The 'Dark' Knight.",1
480," Dark, brilliantly acted and extremely entertaining. There really is little more you could ask from a movie of this calibre. It may not be intensely realistic, but it's as close as it gets for a comic book flick. The dramatics are well timed and the film noir overlay sets the perfect mood to truly allow viewers to become immersed. A masterpiece, and that's no joke. Long live Ledger.",1
481," Phenomenal. A bit long at 2 and a half hours, but utterly entertaining and chilling.",1
482," I laugh at Billy C inferring that Two Face copies Anton Chigurrh. But since that comment was definitely made just piss someone off, I'll ignore it. great movie, great acting/directing. Deserves Oscar nominations. Tons of em.",1
483, This is the best superhero movie EVER. No doubt. And there isn't a single person who saw it and didn't love Ledger as the Joker- the best villain ever to appear in a movie. Too bad that he won't be able to hold his prize(s) in his own hands.,1
484," Why are people posting these fake reviews when it hasn't been released and we know for SURE that none of them actually saw it. I'm giving it a 10 with the confidence that when I do see it, it will match the high expectations I've read from ACTUAL MOVIE CRITICS who previewed the movie at the time of this review.",1
485," Best superhero movie made, period! Heath ledgers performance does not only deserve an Oscar nomination but a winner in my book, 10 times better than Nicholson, and Aaron Eckart is superb, plus Christian Bale may be the best batman ever! Add that together and its the best summer movie",1
486, Definitely freakin amazing i wanted to see it way before heath ledger died it was way better than i expected and he was WAY better than jack he deserved an Oscar it was great!!,1
487, Action movies this good are very few and far between. The best movie released since the Gladiator.,1
488," Christopher Nolan put together a wonderful piece of magical works in which my eyes stood upon. He made up the Joker to be as good as the Joker should be with great lines and putting the best actor in the suit. The movie kept me in and off my seat at all most every moment, every part seemed to flow perfectly and it seemed flawless with few mistakes to notice and kept me personally guessing. I rate it a perfect 10 and one of the greatest movies this world will ever see!!!!",1
489," This movie is the amazing. It may be long, but it was so worth it. This movie gives a more darker and realistic twist to the superhero genre. This is a movie in which the good guy doesn't win.",1
490, This movie is awesome! I've always thought Ledger is always overact but he pulled off a beautiful performance. He is everything the joker is meant to be be. Bale still did a good job although Gyllenhaal was a let down. For those who claim that the movie is depressing then they just didn't get it. Batman isn't about being a hero who saves the day and the whole ciity is thankful. He's both loved and hated. Kudos to Nolan for as showing us the real dark knight. This movie makes it so much easier to forget those dreadful days of Batman & Robin and Mr Freeze!!!,1
491, Arguably one of the best movies ever.any one rating it below did not pay attention to dialogues or the characterisation and the ending questionable? surely you r joking mr rob t.,1
492, Best super hero film ever. Grounded in real life.,1
493, Heath Ledger's acting performance is one of the best all time acting performances. Ever. Period.,1
494," Over all it was a fairly good movie, Great performace by Heath Ledger but it fealt like I was sitting though Lord of the Rings 3 again. Interesting story line but let you down in some spots.",1
496, Absolutely one of the greatest films ive ever seen. A roller coaster of emotion and action. Practically pulls you out of your seat and into this dark world where the conflict between Batman and Joker is a reality!,1
498," I love it, Heath Ledger was an outstanding Joker, the best I have ever seen, the film was well thought out, and the character who played 2 face was just amazing as well.",1
499," Ok, obviously whoever rated this film a 0 - 5 is a faggot and can go back to watching movies like 10,000 B.C. and Jumper which they would probably find interesting and both are probably the worst movies ive ever seen. The Dark Knight is the best film of 2008 by far. Is it perfect? No like many other great movies sure it has some flaws to it. Bale's voice as Batman always had annoyed me but he still did a great job other than that little thing. Health Ledger dominated the film.Ledgers performance as the joker finally made me see what a real villian is. How evil a person can be. The movie is a little bit too long but its all worth it at the end. For the people who havent seen The Dark Knight yet ignore all these losers and their review because they dont know sh*t.",1
500," Well, the movie, was to damn long, but i think it was great, the story line, man!!! the joker is the greatest villain of all superhero movies, this guy really nade this long movie not booring, i was alwasy waiting for the joker to appear, he was hillarious and scary at the same time, great acting, even tough, batman, man!! christian bale has been the worst batman ever i think,.. hes voice is freakin stressing.. kill the batman !!! jajaja.. man i really wanted to joind the joker to kill the batman!!!",1
501," I thought this is a refreshing burst for superhero films. Yes it mite have gone on for a bit, and yes nolan mite chop scenes a bit. But, the acting by Ledger was absolutely stunning, making this film sinister and dark without him playing that role the film would have the edge that it does have. Bale for me has secured the role of batman for a long time, giving wales yet another thing to be proud of! and SIR michael caine and morgan freeman give a performance which we know EXPECT from the two of them. Nolans directing was refreshing for a superhero film and one of the best i have seen for a long time.",1
502," ""This movie is no fun. It satisfies the fanboys' desire to have their comic book heroes taken seriously. That's where I think all this fan adulation is coming from. But that totally misses the point. Where's the fun? Where is the superheroic fantasy adventure? The self-referential coyness? This Batman is scary and repulsive. The little boy in me doesn",1
503," A lot of fun, love the cast, not as good as Batman Begins, but a good ride. Heath rules -we miss you.",1
504," A gloriously sadistic cinematic masterpiece. It's dark and twisting, though a bit overlong. the shots give a dark view on Gotham City. Two-Faces costume is lacklustre and the CGI additions to the character where pretty poor. Miles ahead of the pack.",1
505," This movie was not as well polished as the first. batmans preformance was over shadowed by many supporting actors. Also the choice of spanish street fighting as batmans princible martial art made him look skilless. The fact that many iconic batman fighting moves wern't used made me feel like this wasn't a batman movie. batmans martial arts skill take a distant back seat to technology. Supporting villians also feel like they where weakly thought out, ready to take a pathetic john wayne punch. Even though both the joker and two face where well portrayed accurately. This movie felt like truly sad attempt at capturing the dark night.",1
506, first time i went to the movies and felt i should have been charged more.,1
507, It would have been a ten but it went on too long. There was a clear ending to the movie and then it went on and on as if there was some political message that they wanted to push on the viewers which felt tacked on at the end. It was incredible on a IMAX screen.,1
508," Ball-busting, mind-blowing; a force that demonstrates the power of good cinematic entertainment.",1
509," I was very disappointed! All the fuzz around the movie but nothing new came to happen. It was entertaining, yes it was, but the story was very predictable, and so were the joker stunts. The movie was well acted, especially in my opinion by Gary Oldman and Christian Bale, Heath gave us a new joker, but i believe he has been given great reviews due to his tragic death, i have to be honest about that. This joker, could be called diablo, florist, pokemon, he was a great villain, but i personally didn't find any ""Joker"" in Dark Knight! Very well directed, dark just like a batman movie should be, great action sequences, but it was no 5 star movie!",1
510, I wish i could give this movie higher than a 10. i luv this movie! absolutely genius! heath ledger did an outstanding job as the joker.,1
511, This movie should definitely make it to the top 5 movies list in the history of cinema. Heath Ledger's performance is legendary and it is a fitting goodbye to the world of cinema by him by this out of the world performance.All hail Ledger!,1
512, Thank you all....especially Heath Ledger.,1
513, Best batman to date. incredible acting and very credible story line.,1
514," By far the best Batman film ever created, here's to Chris Nolan!",1
516, I'm not a big fan of Batman but after I saw The Dark Knight ...I can say that this was best movie based on comic ever....and I went to cinema twice... worth in every cent.,1
517, This movie is a essential Masterpiece that will be remembered. Joker is a true Villain and shows how if people are pushed they could show what there true character is good or evil.,1
518, Ledger's performance alone turned a good movie into a great one.,1
519," A fantastically dark film that weaves a maniacal tapestry of death and degradation around it's good-guys, who constantly find themselves subverting their highest morals to achieve what is necessary to save Gotham. Better than its predecessor in every way, it's unjust to simply say this is the best comic book film ever made -which it is - when it could be considered also one of the greatest crime epics of all time. While the plot is certainly extraordinary - and trust me, you'll want as little of this film's twisting and turning plot spoiled to you before you see it as possible - the true measure of this film's greatness comes from the brilliant performances. Christian Bale nails both Bruce Wayne and Batman, perfectly embodying the arrogant billionaire and the raspy-voiced vigilante, and never letting one overshadow the other. Aaron Eckhart makes us care so much about Harvey Dent that it ruly hurts when he undergoes the transformation we all know he must undergo. Gary Oldman brilliantly underplays the most incorruptable cop in Gotham, and genuinely makes us care about his character. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are spectacular in their supporting roles, and both of them undergo their own personal journeys that are not only relevant but integral to the plot of the film. Finally, Heath Ledger delivers a haunting and nuanced performance of one of the scariest villains in cinema history. It's Ledger's presence that truly drives the film, and while I'll try to refrain from hyperbole, I can say without a doubt that it is the best supporting performance of the year so far (I say this for the benefit of the Acadamy, who should at least award him a nomination at this year's Oscars). All around, this is a brilliant movie. Does it have it's flaws? Of course. The film is at times muddled, and Ledger is so magnetic that the film threatens to bore when he's not on screen (but I want to make it clear that it never does). But that does little to mar this epic film, or the feeling that you've just finished watching something truly special when you've finished it.",1
520," Brilliant movie, unbelieveble acting, incredible effects and a creepy evil that truly feels like a threat... The best movie I watched in year... (and i watch MANY movies).",1
521, An awesome movie; I can find nothing to criticize.,1
522," Exhilarating, captivating, and excellent are words, which can hardly express the overall brilliance of this movie. Having seen all of the previous batman movies, one sees a changing genre of film among them, first they were more of a comedy, and through a few other phase shifts, we are now at a time of more serious Batman's. When things undergo a change they usually get worse before they get better, but with this Batman movie that was not the case. The actor, Heath Ledger, plays a phenomenal part as the Joker, and his boldness and his terrifyingly good syncopation with his character is stunning. He is actually able to fully put on the persona of his character, and it is this bond, this terrifying connection that makes his character the most stunning and best-acted character in the movie, without question. The other characters, such as Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Harvey Dent (Two Face) also play compelling roles. We see that Bruce Wayne is having a sort of midlife crisis and feels that soon there will not be a need for him anymore. This feeling is pervade in all of his actions and is very convincing. Harvey Dent, who faces a similar dilemma, turns to anger and hate for people, instead of towards protecting the people, as Bruce Wayne, in the end, chose to continue doing. Through quality scenery, excellent make-up, and spectacular stunts, this movie is able to permeate into the audience and deliver extraordinary feelings, feelings of joy, fear, sadness, betrayal, courage, cunning, and of a bittersweet ending to the madness and chaos which the Joker so successfully creates in, The Dark Knight!",1
523, Fantastic movie! loved every minute beginning to end. Showed a lot of talent with all the actors especially Heath!,1
524," I'm a sucker for superhero movies in general, so my grade might be inflated a bit. Even so, Heath Ledger's protrayal of the Joker was scary and twisted - probably the best performance in a comic book movie ever. The rest of the movie left something to be desired. It was too long, the action sequences weren't always comprehensible, and you got the feeling that Christian Bale sometimes didn't get the script for any given scene until five minutes before shooting (forgivable; his performance in the last one was wonderful.) All in all, a great movie, and a definite DVD buy.",1
525," Believe the hype! this is one hell of a thrill ride... returns batman to his dark gothic roots, darker even then betman begins, in such a satriacal way that it will leave you breathless! Borderline oscar worthy!",1
526, Best movie I have ever seen since Blade.,1
527," Just awesome. This is the Batman we all know and love. It's dark, it's gritty, it's complicated and you see a great man do a great thing for the sake of others and not for the sake of his own ego. Just awesome. And once again, buckets of blood, obscene language and porn scenes were not needed to make this movie great. In fact, it is greater because of the lack of those things.",1
528," Could be a great movie. Nolan and his edition team must realize that sometimes longer doesn't mean better. But in the other side of the balance is the Joker... impressive character of Ledger. The film leaves something kind of unusual in comic films: that the audience would like to become in the villian rather than Batman. The joker plays with us, just like does with Batman. Remarcable scenes: 1) The joker expose two different reasons of his scars (violent father and abandoned housband) Was he laughing of the typical villain?... Great script 2) The Joker being hanged down of the string. Was Nolan laughing of Burton's first Batman??? (remember that the joker falls down of the building?)",1
529, One of the best movies I've ever seen can't wait for the rerelease so I can catch it in Imax one more time.,1
530," Is is absolutely not as great as everyone said it is. I enjoyed it, but I also enjoyed Iron Man just as much. But at least Iron Man knew what it was trying to be. TDK tries to balance action whilst attempting to be ""thought provoking drama"". I felt very alienated because of it and insulted. My favorite scene was the large action sequence in act 2 with the transport. Problem with that is that the action sequence is NEVER my fave scene in a film. That just goes to show how the dramatic components fail. Problem is action is not suppose to be subtle while drama is and the problem with this movie is that everything is just so in your face, including the film arrogant, annoying and pompous message. I enjoyed it, but is far from being a masterpiece.",1
531, Perfect.,1
532," One of the greatest action movies ever, and the best movie of the year. Not a doubt.",1
533," This was a spectacular films, but like all in life its not without weaknesses. Nonetheless this gems burns brightly in the darkest of nights!",1
534,"The whole movie was a 7... The two first hours were 8.5-9. It was lenghty and at the end, I was bored after having been amazed by the beginning.Plus, Gotham is supposed to be a kinda' dark city (as in the first one, wich was better), but in this one, it looks like... downtown Chicago at noon. It's an overated movie, but still a good one. Anyone seeking entertainment should go and watch this.",1
535,"The attempt at setting a darker tone is only achieved through an incredible performance by Ledger. It should be noted that Nolan is inadequate in delivering the true tone that Burton instilled in both of his films e.g. Batman himself looked darker in Batman & Batman Returns. Nolan throws in way too much philosophy, which is mediocre and lacking in metaphysic... to be frank, the second time through I was literally looking at my watch, waiting for the film to be over. I would only watch the film once, but I recommend the film to those who are obsessed with the psychotic; then again, I as well find interest in the subject however I found The Crow, American Psycho, and the first Batman to be much better and less cliche in their approach to presenting such character. From an avid film connoisseur, the film could have been so much better, and it is highly over rated,",1
536," Not a boring scene in the film, it flows like clock work great preformances alll round and a near perfect script with a over 5 great quotes and the greatest super hero villan battle in history to add to it . What more do you want?",1
537," Simply put, a masterpiece of modern cinema.",1
538, The best film since LOTR.,1
539," Excellent movie that felt dark and gritty but still contained a message of hope. Ledger was quite good, but so was Morgan Freeman and the rest of the cast.",1
540," Excellent. The writing was so clever, and ledger put on maybe the greatest villan performance of all time. What a tradgic death he had. The Dark Knight's newest member, Harvey Dent, was a big factor in the film. It's intensity gets your heart pounding out of your chest! The best Batman film by a mile, and probably the best superhero film. The Dark Knight is DA BOMB!!",1
541, Heath Ledger was amazing in this movie! The action was great and the acting was great! Great plot and story too! One of my favorite movies I've seen!!,1
542," This is my favorite movie. It's the best movie ever made. It's much darker than ""Batman Begins"" and features superb performances by Christian Bale (he's 110% Batman), Heath Ledger (the modern and slightly more insane Joker) and Aaron Eckhart (the terrifying Two-Face). I'm so happy that Christopher Nolan shows Gotham City in it's true, dark nature with his movies and let us all forget the AWFUL past (the old Batman movies). This is really a great movie and everyone should really watch it - and Jackie C., if you say that shit again, I'm gonna hunt you down and rip your fucking head off, you piece of shit and fucking punk..! Jackie C. I don't think that you have a live, when you talk shit about this masterpiece, so I will send you 2 dollars, so you can buy one.",1
543," How stupid and juvenile do you have to be to Rate this film a 0? Seriously people, the extent to which some of you try to perpetuate any kind of false ""backlash"" is pathetic.",1
544," Perfect - the best action film of all time. Nolan crafts absolute good and evil, the epically evil joker and the epically good Batman and Fox and gang, and documents their battle for Harvey Dent and the people of Gotham whom he represents. This isn't a story of character development so much as an epic struggle that is played out with incredible intensity and thrilling action. No other film attempting to do anything of the sort has attained the level that The Dark Knight has.",1
545, The best batman movie ever made.,1
547," Truly amazing, sound and visuals make this movie one of the best ever. Astounding production with breath-taking performances.",1
548," By far the best comic book film to date. Not too many special effects. Excellent acting, especially from Ledger. Amazing score. Very dark and haunting.",1
549," One of the best movies I've seen in a while. A great capture of the Dark Knight series of illustrated books, exceptionally-acted and brilliantly filmed. Not a film for your young children though due to graphic violence.",1
550," Heath Ledgers performance in this must see movie was amazing i seen this movie twice in the cinema just to see Heath perform. Best Super Hero movie of 2008. Acting, story, script & settings all very good. Must see movie.",1
551, The Best Batman I have ever seen. Good filming good athmosphear Greats Actor A must to see.,1
552, Shakespearean is the first word that comes to mind when I see this film. Although I think the acting is all excellent and writing far above average I think Heath Ledger's performance should be considered not as a best supporting actor but as a Best Actor even though his character is supporting. You can't take your eyes off him whem he's onscreen.,1
553,"with the phenomenal performance of heath ledger and again by gary oldman the sequel to batman begins didnt cease to amaze me, not in the slightest. thinking i'd only watch the ledger parts from the blu-ray disc, i ended up watching the entire thing start to finish - it truly is a masterpiece.",1
554, What an excellent film. Full of twists and turns that you would not see coming. It is epic in every sense and the worst part is the end as you really do not want the movie to end.,1
555, The movie has some good ideas however did not make sense way the Joker was kept alive for so long. The movie did not have to be so long.,1
556," Perhaps it was because of how much it was hyped, perhaps it's because I saw the movie late and missed out on the excitement, but I felt that this film was not quite as good as it perhaps should have been. It had all the elements of a superhero movie but had a tendency towards pretention. Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker is particularly overrated and since when did Batman have to talk like the Cookie Monster all the time? It was worth a watch but ultimately could have been better.",1
557, Quiet simply the best Batman film ever made. Everything from acting to film making is at it's peak here.,1
558," Excellent movie, and a master piece, although it was not made for pop culture who doesnt understand a modern Hamlet and go out to a cinema to find a HSM movie, that wasnt too long for their disney chanel movie style.",1
559, Worth watching just for the hospital bit. Ledger really carries this film (Best bit about it) but the rest of the cast do their part. Sure you could pick the plot apart into a holey mess but that'd be taking away the excitement of the Joker single-handedly tearing Gotham City apart And the hospital bit!,1
560, Awesome. I haven't even seen it yet. How can't it be awesome? This is the movie of the summer mang!,1
561, Perhaps the greatest superhero movie ever made. Heath Ledgers joker is enthralling and very intense. Bravo Nolan.,1
562, It keeps you on the edge of your seat!,1
563," This film is incredible, this is not only the best comic book film of ever, Its also the best film of the last 10 years. Every member of the cast played their role perfectly (not just Heath who was brilliant) and this only aided what was an incredible script that was brought to life with great care by Chris Nolan. Watch this movie the first chance u get, once you do you will want to see it again.",1
564," I can honestly say that the New York critics can fornicate themselves with an iron rod. The sheer power of this film topples every other comic book adaptation off the movie pile. Heath Ledger turns in the most astonishing movie villain since Schindler's List's Amon Goeth and Christian Bale matches him in every respect. Don't listen to the New Yorkers. They're just upset because the film was set in Chicago. SEE THIS FILM!!! Although at 150 minutes, it was somewhat of a drag.",1
565," Simply amazing, i say give it the best picture Oscar, its up there with no country and the departed.",1
566," Probably the best comic book movie of all time. It is sad that three critics ( new yorker, new york, and austin chronicle don't get the movie and drag down the score).",1
567," Saw it at an advance imax screening Tuesday night. Unbelievable. Amazing performances by the cast all around, especially Ledger's unforgettable Joker. Oscar worthy to say the least. Story is fantastic and is a real treat for comic book fans and nonfans alike. Feels like a crime drama even more than a superhero movie. Excellent. You must see this movie!",1
568, This is an excellent dark and intense movie. It goes where every other comic book/superhero movie wouldn't go. It is an intense crime drama and may not be suitable for 8 year olds like spiderman.,1
569," Dark Knight is a magnificent showcase of what a Hollywood Summer Blockbuster should be. Dark Knight is smart, witty, and knowledgeable in its execution. Nolan has done a great job in squeezing every ounce of talent from the all-star cast of Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, Maggie, Oldman, Freeman, etc. Definitely lives up to all the hype, and I would not be surprised if it received an Oscar nomination in best picture and supporting actor.",1
570, Genre defying masterpiece!,1
571," I saw this movie two days before its release, at a special pre-screening. Now, just this one fact should tell you how great this movie was: not once did any of the people in the (full) theater talk. Everyone was too busy watching the action--and the drama, and the humor. Great performances from everyone, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a great improvement over Katie Holmes (no slight to her, she just wasn't right for the role.) There are a few clichés (becoming like your enemy, chaos vs. order) but even those just add to the complexity and scope of the story. Honestly, if you want a movie that combines top-notch action, black humor, tragedy, romance, and just about every other genre into an unnervingly realistic whole, you can't beat the Dark Night.",1
572, The Dark Knight really conveys how a psycho like the Joker would actually behave in real life and passes on philosophy that can be related to our society today.,1
573," A movie which rips out your thoughts and ideals of what the real consequences would be behind the actions of a ""hero"" and the morals and vulnerabilities of the cities they protect. An intense cinema experience made all the more watchable by one of the best performances that my generation will likely ever see. There will never be another joker!",1
574," This movie really was amazing. I know everyone has been saying how amazing Heath Ledger is in this movie and they were right. He actually manages to make the Joker scary, unpredictable yet still humorous in a twisted way. I truly do believe that he may have been the best villain in a movie.",1
575," Great movie, too bad Heath Ledger died. Christian Bale is great as usual. Aaron Eckhart turns in a great performance. The movie was pretty much fantastic, if a little long.",1
576," Overall, the movie is great. It's dark, very mature, without having to be graphic or profane. I've always thought that great movies don't need to have excessive violence or language in order to be a good movie, and The Dark Knight proves this point to be true. The reason I am not rating this movie 10 is because the ending really took a slow turn. The last 10 minutes or so really slowed the action down to a crawl. The ending really didn't leave you wanting more, it just kind of ""ended"". I would highly recommend you go see The Dark Knight, but you've probably already seen it, or are on your way now, so you don't need me telling you that. ",1
577," In my opinion, one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's up there along with the original Jurassic Park, and Independence Day. Ledger does possibly the best acting I have ever seen.",1
578," Heath Ledger put on an Oscar-winning performance and really made his character, the Joker, come alive. And, of course, Christen Bale and Michael Kain were brilliant.",1
579, The NY Times review has it right when it compares this film with Zodiac. Both dark and enthralling. But the DK is highly superior and lived to its hype more that I could ever expected. It blew my mind and Heath's performance like the movie was just stunning. This is a serious art film that just happens to have comic book characters. You could feel the energy in the air while watching it. Everyone around me was gasping for air and thrilled to be watching such spectacle.,1
580, A 10 + For Heath Ledger This film was dynamic and on the edge of your seat exhilarating .I can understand how this character would be tough to get out of his subconscious.I truly enjoyed the well thought intensity of this film.And Arron Eckhart was incredible also!!!!!!!,1
581," Ledger was amazing as the Joker, and the movie dared to be unconventional in the fact that it let people die, and it let the ""good guy's"" appearance be less than immaculate. Though it seemed to have enough plot for two movies, I feel that this installment was so triumphant in achieving everything it wanted, it should be the cemented end of the saga. Trying to top this would be a set up for failure, and ending it would be a great memorial to Ledger, who was amazing in this, and deserves a posthumous Oscar for best supporting.",1
582," This movie was better than Tim Burton's Batman. Heath Ledger was amazing. Personally, i think he would've made Alan Moore and Frank Miller either pleased or proud, thus why people speculate if he should get an Oscar. One great thing Nolan did about this movie, he didn't revisit Batman's origin (death of his parents). He just moved on with the story. That's why the other bat sequels stank, they look back into origins TOO much. This was a fantastic film. and if you miss this movie, you would have missed this summer's greatest hit.",1
583, Went to the Midnight opening. Wow... Wow.. Epic beyond words!,1
584, Amazing.,1
585," Ledger is great. The movie is a whole is excellent, but perhaps a little lacking in memorably iconic moments. There is also a half hour diversion to China in the middle of the film that seems out of place. Worth seeing. Not really a film for young kids.",1
586," The Dark Knight very well could be the ""BEST"" comic book movie ever made, by far the best of the Batman series.",1
587, Outstanding. The only troublesome thing about the entire experience is that there will never be as great a Joker as seen here.,1
588," It astounds me that some critics gave this awesome film such poor ratings. Ledger was perfect as Joker. When he showed up, I thought ""Finally...they made Joker like everyone truly imagined him."" Incredibly dark, philosophical, moving and cool. Nolan is a top notch director. Bale is a top notch actor. Perfect combination. This, ladies and gentleman, is the real Batman, the real Joker, another Batman film (Begins as well) done with justice to the character and ethos of the comic and graphic comics in mind. The other Batman films were horrible and horribly PC. Batman has never been PC. Which is why some critics of biased liberal idiotic ""journals"" do not like it. This is why this film will make tons of dough. Not because Heath died, but because Batman rocks, and the Joker is the ultimate agent of chaos. Go see it now (don't bring your kids though).",1
589," How some of the critics gave this anything under a 95 is beyond me. The Dark Knight is everything a movie should be, and then some. It is a movie that is so good, that it has single-handedly changed movie making for the rest of time.",1
590, The best movie of the year so far. The best superhero movie of all time. The best sequel ever. Heath kicks Jacks ass as the Joker. Long live the Batman !!!,1
591," The real star of ""the Dark Knight"" is Aaron Eckhart who gives an outstanding performance as Harvey Dent. Ledger is very good as the Joker but Maggie Gyllanhaal could have stayed home and she would not have being missed. Overall the film and the story is murky and muddled with too many fast cut edits and twists and leaves a lot to be desired. Overhyped and overpraised.",1
592, Best movie I have seen in years and is also now my favorite Batman movie. That was previously hard to attain since Mask of the Phantasm. I felt drained afterwards because of all the tension. It was almost as intense as watching Saving Private Ryan.,1
593, Batman has never been better on screen. Joker is really amazing. Caos. Only the gadgets are lame.,1
594," The Joker's calling card may be that of a joker, but this movie rises above to be an ace. It steps outside the realm of a cliché 'comic book movie.' Dark Knight offers the viewer action, suspense, drama. Story lines are interwoven and you feel immersed in movie with the ability to connect to the characters. Of which all the leading performances are presented flawlessly. Heath Ledger's Joker stands out gripping the viewer from the beginning. Nolan has truly raised the bar for this genre, and we can only hope Gotham will call upon Batman again for a third installment.",1
595," The moral dilemma and how far does one get pushed before falling into the abyss? Ledger was brilliant and only underscores the loss of such an amazing talent. Bale,Ekhart, Oldman, Caine, et al equally stood up to their roles. My only complaint was that it was a tad long to get to the punch line. Excellent all around.",1
596," Awesome. Heath Ledger is unreal. it's such a shame that he died because he would have had an incredible career. this movie is one hell of a ride, and ledger as the joker practically fuels the fire.",1
597, An incredible movie. Heath Ledger did a more than outstanding job as the Joker.,1
598," Ok, I'm a big skeptic when it comes to Hollywood. I'm of the opinion that 95% of what they produce is garbage. i even expected to be disappointed by this movie, I've never been a heath ledger fan, and i tend to not believe the hype, ever. but this is for real. it doesn't feel like you're watching an actor, it feels like they busted some psycho out of prison and put him in a movie. it just doesn't seem possible that this is the same guy that was in ""10 things i hate about you."" overall the movie has some issues, it might have been too ambitious for a 2-3 hour movie. Maggie Gyllenhall is forgettable, and there are a few silly cliches that remind you that this is a comic book movie. this isn't a perfect movie, but ledger gives a perfect performance. It's just plain creepy.",1
599," It's a shame we will never get to see another villain like this. This was the best movie of the year, hands down.",1
600," This movie was much more than I had expected, and greater than anything I could've wanted from a Batman movie. The character development was just phenomenal and I couldn't believe how well Heath Ledger played the role of the Joker. He was simply disturbing, sadistic, and at some points quite comical even if the situation was gruesome. This movie definitely deserves all praise it receives, this is a movie I will go to again just because I can't wait for this to come out on dvd.",1
601, I give this a 9.5 but still this movie rocks I love the JOcker almost as much as BATMAN and the action is wicked there is not enoth WORDS to describe this MOVIE this movie is the best of the BEST this YEAR SO go see it and stop READING this!!!,1
602, Simply put: it will leave you speechless. Disturbingly terrific.,1
603, Magnificent performances all around (excluding Gyllenhaal) with a story that never drags. Every time the movie seems to be heading toward a lull it picks right back up and throws you back into the mix. Heath Ledger completely redefines the Joker into the maniacal anarchist he had the potential to become.,1
604," I went into this movie with some of the highest expectations I've ever had for a film. I left realizing I was shocked, it totally and completely lived up to all of them. In fact, it actually surpassed them. To put it bluntly, The Dark Knight is one of the closest things I've seen to a perfect film to come out of American cinema in years. Everything about it pushes boundaries of its genre and every superhero film that comes out from now on will be compared to this one. Every performance is spot on. Christian Bale pulls off Bruce Wayne again which is something that I was a little worried he might try to change up but I'm happy to say he nailed it again. Michael Caine is awesome (but then again when is he not). I was skeptical to whether or not Heath Ledger was going to really be as good as the hype and let me just say: YES he was INCREDIBLE. I don't know how to pull it off but his Joker literally terrified me and at the same time made me laugh. I can't really explain it its something that must be seen and I can definitely say that he does deserve an Oscar nomination for his role. The role of the Joker is terrifying just by itself and when Ledger steps in and adds an almost likable side to him its almost disturbing. You don't want to laugh at the man in a clown suit making Jokes because he's also doing horrible things to people. Aaron Eckhart is also awesome in this as Harvey Dent and definitely deserves to be mentioned. The writing is top notch and at this point I want Nolan to take the Batman franchise wherever he wants and he clearly knows where he wants to go. The story takes every plothole and cliche from superhero films and fixes them. It's well paced, never boring and most of all you always are left wanting to know what happens next. I don't have a complaint. This is not the Batman you've always known. This is something new, yet still the same. I've never seen a film reinvent something like this. This doesn't feel like some crazy superhero story that takes place somewhere else. For the first time it almost feels real. The danger feels real, that's where this movie really starts to come into its own and it becomes something more than a superhero movie. The action was top notch and there are some truly badass scenes. To sum it up: not only is this the best superhero film EVER MADE, but its also one of the best films I've ever seen.",1
605," One of the most satisfying mixtures of both cinematic escapism and intellectual art I have ever come across in the world of cinema. The fact that it is based on a childish lore, has nothing and everything to do with this complex dichotomy of everything that is life, cinema and human, all mixed into one. This movie, while exposing the multiple levels of duality in each one of us, also inspires us to be better, think better, while challenging the very notion of good vs. bad in the first place. It is nothing short of a modern masterpiece, and I am certain history will prove it as such.",1
606," Just got back from this movie, and it is utterly terrific. Agreed that the cell phone sonar thing doesn't make sense, and agreed that the end was a minor let down, but that's only in comparison the the hours of ass-kicking action that precede it. Go see this movie, for the love of God.",1
607," I went in expecting something the equal to Batman Begins. I absolutely loved the prequel to this movie, and figured that they might just top it with this next movie. Coming back, I'm stunned when thinking that Heath Ledger was the Joker. I apologize for rudeness, but I truly wondered whether he could pull it off, given his past work. As it turns out, his performance was nothing less than spectacular, easily topping Jack Nicholson's performance of Joker from 1989. I can honestly say that I cringed, laughed, and stood in awe of this latest rendition of Joker. Somehow, this movie went back to the basics of Hero and Villain more than any movie I've yet seen. The entirety of Batman's and Joker's characters were actually based around the morality that they stood for, rather than their ability to physically wreak havoc. Its not that they were lack luster in that respect. You just get so much more drawn into the moral dilemmas they must face. I give this movie a ""10"" only because there is no other way to express the genius of it.",1
608," This movie is amazing. It's a SuperHero movie with huge morals and wonderful grace, with superb acting, the latter conceding to everyone, not just the fantastic Heath Ledger, brilliant direction, top of the line action, and a dark, even sadistic realism that it seems some critics can't bare. The only shame I can feel for this movie is how underappreciated it will be.",1
609," Smarter than any superhero movie deserves to be. This is a great movie with so much more depth than a summer blockbuster deserves. A great great film. More story and themes (translate: slower) than some in the ADD generation can tolerate (at times, at least), but if you like your movies epic, if you appreciate movies with depth, and you even remotely like Batman, this is a must-see, but you didn't need me to tell you that. The Joker adds an unnerving, edge-of-the-seat unpredictability to this movie that you so rarely see in superhero movies and well, any movie nowadays. It cannot be understated that Heath Ledger is brilliant. The only negative I can see is that I honestly don't know where they can go from here? How do you top this? What other Batman villain can hold a candle to the Joker (especially this masterful portrayal of the iconic villain that for obvious reasons cannot be reprised)? I almost wish that they don't make another one just because this one is so damn good and the next one will almost certainly be a disappointment with the standard set so impossibly high.",1
610," Utterly amazing, films don't get any better then this.",1
611," What can I say? read just about any other review and you'll have my opinion. It's just a crying shame that Ledger can't reprise this roll. Also I want to say ""I was wrong"". I was one of those who thought he was going to ruin the part before I'd actually seen footage of him in character. His take was equal to Nicholson's, though completely different in tone. A Perfect 10!",1
612, This is the treatment Batman has always deserved; Blurred moral boundaries and unapologetic villainy. Ledger's Joker exudes maddness and is the pinnacle of a pyschotic portrait. All facets of this gem are flawless.,1
613,"Great nuances keep you interested. although it's long, i never got bored -- whether it was action movie stuff, the acting of the wonderful cast, the interesting turn in the music and audio editing, or the overall mood. wonderful, wonderful film that puts other comic book movies to shame.",1
614, This is not only the best Batman movie ever. But also the best movie ever!,1
615," Truelly brilliant, not just the best Batman movie ever. But also one of the best movies made in at least 20 years. Ledger owns the Joker part and deserves every known movie award there is.",1
616," It couldn't have been more satisfying unless it was 5 hours long. I can think of 12 critics who are factually wrong, and I'm not sure if it'll ever set in that Heath Ledger's gone, because how can he be?",1
617, Easily the best movie based on a comic. A real movie.,1
618,Heaths performace is suberb. Some of the Best acting ive ever seen,1
619," EVEN BETTER THAN THE HYPE The Dark Knight (TDK) on IMAX may be one of the best films I have ever seen ... up until the third act of the film. This is not to say the third act of the film isn't good, however. It is just familiar for fans of comic books films. The film's excellent performances, including Mr. Ledger's transformation into the role of the Joker, match the skill of the writers and producers of the film. Mr. Nolan vision and expansion of the world of Batman are breathtaking ... and a welcome change from earlier comic book adaptations. While many audience members will be drawn in to see the film out of morbid curiosity after Mr. Ledger's untimely death, I expect many will see it as a celebration of fine acting and enjoy the movie as one of the best films of the year ... if not decade. Regardless of why you go see the movie, TDK is a must see for those who love movies and what the profession of acting can offer us, which is pure entertainment.",1
620, Completely overrated. Very good however.,1
621," Awesome installment in the iconic Batman franchise. Christan Bale is pitch perfect as cocky, twisted in his own way Bruce Wayne. The Joker is sociopathic and fleshed out by Heath Ledger like no one before him.",1
622," I went in with mild expectations when seeing the dark knight. I admit to liking the lore of batman, but i wasn't the hugest fan of the first film (begins). This movie, however, blew me away in a way that was not expected. The characters were very well developed, and their pains and ambitions seeped through their performance. Batman and Harvey are two men who are affected by the same problem in totally different ways, and the inevitable conclusion follows. I don't say that i'll go and see a movie twice often, but i believe this one deserves it.",1
623," -1 for Maggie G, her acting was fine, she is not attractive enough for the role. Look at the tail that Bruce is with in other parts of the movie. Katie Holmes was more believable in the role. Other than that the movie was excellent, half way through it didn't even feel like a superhero/comic book movie. More like a psychological thriller with a terrorist twist.",1
624," Very entertaining. Since everyone is heaping nothing but praise i will change it up. Three things that i did not like. 1.Honestly how was this movie only pg-13. i mean i know why, because it make more money that way, but seriously, this movie was extremely violent. I am no prude, but pg 13, really? The magic trick with the pencil should have made it R let alone the rest of the brutal violence. 2. I did not like the ending. Dent should have shot the boy, it was corny to have batman save him. i am no weirdo, but it seems like the 3 ""knight"" all should have lost someone, bruce and harvey lost rachel, but gordon did not have to suffer at all. I just thought with the way the movie was going it would have been more true to the story to have the kid get shot. 3. Maggie Gyllenhal is a terrible actor. thank god her character was killed off because i think she could have singlehandedly destroyed everyone elses performance through the poor quality of her own. That being said all of the other actors put in great performances. the two and half hours was over too soon for me and left me wanting more. great film, i hope they do not make a third because they cannot top this, especially considering they cannot bring back the joker character considering ledger's cowardly death. That's right i said it, overdosing on drugs is not a tragedy, it is a diservice to people who do die tragically to put a drug addicts death on the same level",1
625," Excellent film --starts off beautifully--- a tad too much fat in the middle, but ends brilliantly. As others have said, this film really elevates the ""superhero genre"" to real drama---like Lord of the Rings did in a way. The cast was a big part of that-- Ledger, Ekhart, Bale & Gyllenhaal (much preferred over Holmes) were absolutely solid, with perhaps Ledger outshining a bit. But he really did have the most to prove given the iconic Joker Nicholson created---and Ledger totally hit it out of the park and then some. This is just a great tragic drama---one of the better films I've seen this year. Had they tightened up the middle a bit, I would say this was almost a perfect film. Even saying that though, run and see this thing in theaters--definitely worth the price of admission (& to see some particularly great action scenes as they were meant to be seen).",1
626, I loved it. Blows away every superhero movie ever made pretty much.,1
627, This movie was absolutely god damn awesome! Easily the best movie I've gone to see at the theaters in AGES and it was worth every cent! MUCH better than Batman Begins. The action was non stop. Brilliant acting and my god did Heath Ledger deliver an absolutely convincing and amazing performance. Throughout the whole movie it actually made me somewhat sad as I was seeing how well he portrayed the Joker knowing that he won't be returning in future Batman movies which is an immense shame. I know he'll get an Oscar for this because his performance was FLAWLESS and he was definitely the standout in this movie. Even if he was still alive he'd still be the standout. Batman seemed to be in the shadows a bit in this movie.,1
628," Oh my damn! I went into this movie already with high expectations, as many of my co-workers saw the midnight showing), and ""The Dark Knight,"" still managed to surpass them. This is the greatest Batman film I have seen, one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen, as well as one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. ""The Dark Knight,"" receives an all too well deserved 10 from me.",1
629," It's really hard to poke holes in this movie. It could be done, but just enjoy it for what it is, a true piece of cinematic art.",1
630, Oustanding performance of Heath Ledger take this movie to the next level. Producers should make the desition to dedicate this movie to his memory. And that is not joke.,1
631," I watched it twice, two nights in a row. Best movie of the year so far.",1
632," I wasn't planning to see the movie, but I'm glad I did. The cast was outstanding. Every major actor sold his/her role. I haven't seen a film this good in years. It was sad to watch Heath Ledger give such an amazing performance, but thankfully, his performance and other more than make up for the hype. One final thought, for those who may feel put off by the movie's violence, the most depraved acts were not shown on screen, and the action is great.",1
633, Perfect.,1
634," Took over where Batman Begins left off and continued the awesome tale of Christian Bale's batman, the best one to date. Kudos to all involved and to Christoper Nolan.",1
635, Best portrayal of Batman and the Joker......ever.....bar none.,1
636," honest review: way over hyped... realistically: on par with the last one. people who gives 10s are idiotic because there were tons of flaws in it including being long, complicated, and silly at times (boats). ledger is great at acting creepy/wacky, but that's hardly oscar deserving.",1
637," Best movie I have ever seen, It had everything you could possibly want, action, humor, mystery, compelling characters, a great message, and most of all Batman!",1
639," The best movie this year, and the best superhero movie by far. It was just really well directed, written, and all the performances were fantastic (especially Ledger).",1
640," It's finally here and unlike a great many films out there that simply can't satisfy the ""hype monster"".....this one grabs the monster by the head and shows him the ""dissapearing pencil trick"". This IS the best comic book film if not one of the best FILMS ever made.....period. The dark, gritty, and unrewarding places this movie will take you is both depressing and captivating at the same time.....as in you truly feel ""at a loss"" at the end, that evil hasn't won but simply proven it cannot be denied its existence no matter who is there to stop it. The Dark Knight far exceeds Batman Begins in almost EVERY category save for the ""origin story"" aspect.....whether it be the villains, the heroes involved, or the situation at hand everything seems far more dangerous and ""on the brink of disaster"" in this sequel. This is a super-hero film where the hero is truly a step behind throughout the entire flick even when you THINK he's gaining ground.....he simply isn't, instead he's losing it far faster with each passing moment. As for the performances.....Heath Ledger steals the show hands down, he simply sizzles on screen as the Joker to a level where you are mesmerized by the character, his actions, his ticks, his intentions, and origin keep you wondering about the ""man behind the painted face"", this menace, this jester with the brains and violent nature to cripple an entire city.....youll believe he can succeed, and for the most part he does. Aaron Eckhart turns in a performance that will blow your mind as well, going from saviour of hope to the destroyer of it is both tragic and well displayed, you can truly feel this mans anger as he goes head hunting for those that **SPOILER** ""burned"" him (pun intended). Batman is sort of the middle man in this film, but at the end of it all and once the poop has hit the fan and splatterred all over the room.....he is left to clean it up with his bare hands. So IS this one of the greatest movies of our time......YES.....IT IS just that, its vastly entertaining with superb performances, amazing and well timed action sequences, and a interesting look at human beings and what we're capable of doing under the most dire of circumstances. A+....highest recomendation.",1
641," The best Batman, the best comic book movie, one of the best action-crime drama movies ever!",1
642," Awesome, crime/cop/detective drama and the fact that the characters are from Batman make it twice as awesome. It's like Scorsese made a comic book film, Nolan is just as good! SEE THIS MOVIE!",1
643," Amazing. I saw it at midnight-- I was originally not intending to see it at all and my friend had an extra ticket. It was absolutley breathtaking. It lacked the slowness of the first movie. Yes, DK had its action and fight scenes and violence, but it managed to also maintain a plot-- a rariety in today's film industry. The cast was beautifully cast. The only weakness in the casting was Maggie Gyllenhaal, who unfortunatley just played herself. Aaron Eckhart did a wonderful job displaying the struggles of a man--in well, you'll see. And even if Heath Ledger hadn't died, and this was not his last role, his performance would still be something talked about years from now. HIs grovely voice and little tics, made the character human, something that while sitting in the audience, even you can fear. An amazing cast, amazing plot, and amazing setting. Go watch it. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",1
644," A very good movie, especially for this genre. Ledger is brilliant and almost puppy dog sad in the sadistic swirl of his Joker character. Good action, good gizmos, nice, if sometimes confusing and higly unlikely plot twists. All in all, a very good, not quite great movie that is weighed down a bit by its morality study manner and general murkiness, both in plot and look. That said, easily one or two of the best action flicks in the last couple of years and well worth watching.",1
646, O melhor filme de todos os tempos.,1
647, Amazing. Ledger is simply disturbing.,1
648," This is the best comic book movie to date, and i highly doubt it will be topped. No question it is the movie of the year and Heath Ledger deserves the Oscar for it, and I'm not saying it because he passed away, I'm saying it because he was amazing as The Joker!",1
649,"CONFUSED AND TOO LONG. great critique. the movie WAS long, but it kept coming back with more and more intensity and surprises. Ledger's joker was unbelievable. i always liked him as an actor, and to see him (i'm stealing this from a critic's review) transcend his own acting ability the way he did just moved me... and i was so sad every time i remembered that he's gone. posthumous academy award, anyone?",1
650," This is the best Batman movie ever, Christopher Nolan should be nominated for Best Director on the Oscars! Don't miss this movie",1
651, Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is simply amazing. This Dark Knight is even better than Batman Begins.,1
652," Thrilling... a jet coaster that serves haute cuisine and drops you off in the middle of an insane asphalt jungle. Great script, black humor to write home about, and Heath Ledger's finest performance. Definitely the guy gets the Best Actor Award this year. Or I'll blow up a hospital.",1
653," This movie was just as good, if not better, than the first one. Viewers will not be disappointed. Just when I thought the movie was over, Joker pulls another one of his ingenious tricks again and again. I will probably have to watch this movie again to fully understand the characters' motives and the intricate plot. Overall, it was an amazing film with a promising plot, new ideas, and great action scenes.",1
654," Best Movie Ever? No, and that was pretty obvious before seeing the movie. Best Comic Book Movie Ever? Depends on what you're looking for, I wouldn't say it was. Over hyped? What isn't these days. A good flick, absolutely. I was one of the eager to see this and hoped it would live up to it's hype...what can I say, I'm an optimist. I think Ledger did an outstanding,daring and brilliant job as joker. It takes a certain swagger to take that roll and pull it off with Nicholson looming over for critique. I thought the plot was a little more than needed and there were glaringly terrible lines delivered in scenes that made me wonder how they could have been overlooked when this was written. Bale's batman voice is irritating at best and unbearable at worst. All that aside, I didn't notice the length of this movie at all while watching it, the pace of the film worked well for me and I felt there was a healthy sense of camp in the characters delivery left underlying and keeping the movie from taking itself too seriously. It's definitely not a movie for everyone and it will not please everyone but I still have to say that I have not seen a batman movie since Burton's first that had me as interested and excited for the next scene throughout...and yes, Imax helped perpetuate the larger than life feel that added to that. I don't think this is going to reshape Batman to a point of epiphany and I would be wary of expecting that going into any movie...you'll be grossly disappointed. If you want to see an action packed crime drama play out between a hero and villain we have all been familiar with for ages, then go and enjoy. Expect to have fun and leave the imperfections aside and I have trouble seeing anyone coming out of this movie wishing they had not seen it to begin with.",1
655," Unbelievably good. No single element, actor, or production area falters, bringing the best of Batman comics to the screen with an eye so discerning it threatens to create a new genre for itself: not the superhero movie, but the superhero film.",1
656, The best Batman of all. One of the best movies of the year (if is not the best). Heath Ledger should win the Oscar for his Joker and Christian Bale is just the best Batman we ll see,1

660," Flawless and outstanding screenplay, the Film is fantastic from point A to point B. Christian Bale unleashed the true essence of what Batman is and play it perfectly. Heath Ledger is definitely outstanding with his mimmicks & screenplays, giving us the perfect match. The story is great, the sub-story plots are crazy, the characters are well played and the Joker is giving an incredible moral twist behind the movie! Thx Guys for that film! 10/10... no I would go for a 11/10.",1
661," See it at an IMAX, do not miss the opening at all. The best movie this year, I am betting a clean-up at the award shows. Will be seeing it again, IMAX of course.",1
662," It is one of the greatest Batman movies ever. Heath Ledger acted Joker perfectly. I literally left the theater saying "" Why so serious ? """,1

665, One of the best movies I've ever seen,1
666, best movie ive seen since pulp fiction.,1
667," Try getting this one out of your head. Nolan goes where no other film, let alone comic book film, has gone before. It's one to show evil, even reveal its' allure. Its another entirely to turn a world on its head, leave it a shell, and hope the audience accepts it. Kevin Smith, the director of Clerks, noted that this is the Godfather Part II of comic book films. I'll go further. This is the Godfather II of our time. Rarely has a mainstream film that is designed for entertainment ever pushed boundaries of every kind on the audience. Ledger will haunt you for days after (provided you paid attention). From the opening scene to his final moments, you are riveted and repulsed by his Joker. The rest of the cast to a person is nearly flawless. Props must go to Bale, Freeman, Caine, Gylennhall, and especially Eckart. Eckart breaks your heart, revealing a tortured soul under the shining armor. His final scene has real weight. As for the movie's length, this sounds like short-attention span whining. Nolan isn't going for disposable. He wants to challenge our minds. He is a first class filmmaker interested in posing hard questions. Thank God.",1
668," This movie has it's strengths and weaknesses. One one hand, Heath Ledger does an unreasonably fantastic job as the Joker. It's a shame that he won't be able to reprise his role, because he just nailed it. There's never really a dull moment in this movie. My attention was kept for the full two and a half hours. But on the other hand, some parts were unreasonably predictable. Anytime anyone gets into a car, you can assume that they'll be dead in a few seconds. Some parts could have been entirely left out. (Ferry scene comes to mind). But go see it. It's a lot better than Hancock and Space Chimps.",1
670," Heath Ledger's performance as the twisted Joker is pure genius. It's so good he should get nominated for a Oscar. Also the action, casting and special effects work out perfectly. Hail Ledger! You'll be missed. Best Movie of 2008!",1
671," This movie is not a 10. It's close, but it's not a 10. It collapses under the weight of too many ideas covering too much time. You should definitely see it, though.",1

676," Amazing movie, truly unique and mind-bending.",1
677, See the movie for no other reason that the fact that it haunt you for hours after walking out of the theater. Heath Ledger's Joker is perhaps the greatest villain captured on film.,1
678," First Heath was perfect, movie was almost stale to me, they made it long and tried way to hard.",1
679," Nothing tops this movie. Best of the Batman series for sure. Heath's performance is amazing beyond belief. I figured it'd be good, but it blew away what I expected. This is a must see movie for sure.",1
680," Honestly, I am one hard critic, but this film was absolutely amazing. The acting, cinema-tics and story were all brilliant. A must see.",1
681," I can't believe some critics are giving this movie a rating of 50! It was by far the best movie I had ever seen. Im not usually into superhero movies, but I am so glad my boyfriend dragged me to see this. If you havent seen this movie yet, I advise you too.",1
682," Great movie with very good writing and acting. At times it transcends its genre in addressing the darker aspects of human nature. My only complaint is that it's about 20 minutes too long, with most of that unnecessary padding coming in a downright silly action sequence near the end.",1
683," WARNING, SEMI-SPOILERS. It is excruciatingly difficult saying how great this film is without detailing why. This film is a masterpiece. This is no superhero film, this is an epic crime drama that just so happens to have a superhero in it. Batman and The Joker are complete polar opposites, and Harvey Dent's coin (and later, as Two-Face, his face) is an astounding metaphor for it. They are opposite sides of the coin. To quote The Joker, ""madness is like gravity, all it takes is one little push."" One little push to turn a man like Harvey Dent into a man like The Joker. The Joker is just plain dark. Not melodramatic-teenager dark, a-person's-life-is-a-punchline dark. Anyone I've met that disliked this film hasn't really explained WHY, they've spoken in a certain vagueness without actually detailing what was wrong with it. That's the thing though, there is nothing wrong with it. The entire film, all 152 minutes of it without a dull moment, I was glued to the screen. It's a shame Heath Ledger died. He put his heart and soul into his role as The Joker. When I watched the film I didn't think ""hey, there's Heath Ledger as The Joker,"" I thought ""hey, there's The Joker."" I heard he had the utmost respect for Jack Nicholson, and those big clown shoes he had to fill were what made him persevere. Enjoy your Oscar, Mr. Ledger. Rest in peace.",1
684," The best comic book related movie ever :) A real good movie, but not as good as many people say :P",1
685,Indelible performance of heath Leger and strained action with twisting story line like no other.,1
686,"amazing film.. and im not just riding some sort of ""bandwagon"" which is what ive heard some idiots calling it... i mean, if you love it, you're a dick riding bandwagoner? get the hell out of here! this movie was great... perfect direction, perfect screen play and perfect cast.. nothing was wrong with this movie.. AT ALL! and i saw this person named BILL M say... ""Dark Knight ruined Batman - series should have never been written. DC should be ashamed!"" are you kidding me?!?!!? LMFAOOOOO!!! hahahahaha! this dude couldnt even BACK UP his statement.. i would LOVE to see this guy back up his comments, but he cant... it just shows that he's an idiot.. very sad... poor guy.. i almost feel bad for him and his very pathetic life :( poor little guy :(",1
687," Wow...after reading all the reviews for the Dark Knight, my expectations were sky-high. This film managed to exceed those expectations 100-fold. Easily one of the best scripts in recent memory, and the only reason it may not be nominated for Best Film is because of the obvious bias against 'comic book films.' Hey, I loved Iron Man and Incredible Hulk, but THOSE are comic book films -- you could turn your brain off, sit-back, and just have a blast for a couple of hours. The Dark Knight is something else altogether.",1
688," The movie was excellently written, and the most enjoyable part of the film was Ledger's performance of the maniacal ""Joker"". I would've enjoyed if he had more screen time, but nevertheless, the movie was excellent. The movie wasn't really about Batman at all, but more about Gotham City as a whole. Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Gary Oldman were all magnificent, and the worst part of all is that three of those great actors won't be able to be in a third edition. The movie was not that violent, but I still think it is not for children. The movie is too psychological and dramatic to be even understood by the child mind. How Christopher Nolan discovers the ""Joker"" in everyone is remarkable and award-worthy. The movie will sure be remembered by all as a masterpiece.",1
689," I was completely in disbelief of all the hype. But it's true: This is an excellent, excellent movie.",1
690," Go to any KISS concert in the 80's and find a pimple faced teen in clown makeup and thats Heath Ledger's performance as Joker in a nutshell. A nice movie, but over hyped to no end. Best superhero movie of all time? Oscar performance for Heath Ledger? I understand the guy died, but lets not over exaggerate his performance because of it. Nothing spectacular and not what I envision as the iconic Joker. The joker was neither funny nor scary and the expectation waiting for the famous laugh plastered all over the trailers for this movie was nearly non-existent. As for best superhero movie I'm not even sure I'd rank this above Batman Begins or the very 1st Batman whose Joker played by Jack Nicholson I enjoyed more and the back story of how he became the Joker was better portrayed. The ending to this movie was muddled with that high-tech sonar montage and the morality lesson at the end carried on about 10 minutes too long. What was scarecrow doing in the movie? And 2-face was hardly utilized. Do yourself a favor, go see this movie because it is entertaining and different (see my rating of 8). But, don't go in expecting to see the greatest movie of all time as some here would lead you to believe.",1
691," The Dark Knight is the first movie to get Batman, the Joker, and Two-Face exactly right.",1
692," its really funny that people keep trying to compare bale and ledger to keaton and nicholson, theres no comparison.. bale and ledger beat them hands down. i saw the 1989 movie when i was 7 years old, and i watched it again to compare it to dark knight. all i have to say is if you havent watched that movie in 18 or so years like i hadnt, dont watch it, itll ruin how you felt about it. the original batman was TERRIBLE, it was corny and dreadfully boring. you dont feel as if youre watching the joker,but jack nicholson dressed up in make up. i often forgot i was seeing heath ledger in the dark knight. i dont see how all of you people praise keatons lifeless performance as bruce wayne. the whole time, you dont feel as if you know who he bruce is, theres no personality, and i dont really think thats keatons fault so much as the writing/directing. i do like tim burtons gotham city and batmobile better, but you dont even feel like bruce wayne is tormented when you watch his batman movies. you dont get to see how he is a billionaire playboy.. you just see some man in a cave thats courting vicki vale. oh and being introduced to jack napier the first 30 minutes, and the flashback of him killing bruce's parents.. ALL WRONG! i hate that they put that in the film, plus the joker dancing around to prince music? you have got to be kidding me. you people are delusional if you think the first one is better. you dont sense that joker is a crazed killer, but a corny thug with paint on. and anybody that knows anything about the comics has to remember that joker has changed over the past 68 years depending on the writers. he started out as a crazed, psychotic, heartless killer, then was toned down due to censorship in the 50s and 60s. the toned down petty joker was cesar romero, then he had a come back where he was a killer, but still fairly corny, and thats the joker that nicholson portrayed. in the late 80s, he was rehauled again, and became much more vicious and similar to his original incarnation, and thats ledgers joker. please dont say that ledger didnt act like the joker is supossed to act if you know nothing of the lore of batman, and are basing those feelings off of other acters interpretations of the character, thats just stupid.",1
695, Some of the best acting and storytelling I have ever seen. Every second you spend not watching this movie is a second wasted.,1
696,Best movie ever.,1
697,"Absolutely flawless. Unrivaled for its type of film. I've seen it at a art theatre and in IMAX and its worth it to see the latter.Ledger deserves an oscar for the best performance since anthony hopkins in silence of the lambs as a villain. Just go see it you'll want to see it twice as soon as its over.",1
698, possibly the best superhero movie of all time. I wanted to see it since i saw the first trailer and i wasn't disappointed Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar!,1
699," I honestly had no interest in watching the first movie, Batman Begins, when it first released (or months after it made it to DVD). But when I heard they were making a sequel, and people were actually getting excited I figured that I had to check the first out. I had to say, I was impressed. I was expecting the humorous (yet unfunny) Batman movies from the George Clooney days, and was given a darker, more violent, and an even grittier Batman than I was used to. So I went to go see this one. I came into this movie with high hopes but a little cautious. I always felt that the Joker (while probably Batman's number one arch-nemesis in the comics) was the opposite of the more menacing bad guys that I expected from a hero-villain clash. In the Dark Knight, I was met with a creepier, more disturbing version of the Joker. And I must say that Heath Ledger really made it that way for me. I really got the psychological instability of the character rather than the odd-ball, ""got to take over the world"" version of the Joker that many people probably envision when thinking of the Joker. Honestly, I never thought that a comic book movie would possibly have a chance at movie of the year, but there may be a shot in this one. And there are definitely going to be some awards for cast and crew members of this one.",1
700," Spectacular. The moral issues this film raises is intriguing, the surprises and twists will have you enthralled, and all the actors officially bring their A-game to the table. Heath Ledger provides one of the most impressive performances in filming history, in one of the best films of the modern era. A word of advice for all who haven't seen this movie yet - do not pay attention to any of the so called 'professional' reviewers who rate this poorly. Their reasons for doing so seem to be because the movie isn't 'fun' enough. Well, it isn't meant to be 'fun'; it's supposed to make you think about what good and evil really is, amongst other social issues. Flawless - a truly genre-defining film.",1
702, One of the best movies I have ever seen. I will remember Heath Ledger as a god.,1
703," Great script, awesome action, and a stellar performance by Ledger! If it weren't for the Batman's forced hoarse voice, I would have given this film a perfect 10.",1
704," What more could you ask for from any movie?! Just a shame Heath Ledger can't resume the role again, he may have made it his own forever! Lived up to it's HEAT comparison",1
705," This is the perfect, perhaps last, glimpse at the brilliant talent of a great actor. Heath Ledger ""upstages"" an impressive cast of successful actors in a memorable performance that makes the movie re-watchable. This is the best movie of the year.",1
706,don't normally dig the summer blockbuster type movies...but i dug this one because of that nice heath ledger fellow...he explodes in every scene from beginning to end...his intro into the movie blew my mind...even when the joker wasn't in a scene i couldn't stop thinking about what he was up to...riveting...will never look at a pencil the same way again...awards for him will be given...too bad that they had to have all those scenes with that rich guy in a bat suit grunting around,1
707," This movie was awesome, but it was really slow in the beginning. it was definitely heath ledgers best film.",1
708," In short, a masterpiece. Every single actor and acrtess brought their absolute best, especially Ledger. Harvey Dent's and Joker's characters were perfectly pulled off, and the storyline could not be more twisted. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie, even the dialogue couldn't lose my interest. I strongly reccomend that you do NOT bring any drinks with you into the theatre, because I had to leave and use the bathroom, and that broke the train of the movie. If you gave the first movie anything higher then 2 stars, you absolutely MUST see this movie. If your new to the series, see it anyway. An absolute must-see.",1
709," And although Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle gave the movie a 50 out of 100, I'll quote him for his use of words and savor of just how cruel and brilliant The Joker was, ""The only thing here that feels truly, utterly alive is Ledger's maniacal, muttery Joker. The last laugh is his and his alone. It's enough to make you cry."" If Savlov meant what I think he meant then I agree. The movie really had very little interest in anything other than The Joker. Ledgers performance is what made this movie what it is. Bale was at most, entertaining. Gyllenhaal was... well better than Holmes. Caine was still good, as was Freeman, but I think it's safe to assume it's because of the respect they've gained in the industry, that we automatically would assume they did well. But Two-Face/Harvey Dent, Aaron Eckhart was not very heroic, or insane in any parts of the movie, and his role as Two-Face (which I was looking forward too) was short lived. The ending was so quick; I was still waiting for something when the credits started to roll. However, like I said, Heath owns this. The action I felt was great, the sick humor was there, and I got teary eyed a little at the end. So yes, this movie is going straight to my heart and onto my shelves. I think everyone, everyone should see this. But I think people should stop praising it, and approach it realistically, because as amazing and breathtaking, and short of nothing than spectacular, that it is... It was still just a movie, with as many flaws as one. The movie struck fear into people, and it made the rooms around us slightly darker, made our lives just slightly grimmer. In succeeded tremendously in producing a fowl and tainted environment for the viewer. The movie will no doubt live on though history as one of the most cinematic accomplishments ever fathomed. Partially for the mark Heath Ledger placed upon it with his death, but also because of the shear trauma many actually felt from watching this. To put it short, I",1
710, Heath Ledger played the Joker how he should have been played for a non animated movie. This is what makes the Joker such a creepy/mysterious character.,1

If you liked the original or just want a suspensful action movie you MUST give this a view. But be warned: it's not called the DARK Knight for nothing.",1
714," To the ironically named ""Terminator"", why complain about the violence. This isn't Power Rangers as the preview alone could tell you. I thought the movie was excellent, though I would agree with one reviewer that said you might leave the cinema a bit exhausted.",1
715," Outstanding... simply the best superhero movie ever filmed... we can easily find the very best of 70 years of batman comic book stories in this movie. All the actors did an excellent job (Ledger in particular IMHO overshadowed Nicholson's Joker), and Nolan direction was terrific. Great story, fantastic pace to keep you glued to your seat. Most realistic superhero movie ever seen. This movie sets new standards for the genre. P-E-R-F-E-C-T.",1
716," Full disclosure - I am not much of a fan of comic book movies in general, nor batman movies in particular. But don't be fooled by the costumes, this is much, much more than a comic book movie. Nolan's direction is so deft, the acting so brilliant, the dialogue so well written, that ten minutes into the film I forgot that I was watching a comic book movie. This movie gives us an exploration of duality, dark v. light, good v. evil, id v. superego, wrapped in a fantastically entertaining package.",1
717," SPOILERS ALERT!!!!!!! A lot of people including myself are very excited about the Dark Knight and went to go see. After seeing The Dark Knight I was amazed but at the same time a little dissapointed. The beggining of the movie kind of makes you think you are in for dissapointment. Diaologe is mumbled. The story is confusing and you are probably going to be a little confused. But thankfully all that is not important. What is important is that the joker is turning Gotham upside down. The Joker hogs the spotlight with his stunning performence and constant cause of trouble throughout Gotham. On top of that there are even some plot twists which I don't want to spoil. But, lets just say you are in for some shockers. Despite all these ups there are a few downs. First off the plot is pretty confusing even after the beginning. So be prepared for some head scracthers. In addition the movie appears to going for a cliff hanger ending. However, sadly the conflict is quickly resolved preventing what could've been a great third movie. All and all the Dark Knight will please most audiences even if you haven't seen the first movie. But be warned that you may be dissapointed as I was. Still if you love Batman, plot twists, Batman, and movies all together then grab some popcorn get ready to have a good time.",1

721," Brilliant, tragic, disturbing. Ledger's performance so convincingly evil, it made me extremely uncomfortable. Many times the audience laughed at scenes which were not funny. Maybe it was their nerves. This is not a funny movie at all. It is serious, dark and disturbing. Afflicting suffering for pleasure and seeking anarchy, goes beyond evil. Where as evil has a plan, the Joker has not.",1
722," Some critics are claiming that this is too ""sadistic"" for their taste. These guys can go see ""Batman & Robin"" again if TDK is too harsh for them.

Nolan's second masterpiece, alongside Memento.",1

726," It was enjoyable, but I liked Batman Begins better. Too many events happened without a thorough explanation. The strength of Batman Begins was that it took the time to explain how someone like Batman could exist to the extent that suspension od disbelief was possible. That didn't happen here, especially for the last 30 - 60 minutes. It seemed as if they were trying to jam too many things into one movie. All of this said, I still liked it, and thought it was a worthy enough successor.",1
727," One of the best movies of all time - forget the negative reviews, just see the movie and you will enjoy it! Also, instead of showing the violence of the Joker, the camera turns away just at the right moment.

728," Are you an adult that wishes to see a movie containing adult themes? Do you wish to see acting take place before you, with skill, passion and genuine talent? Do you wish to be transported to a bleak, hopeless society full of awkward questions and difficult decisions? Do you want to see a classic character stripped back and forced to confront the impossible questions a self-styled 'vigilante' must find answers for? If you answered yes to all the previous questions then this film is for you. A stunning, pitch-black barrage of unforeseen consequences and cruel twists. Of course all eyes will be on Heath Ledger, but to claim this film is a 'tribute' to him is a gross nonsense. But, of course, you want to know if he is as good as the professional critics say he is, right? The answer is yes, and mesmerisingly so. With just enough of Jack Nicholson's comic camp to keep the character recognizable, Ledger and Christopher Nolan twist the Joker into a sadistic, almost satanic enemy of decency, armed with an unlimited supply of sociopathic apathy and gut-wrenching personal demons. Christian Bale broods and struggles throughout with the weight and sheer hopelessness of the task ahead of him, but with such aplomb and adeptness you are left amazed at how a vintage comic-book character can be converted into a very adult, very complicated hero. This movie was incredible, and when the credits roll you'll be left a little numb, a little bruised, but completely impressed.",1
729,"It starts out as an interesting upbeat adventure with gadgets with an Indiana Jones flavor, but the more you see Heath Ledger on screen the more you wish he would stay there.  The story begins to fall apart and there are too many villains to keep track of.  Heath Ledger's performance remains as the only memorable feature.",1
730, Excellent Movie. Best action/crime movie i saw in years.,1
731," Not a Batman movie, but a Joker movie. Christian Bale is marginalized and, for good reason and to great effect, Heath Ledger is elevated. In an action movie like this, you have to have two things: a good director and at least one good performance. What saves this movie from being a bloated mess is Ledgers staggering performance and Nolans competent if underwhelming direction.",1
732, Movie is amazing and ledgers performance is stunning. The best acting of the century. The movie is funny yet twisted and the movie itself is phenomenally well done. Anyone who hasn't seen it really needs to cause it is absolutely the film you have to see.,1
733,"I like scary/action movies. Ledger was brilliant. The action was mostly interesting as well. The Joker drops a few silly comments bringing comic relief to the constant seriousness. Iffy parts include OK-a-little-over-average acting job of Batman and Harvey. The actress who played Rachel was horrible but that didn't really matter. When seeing a superhero movie you always expect to atleast have a happy ending. This movie has none. It's depression after depression after depression of sadism and death for an overrun 2 and 1/2 hours. It could have been finished 30 minutes earlier if you see the ending. No one really wins in this movie, but it is suspenseful. If you like suspense, go ahead and watch the movie. But there is no positive excitement, its 100% run off of depression, fear, and sadness.",1
735," The Dark Knight has to be the best movie of 2008. I don't think any movie can live up to its achievement. On most movie databases it's been given extremely high results. If movies keep on ending up as crappola like 88 minutes, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Jumper, and much more. Despite the fact that Hellboy and Hancock aren't worthy enough, Dark knight's gonna win best picture at the Oscars. And since Ledger's dead, he did an amazing job as the joker and hopefully will be recognized and awarded best supporting actor at the Oscars for Heath's memory. Just a great movie. go see this NOW!!!",1
736, This is how dark all comic-book turned movies should be. Awesome!,1
739," Brilliant film. Acting from Ledger and Bale was great. The special effects were good, but never took attention away from what was happening. A great story that hits some deep philosophical questions. David H: Batman does triumph in the end. The Joker loses, Gotham gets to have it's ""White Knight"". The point is that he is redefining what a hero is. The audience looks up to Batman's sacrifice, even if the people of Gotham City don't. Billy C: Two Face was flipping coins in the Batman comics in 1942.",1
740," This is one of the best movies ever. I was already a fan of batman, after watching this movie i became a fan of joker too. Ledger's acting was awesome.",1
741," Wow. simply amazing. utter genius. director Nolan makes the world unlike any other comic book movies ""world"". Its so realistic, it seems like it could happen to any place in the world. Unlike many of all of the spider-man movies, when will you see a man with four giant steel ""tentacles"" terrorizing your city? Every character plays their role superbly, the story line is exceptional, and they build from exactly what they started with the first one, ""Batman Begins"" Heath Ledger as the joker was one of the best performances i've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. He makes you enjoy every second hes on the screen This movie surpasses the ""comic book"" genre. Its a CLASSIC 10/10",1
742," Awesome movie. Saw it 4 times already. Easily the best Batman movie so far and also the best movie of the year. Heath Ledger's performance is incredible and Oscar worthy. The rest of the movie is also damn near perfect, with intense action sequences, a deep, intricate story and great characters. I have a few minor quibbles, but it's not enough to bring this movie down. Whether your a Batman fan or not, you need to see this movie - it's that good.",1
743," Fantastic movie. This movie explores issue of morality with enough depth and talent to put Shakespeare to shame, let alone Hollywood. I think that may have confused a lot of the reviewers, who were expecting a typical comic book movie. The movie is intriguing, deep, well executed, and brilliantly acted. On the flip side, the pacing is weird, and it gets slightly confusing at times, but I left the theater feeling that those were worthwhile sacrifices for the sake of the movie as a whole, rather than a true flaws of the movie. Overall, a fantastic movie that I recommend to all adults, but be aware that it isn't your typical summer comic book blockbuster fare. It's much much more.",1
744," I personally loved it. I did have some complaints, both about the movie and the critics. Two-Face did the coin thing in the comics as well. I believe that the Batman comics came out before No Country for Old Men...Correct me if I'm wrong. My big complaints had mostly to do with the fact that I don't think Two-Face would speak with the same voice after losing half his lips. Also, I didn't care for Batman's voice... The Joker was brilliant.",1
745, amazing and also to Billy C. Two Face was thought of way before Anton Chugurrh. (1944 to be exact).,1
746," The best movie I've ever seen. In the first movie they really nailed it with a superb cast. This movie is much deeper and darker than the first. Batman's ultimate rival, the joker was so entertaining. No matter what he did, it was entertaining. I wonder what the sequel will be like.",1
747," If any film deserves a perfect score, this does. In all actuality, there is no such thing as a perfect movie, but this one comes about as close as any ever have. Dark, beautiful, harrowing and deeply meaningful, ""Knight"" is a class-act masterpiece, both high art and brilliantly accessible to our modern spoon-fed masses. The bar has been set so much higher by the Nolans' latest stroke of genius that audiences are bound to be disappointed by the suddenly mediocre fodder of the box offices for quite some time.",1
748," Everyone did a wonderful performance, especially Heath. I am not just singling him out because of a fatal accident. This is in all honesty. On thing that I will say is watching it for a second time it seemed longer than the first time. Another thing is for people who read the comics. Do not expect to walk in this movie and have it follow the comic books. This was a darker version of Batman as I would like to say. Now, if you don't follow to comic books so well, or don't read them at all, then you will appreciate it as a movie instead of comic book character.",1
749," I caught an early screening and I thought it was incredible. I couldn't believe that this was the same actor in 10 things I hate about you playing the joker, and even though Aaron Eckhart is overshadowed by Ledger's incredible performance, Eckhart was amazing, too. This movie is just simply brilliant.",1
750," This film is absolutely brilliant, from start to finish you will be surprise, even by event that you knew would happy.",1
751," This is one fantastic film. Heath Ledger's performance is one for the ages and every bit as good as the critics say it is. It's tight, tense and terrific. This is without a doubt the best comic film ever made...beware though it's dark. Don't say you haven't been warned.",1
752," A very good film, no doubt. Ledger's final performance will be forever remembered alongside the powerful performances from the likes of Nicholson and Pacino. This is a throughly enjoyable romp, but at Number 1 on the IMDB, it's over hyped and overrated. Go see it by all means, but don't expect The Godfather or anything nearly so good.",1
753," Good mix of humor, darkness, and action.",1
754," I really cant believe some of the comments here and the marks...... It is a 3? A 5? Get real, maybe you should have gone and seen Mama Mia instead. I mean you are entitled to your opinions but David H saying that the was left feeling depressed after the movie and defining what a super hero should be is ridiculous! For all true Batman fans, this is Batman he is. This is his challenge: to be a superhero in a corrupt town with little thanks from those who surround him. Of course he is a dark character, all you have to do is think about his development and what he has had to go through...... Heard of empathy? Having collected the Legend of the Dark Knight comics as a boy I am truly thankful to Nolan for allowing the characters to express their true identities. Ledger;s Joker walked all over the funny clown of Nicholson. the joker is an evil, pranking genius. A sicko. Nothing less! He is not a funny guy really. He's maniacal! I do agree about Gyllenhal though. That was a poor casting decision but then again it didn't detract from the broader picture and was bearable. The Two Face narrative was true to label. This was the movie of the year with great performances across the board, a great script, beautifully directed in all its darkness and left me on the edge of my seat, not to mention the awesome action sequences. The best of the Batman franchise and beyond comparison (you compare this to Iron Man? Bah!) The Dark knight. Truly true to label!",1
755, The best superhero movie ever made. Flawless acting and a story that soars above the average summer blockbuster. The movie is an absolute masterpiece and one of the greatest films of our generation.,1
756," Best movie of all time! Critics who give The dark knight poor reviews are seen as sad a hopeless creatures. Constantly grasping out for attention and wanting any sign of recognition for their critic minds. But sadly all these critics do is uphold a poor society where good movies are rated poor. Overall, Heath ledger delivered an outstanding performance where there is a fine line between evil and insanity. The movie was creative with unique turns and twists where the only savior for the city is a hero among a rats nest of villains.",1
757, I reluctantly went to this movie with my husband and teen son. By the time it was about half-way done I was thinking how much this movie totally kicks butt - it was fabulous. I smiled everytime Joker was on screen because the character was so well acted - it was almost hypnotizing to watch. Take from a soccer mom who shuns this genre - this movie is good!,1
758," Easily the best movie I've ever seen. Heath Ledger is spectacular, and Christian Bale proves why he is the most underrated actor in the world. The fight scens are improved from Batman Begins, the plot is fantastic, and it leaves you thinking for days after you've seen it. This is the first movie I've ever watched where I can find nothing wrong with it.",1
759, Phenomenal. Oscar For the Jokers Performance. Took it in a interesting new direction. No spoilers here ill say no more.,1
761," For the most part a enjoyable movie, let down by a finale that is highly questionable in it's message.",1
762, Perfect!! Reinvention of a genre.,1
763," A masterpiece of the genre, easily the finest ""superhero"" film I have ever seen--it also stands on its own, outside the genre, as a bona fide piece of art. It is also a film that brilliantly captures some of the darker aspects of our world today--a pervasive sense of darkness and loss of control that has existed in the cultural zeitgeist since 9/11.",1
764," -Wow, I'm surprised at what some of the lower reviews had to say. Some argue that the film attempts to be deep, but fails. I don't think it fails at all. The movie poses the question: what are the consequences of any man (whether me or you, or someone with lots of money, power, and technology dressing up in a batsuit) taking the law into their own hands? Most movies just explore this notion of vigilante justice very briefly and poorly, but The Dark Knight does it sublimely. It actually shows the terrible consequences of vigilante justice on one's friends, loved ones, and on society (Rachel Dawes is killed because Bruce Wayne is Batman; Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox's friendship is broken because, once again, Bruce Wayne is Batman); and other wanna-be vigilantes also try to take the law into their own hands, as the movie's start shows. -Then we have the idea of opposites: Batman, the vigilante hero, and The Joker, the villain. With great power, the movie explores the idea of the limits of vigilante justice. To stop evil, will Batman himself commit evil? Will Batman just turn into the next Joker? The movie does suggest that there's a very thin line between the vigilante and the criminal, and the only thing that stops Batman from becoming the Joker is his moral code, and his unwillingness to kill. -And then you have Harvey Dent, the embodiment of both good and evil, as characterized by his Two-Face persona. The regular man who tries to do good within the limits of the law, but is beaten down, until he too decides to do evil. Or what about the fact that Joker thinks everyone is as evil as him, that they'll all kill if compelled and sink to his level? We see this in the scene with the two boats, one full of criminals, the other with ""good, normal people"" where each holds a detonator to blow up the other boat. The criminals, it turns out, aren't all pure evil, and the good, upstanding people, it turns out, have evil thoughts and would kill. But no one blows up the other boat, showing that the Joker's wrong: not everyone is like him. Harvey Dent falls victim to the Joker's evil, but Batman endures. -No other superhero movie has ever attempted to take on these themes (though all superheroes are vigilantes and live by their own sense of justice) except for The Dark Knight. This movie poses real questions and explores them with courage. It does things no superhero movie has done before. -Some didn't like the ending where Batman is on the run, yet, as a vigilante breaking the law, shouldn't (realistically) every superhero be on the run? And one of the greatest parts of this movie is how Batman becomes hated at the end: the movie argues that true heroism isn't glamorous like they show in movies, but about what's done in secret, what no one knows about. Batman sacrifices his own reputation so Harvey Dent can give all people hope in the law and the goodness of all normal human beings, not hope in grand superhero crime-fighters, like Batman himself. The movie debunks the very idea of the superhero, who does amazing feats in public, to the idea that greatness lies in us--normal people. It's not the superhero that's super, it's the regular people: that's the movie's message. -There's so much more to say, but this review's already too long. But does anyone else think that all these themes (and more) could've been explored in less 2 hours and 20 minutes?",1
765," This Batman is, in my opinion, infinitely better than its predecessors. It is much more than a comic book movie and even delves into the basic laws of human nature and the consequences of actions. But, if you don't like to immerse yourself in the human dilemma, just sit back and watch some awesome action sequences and Heath Ledger's best performance ever. I just want to go back and see it again. This is the best movie of the year.",1
766," The only ones who have given this movie a low score are either picking the damn thing apart, not allowing themselves to be taken away by the scope and beauty of the film, or are not familiar with the Batman character and are totally missing the point. TOO dark? TOO depressing? Please. This movie nails Batman's character, his morals, his frustrations, his burden perfectly. Ledger is wonderful as the Joker. Psychotic, maniacal, with a warped sense of humor. The Two Face character is developed in a manner where we can understand why he come to be a vengeful man on a killing spree. It makes sense, it works. Maybe it is a little long I'll admit, but never boring. Some people will just never be pleased. Do not listen to the people who say Batman's voice spoiled the movie. Or that they don't understand how the Joker kept escaping and was able to blow up so many things. Haha. Wow. Watch this movie. Great entertainment.",1
767," Although a bit long (an attempt to address too many characters and plot lines), the movie was done very well. As for the criticism, I don't understand any of the complaints (all of which seem to lack any substantial supporting evidence, and thus merit). There seems to be two common complaints: first, there seems to be issues with Batman's deep voice. This is a surprising criticism given that he used the same deep voice in Batman Begins. Second, people seemed to dislike the supernatural and unbelievable aspect of the film. This is very confusing criticism, since the film is based on a comic book. I guess if these are the best criticisms which people can throw at the movie, it must say something good about the film.",1
768," Jacob G says, ""Also if he would have killed Joker in the beginning he could have saved like 50 people. Batman lets his own personal heroics get in the way of saving people."" Cripes, man! That is, in fact, the theme of the movie. They explicitly state as much. Anyways... An all-around solid, engrossing and well-made film. Uniformly solid performances throughout. Yes, it's true, Ledger was awesome. Too bad he's gone, but he left on a high note. I did, however, have a couple of problems with this film: 1) It didn't feel extremely long. But, it did feel a little long. I think 15-20 minutes could have hit the floor without sacrificing the plot or pacing. 2) The whole cell phone-sonor thing kinda bugged me, both in concept and the visual effect. Then, at the end of the fight, Batman gets hit by the Joker cuz his ""sonor vision"" is still on? Sheesh, dude! Turn that stupid sonor-vision off when the guy's right in front of you! Ultimately, this is the comic book movie that raises the bar on what's possible with comic book movies. Watchmen, The Spirit, Iron Man II, Sin City II, Thor, Captain America...they all got their work cut out for them. Wanna see me make this pencil disappear?",1
769," A dark film, but a great and memorable one at that. Unforgettable.",1
770," Best Superhero movie by far. Amazing work. ""Nonya Business gave it a1: Much worse than the first. Since when did Batman become hated and a villain?"" Talking about not knowing a d*mn... Batman has never been loved in comic books. He's even been prosecuted as a vigilante. Search information about Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"".",1
771," The title of this film is about the only thing that makes this a ""Batman"" movie. The Joker is without argue the star of this film. Heath deserves an Oscar for his incredible performance. There is virtually no trace of Mr. Ledger beneath the Joker's sadistic, etched in smile. Fans of the comic, and it's true darkness, can thank Nolan for bringing it to life in a manner that can be enjoyed by the casual movie go'er, ensuring that Frank Miller's efforts to bring the caped crusader back to his gritty roots weren't for naught.",1
772, Best Batman movie by far...Best fare in the action genre this decade.,1
773," You don't realize until you leave the theatre that this is probably the bleakest blockbuster ever made, with the Nolans and Goyer absolutely refusing to compromise the story. At least one, extremely tragic, thing happens in this that I was 100% certain would be prevented. The Joker's games are genuinely sadistic and often painful to watch. All in a summer blockbuster about a man in a cape. This is what Ang Lee tried to do with Hulk (but only got about 57% there) - make a superhero film that really IS a film. It helps that he's assembled a fantastic cast: Christian Bale as the first Welsh Batman, maybe overdoing the Bat-throatiness but the first one to properly brood since Michael Keaton (who to be fair was also the last one to have the opportunity); Sir Michael of Caine as a still pre-tache Alfred Pennyworth, finally coming across as the wise vizier from the comics; Morgan Freeman, who seems to an extent to be in there simply because he's Morgan Freeman and he rules, in the crucial role of Luicius Fox, finally bringing the dimension of Waynecorp into the movies properly; Aaron Eckhart, who has quietly rocked for years, who is even better as Harvey Dent than I thought he would be. WB were considering Justin Bleeding Timberlake for the role, you know. Then there's Maggie Gyllenhaal, who for the record is easily pretty enough with change, being both cute and strong as Rachel; Gary Oldman still stoic and principled as a young James Gordon (incidentally, since we saw his family in this one, anyone want to take odds on Sarah Essen appearing in the next one? And who could play her? Ellen Barkin might work). And Heath Ledger. Now, obviously objectivity is compromised when discussing his performance, but it is absolutely mesmerizing, and genuinely terrifying, and god damn it, just god DAMN it. In conclusion, Batman Begins was great. This is better, but much, much bleaker.",1
774," Quite easily the best film i have seen in years- or possibly one of the best films i have ever seen in my entire life. Going into the theater, i had every belief that it was going to be a lamo like the boring ""Batman Begins"", but wow was i wrong. I ended up loving it so much, i went to see it three more times in theater. As of now, i have seen in a total of four times and look forward to seeing it again (hopefully at the IMAX! that would be spectacular). The movie itself is pure artistic genius. The beautifully epic shots- to the loud, heart racing music- to the fantastic acting from Freeman, to of course, the absolutely AMAZING Heath Ledger- the Joker as a character itself- the fantastic psychological depth required to watch the film- the one liners that make the film a classic ""Die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". All of this makes up for one hell of a good movie. I give it 10 stars- it's every bit deserving of a perfect score. The story was well-written, and instead of being your typical good vs. bad guy, they made it so much deeper and darker than that. The Joker was my favorite villain of all time. Heath Ledger awed me with how talented he is, he has an incredibly gifted mind. I have now seen him in other movies (Brokeback and 10 Things I Hate About You) and am just as impressed. But his hugest, most eerie role to date was the Joker and it will be in history as one of the most terrifyingly fantastic villains of all time. I absolutely loved it and when i went to the bathroom and missed a Joker scene, i was furious. He must be seen at all times, it's just that good. Christian Bale is a nice cleancut look for Batman. Though the husky disguised voice continues to anger some, i found it rather annoying at times, however it's understandable that Bruce Wayne must have a huskier, deeper voice to disguise himself as Batman. Michael Caine was a nice classic touch to the movie. Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckheart, also, shockingly surprised me with how well they acted. Morgan Freeman- well, loved him. And i actually loved the idea of Maggie Gyllenhall replacing Katie Holmes- i just don't think Holmes is a very good actress and comes across blah. The music was terrifying and heartpounding. The action scenes were ecstatic to watch- they were absolutely heart racing. I especially loved when the truck flipped over, and the Joker comes out shooting at everything saying ""C'mon hit me hit me."" It was terrific. Overall, such a job well done. Christopher Nolan- my hat tops off to you. You are quite the director with completely erasing the label ""comic book"" or ""superhero movie"" and replacing it with ""crime/thriller"" or ""an epic"". Job well done. Fantastic movie. I loved it. My number one.",1
775," Amazing. Everything you'd want from a blockbuster movie. Great script, unbelievable acting. Awesome cinematography. Movie of the year.",1
776," Oh my gosh this movie is really a ten but I just want to say why I didn't give it a ten. It was so long I couldn't stay to see the end...I was mad. But it took me five extra minutes to get out of the theatre. I even walked out of the theatre and then came back in to give it a little more time. It has stories in it, the Joker had a story, Batman had a story, Gordon and others. I mean it was a collaboration that brought the world of a super hero into play. It is not going to be all white...it will be dark. It makes you appreciate this real world we live it. I loved it...I will buy it as a trophie. You know what...it's at ten!!",1
777, Ledger's performance alone makes the movie worth watching.,1
778, Great action but got a bit boring and lost focus. Ledger good .,1
779," This movie is worth to watch the 2nd time. I missed the connection in lots of places because I was focusing on the action scenes. When i watch the 2nd time, everything tides together so nicely and i am amazed that how well the script is written. The only downside is, this movie is a bit too long. And the female lead is not pretty lol.",1
780, One of the best movies I have ever seen along with THE BEST acting I have ever seen from the joker of course. Anybody that gave this movie less than a 8 deserves a pencil slammed into there eye. Collin C your an idiot.,1
781," Very well done if just a touch too long. Overall, no complaints though. A marked improvement over the already solid Batman Begins. Ledger was, as pretty much everyone else has said, amazing and it makes you that much more sad that he is gone. As for the negative reviews, nothing is really valid or makes much sense. The Salon.com critic is notoriously bad, giving ridiculous popcorn and chick flicks good reviews, and more thoughtful films that require patience bad reviews (Wall-E and There Will Be Blood to name a few). Don't listen to the naysayers and go see this film. Most people won't be disappointed.",1
782," A great movie that is so dark it's black, oozing with darkness. Nonetheless, superior acting led by the incomparable Christian Bale and Heath Ledger; incredible directing and writing; and amazing cinematography. Just an all-around awesome movie. Highly recommended for at least one viewing.",1
783," best movie of the new millennium. with good twist and turn, good storyline and a very convincing sadistic role portrayed for the joker. i really feel its a shame that some critics have a little or no good taste to give this movie a lower rating just because its a comic book movie. and some viewer shouldn't watch this movie if they don't understand the story and go off saying its a horrible movie.",1
784," It's one of the best films I've watched in years... I must say I was a little diffident before watching it cause I thought that the whole dithyramb thing came as a result of Heath Ledger' death... But,well,I was completely wrong!! You extremely rarely watch a movie that keeps your heart beating through every minute... I just didn't realize how the 150 minutes have passed.. What can I say about the performances?? They were all stunning,especially Ledger's Joker which I must admit is the best villain I've watched in years.. Chilling tragic and hilarious at the same time... Hands down Oscar worthing!! So so so bad he passed he passed out so young.. He was extremely talented and we would wait huge things from him.. Pitty! Anyway,I was also impressed by Eckhart's performance.. He approached precisely the character the authors had created: disturbing but also sympathetic (mostly because of the whole Rachel's loss thing). Just an underrated performance because of,you know, Ledger's hurricane!! Bale and Caine Had a magnificent chemistry the way you think they're friends beside the movie.. Gyllenhaal made also a satisfactory performance (miles better than Holmes!).. In generally this movie I have the impression that is the movie of the year.. And it has to.. You know it totally changed from now on the term Superhero movies. How difficult the work for the following ones!!!!! 10 out of 10! ps. Sorry for my English,I'm a Greek guy.",1
785," The film was a powerhouse, and kept me in my chair up till the last scene. Heath Ledger was absolutely amazing as the Joker, to whom he adds an entirely unique chemistry that just fits with the movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose acting is better than average, could not even doom this film with her pan-face.",1
786, Excellent movie... worth seeing for any money.... Heath Ledger must at least get an Oscar nomination for this film.,1
787, One of the best super-heroes movies ever made.,1
789, Heath ledger made this movie what it is....very good job.,1
790," Truly a great piece of entertainment... action and a good story line, plus really good acting. Especially good acting by Heath Ledger. And the muscles on Christian Bale... would make any man envious!",1
791, Epic. This spectacular performance can and will not be duplicated.,1
792," It's Ledger, and what a performance--with an Al Franken voice inside that mask, to boot. Bale lives up to the histrionics too. But so dark, so dark.",1
793," There are some movies that I cannot help but admire in front of others. But there are only a limited number of movies among them that I am ready to watch at any given mood of mine, that I really admire. The Dark Knight is definitely one of them, and Heath Ledger's performance played a huge role for that.",1
794," Such a great movie, it goes way beyond all other comic book films. It is long but I never want it to end whenever I watch it. Performances are great, and obviously Heath is incredible. The technical production of this film is great, as is the script. It's an exciting but emotionally deep film.",1
795, Good not find one flaw in this film. A true piece of art.,1
796," For a blockbuster movie, this is one of the few I highly revere. Though very long, I hardly noticed how long I had been sitting in the theatre and almost wanted it to continue. Action-packed and fun, it makes for a great thrill. But at the same time, Heath Ledger owned the screen. Aside from the bias raised with the heartbreak of his death, his performance was undoubtably the most involved and skilled fathomable, and worthy of an Oscar. His death only makes the movie all the more tragic. I highly encourage everyone to see this to really respect the acting ability of such a man.",1
797," The movie is good, indeed, but 2 and a half hours may be too long, to say the truth when something interesting and/or full of action happened, there was a 40 minutes gap until another scene like this happened.",1
798," Great acting, great message, great atmosphere, great writing. The only reason why you wouldn't like this movie is because you misconstrued it as a 'super hero movie' (is The Godfather a ""shoot 'em up""?), didn't see the first one, and let's add ""completely out of touch"" to that list. No, you can't do better than this movie. If you want to say people liked this movie because Heath Ledger died, go right ahead. But when I heard he was cast as The Joker I was very upset; ""The guy from Brokeback Mountain?! The Joker?!"" But he does a phenomenal job. This movie is one of the most logical you'll ever find near the action genre; just about everything they feature is plausible. The Fulton surface to air Recovery system, for example. How can you not like a movie that thinks about what its doing? Its extremely rare. If you like depth, or just great movies, you'll like this movie. That's all there is to it.",1
799," Great overall movie but i thought that Heath Ledger made this movie what it was, and it is not because he passed it is because he really put alot of effort and time in this role and i think he deserves an oscar.",1
800, Near-perfect.,1
801, This is easily the best batman movie by far with spectular action and a well acted cast every actor and actress in this movie delivered. My only problems were that they should have left twoface for the next movie and the fact that movie was fifteen mins to long.,1
802,"wow, I can't believe the audacity of some people to rate this film anything less than an 8. This film is the best film of 2008 and by far one of the best film of the 21st century.. It may not be one's definition of ""art"" but it's as close as a movie will get. Ledger's performance was mind blowing. ""slumdog"", ""curious case"", ""frost/nixon"" , for example, are all lovely, but none of them especially ""slumdog millionaire"" , are as memorable as 'The Dark Knight'.",1
803,"This movie is in a tie being the best film of the year(along with Slumdog Millionaire). This movie should have been nominated for best picture. The oscars are pathetic for nominating the Reader over The Dark Knight. This is a movie I could have seen over and over at the theaters and still not get tired with it. This was sad, but a great film. Great acting, musical score, special affects, synomatogrophy, and more. As much as I loved Batman Begins, this film trounces that in contrast. What a shame Heath Ledger died. He was such a splendid actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart were also flawless actors. The new Rachel had rather small shoes to fill from the first Rachel, but she was a good actress. See the Dark Knight! Also Slumdog Millionaire!",1
804," With ""The Dark Knight,"" all previous big-screen incarnations of the caped crusader",1
805," It's a good movie, but there are things I don't like in it. I can't put my finger on what it is. It's probably the whole thing with the sonar-thing.",1
806, Name-dropping Ozu (who made the same movie over and over again) or Tarkovsky does not make you better than the people who appreciate this fine piece of pop art.,1
807," This movie was astounding. But, I would not agree that it is THE best movie ever made, nor would I agree that it ws not good. In fact, I would nto even give it average reviews. It was very, very good. It was dark, compelling, and at times incredibly moving. My one problem was, as with most of my favorite movies, it is a tad bit too long. Now, the fisrt and second times I watch them, i do not mind, but, after that, they start to cause me to fall asleep, even though I am still enjoying them. So, yes, this movie was overwhelmingly good, just, take my advise, do NOT watch it multiple times over a short time period. Take your time, and enjoy it.",1
808," This movie changed my life! I was about to jump off of a tower, but i heard about this film, watched it, and now im still like here. ya know?! Dark Knight is so awesome. thank you batman. i heart you.",1
809," Action packed. Amazing performance by Heath Ledger. Cool beyond cool. That's why I loved it. But I can fully understand why someone would not enjoy such a dark film, where law enforcement is a joke and every person is an arse, oh except for that one guy who gets driven insane.",1
810," Nolan has made Batman plausible. And this seriousness makes him capable of creating an outstanding movie. If the first one was very good, this one was incredibly amazing. Each scene, each dialogue, each detail make us enter Gotham City and forget our world. I dont think it's too long. Actually, I wanted more :( Well, this an unforgettable movie. The best Bat-movie, the best movie of that year, the best and darker thriller ever made and one of the best movies ever made. 10 is not enough.",1
811," Everything is absolutely awesome about this movie in theaters. I thought it was good enough to see it 3 times, but when I rented the dvd it just wasn't the same... Even if you have a home theater system. I thought it felt too different.",1
812," Without a doubt, the greatest movie of all time. Amazing!",1
813, The people giving this film bad reviews probably don't like good Entertainment. They probably are over analytical people that take themselves and others too seriously. It's entertainment do yourself a favor and go back to watching Pans Labyrinth. Which was really trash. Talk about over hype. Losers.,1
814, I don't relly enjoy the plot for batman films-I personally find them a bit boring.But I enjoyed this film-definately better than the first.,1
815, This is probably not going to be the be all end all of comic-book movies or even super-hero movies. I don't like Nolan's' direction(or maybe it's the editing of the film). more often than not he(Nolan) has crippled a damn fine performance by Ledger with his incessant cutting and not having the camera aimed at him(Ledger).,1
816, How can anybody that calls himself a movie lover givie thid movie under 80/100? This movie is great. I mean 50?! Really?,1
817," Once again Michael scraglow is on the bottom for low vote against a good movie. Why in hell does this guy still have a job as a professional critic, he's completely clueless. He's given some of the best movies out there horrible ratings and then given complete stinkers high scores. He's like a crap barometer, if Scraglow likes it, then it's crap, complete and utter fly infested maggot ridden crap. Batman was great by the way.",1
818," The single best Comic book movie ever made. I often feel that metacrtic scores are off. And 82 is definitely low. There simply isn't a weak spot in this film. Heath is amazing. The writing and story are great. The score is fabulous. The film has many of the intangibles that make a movie great. Any fan of Batman will be thrilled. Scratch that, any fan of the action genre will love this movie.",1
820," Excellent film! i understand why some people weren't ""wowed"" by it but there is no logical reason for why people are giving ratings of 0!! It seems that for some people if a film is even slightly disappointing then they say its sh*t!!! These peoples opinions are totally invalid! Idiots!! From a creative point of view this film was spectacular. All the acting was very strong. Christian Bale can act......he puts on the gruff monotone when he's as Batman so people don't recognize his voice. All the people complaining about his voice in this film obviously didn't think of that! Idiots (again)! And yes of course Heath Ledger was brilliant. Great film! ps. Paulio G - ""Over the top story"" !!!! you do realize that this is a comic book adaptation yeah? It is a fantasy film, i think that you are somewhat expected to suspend your belief before watching! Its not a documentary!!!!",1
821," This movie is a thrill ride start to finish and Heath Ledger's performance is enough to make the movie a 10. But don't forget all the other excellent things in the movie, with awesome action and impeccable story ""The Dark Night"" is the best of the year.",1
822, Amazing.,1
823," Heath Ledger's acting makes this film. It is the greatest comic to film transition ever, it really does create a whole new film franchise that separates it from the dull and camp batman films of yesteryear.",1
824, A great movie all around and the end is superb.,1
825, this is my favourite movie i would watch it every single day if i could.heath ledger did a phenominal job for a last performance.may he rest in peace,1
826, The greatest entertainment epic in the history of everything.,1
827," this is one movie which no comic lover should miss irrespective of who ever may be his or her favourite character. After watching the Movie u would know why i mean it. My Favourite until i watched Batman Begins was He-man and Superman and then batman, but after Batman Begins i started to like the character and after watching THE DARK KNIGHT, i had no option left but to admire and respect the character by the way it was portrayed...Hats off to Nolan and Keith and also Bale. All in all Wonderful Movie and i am glad that i was the first one to watch it 8 times in IMAX in my city and the first one to have the Blu-Ray Disc in the Office and City. i feel so proud of it too. Hats off the entire Production.",1
828," I am going to be the first one to say, ""How could anyone hate this film""? I mean yes it is a little long, but it has the intelligence to keep it interesting. The joker does steal the show, but offers a point of view that needs to be embraced, and not ignored. If anyone ever read the newer comic adaptations of Batman, than this is a dream come true. It is a very tragic comic, and the Joker and Batman are dark disturbing characters just like in the film. Christopher Nolan is a godsend to this franchise, giving it heart and soul. Finally, comic book films can be art, plus win academy awards in major catergories. Isn't that what comic fans have wanted for years for their favorite books being brought to screen and being so respected? My one problem with the Dark Knight is Bale. He is so dry and wooden. The Jokers plot is the whole plot of movie. His story is the driving force in the Dark Knight. Everyone loves the Joker more than Batman because he has no limits, no rules. That is why this will be the best film in the series. As for plot holes, every arrogant person thinks they see them, beleive me I went to film school. Some people can't just accept some things the way they are without trying to be the next Roger Ebert, or a lesser Roeper.",1
829, Heath Ledger gives the most stunning performance of his career.,1
830,"Heath Ledger was the best part of this movie, bar none. The first 3/4 of the movie are definitely enjoyable, but beyond that? It drags like it has an anchor on it, which is a shame. Of course if the joker made more appearances in the latter scenes, it would have most certainly validated them.",1
831," Good movie, but overrated. As many before me have stated, Heather Ledger was great. The cinematography and music are great. The first thirty minutes are fantastic, but the film gets caught up in minutae and too many plot threads, namely the Two-Face/Harvey Dent character. This film could have been simplified, and would have thus been more satisfying. I dig the ambition a lot, don't get me wrong. But this is not the best superhero movie ever made. Don't ask me what is--I think they're all pretty flawed.",1
833," Nolan is a brilliant film maker, this is the best batman yet. If the academy doesn't recognize this work of art for best supporting actor or best picture, then the academy doesn't know movies at all.",1
834," Incredible!... the best movie I've seen this year and one of the best I've seen in my life... The cast is just perfect.. Christian Bale is the amazing as Batman... and Heath Ledger is perfect as The Joker... Unfortunately some ""reviewers"" say this is too sadistic.. It is not sadistic.. It's a Masterpiece!",1
835," The ""New Yorker"" and ""New York Magazine"" have no clue what they're talking about. They're whinging losers that complain ""oh it's too dark, I'm a wuss"". It's brilliance is in it's dark theme! I think it should be even darker. See this movie, it's just incredible. I couldn't criticise anything in it, and I'm a very critical person.",1
836," The best of the best of superhero comic book of all time. The Story is moving and the actions scenes were superb. This is like a epic drama Action movie. All of that combined together. Heath Ledger, you will be missed. For those of you give this a 4 or less, then to hell with you. You like doing this for fun or i suggest you guy are sick in mind and evil.",1
837, Absolutely superb. This is the real Batman and Joker come to life.,1
838," Just saw the sneak preview. It was everything I hoped for and more. The darkness and complexity of the movie was exhausting, but in an amazing way. You can not compare this movie to other super hero movies because it redefines what a super hero is. Heath Ledger is absolutely, terrifyingly evil and Aaron Eckhart does an incredible job with his character too. NOT a family movie, but if you enjoy intense movies, then you will love The Dark Knight for its uninhibited vision of chaos and insanity in the world.",1
839, Best comic book movie of all time. Wow. The Dark Knight will make you think about life a little harder.,1
840," Easily one of the best movies of the summer. The performance given by Heath Ledger is unbelievable. I have never seen another actor portray a character so intense, chilling and psychotic the way Heath portrayed The Joker. Along with Bale, Oldman, Freeman, and the rest of the cast, the performances are superb. Maggie is a nice step up from Katie Holmes. Director Christopher Nolan takes the criticisms from Batman Begins, corrects them, and makes the sequel nearly flawless. Oscar nomination for Heath? Absolutely.",1
841," Almost perfect. Better than Batman Begins, and in my opinion, the best comic book movie to this day.. The Dark Knight brings a new grit, thrill, and disturbing sadism to the childish world of batman. A true Hamlet of our time that left me thinking about how much I really did like this movie for days on end. Director Nolan, and Actors Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, and Aaron Eckhart have done something that I consider to be one of the greatest compliments for Comic book adaptations. They made it feel real.",1
842," Best Batman- and superhero-movie ever, as also one of the best crime-thrillers of it's kind. Heath Ledger shines, and the rest of the cast is tremendous also.",1
843," Heath is amazing, the film's brilliance lies with Heath's wonderfully wicked and malevolent joker who captures the audience's attention from the word go. There are also stellar performances from the other actors, who really nail their roles. However, there is something truly haunting and mesmerizing about the Joker, Heath really immersed himself in this role. It was wonderful!",1
844," The Dark Knight evokes everything you could want from any movie, not just a comic book movie. Is it the best comic book movie ever made? Yes. Emphatically yes! Is it the best movie ever made? It certainly ranks up in my top 5. Whether you are watching Heath's Joker (and you could easily be forgiven that you are watching Heath ... his performance is so good), Harvey Dent's transformation from White Knight to a monster, or Gary Oldman's portrayal of an infallible cop that seems to be fighting a losing battle, you will find your self amazed, in love and ultimately overjoyed by the attention to detail and the skill of the actors playing all the parts.",1
845," This was by far the best movie of 2008. Maybe one of the best I've ever seen. I just loved it. The Joker was better than ever, and was so convincing. Everyone needs to go see this, I was in the FRONT row because there were so many people, and I still couldn't take my eyes off.",1
846, A Cinematic Orgasm!!,1
847," This movie was amazing, and RIP to Heath Ledger who really played an Oscar deserving role!!",1
848," This movie is nothing short of brilliant. What else can I say? It's too bad that the rating system here only goes to 10, because this is, at least, an 11.",1
849," Does anyone else agree that The Joker is easily the most hateable, but likable villain? He's pretty sweet, but I just hate him. Great movie, saw it already, seeing it again tonight. It should be awesome!(again)",1
850," The Dark Knight is one of the best crime movies ever, it never lets up. The best comic book movie I've ever seen. The characters are top notch, and Heath Ledger as the Joker deserves an oscar for his role. See it in I Max if you can.",1
851," ""Epic"" indeed.",1
852," Note to soccer moms: Leave your rug-rats at home, this ain't no kids movie!",1
853," I must say it was better than I thought it would be. No one mentioned the correlation between Batman and Joker. The Joker was stating it right in the movie that Batman is in many ways like the Joker. Also, they showed how people will blame you or throw you away once your done doing them a favor. It's very interesting all the messages that were written into the story. Very well done. Appreciate what the Joker says in the movie when you go back and watch it again.",1
854," This movie is great, keeping your attention for over 2 hours. Heath Ledger by far was the best performance in this movie.",1
855," Well let's face the truth about this movie.... Some people might be really crazy for these and some people are just disapointed... well for the last of these I can only say that I don't know what kind of movie are they expecting it to be, of course if you go to see the dark knight you are searching to see an action movie (for me the best action movie of the year). I respect other people reviews and of course everybody can have different points of view.. Heath was the greatest joker of all and christian Bale is truly the best batman in my opinion, the history 4 a superhero movie is great and may be u get a little tired with the 2:30 minutes but at least for me it worth it every second.",1
856, Masterpeice. Brilliant. Amazing. Can't wait to see it again! You will not be dissapointed!,1
857," This movie was a masterpeice. Hands down. It may not be the best choice for a kid like me, every single part of this movie was phenomenal. It couldn't have been better.",1
858," Masterpiece. Ledger is brilliant, Bale delivers another good performance, and the Caine/Freeman combo continues to deliver strong support. Intense action, introspection, and realistic parallels are all strengths this movie possesses, with relatively microscopic flaws.",1
859," This is by far the best hero film I have watched, EVER! I can't stand siting in one place for a short period of time, I get antsy when watching a 30 minute TV show. But this movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Some people said this movie was too long, I disagree. AND the only reason the ""Critic"" rating is SOOO low, especially compared with user's rating is because a few critics did nothing but bash this movie just for fun. Come on, the ""Wall Street Journal""? Like they're a creditable source for a movie review! This movie exceed all of my expectations! Nuff said.",1
860," There are few movies that actually follow through on their claims to keep you holding on to the edge of your seat throughout. Not only was I gripping to my seat because of the anticipation of what was to come, but holding on with excitement that finally a hollywood movie combined a good script with superb acting. That doesn't happen to often, but when it does. WOW!",1
861," This was the best film so far of 2008, and deserves its rightful place on the Top 250 list. Every minute of this movie is done to perfection, go see it immediately!",1
862, Simply amazing.,1
863," Nolan and Ledger do a great job with the Joker. Dont be mistaken by the title, this movie should have been named The Joker. He is chaos and apathy with cunning and intellect. He has the heroes chasing their tail throughout the entire movie. Batman should be happy to have such a nemisis. The question is where do they take the franchise from here? The Joker is still alive.",1
864," A movie that really puts you on the edge of the seat, at least for the first part of the movie, then it begins to drag out. The whole movie was depressing, Heath was a great actor.",1
865, Excellence in film making and acting.,1
866," The Dark Knight ~ Jayism Review Where do we begin? Ah yes, my review for a comic book movie that is a sequel to another movie that I loved backed in 2005. This is my first review in a very long time, I hate not written all the movies I see as reviews but that",1
867, Freaking Amazing! Heath Ledger was fantastic as the Joker. Definitely a new addition to my favorite movies list. A definite must see.,1
868," If you are going to see one movie this year, then you better make this your best bet. If you thought the new Hulk and Iron Man comic adaption was good, wait until you see this one. The writers were extremely clever, from small jokes from the Joker now and then to the jump-outta-your-seat intense moments. The actors did an amazing job that lost none of the good writing in the transition. Heath Ledger should definately get the first posthumous Oscar for his amazing job. It is a little violent, and a PG-13 might be too kind of a rating, but none of the violence was over used, and all of it felt like it should be there. There is honestly no reason not to watch this (tip: buy tickets online if you can and arrive early to wait in line, you're gonna have a hard time finding tickets and seats if you don't come prepared). If you haven't watched this yet, I don't know why you are here, just go watch it already.",1
869," Notice anyone that rates this low either says ""it was too long"" or they try to compare it so Burton's Batman and this Joker to Burton's Joker. It is funny and sounds like a broken record. You guys miss the point, have bad taste, and need to take some ADD mediciine because you obviously have problems.",1
870," From the opening bank heist to the final line of voice over, this movie will enthrall you. Ledger's Joker is as masterful as all the reviews and hype have said, and it is his movie every moment he is on the screen. Strong acting across the board, sharp writing, and explosive action make this a film for the ages. I will be going back to see it again it theaters, and if you have yet to see it - go!",1
871," The movie was spectacular, and Heath Ledger's performance was the best part of it. He truly made the film for me, and I found myself hoping he'd be in the next scene. How sad that he's not around to enjoy the accolades he's receiving. The only thing I found unlikeable in this movie was Christian Bale's overly raspy voice when he was in the guise of Batman. Other than this, the film was almost perfect. Completely lived up to the hype for me. I'll be seeing it again very soon.",1
872," I don't care much for heath ledger but the joker role he played was excellent. It was a smart movie with many plot twists and turns. It's batman, but in the 21st century so its much more gruesome and comparable to today.",1
873," I watched it yesterday and I want to watch it again, it's that good. This is without a doubt the best movie of the year and the best comic book movie ever made. Forget Spiderman, X-men or even the previous installment of this franchise. Moreover, the quality of this movie, especially Heath Legder's acting, transcends the genre and truly makes it an instant classic for me. It is a disturbing movie true, but that is what this kind of movie needs to make it come alive. The only shame is that we will never be able to see Heath Ledger perform as the Joker again...and once you see the movie you will understand just what a real loss that is.",1
874, Without a doubt the best Batman movie. Without a doubt the best Joker. Hollywood finally got it right on this one.,1
875, Great Movie.... Heath Ledger definitely took the Joker to a new level...,1
876," Must see, excellent is every way possible, definitely not your typical shallow, dumbed-down action film, better than the first, best movie of the year so far, and I am willing to bet that at the end of the year, it will be the best one of 2008.",1
877," The Dark Knight is not only the best superhero movie to date, but it is also a great flick in general. Its dark and thrilling atmosphere and its mastery of suspense aren't all the movie offers, as it also showcases terror-iffic performances from all the cast (especially Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart). Finally a Batman movie that perfectly portrays the comic. Batman Begins was close, but The Dark Knight hits the bullseye. I held off on a 10/10, because, although it is superb, it does have a few flaws. Most of which are minor, such as being a bit too long with some scenes that just feel pointless. But overlooking this diamonds slight imperfections, I can honestly say this is the best movie I have seen in a long time (yes, including you Iron Man).",1
878," It's the best movie based in a comic, simply amazing The Joker is the best, I don't care about Batman, the Joker is now my new hero. This movie is intense, very violent, sick, I was so scared watching it, 100% adrenaline, you must watch this movie",1
879," Really Good, lived up to all the hype. Just relly sad that we wont see Heath Ledger in the sequel.",1
880," Impressive in every way. Fixes all the faults that were with Batman Begins (particularly the hard-to-follow action sequences). I don't give out 10's that often, and considering the score I gave the Hulk, this movie deserves a 16.",1
881," Very good film. Great story for the genre. Well acted and directed. Terrific adversary. Dark and brooding performance by the late Mr. Ledger. This is not he tounge in cheek comic book movie (where, e.g., Iron Man is a great example. This is rather dark. But it is an engrossing movie experience.",1
882, I will not justify my 10 rating for this movie. If you can not guess why I am giving it a 10 go see Mamma Mia!,1
883, Joker has no jokes - just a crazy guy in makeup. Plot jumps all over the place. Many scenes/plot lines are edited to have you fill in the gap. Length of movie didn't bother me as much as poorly developed characters. If you're trying for a comic book movie with substance and action - then iron out the kinks first. Difficult to follow at times. No real sense of where the movie was going because the scenes would end and you'd be in another place right back in the action wondering what just happened.,1
884," Words cannot describe how good of a movie this was. Ledger was exceptional. If he were still alive, he would of been one of the hottest stars on the planet. Bale was spectacular, but he always is. This movie is in my Top 5!!",1
885, Two possible oscar nominations for this movie: Best Sound Editing Best Actor in a Supporting Role.,1
886, Nolan doesn't disappoint. Ledger is hypnotizing. Even the lesser characters are praiseworthy.,1
888, A great cinematic masterpiece with solid acting from Heath Ledge along along with amazing perfromance from other cast. Best movie in recent history.,1
889," Never have I walked into a theater with such high expectations and walked out with them surpassed. This is my new favorite film of all time, with great performances across the board and the craziest and most interesting villain filmgoers have ever seen. The fastest and most worthwhile 2 & 1/2 hours I have ever spent with a film.",1
890," This is not a comic-book movie. It is not a crime movie. It is both; one of the most engaging, entertaining, and emotional character studies you will ever see. The only difference between this film and other's of it's kind is that it happens to star the Dark Knight and the Clown Prince of Crime. Fantastic performances all around, with one of the greatest screen villain portrayals you will ever see in Heath Ledger's Joker and top-notch directing make this an instant classic.",1
891," ¿Que paso con la atmósfera y el Batman que creo y llevo a la pantalla grande Tim Burton? Este increíble director pudo, en la década del noventa, crear una ciudad Gótica muy futurista, con colores que sobresalían de la pantalla, con una muy buena estética, pero con una trama que dejaba mucho que desear. En el 2005, otra película del hombre murciélago llego a las salas de los cines, provocando un giro tremendo en la manera de contar una historia basada en comics, con un realismo muy bien llevado y con actuaciones también muy buenas. Christopher Nolan, en el 2008 ha vuelto con, no solo la mejor película realizada de este superhéroe, sino la mejor película de acción, drama y suspenso que se ha hecho en años. La historia que se cuenta es la de Batman junto con Harvey Dent y Rachel tratando de poder combatir el crimen de la ciudad. Batman, como siempre tratando de matar y mandar a prisión a los criminales, y los otros dos personajes, tratando de ir ganando gente para unas próximas elecciones para presidente. Estas cuestiones se van a poner en juego cuando repentinamente un individuo, el Guasón, empieza a matar gente sin piedad para tratar de, entre tantas cosas, descubrir la verdadera identidad de Batman. Las actuaciones son verdaderamente increíbles. Christian Bale, el responsable de darle vida al superhéroe, esta increíble. Su fluidez en las acciones y la manera de hablar y expresarse están muy bien plasmadas en la película. Michael Caine, también es una gran figura dentro de la pelicula, su personaje no aparece mucho en escena pero cuando lo hace llena al espectador con reflexiones totalmente ciertas, muy bien por ese lado. La actuación de Aaron Eckhart, es digna del reconocimiento, ya que logra poder entrar en dos personajes totalmente opuestos e increíblemente personificados, cada uno con características físicas y mentales totalmente diferentes. Maggie Gyllenhaal, interpretando a Rachel, el amor platónico de Batman... para seguir leyendo: www.mmcriticas.ar.nu",1
892, It's depressing to know that I'll never see Ledger put on a spectacular performance like this again. He's left us with what can only be described as the performance of a lifetime.,1
893, First of all to all those people bitch@@@ about the movie cause its too long or confusing and talking shi@@ about heath ledger then u know nothing and will never know nothing about movies or acting just go watch something u little kids probably understand like pokemon or something anywayz I think the movie is well acted well written and by the far the best comic book movie I seen since iron man and heath ledger should and will get an oscar for this he deserves it its too bad he couldnt be here to see his best perfomance RIP Ledger the best joker and an oscar winner,1
894," There are movies with elements so good that whatever their flaws, you walk out awestruck, myopically fascinated beyond all expectations. That's how I saw King Kong, and I do mean the monkey, in a crappy movie. And that's Heath Ledger, who's so stupidly good as the Joker that I can barely remember the rest of the movie. This despite my near-obsession with Batman Begins as the best superhero movie to date. How was the rest? Pretty exhilarating, but at first viewing it's all Heath, all the time. You will not believe it's the same guy. Go. Go now. And maybe I'll see you when you go back to see it again.",1
895," Es una película sublime, redefine totalmente el género de cómics adaptados al cine. Ya la vi 2 veces, y pienso verla varias veces más. Por suerte las mejores imágenes no se destripan en los trailers y hay varias subtramas complejas que se van uniendo. Me saco el sombrero ante Cris Nolan, un genio y uno de los grandes directores contemporáneos.",1
896," bravo, that's all I can say cause I'm spechless",1
897, Incredible... Simply mind-blowing... Possibly the greatest performance from an actor (Heath Ledger) ever... Possibly...,1
898," Great flick. Definitely a different flavor of super hero movie. Ironman was fun, this was very dark and there was a lot of morality involved. A great movie.",1
899," I really liked this movie just to get that out of the way. Things I didn't like, batman's voice for one. What are they thinking, sounded so horrible, should have kept batman using bruce wayne's voice like batman begins. Spoiler, don't read on if you haven't seen it yet. I didn't like that they killed off batman's love interest Rachel and killed off Two Face, should have just introduced him and kept him for the 3rd movie. Ledger was amazing and yet overal I just think there was too much packed into this movie.",1
900, Amazing.,1
901, One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.,1
902, This is the best superhero movie ever made !,1
903," Excellent movie. I've never been much impressed by the batman series, but this is different. Very well crafted, imaginative, and unpredictable story, memorable characters and acting (the joker is really that good - thanks Heath), thoughtful lines (for once in a hollywood action movie), excellent cast (Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, what more to ask?). For me, this movie relates more to crime drama movies like Heat, that to superhero movies, as Batman and science fiction are not a central part of the story, and that's for the better. The action scenes are not that frequent, but when they occur, they are impressive and ingenious (think about the police van chase, wow!). The pace is good and the atmosphere is dark, with tension that slowly raises through the film, you can sense it. The music, though not memorable, does a great work at setting the mood. Thumbs up to Chris Nolan and his team. Go see it and forget old batman movies.",1
904," Solid performances by most of the cast. I actually thought that Bale's was overshadowed by the rest of the cast. It was also long and somewhat jarring. Otherwise, it was deeply engrossing, disturbing movie, most likely because it rang so true in the most hollow, unexplored parts of my psyche.",1
905," I can honestly say that The Dark Knight is the first comic/action film that has ever lived up to its hype and managed to not only deliver the same level of quality story telling and performances as the previous instalment, but also managed to out do it. Heath Ledgers performance was definitely the highlight of the movie for me; as opposed to trying to replicate Jack Nicholson as the Joker, Ledger brings a uniquely styled, modernized Joker that fits right in the pocket of Christopher Nolan",1
906," This movie was brilliant! The acting was superb, the story was solid, the character development was outstanding! This movie did not disappoint me one bit. I was so excited to see this movie and it went beyond my expectations. Seeing Heath as The Joker really blew my mind. For me to think that he is no longer apart of the acting community is such a shame, he is a great talent!",1
907," Finally, the mythology of Batman is personified on the big screen in a 2 1/2 hour masterpiece. He is the ""anti-hero"" superhero that can not flaunt his smile and muscles in public like Superman can. he remains in the shadows, villains and law enforcement constantly hunting him down. Heath Ledger's Joker leaves a chill down my spine everytime I see his face on the screen, however on more than one occasion throughout the film, I found myself secretly cheering Joker on. The Joker's philosophy on his and the Dark Knight's co-existence of each other summarizes why comic book writers have a hero and a villain on complete opposite ends of the spectrum....both needing each other to survive. Bravo!",1
908," An astounding movie. Heath Ledger's performance completely blew me away. I'm not a DC person at all, but I have no trouble whatsoever saying that this is the best superhero movie I've ever seen.",1
909, The only regret is that we won't see this artist perfecting his craft one more time,1
910," I had never watched a movie more than once in a theater, until the dark knight. The movie was a masterpiece. Heath Ledger is the only actor that has ever given me goosebumps. He is brilliant.",1
911, Transcendent masterpiece.,1
913,Best movie ever.,1
914," One of the best movies this year. Maybe this decade. It transcends the genre. Its full of complexity. I saw it twice the first time it was somewhat confusing. But, after you watch it a second time it is not confusing no more. It filled with intricate story the will leave you speechless. I recommend seeing it a second time if you didn't understand it. You can dwelve into the dialogue more and helps the story come all together into a near masterpiece.",1
915," The negative reviews of this movie, though some are worded more eloquently than others, seem to all point to the same things- it's too brainy, to confusing (?), too long. I feel some degree of sympathy for those people, but to a greater degree I'm frustrated. This movie is NOT too long, in fact I've never experienced a faster two and a half hours in front of a screen. It is as diverse, intricately woven and demanding as anything I've seen this decade but too say it is confusing or too brainy for it's own good is a digression back into the pathetic archetypes that we've drawn for movies since the ""Comic-book blockbuster"" came to be. The Dark Knight is terrifyingly brilliant in accomplishing what it set out to do. Forget Burton's alien, museum labyrinth of a Gotham City and Schumaker's over camped, neon dump of a pair of sequels, this Batman has a soul. While it IS insanely fun (action scenes don't get any better, folks), it is also liberated from the torturous routine of CGI macabre and given wings inside the deep, dark blues and blacks of a Gotham under siege. Ledger's performance is one for the books, part Jack Nicholson ala the Shining and Punk-Rock eccentrics, he takes volatile to unfathomable depths. And while the late actor's portrayal is perhaps the most valued performance in the film, it is measurable only by the strength of the actors around him and rest assured, they're moving mountains. Bale is wonderfully tortured as Batman. He is scarred and worn thin both physically and emotionally, searching for some catharsis while walking the tight rope between heroism and villainy himself. Oldman delivers virtue as believably as any before him as the newly appointed commissioner. Cane and Freeman, the most veteran of the bunch, both act as a double headed creature of fatherly wisdom, challenging and yet reinforcing Wayne/Batman to take the higher road and weigh the costs of his war. Maggie Gyllenhal is a welcome relief to Katie Holmes and comes through with a Rachel Dawes who is confident though not without vulnerability. And then Aaron Eckhart is absolutely the unsung hero of the film, waxing ethical integrity before falling into the shadows and discarding his own legacy as the white knight. This film has not only shattered the idea of what a ""Super-hero"" film should be, it is also imaginative in taking the best of Crime ala Michael Mann's Heat and the dramatic pull of a classic tragedy. The summer blockbuster has now been redefined in the bold narrative scope of Christopher Nolan. Forget the blundering, paper-tiger of an epic like Spiderman-3, the Dark Knight is out to take names and while its demands on the viewer run high, what you get in return is more than worth the price of admission. This truly is a stirring piece of art.",1
916," The Dark Knight is the new gold standard for comic book superhero movies. This definitely ain't your freindly neighborhood Spiderman. THis movie is dark and serious, but it is also a ton of fun. Heath Ledger is wickedly funny as the Joker. He gets my vote for best supporting actor. Well worth the price of admission even if I did have to sit throught 30 minutes of comercials before the movie started. Now I remember why it's been five years since I've set foot in a movie theater.",1
917," this is by far the best superhero movie i have ever seen. with all the talk about heath ledger (who, incredibly, put jack nicholson's joker to shame), i just want to throw in a thumbs up for twoface. This film is deep. the way the writers wove (very subtly, i might add) the two-sided coin theme into every facet of the movie was nothing short of brilliance. everything down to the last detail was 50-50. However, the movie is such a maniacal rollercoaster ride that you only realize this when you wake up the next morning, wanting to see it again.",1
918," An astonishingly well-made film--one that surpasses the term ""superhero movie"". It's a mature look into what it means to be a hero in a world full of villains. What does a hero mean to the common people? Where can the line be drawn? How do they fit into the chaos of the world? These are the questions this film is unafraid to ask. Beyond that, it's a fantastic crime saga, with a thrilling and complex plot. The cinematography is fantastic as well, with some of the most memorable sequences of recent years. Not to mention, the action is miles beyond that of Batman Begins. And it's all topped off with incredible performances with some of the cream of the crop of the acting scene, with the highlight being Heath Ledger's truly mesmerizing turn as the Joker. Frightening and unforgettable.",1
920," superb - forget the negative reviews - if you liked Batman Begins, you must watch this - the joker's performance is brilliant and outstrips Nicholson's portrayal. Granted - it is long and it does feel like it is running into a second movie toward the end but the time flies by. Great casting, story and just a joy to watch. The review which sums it up succinctly - 'Dark and exciting'",1
921," A massive step up from Nolan's well-meaning but ultimately flawed Batman Begins. Ledger is obviously the show stealer, as a deranged, mob-connected, terrorist incarnation of Bruce Wayne's iconic nemesis. Whats surprising is the overall feel of the movie, which evokes feelings of terror and helplessness similar to those of the early days after 9/11. Evocative cinematography and excellent wardrobing seal the deal. Despite the film being a half hour too long, this is one of the few films of 2008 worth your hard earned $10.",1
922," The movie was well acted, directed, made and edited.",1
923, Cool movie. Heath will be missed. He was soooo entertaining to watch.,1
924," I think this movie is brilliant. It was a nearly three hour movie that left you wanting more. A villian equal, if not better than Batman. The Dark Knight is full of action, emotion, and shows humanity their darker side. I saw it three times already, and plan to see it again. Heath Ledger performance as The Joker was amazing and made me mourn all over again at the loss of such a talented and brilliant actor.",1
925," The movie was amazing. What can you say about Ledger as the Joker. Perfect. I compare his performance to Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow because nobody else can fill those shoes. He was the perfect cast to be the Joker, and never again will we ever see such a Joker as with this film. I am tired of the critics who say this movie is too dark and not funny enough. Stop comparing this Batman series to past Batman movies. The idea of these 2 Batman movies was to make it darker and more serious, so please, critics, stop knocking this movie for not being what other Batman movies were like. You all sound like the Joker.....Why so serious?",1
926, Exactly what one would expect from the highest quality films in existence.,1
927," I'm confused at how some people are classing this film as 'gory' or a 'slasher'. At least in the version on release in the UK i don't remember any graphic violence. Fighting, sure. Two Face is the only vaguely gory thing i can remember, usually most of the graphic content is removed by timed camera switches (Jokers introduction, 'why so serious', even gun shots). The gore level is no worse than you would find on Saturday Afternoon Television. Think A-Team (ok, A-Team with people dying). The only way I can even concieve this being a 'slasher' is that the Joker largely uses knives.. Anyway, gripes of the clueless aside. Ledger was amazing, and the film on the whole is probably the best film i've seen this year.",1
929," It's good - tick. Yes it's dark - comparatively - tick. Heath Ledger is very good too - undeniably so. I fear however that it falls short of a great film due to the American notions of subtlety differing from those abroad - in pockets. Certainly it was less allegory than sledgehammer metaphors for terrorism and I was uncomfortable that the thematic intention of the ending seemed to be a condoning of what really amounts (although this is hinted at in the film in fairness elsewhere) to reverse-terroroism and hypcrisy of the worst kind. That is not me getting personal, rather it is black and white and slapping you in the face throughout the film.... funnily enough though, this is probably equally the film's strongest suit. It is intelligent cinema and watertight allegory/metaphor for stateside audiences that I think helps audiences there achieve some sort of catharsis due to 9/11 that as a neutral and openminded person I cannot totally relate to - or rather, choose wisely not to. The trouble is.... I can't help think Nolan's thematic assessment at the end is wrong. And this grates with me..... however it is a cut above any other superhero movie made, albeit that it is extremely pious and serious at times (only occasionally managing the quips and humour that made Batman Begins so accessile and smart). Also, at times Bale sounds like someone doing a Clint Eastwood impersonation - an exaggerated one, with a megaphone. At the end of the day it could have been a masterpiece if he had made it for the most discerning of viewers, such as Nolan himself, but there is pandering and thus the odd insult to one's intelligence. Without wanting to sound like an ahole though, it is clear from the reviews this is (somehow) being passed off as Shakespearian poetry.... sorry, but not outside of the US. These themes were already being processed elsewhere, resolved and learned from as early 2002/3..... its old hash. We know you became monsters, we know the face of the enemy is one void of the kind of simple motivations of greed that plague the west or rather have been replaced by a simpler one (the desire for chaos and destruction as a noble pursuit), we know that the US by compromising became that which they hated etc etc..... look, this was already well established and obvious when the USA was voting Bush in again four years ago.... (and people like me were crying into the palms of our hands that the most powerful country on earth was also clearly the most self-gratified and dumbest) The Bush who is now a lame duck President and set back East-West relations about five hundred years. Sorry, but you need to be smarter and more insightful and then the height of the nation's entertainment (the very gd Dark Knight) could be a masterpiece and a superb piece of intellelectual visual poetry. But it is not - not quite. It looks fantastic though. It is a great movie. It is however only being reviewed as a masterpiece, it is not actually one. That is fact. Not opinion. :)",1
930," Insanity comes to mind when recapping the forces at work in this movie, from the anarchy caused by The Joker, to the combative string of tries at order; all end in more insanity. The story as some have said is predictable, but this only becomes clear when you step out of the theater, for the intense action keeps you none the wiser of even the most obvious plot twists. You can't blame a writer from writing persuasively, nor can you blame the story in this film from living up to the batman storyline we all know and love. Prediction is not a quality i would dare use to rate against a movie, if anything it helps you cope with the intensity. Maybe I'm just looking at the negatives people mention and flipping it like a coin, but who can claim its not a matter of perspective.",1
931," Superb, left me in a bit of quandary as to weather I'd actually liked it or was just blown away by the movie, it has so much going on and has so many levels that if you approach it like a regular superhero movie you will be struggling to keep up, a real treat, a must see again and again movie.",1
933, Great performance by Ledger! Almost perfect action movie but at times I felt that two many characters and ideas were introduced at once. The movie could have been edited a little shorter,1
935," For Batman fans, it will be a mind blowing movie. For others it should be a great movie. I am not a fan of hype, but this maybe the first movie to come close to matching the promises given by the hype. The acting is solid to top notch across the board. The praise for Ledger as the Joker gets jaded by some who think it is just people being nice because he died. I wish Ledge was alive so he could hear all the praises for this role. If you are looking for a popcorn flick, this is not it. Chris Nolan has taken a super hero movie and made it into something anyone should admire for the quality and craftsmanship. The few poor reviews I have seen for this movie seem to focus on the fact the movie is not a happy story, well duh. This is the first movie in a long time where I did not predict every plot twist and even after over two hours, I still wanted to see more. If they could have kept the quality up, I could have watched this for four hours. Unlike the latest Indiana Jones movie, this one is worth your $10 to see or $15 if you watch it in IMAX like I did.",1
936, Too long Too many plans illogical-Joker says he does not make plans ha!,1
937, I thought Jack Nicholson would be the ultimate Joker - I was wrong Christian bale is a solid Batman but Heath Ledger is unbelievably good.Great SFX The new Batman movies are easily the best DC Comics into movies yet.,1
939," The only thing keeping it from getting a 10 was all that ridiculous filler about some bat guy. It just distracted from the real point of the movie, Heath Ledger's Joker. Holy. Crap. I nearly peed my pants watching this guy. It's been said that this role is what killed Ledger, and after watching his performance, I believe it. One of the best performances by any actor I've ever seen. Heath Ledger really and truly became The Joker.",1
940, One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. If not the best.,1
941,"This is one of the best examples of acting you could find anywhere. This is Heath Ledger's movie. His portrayal of The Joker is so incredible that every scene he was in I absolutely loved and everything else was ""pretty good"". Overall, a very good movie, but I really wouldn't give it a perfect score. But I am giving it a perfect score because you just have to see it to see Heath work his magic.",1
942," An excellent movie from start to finish. The amazing action and visuals fit the dark and intriguing story perfectly. Although it is long (152 min.) you won't be bored for a single second. To all those who criticize the maturity and darkness of the movie, consider that the appeal of batman has always been that he is not the typical flashy and brightly colored superhero. His appeal stems from the fact that he really isn't a superhero at all, but rather a man who simply seeks justice in a dark and corrupt world.",1
943," The Dark Knight's characters were well portrayed by each actor, especially Heath Ledger (it may be cliché by now but the man was nothing short of a genius in his captivating performance as his evangelical character, The Joker. I agree with the many critics that say it is too early to predict Oscar nominations or winners, but it should be said that Heath Ledger has given the best performance of the year to this point.) Everything from the direction, to the writing, to the camera work was done to the perfection and brought forth the dark imagery the film wanted to get at. But like almost every movie there are some critiques. In the opinion of myself and several others the character of Two-Face was killed off too quickly as he arrived much too late in the film. As for The Joker he was literally left hanging as if to put him in a sequel, but unfortunately his character has come to an end with the untimely passing of Heath Ledger. I say this so boldly because no one will ever again be able to capture the character or immerse themselves into the mind of such a sadistic demeanor with what looked like apparent ease. The authentic look of the special effects only enhanced the experience of this new age of Batman we have all been able to enjoy. The Dark Knight represents a spectacular adaptation of the comic book and should be considered nothing but great film and a job well done by all involved.",1
944," This movie was brilliant. Death aside, heath ledger's performance as the joker is one of the best jobs of acting I've seen in quite a long time. Strangely i really enjoyed his presence....is that bad? ;p. Not the whole murdering thing though....that's too much. But yeah, Awesome movie! OH...on a critical note: Christian Bale's batman voice really really sucked towards the end of the movie, i wanted to leap into the movie and give him a throat losenger...""I'M THE BATMAN""...lol.",1
945," This movie was amazing. I have already seen it twice since it has come out and am wanting to see it again. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was terrific. He hit the character to a tee. His actions were twisted and genius at the same time. He added a perfect amount of sinister humor to the character. While Ledger did a fantastic job, he was closely followed by Christian Bale. Both were excellent counterparts to each other.",1
946," firstly, anyone that gives this movie worse than an 8 has no clue about movies, secondly, those that say it is too long should grow a bigger attention span, this was the best movie I've ever seen, and finally the return of the king was longer and no one moaned, and it got 11 Oscars, so that's something to lookout for next year.",1
947," Superb acting and direction, fantastic visuals, intricate plot, and a haunting score. The Dark Knight is the best film of the summer and one of the most memorable films of this decade.",1
948," This film was incredible and it's ridiculous to argue that Harvey Dent is a reflection of Anton Chigurrh. To quote a commenter on a macleans review, Two-Face was flipping coin since before the Coens, Javier Bardem or Cormac McCarthy were in short pants.",1
949, Definitely the best movie I've ever seen. One thing to notice is that the majority of reviews that didn't like it only disliked it because it was too dark for them...those reviewers should go see a comedy...you have to be in the right mood for this kind of movie,1
950," A fantastic film with a truly awesome performance by Heath Ledger as The Joker, giving a chilling, callous and cruel character to The Joker.",1
951, This movie owns. Heath Leger owns as the Joker. Joker is one of the greatest villians ever.,1
952, Super Hero film meets No Country for Old Men. Loved every second of it.,1
953,"the first time i saw this i was in awe of its greatness. i ended up seeing it 5 times in the first for days it was out. and im not even that big of a batman fan. ledger's performance is nothing short of genius, all my friends agree that this movie has some of the best acting. this movie offers things for everybody, and in my opinion is one of the best films ever made",1
954," The right amount of action and quite a dark sense to it. Complete change in style from batman begins, for the better. The misunderstood vigilante and his foil the joker bring us moral dilemmas making the quite film thought provoking. It is visually captivating and i was pleasantly surprised after going in pessimistic thinking it could not possibly live up to the hype.",1
956," Easily one of the best Batman movies made. It takes itself seriously and is brilliantly directed. Look for some of the elements that made ""The Prestige"" and ""Memento"" so excellent. However it still loses a few points for it's over-the-top gadgets and science (It's a bit cheezy).",1
957," Ledger was outstanding, the fillm was well-written, and someone finally got Batman right.",1
958," Close to perfection, the only thing I didn't like was a certain character faking his death. Thank you Nolan.",1
959, The film seemed to never end the first time I saw it. The second time I saw it was at the IMAX. OH MY GOD! This film is superb. The full screen shots looked fantastic. The sound was perfect. Even better the second time because you aren't anticipating the film to end. The Joker is perfect. Love this movie.,1
960," An excellent movie, from the phenomenal special effects to the beautiful portrayal of madness from Heath Ledger's joker. A must-see.",1
961," Some of batman's dialogue was so corny and horribly performed I couldn't not believe what I was watching! Was it just me or did African Americans die super violently in this movie? Pencil in the eye, cut up cheek, 1 pool stick for 3, a shotgun to the chest, what the hell gives?",1
962," The Dark Knight is a dark theme saga with a good balance of emotion and visual stimulation. All of the actors poured themselves into these roles, and in doing so gave a compelling performance. The Dark Knight shows us that violence and non-stop action isn't always a bad thing.",1
964," Good, but nothing exceptional as some people say, definitely not the BEST movie of 2008.",1
965," Dark Knight is as compelling as it is complex. Ledger's performance is haunting and memorable. Bale's Batman: daydreaming, gloomy, and angry is the best copy of the caped crusader yet. All of the players nailed their parts. There were small logical gaps in the schemes and deeds of the characters. A man allowing an activated grenade to stay in his mouth, impossible to predict circumstances situated into traps. This is the best ""Superhero"" movie.",1
966,"Not to be pretentious, but to people who claim that the movie was ""confused,"" you simply didn't understand it.  Ledger WAS amazing and I get the impression that some people are giving it low scores just to prove otherwise.  In other words, they're rating it low because Ledger died and they don't want to be part of the ""hype.""  The movie brimmed with drama, emotion, and cold logic.  The script was impeccable.  the characters are believable and very accessible.  However, the flaws with the movie were Bale's acting (in the Bat costume, jeez, if you're so rich, why can't you alter your voice with technology?) and Batman's self-struggle that made him seem like a whiny kid.  This movie rivals the classics and I prefer Ledger's Joker acting to Nicholson's.  The length was entirely necessary to fully develop the plot and characters and I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time!",1
967," I thought this movie was awesome. Ledger did an amazing job and really makes the movie fun. It was a little weak on the story line but made for some great action sequences. Movie did seem to drag on though. Overall i was very impressed though, best action movie of 2008 hands down.",1
968," Robbed me of coherent speech when I first saw it and the second time a few weeks later as well. Stunning, all of it, and not just because of Ledger.",1
969," Okay, okay, I feel like I have to say something. After seeing the film and reading all of the reviews, I have to agree with the positive reviews. Every negative review that I read just seems like the reviewer either didn't understand the point of how the film coincided with the comics (nearly everything the Joker does in the film is something he did in his first appearances in the comics) or they seem to have some beef with some asinine aspect of te film that you would only pick up on if you didn't want to watch it in the first place. And if that's the case, why are you complaining. No one put a gun to your head. grow up.",1
970," You dare give this a 50 out of 100. This movie made so much money. Heath Ledger's performance only was better than any other villian EVER! And I know what your saying, how about Darth Vader. NO! I said everyone. And futhermore this is not the same batman it is a re-imaging, a more realistic side to it. The visual impact of the film is amazing. It should be a crime not see it in I-MAX. And you dare to say it was horriable. I think this is an outrage. You remeber how crazy people went Titantic came out? The same thing happened here. People went 2 or 3 times to the movie. The DvD sales were through the roof and people called each other up saying you got to see this Heath Ledger is brilliant! You say hollywood is losing its touch, I say you are. R.I.P Heath I'm sorry these guys are such idiots.",1
971," Its one of the best movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in my life, and im not even a big fan of comic book character movies. I have never enjoyed a film so much! Brilliantly written,scripted and directed. All round Classic.",1
972, Darker and more complex than Batman Begins. This is one hell of a movie that will leave you exhausted but eager to see it again.,1
973," Enthralling and truly amazing!! The Dark Knight is one of the best super-hero movie ever made. The amazing acting and directing and visual effects makes this one of the best movies of 2008. The Dark Knight beginnings where Batman begins leaves off with the Joker causing turmoil and pandemonium in the crime infested Gotham city, the clown prince of crime soon becomes a throne in Batman side as he tries to battle the Joker and his conscience of whether or not to kill the Joker or put him away. Which bring all viewers to ask one question how far will batman go to get rid of the Joker and crime? Christoper Nolan gives us a look at the darker side of Batman and the Joker like no one has ever seen before, all adding up to the wildest and darkest superhero flick ever made. I very highly recommend this movie",1
974, Probably the most captivating movie experience I've ever had. Ledger was absolutely brilliant and compelling in his role. The contrast between hero and villain makes this movie more than a superhero movie. Truly causes one to pause and question the direction of their own moral compass.,1
975," Fantastic. Batman is a complex and in genius film The Joker is the icing on the cake. Stunning, R.I.P Ledger!",1
977," Perhaps it loses some of its impact on the small screen (I have only a 32-inch flat screen TV), but I was expecting a bit more from this film. It's a good, not a great, movie. The actors, esp. Ledger, do a very good job in this, the continuing saga of a comic book legend. Perhaps a second viewing will WOW me more...?",1
978," I never like Batman too much until I watched this movie. Joker is amazing, too. This movie was thoroughly entertaining and suspenseful.",1
979," I have seen the movie three times and it holds strong. The storyline is complex to find new things in multiple viewings. Ledger is brilliantly creepy, Gordan actually has some cool parts, Bale as Batman is amazing, in stead of having his fight seens blurry flurrys as in Batman Begins his fighting sequences are methodical and smooth as he easily dispatches henchmen, he's an unstoppable force. An amazing movie altogether I just got the two disc collectors edition. (P.S. This is the most believable and realistic super hero movie, it can actually be taken seriously)",1
981,"Wow!!! The Dark Knight is truly the 21st Century Knight !  I'll give it 10/10 as it is more darker and deeper than it's prequel! For the tools of his trade, in addition to his gadgets and gizmos, he deserves an Oscar and 5 stars! Batman has done a teriffic job again! Call it the number 1 movie of Hollywood-That's Director Nolan's noir of signature style!",1
982,"This is best rated and most popular Batman movie in the series. Add in the best music by Hans Zimmer, the best supporting actor of Heath Ledger, the great cast and the sound effects, you create the most serious adapted comic-book movie ever. Only thing I disliked is the deeper voice of the Batman which might have been too under-toned.",1
983,"Best superhero movie ever! If your a fan of classic Batman stories such as The Long Halloween, and The Killing Joke, this movie is a perfect interpretation. I wouldn’t even address this as a superhero flick, more like a crime/ drama with powerful symbolism. Heath Ledger truly was the perfect joker and he will be missed. It’s funny how we’ve grown up in an era of superhero films, but once in a while we’re treated to hero films using the comic book material and plugging it into a different genre that real es entirely to reality. This will always be my favorite movie hands down.",1
984,"Batman: A childish comic book character past his day. Think again, Nolan brings the dark and the adult to batman. Not to mention Heath Ledger in a legendary performance as the scary but damn right interesting Joker. Bale also cements his place as THE Batman with a smooth performance. This is just about one of the best movies I've ever seen.",1
985,"I cannot tell you how my hopes were dashed when I saw The Dark Knight. The entire movie, in fact, was literally painful to sit through because I could just see how the film might have achieved the greatness it has been accoladed for. Unfortunately, The Dark Knight refuses to realize both the limitations of the audience's attention span, and how much plot one can squeeze into one film. Christopher Nolan took what, in disparate elements, are absolutely amazing aspects of a film. Logically, these should have come together in a mind-boggling display of superhero goodness. To start with, let me make it clear that Batman is my favorite superhero, hands down. Also, I should say that I did not hate Batman Begins; rather, I appreciated what Nolan was trying to do in his attempt to reboot this would-be icon of the comic world and eagerly awaited the sequel. In addition, I did not think the film was bad- but I did dislike it for approaching greatness and yet never quite achieving it. I should also say that I loved, as many people did, The Joker. Heath Ledger gives a performance to rock the ages. Never before has a villain, in anything that I've seen, reached the levels of lunacy and depravity that The Joker reached in this film. Nevertheless, I ask you, you fans of The Dark Knight, if you truly loved the film, or if you truly loved The Joker? In all honesty, the first twenty minutes, essentially the first two Joker scenes, had me on the edge of my seat. I was ready for this to bring down the house and top off my list of favorite films- how could Nolan possible steer a film down from such impressive heights? Well, as they say, the bigger they comeâ",1
986,"The second of Christopher Nolan's Batman films.Much has been said about the late, great Heath Ledger's Joker & it is all it is cracked up to be. He steals every scene he is in & the ""Why so serious"" scene is already up there with the greats.A mention to Aaron Eckhart as well for a very good portrayal of Harvey Dent. It is a very strong supporting cast as was the first film.My only criticism is that Christian Bale's voice as Batman is unintentionally amusing. I understand he changes it so people won't know he's Bruce Wayne but it's so over the top it's almost comedic.",1
987,"you have nothing here but a perfect screenplay with a strong narrative with spell binding performance of heath ledger as joker. christian bale is awesome in the climax dialog. gary oldman and micheal caine are neat, aron eckhart is good as harvey. perfect emotional gripping thriller that will drive you crazy right from the beginning. a decent climax and thundering technical effects like visual effects cinematography and some stunning camera work makes dark knight the best movie of my list of top rated action movies.",1
988,"My favorite film of all time. I have never been a fan of superhero movies, on second thought I hate them. But this is no superhero movie. This is a whole new different type of entertainment that will inspire other films of the superhero genre. whether a fun of superhero movies or not, you will love this movie.",1
989,"I personally feel this movie is a bit overrated. But that's just me. I love it, but not as much as most people do. But aside from that this movie is phenomenal. I just am not a fan of the first scene and the last scene, everything else, golden.",1
990,"This movie hits the ground running and never lets up. Having seen it 5 times I'm still having a hard time finding flaws and every time I've been dragged in. The Joker scenes still send shivers down my spine. It's so good because it is not the usual action hero movie, I can't believe Spider-Man 2 has the same score on metacritic as this one.",1
991,Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was brilliant. He never lost an award for his performance. The movie is just like Batman: Arkham Asylum. I give this movie 10/10,1
992,"The Dark Knight is amazing. Heath Ledger's perfomance was amazing. The screenplay was brilliant. Christopher Nolan (The Director of ""Inception) is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.",1
993,"I think I came in my pants when Gary Oldman said ""Dark Knight"" at the end. Throught out the entire film, I must have had a massive hard-on due to its near-perfection. And when detective Gordon said those two words as Batman sped off, it was the ""finishing"" moment. It defined it. There are a handful of problems, but all the amazing **** that goes on more than compensates for it. It **** tops that **** **** anyone that says that it's overrated.",1
994,"I have never been a fan of the superhero genre, possibly because of the pre-'Batman Begins' drought of good superhero films, only broken by the 'Spiderman' trilogy.'Batman Begins' was already a good film, but its sequel burst into the box office to critical and commercial success, and its not hard to see why. It is a superior film in many ways to its predecessor in that it is more thrilling, clever, suspenseful and action packed than 'Batman Begins'. The strength of this film, not surprisingly, comes from the villain, played by Heath Ledger in his Oscar winning role. Ledger was sinsiter and completely unrestrained as the psychotic 'Joker', and is terrifying, but oh so enjoyable to watch. It is true that he steals the show from Christian Bale as 'Batman' himself, but this really isn't a negative.The film has a fantastic script and a wonderful musical score, and many other positives, including an excellent technical production as well. It has restored my faith in the superhero genre, along with the other 2008 hit, 'Iron Man', and is not just a great superhero film, but one of 2008's best films overall.",1
995,"this is one of the greatest movies ever made, go see it for heath ledgers performance by itself, or see it because his performance is tied into a drama/tragedy masked by clever action sequences and deep, interesting characters.",1
996,"I can't understand why people don't like this movie, it has got to be one of the best ever films. It's The Godfather of comic book movies. A true triumph. Heath Ledger is the perfect choice for the one and only Joker. If there are any niggles, its got to be Christian Bale's Batman voice, which is too growly.But its the only bad point of this cinematic masterpiece. It shows the hard choices Batman has to make, in order to make Gotham a better place. Cannot wait for Nolan's sequel",1
997,"This was an excelent movie to watch, but I had to rewatch it multiple times to fully appreciate how fantastic this movie was. The theme of the movie was superb, fully revealing the struggle and battle of order vs chaos and desperation of both law and underworld crime, with one exception, though - the raging unstoppable tornadoe, only known as the Joker. Christopher Nolan did a breathtaking job of portraying this absolute distinction of Batman and the Joker. What makes Joker work is not only Heath Ledger or Christopher's realistic approach of this madman, but also small bits and tributes of every Joker before this one (going from Ceaser Romero to Jack Nicholson, also Joker from animation series and from ""The Killing Joke"") and also a new distinct personality, all together mashed into this psychotic rage. He was a pure agent of chaos, delivering himself at the scene when it's too late to back out for the rest of the performers. Brilliant.The white knight of Gotham, Harvey Two-Face Dent was also an amazing addition to the story, demonstrating how easy is to fall from the top of the idealistic law to the depths of destruction, bringing chance as the only option for fair in this cruel world.The Dark Knight also delivers an amazing portray of what happens, when the symbol, which should incorruptable, is backed to the corner.Overall, this movie in my oppinion one of the best movies ever made and for good reasons. Check it out! 10/10",1
998,"Batman Begins is the better Batman movie, but The Dark Knight is the better movie. That's my honest condensed opinion, I own both movies on blu ray and recommend them to just about anyone.",1
999,"I have no problem saying that this is my favorite movie of all time. Heath Ledgers performance as the joker is masterful. I saw this at a midnight showing and i was simply blown away. I saw it in the theater 8 times and have currently lost count. Probably around 20 times by now. The only complaint is that when you get down to the knitty gritty there are a few plot holes but frankly its a comic book movie so i can overlook that very easily.  Heath Ledgers performance makes this movie and the supporting cast isnt bad either. Cant wait for 2012 when The third one comes out! Currently title ""The Dark Knight"" rising.",1
1000,"You could call it the best movie of the year i call it the best superhero movie of all time it makes the avengers look like a cheesy cartoon. Instead of going for the explosions and one liners, it hits home and takes its time to carefully craft a masterpiece of emotion and true human spirit. A must see",1
1001,"The Dark Knight has been argued about with fans and critics alike if this is the best Batman movie ever or not while I can't answer this it is a fantastic movie, the acting is great, and the story is fantastic, the interpretation of Batman and the Joker are amazing, this movie will have you wanting more, a must see for Batman fans.",1
1002,Best superhero movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
1003,"It has been three years after the prequel BATMAN BEGINS (2005). THE DARK KNIGHT is the sixth film that brought Batman into widescreen since Tim Burton BATMAN (1989). The Director is Christopher Nolan who well-known as a unique indie film creator in MEMENTO (2000). The movie received as box office record of all-time, It has been earned more than one billion dollars in worldwide and has been broken through TITANIC Record in 1998. The Movie based on Frank Miller version of Batman, which is more mature and close to reality. The Stories and settings adapt well what is on Miller description. Christian Bale Cast as Bruce Wayne, Thiz role seems to be the big leap of his career since his appearance as a kid in Steven Spielberg EMPIRE OF THE SUN (1987). The sequel starred by regular Cast, like: James Cain, Morgan Freeman, and Maggie Gylenhall who substitute Katie Holmes Character on the prequel before. And as villains, Heath Ledger gave his last performance wildly well according to most critics. He even won as best Supporting Actor in Academy Awards. The other villain is Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face. Otherwise, if Joker character want to be appear originally well as its comic, in my opinion the dream cast would be Adrien Brody or Jim Carrey. The Script was nicely arranged by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. The subplot is dynamic and unpredictable. The Action is on the right track, full of Bat-equipment and vehicle chase showdown. It is good to be watch is simple and explosive in the same time. If we want to be fair, we also must give credit to Tim Burton BATMAN which is already set up impressive tones for other next Batman movies or even other superhero movies later. Burton already succeeded to give a new acceptable point of view for this kind of genre. The tone is dark, mysterious, and full of realism.

1004,"Being a huge fan of Christopher Nolan films, ""The Dark Knight"" has to be his best; even better than his most recent film, ""Inception"". ""The Dark Knight"" take Batman to a whole new level; its dark premise and its original screenplay make it a delight to watch and the dialogue is written so well that it should have one or have bin nominated for an Oscar in that category. Everyone gives great performances, especially Heath Ledger, and, in my opinion, Michael Caine, who has an answer for everything in this wonderful film, and who is good in pretty much everything. What I truly liked about ""The Dark Knight"" was that it all fit together so well. Everything worked through smoothly and swiftly, making this a truly entertaining film to watch. Plus, this gives you a story that is actually interesting, for a comic-book movie. Usually, and in past Batman films, it was an average story: Batman and a villian; in the end they square off. This films story is a lot more complex than that. But, I won't spoil anything for you, but I will say, definitley see this movie; great acting, and and great score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. 10/10 [PG-13]",1
1005,Thia is a great movie and still there is a lot of idiots making coments here and given very low scores.  I hate people like this.  Shame,1
1006,"Set within a year after the events of Batman Begins, Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent successfully begin to round up the criminals that plague Gotham City until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only as the Joker appears in Gotham, creating a new wave of chaos. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and improve his technology to stop him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.",1
1007,"simply put, the best Batman film ever made! and beyond that one of the best films ever made! flawless story, chilling acting (Heath) and perfect effects makes TDK one of the best movies i have ever seen.a must buy.",1
1008,After the amazing success of the first film. I was weary of what would follow. Chris Nolan raised the bar for comic books films to an amazing height with this story. While all of the actors performances were equally pushing each other to be better. Heath Ledger's Joker performance was in the stratosphere. He is completely captivating when he is on screen. Amazing.,1
1009,"I don`t think that comparing this movie with the first Batman does any of them justice. Two very different movies, with the very first being more on the comic-like side. They do have lots in common nonetheless. First off, this film is about the villain - the Joker. We can`t understand him. He is crazy and an evil genius at the same time. He plays his games with perfect planning, destroying people`s lives. There is no doubt that Batman never had a more fearsome enemy and I`m glad it stayed that way like in the first movie in the series. As a movie, it couldn`t have been done so well without Heath Ledger, who eats Christian Bale for breakfast. The plot is quite complicated and surprising. The action scenes are very solid but the music beats it all. Gary Oldman plays a very good supporting role too.  The thing I like very much about Dark Night is that I`m not sure if the ending is good or bad.",1
1010,"Finally, the light has shimmered on the Batman movie we've been looking for. Anyone one would concur with the notion that this film was meticulously crafted and you can see the sweat and bone oozing from the screen. This is what you call collaborative cinematic craft becuase within the bowels of this creation were aspects that many people contributed and what a contribution was given for the end product speaks for itself!",1
1011,"Christopher Nolan's reboot of Batman has taken the Caped Crusader to new heights. Batman Begins was a promising start but The Dark Knight is the finished article. This is what a superhero movie should be. This time Batman is up against the Joker who has turned the tables on a villain free Gotham and is causing mayhem throughout Gotham as he seeks the identity of Batman and Nolan's decision to cast Heath Ledger as the Joker must be the greatest decision he has ever made because it reaps the rewards. The late but great Heath Ledger excels as the Joker in delivering a career defining performance, where he steals the show and deservedly so. Aaron Eckhart is also pretty good as Harvey Dent/Two-Face with some memorable lines. The plot certainly keeps you interested from beginning to end and runs along smoothly with some spectacular scenes along the way leading you to a gripping finale. Quite simply as said before the greatest superhero film ever to grace the big screen, the outstanding acting combined with a solid plot and an awesome director shows you exactly what can be achieved. A must see film.",1
1012,"Christopher Nolan isn't your standard better-than-average director - he has a way of direction and conception that is very rare. Having said that, after repeated screenings, I now find that The Dark Knight might just have been a tad too overrated. Nolan is insightful, prodding, and careful about his characters and their evolution, but the flow and surge of the movie was too fast for me. I would have liked a few more extra minutes on the Joker and his ways, the subtleties that make him the psychotic but absolutely cunning strategist that he is, the disintegration of Batman's helplessness after running into a challenge that he has never ever even imagined. The Joker presents Batman with an insourmountable challenge - to save the love of his life, or the possible successor to his clean-up-crap-public-duty? Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon was another highlight for me, equally commendable was Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent portrayal. But then again, if Salvatore Marooni was as important a character in this movie (I'm presuming from the number of scenes he has), why wasn't he given more time and substance? I would have been most interested to see how the Joker dealt with Marooni in private, how their conversations would have gone. I watched it again and again to try and see if I could find anything new, but I was perplexed - couldn't the ending have been different? With all the carnage that the Joker initiated and carried out to near-perfection, how could he be so easily caught?? Or is it poetic justic and ethics that compelled Nolan to direct Batman's character into not being psychotic as the Joker's? For all the rage and anger that Batman personally came to have for the Joker's ways, I would have envisioned a brutal ending. But it didn't happen. Perhaps, that is Nolan's genius, and why we are on opposite sides of the fence! Granted that Knight is a lot better, deep, and precise than your average comic book flicks, I hope that the next time Nolan touches upon a similar subject, he will bring something out of HIS ordinary. He has a signature style - the signature Hans Zimmer haunting score, the rapidly-moving trajectory of the movie, the classic minimalist-signature scene style is all Nolan. It is amongst my favorite movies of all time, though. I wouldn't miss Ledger's Joker for anything, even three years after it came out! Ah, if only he'd been given a little more time! But I get the irony now - Nolan gave Ledger's Joker those few, illuminating scenes for the precise reason - 'if you're good in something, never do it for free', thus the sparce, rare Joker moments on screen!",1
1013,"Like a hot chick with a great personality The Dark Knight really has it all, action, amazing performances, great story, Batman, and awesome cinematography, great trilogy",1
1014,"The best film of 2008....seriously. The Dark Knight has it all. Top notch performances, emotional resonance, effects, score, and superb storytelling. The film does well in introducing characters and developing on them while also weaving a dark story of organized crime and chaos. Ledger was well deserving of his post-mortem Oscar! Nolan sure does know how to make a completely engrossing film.",1
1015,"Great flick and as a person who has read plenty of Batman comics I would like add that it is about time that the Joker was actually the Joker. Heath Ledger Nailed it! Well written, well acted, on the front of your seat action. A little long, could have waited on some of the stuff at the very end but those are very minor issues in a fantastic movie.",1
1016,HEATH LEDGER GAVE A PERFORMANCE OF A LIFE TIME playing the joker.   this was hardcore stuff.  this movie was amazing.  i love this movie.   the acting was great and so was the plot.   it was like batman in a crime movie.  this movie had you keep waiting and in suspense.    best batman movie ever.,1
1017,This was one of the best movies I've EVER seen. Heath Ledger was a amazing! R.I.P. Movie was so exiting and full of action. This is the best Batman -movie ever made!,1
1018,"The Dark Knight continues director Christopher Nolan's dark, dirty and pessimistic vision of the Batman saga, following on from his stunning origin story Batman Begins three years before. It seems the whole film was overshadowed by Heath Ledger's untimely death and subsequent posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Yes Ledger's Joker is utterly spellbinding, playing the Clown Prince of Crime as a terrifyingly volatile, nihilistic terrorist quite rightly received praise, but the film has far more going for it than one stand-out performance. For starters, all the cast are strong. Christian Bale reprises his role as an increasingly despairing and downtrodden Bruce Wayne/Batman, fighting a losing battle not only with the scum of Gotham city, but with the increasingly hostile public reception to his vigilante alter-ego, and with himself. Taking over from Katie Holmes, Maggie Gyllenhaal is also good as Bruce's childhood friend and on-off love interest Rachel Dawes, and she adds a little something of her own to the role - some much-needed attitude, which is perfect for an assistant D.A. who deals with hardened criminals on a regular basis. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman bring some welcome lighter notes and comic relief to this otherwise pitch-black film as Bruce's faithful butler, friend and surrogate father Alfred, and his company CEO/gadget man Lucius Fox respectively. As for the true acting highlight of the film, I'd be hard-pressed to decide between Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart. Oldman's performance as Lieutenant Gordon is well-judged, emotionally complex, and extremely human - if Batman's war with the Joker is the main driving force for action and spectacle in the film, then Gordon's story provides the most scope for genuine drama. I also praise Eckhart for his performance as D.A. Harvey Dent, whose crusade to clean the streets of Gotham leads to his ultimate, tragic, downfall when he is horribly disfigured, becoming Two-Face. Rather than the pantomime villain Tommy Lee-Jones presented in Joel Schumacher's camptastic Batman Forever, Eckhart carefully develops Dent's character, allowing us to emotionally connect with, and understand him and his motivations, making what happens to him all the more dramatically effective. Other than the cast's performances, I think what really makes The Dark Knight is its thematic richness. The idea of duality and antithesis is continually emphasised - justice vs. injustice, order vs. chaos, Batman vs. The Joker. Even Harvey Dent, with his position openly and publicly fighting crime, is the polar opposite of Batman, a secretive, anonymous vigilante - they are two sides of the same coin, with the possibility of one becoming the other in the right (or wrong) circumstances. The film also looks beautiful, in no small part due to Nolan's use of IMAX cameras for key scenes, including The Joker's thrilling bank-heist introduction and the action-packed Gotham freeway chase. Hanz Zimmer's eerie and layered score also deserves a mention - this is not the epic, orchestral sound he made for the rise of a hero in Batman Begins, but a dark and disturbing musical accompaniment for a hero's fall. Where The Dark Knight fails is in one sub-par sequence that threatens to de-rail the whole film. Everything from the hostages on bomb-rigged boats to Batman's final confrontation with the Joker is over-blown, over-acted and thoroughly unnecessary. The film would be much better off if this sequence was deleted entirely, if the joker was dealt with more swiftly, then we could progress directly to the film's fine conclusion. Thankfully, the Nolans (Christopher and Jonathan) and David Goyer do redeem themselves for this silly, muddy segment with a brilliant, well-acted, tragic and emotional finale that ties off the story in fine fashion. So The Dark is not a perfect superhero film. Its actually debatable when a film becomes this dark and full of allegory and symbolism whether it can really be considered part of the same family as Superman, or X-Men, or even its series predecessor Batman Begins. The Dark Knight is really a crime-thriller with a heavy dose of almost Shakespearean tragedy thrown in. By throwing off the shackles of the superhero blockbuster, Nolan has allowed his series to mature, to comment on serious and relevant issues to the modern world. Christopher Nolan has created a very smart, rich, and exciting thriller that is as different to Batman Begins as is possible to be. There's very little to criticise apart from that misjudged, flabby sequence towards the end, and the film is technically superb. I just hope Nolan cheers up a bit in The Dark Knight Rises (though the trailers released thus far appear to make this unlikely) - the depressing hero movie trend is drawing to a close, and it would be nice to end his Batman series on an optimistic note.",1
1019,"Amazing and mind blowing, the weakest acting was actually Christian Bale (keeping in mind that he was still amazing). What I'm trying to say is that there were no weak actors. To silly reviewers who rated this movie a ZERO, but only those who based their score on the amount of sadism and horrific scenes. The only thing I agree on with you is, that the age restriction/certificate should have been bumped up to +15. Otherwise, I think your reviews are pointless. Apart from that, the original Batman is a dark story (comic) which portrays pain and suffering in the exact same way or even more horrifyingly in the comic book! This is not a superhero movie for a 10 year old. Its a memoir for comic book fans and an amazing crime-thriller action movie experience for all else. It does an amazing job at showing people the Batman universe. If you expect rainbows and unicorns and magical endings, don't watch this. This is a naked and bared view of what the real world is like...and what really happens in it, but luckily for the people of Gotham, they have their fictional character who protects them. In real life all we have is jokers.",1
1020,"The sequel to Batman Begins, The Dark Knight  where Batman fights crime in Gotham with the enemy now being the Joker he takes help from Commissioner Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent to stop crime and save the city.",1
1021,"The Dark Knight is even better than Batman Begins. This film is totally the best Batman movie of all time, the best superhero movie of all time, the best movie of the year, and one of the greatest movies of all time.",1
1022,"Brilliant direction/production, amazing screenplay and unforgettable performances! Heath Ledger is the BEST JOKER and the best actor of his generation. No way you can deny it. He was visceral, he embodied Joker and was stunning! Real MASTERPIECE!",1
1023,"One of the best comic movies, ever. Of course the outstanding performance of Heath Ledger will be the memento of this movie, but even without the Joker the movie was amazing. Bale felt more like a Batman than the first movie and Harvey was very well portrayed.",1
1024,"The best Superhero movie ever made isn't saying enough. The Dark Knight pleases both aesthetically and emotionally. Nolan does it again by creating a film so deep and emotional that one cannot believe it is a Batman film. Heath Ledger is outstanding as the Joker, and deserves all the awards he won for the role. This is a fantastic film, for anyone who wants to see a good movie, not just comic book fans.",1
1025,"One of the best and most entertaining comic book/action movies of all time. Ledger's Joker is the movies most memorable aspect and one of the best movie characters of the decade. Perhaps the movie ends a little weaker than it starts, The Dark Knight is however is an awesome movie.",1
1026,"The Dark Night jump starts into a very action filled, drama with twists and turns to keep the viewer on their feet. The villain really captures the audiences in his psychotic behaviour and terrorising plots. Heath Ledger brings The Joker alive and deserved his posthumous Academy Award. Really a good movie, but not too happy, one must be ready to take a ride though the rough.",1
1027,"If you saw this movie, you can now be certain that Batman is not for children. This takes Batman to a whole new level. And people who don't understand that think that this movie was all hype about Heath being dead or just being another flashy piece of crap. Well let me remind you, sir, that this movie was taken from a loving childish comic superhero and funny and goofy nemesis. And this movie just totally back handed the hell out of me for ever thinking Batman was childish. BRAVO MR. NOLAN BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.",1
1028,"This movie is phenomenal. It has everything any action movie lover could ever want in a movie. You have great action scenes, unbelievable performances from Heath Ledger and Christian Bale, and great directing.",1
1029,"Thrilling stuff abides here. With a magnificent interpretation of the Joker making his debut (played by Ledger very well), coupled with great effects, interesting cinematography and nail-biting action and suspense, the Dark Knight is a sequel which really works and is, if anything, even better than its predecessor and is probably the best Batman film to date.",1
1030,"Hands down the best comic book movie ever made.  Can it or will it hang on to that title, only time will tell.  This was the last film I saw at a midnight screening before swearing ever doing that sort of thing again and I even saw it a few hours later the next day.  It was the first film ever to successfully use viral advertising and I still remember receiving a call at work from a guy claiming he was kidnapped by a clown before a gunshot, maniacal laugh and then a dial tone.  Who knew a Hollywood film would make a case for the war on terrorism and the Bush doctrine?  Who knew that someone would come along and make Jack Nicholson look like an amateur?  Heath Ledger did such a fantastic job that, even before the release of the film, people were talking Oscar.  Who knows if The Dark Knight Rises will dethrone this one day, with Nolan behind it, it definitely is a possibility.",1
1031,"TDK isn't just a great comic book movie, it's a great movie period. Christopher Nolan left off a good starting point for TDK because of what happened at the end of BB. Gordan talking about escalation and showing the Joker card to Batman. All these things happen in TDK. The story is very compelling with the Joker as his plan is to unmask Batman or people will die.  Joker's a Villain that is all about chaos and anarchy. He wants to turn the good people in Gotham bad. Deep down he feels everybody will turn on there morals in the right situations. At the beginning of the film Bruce Wayne thinks he can stop being Batman because of the help of Gotham DA Harvey Dent cleaning up the streets and the Mob. Bruce gets a glimmer of hope to get back with Rachael Dawes, but because of the escalation of criminals and villains in the city Bruce must continue being Batman. Now even though the main plot involved the Joker, the actual story was about the rise and fall of Harvey Dent . The cast was excellent as of course Heath did outstanding. Christian Bale was good again, Gary Oldman was I think pretty underated as he had a bigger role in this one. Also Aaron Eckhart was very underated to me because he kind of had to play two roles in this. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and pretty much everybody else gives good performances as well.For the most part everything in this film is realistic including  the Two-Face visual and make up effect. The story is a bit darker this time and the film takes place more in Gotham City which is Chicago. That environment gives it a realistic feel. The soundtrack mostly of the Joker theme creates the tone for the film and there's a few other good tracks that create some of the mood for the film. The soundtrack good for the most part.Despite there being 4 villains being Joker, Salvitore Maroni, Harvey Two- Face, Scarecrow and a criminal mob accountant named Lau and just all these other characters ,I thought that nobody was ever forced or the plot. The pacing was excellent despite the film running for 2hrs 24min of screen time and it never got slow or boring for me despite it being 144 min. So the length of the film didn't bother me. The only negatives of the film are Batman's voice , which was just a bit to growly for me and also the fight scenes such as the nightclub scene and the peice with the two boats. The scenes weren't bad but not great. So after the negative things I have said about TDK, there's definately not enough to derail the film in any way. TDK haves a good story and great plot lines, great character development and for the most part haves pretty good action. I rate this movie a 9.5/10 stars*.",1
1032,Chris Nolan is a god and The Dark Knight is proof of my statement it has a story that has kept me thinking for 3 years scene stealing performances by Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart and a captivating score it is the film of the generation. 10 out of 10,1
1033,"Everything about this film is flawless and perfect with everything from its memorability to its strong performances - particularly Heath Ledger, its pitch perfect plot and like the first film, its dark tone. The Dark Knight Rises better be nothing short of amazing!",1
1034,awesome movie! the complexity of this movie has left me breathless. you don't get more characterization and intelligent plots than Batman: the dark knight.,1
1035,"I was completely blown away. It's probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen. The movie did have a lot of hype and expectations and to be honest, I think it exceeded them.Heath Ledger was pitch perfect as the Joker. His magic pencil trick was um, quite effective, let's just say. Cackling and twitching, odd mannerisms ahoy, Ledger completely becomes the Killer Clown from Hell. No one's going to remember Jack Nicholson after this one. The one recurring thought I had walking out of the theater was how unfortunate it was that we wouldn't see his incredible talent again in the inevitable third feature.Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent was also excellent. As other reviews have already said, he is the White Knight to Batman's Dark Knight. The entire central plot is pretty much designed to channel this man's fall from grace. When you first see the full reveal of Two Face's face, it's hard not to gasp. The CGI/make-up for Two Face is how he should always look, it's iconic and grotesque and realistic all at the same time.At a running time of 2 and a half hours, this is ostensibly a rather long movie, yet it never felt that way to me. Probably the fastest 2 and a half hours I've spent in the theaters. From the opening bank robbery to the sobering finale, I was completely captivated by this epic crime tale from Chris Nolan. Yes, this is not simply a feel good superhero movie like Iron Man (which I enjoyed a lot), but an honest to God HEAT-esque crime drama. For some people, this may not be a good thing. They may complain that it wasn't light hearted enough, that it was disturbing to peer into the heart of darkness in a city without hope. For those people, yes... please go elsewhere. Maybe go watch Mamma Mia. For the rest of us, The Dark Knight is a night to remember. This should've won Best Picture at the Oscars. What other superhero film can you actually say that about? What Christopher Nolan did with Batman and The Joker is simply the stuff of legend. You can't just look at it as a comic book movie, you can't just look at it as an action flick, you can't just look at it as a crime drama... it's a mindblowing masterpiece of cinema. Nolan took a franchise that had become known for ""Chill out, bird boy!"" and somehow managed to craft a dark epic that would become the third highest grossing film of all time. To make that sort of herculean effort with minimal CGI in today's environment... the man is simply a visionary genius.And Heath Ledger... what is there left to say about Heath Ledger? He didn't win the Oscar because he died. It wasn't a sympathy vote. He deserved it, by portraying The Joker in a way wholly unlike anything we'd ever seen before. **** Cesar Romero, **** Jack Nicholson, and **** Mark Hamill. Ledger will always be The Joker now. So many quotable lines, and even a second villain that felt natural and meshed with the plot. Who could forget that brilliant hospital scene with our first glimpse at Two Face? The way Nolan teased at it, turning his head away at just the right moment to heighten the suspense. And then the actual reveal, and hearing the gasps in the audience. Just great iconic moments.Another iconic scene: the interrogation room. What a wonderful way to subvert the traditional interrogation. Start it in darkness, but then shift into bright light, contrasting the white room with the blackness of Batman. Also reflecting the two warring sides of Two Faces. The Batman pummels the Joker, yet somehow still ends up being helpless while the Joker is holding all the cards. This isn't the sort of stuff you expect from a superhero action film. That's why it's so wonderful. Just as the Joker turned Gotham upside down, this film has completely turned its genre upside down. My favorite scene is the ending monologue from Commissioner Gordon: ""Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector... a Dark Knight."" BAM. The title card finally comes onscreen. If that didn't affect you in some manner after witnessing the last 2 and a half hours, you're just not human.",1
1036,"I was aware that this film was something of great importance. And it was, but it wasn't good enough. I liked the Joker, he was a much more effective villain than what I saw of the Scarecrow and Bane. Bruce Wayne didn't seem to have much of an impact on me, but he certainly had quite a few things to say, whether they were mildly significant or extremely amusing. It was dark and thrilling, but there were a few things in here that just made it feel silly. I enjoyed the sociological aspect of choosing between two boats and the way it didn't play on the assumption that when things happened, it wasn't for money. Amazing set design, would've liked to see more contribution from Wayne, good interaction between different characters and the rapid shifting between scenes is a real problem. Still, it was fascinating and was glad I saw it.",1
1037,"The Dark Night is an amazing movie! It is the best Batman movie I have seen so far, the plot is great and so are the special effects but the show-stealer is Heath Ledger as The Joker. Ledger nails the role as he fully embodies the villain and gives The Joker a seat on the list of greatest villains. The acting is pretty good (Joker especially) and overall The Dark KNight is a joyride that will keep you in for it till the end. SCore: 9.0 out of 10.",1
1038,"Wow. Just wow. And I thought Batman Begins was excellent. This... this piece of art... its PHENOMENAL!! From the scale, to the acting, the atmosphere, the music, the action, it's all art. I have not experienced this level of greatness in the cinema for a long time. This film is the darkest Batman, as well as one of the darkest, violent and gripping films, ever made. In short the film surpasses the hype for a comic superhero flicks. Acting & dialogues were so great especially the late Heath Ledger who stole the show plus the brilliant minded director C. Nolan brings the show spectacularly gripping scenes that makes this movie a truly epic from start to finish. In short, it's a masterpiece. One that will knock you out of your seat. It is the best Batman film ever, the best superhero film ever and one of the best film ever made.",1
1039,"It's a master-piece. Heath Ledger and Christian Bale have made not a batman sequel, but an original and thrilling movie that consist of events that are in the course of human nature. A hero that Gotham needs, but not at the moment, Bruce Wayne is there to save Gotham from the Joker, who is clever enough to twist the tables. After the White Knight, or Harvey Dent falls to the pressure of being what The Joker considers to be the Dark Knight, it is revealed that that's what he wanted all along. Not to get in a fist-fight with Batman, but to turn Gotham's white knight into a tragic figure that dies due to the want for revenge. Not only is this a great film, but Ledger's legendary performance. It differs greatly from earlier portrayals of The Joker. In the end, he is a sadistic, clever, and brutal character that comes from Ledger directly. The dialogue is perfect. The effects are even more well done and attribute to the overall look of the film. Deep down, physiology  of the brain gets the best of Dent who turned into a monster thanks to the Joker's numerous problems that need to be solved by Gordon, who is played expertly by Gary Oldman. The cinematography is brilliant. The props, the city...everything. What we learn is that sometimes the hero isn't who we think it is. There's always people who believe in good, and people who believe in the bad. What it comes down to, is whether or not you'd love  a great movie like The Dark Knight.  A+",1
1040,"Only movie I have ever watched entirely while literally sitting on the edge of my seat. The Dark Knight isn't just the greatest comic movie of all time - it is certainly one of the best film ever. Everything is perfectly stitched, the powerful dialogue, the perfect soundtrack, the astounding acting, the theme and the vibe of what Batman really is. This is my favorite movie to date.",1
1041,"Easily one of the best superhero films made with excellent story, acting and tone. Superb.",1
1042,"The Dark Knight is the successor to the 2005 ""Batman Begins"". It more than surpasses its predecessor in both storyline direction and overall appeal. The storyline includes two most popular batman villains The Joker and Two-Face (who actually starts out as a good guy in this movie). Many people began watching this movie first before they watched Batman begins, yes its that good. Out of all the character development and acting, Heath Ledger of all actors take the award for the best role. Not only did he deliver a cunning character display making the Joker the most diabolical and popular villain within the movie but his role as the Joker put all other actors who played Joker in the past to shame. Regardless of whether you have seen the first movie or not, this movie lives up to the name and is the sole reason why Christopher Nolan's batman franchise is considered to be ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"".",1
1043,"One could say flawless, and one would not be too far from the truth.With one of the best ensemble performances in a blockbuster, The Dark Knight catapults itself away from its rebooted predecessor, 'Batman Begins"" into one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.We see Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) return as the caped crusader, dealing with copycats is the least of his worries, as he has been dealt countless obstacles and now tragedies, and now the emergence (and most haunting incarnation) of the Joker, played by the ever talented and late Heath Ledger.What is so intriguing about Ledgers Joker is his simplicity, he is a man not quite easy to please, with no lust for money or anything of that nature, he simply wants to 'introduce a little anarchy'.We are also introduced to District Attorney Harvey Dent, attempting to lawfully clean up Gotham's streets through imprisoning the kingpins and criminals that occupy the city.What ensues is glorious set pieces, but too CGI laden, they look realistic to the point that it is believable in front of you. We also see the introduction of the BatPod, a new vehicle used by our vigilante which again, sets up some wonderful scenes involving this new machine. The tone of the film has definitely shifted to a much more sombre and gritty tale compared to 'Begins', adding more emotional depths to each character, no stone seems to have been left unturned when it comes to outlining each main cast member in terms of us knowing exactly why they are there and what is going on in their life. It's remarkable to have such depth for so many characters, but we do care for them, and when tragedy strikes its difficult not to feel for the characters on screen.The writing is excellent, especially for the Joker, he runs away easily with the most defining moments of the film , whether he's doing magic tricks or dressing up as a nurse, his persona is set in particular scene when he's trying to detonate a bomb, I believe the seconds to follow where completely unscripted, and Ledger just went with the character he created, utter brilliance.Theres also a standout performance for Bale himself as Batman, he has a lot on his plate considering the public don't quite know what to think of him, hero? Villain? He clearly does doubt himself in many moments throughout the film which can all be portrayed through Bales superb acting.Alfred (Michael Caine) returns as Bruces faithful butler, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) returns as Bruces genius friend and new head of Wayne Enterprises, and Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend and love interest Rachel Dawes.While the despair is in heaps here, there are a few comedic moments, particularly with the Joker, but this is a new benchmark in superhero realism, and this film hits heights that were perhaps too hard to follow (I reviewed this AFTER reviewing TDKR).Its epic on so many elements and wasn't afraid to drastically change the pace, with a successful outcome, The Dark Knight can be seen as unbelievable, and exasperatingly good on all accounts.It will put a smile on that face...",1
1044,"Heath Ledger's impressive role as the Joker was of non-stop scares and his villainous crime/tension helped The Dark Knight outdo the other Batman films. If you don't like this, increase your sense of suspense.",1
1045,"The people who say that the movie is ""overrated"", those people are incredibly braindead. How couldnÂ´t they like this amazing and extremely superhero movie?! Director Christopher Nolan makes a good job, his vision is better and Christian Bale portrayed very well The Batman. This is how Batman really is.",1
1046,"Lets get straight to the point. The plot is set out to perfection. it doesnt rush itself and tells the story brilliantly. The way it elegently portrays the jokers sick humor when threatning the 2 boats containing prisoners and citizens and not to mention the tension when one boat has to blow up the other leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The film also shows  that batman is shown not be a unbeatable hero and has a side of realism that christopher nolan directs really well. But my favourite thing about the dark knight is the excellent acting of the late heath ledger and his role of the joker is quirky, sinister and what makes the dark knight one of my favourite films of all time.",1
1047,"The Dark Knight is definitely one of the darkest Superhero films of all-time. What Nolan has accomplished with this series is nothing short of remarkable. Some people say the movie is too long but hey, most great movies are. Heath Ledger's role as the Joker was fascinating. How he was able to totally and completely transform into the ultimate villain shows what an incredible actor he was. He was able to perfectly capture exactly why the Joker is the best villain ever in exposing the dynamic between the Joker and Batman's relationship. Christian Bale and the rest of the cast was phenomenal as well and the acting was superb from top to bottom. There were a few disappointments. The first was that Katie Holmes was by Maggie Gyllenhaal. It breaks up the continuity from the first film and let's face it, Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't attractive at all. Are you seriously telling me there weren't any other pretty and talented brunettes in Hollywood who could replace Katie? If you're going to replace someone in a film series, which I truly hate doing, always upgrade. Secondly, I was really disappointed with Two-Face's quick departure. In the canon, other than the joke, Two-Face is the ultimate villain against Batman. Yes, it felt right in the movie so I can't hold that against it but as a fan of the lore, it was a bit of a disappointment for sure. The last thing is that the plot felt moreunrealistic in this film than in the last one. Most of the major plot points rely on unreliable or fantastical elements. These are all within my suspension of disbelief for the film but Batman Begins didn'tcontain as much of this. All in all, amazing movie and truly the best superhero sequel of all-time. RIP Heath Ledger.",1
1048,"This movie continues the story about the infamous Batman, a.k.a Bruce Wayne. A new mob has formed and the new D.A is Harvey Dent. The movie begins with a bank robbery by an unknown group of robbers. Later into the robbery, it is revealed that these robbers are working for the Joker. It is also revealed that this is one of the Mob's banks. Each robber, disguised in clown masks, is given an order to kill their partner when are finished with their job. That leaves two clowns standing, one which is revealed to be the Joker himself. A stolen bus is used to carry away the bags of money. When Lieutenant Jim Gordon arrives on the scene, they find video of the Joker taking off his clown mask. This scene kind of points out who the main antagonist of the movie will be. Gordon also discovers that this money is indeed ""mob"" money.    You soon find out the members of the mob, when the Joker interrupts one of their meetings. He states what is his and should be the mob's objective: ""to kill the Batman"". Later, he announces that if the ""real"" Batman does not turn himself in, then there will be deaths starting ""tonight"". The first deaths are Commissioner Loeb, and a judge who formerly tried members of the mob. Harvey Dent, the District Attorney, was attempted to be killed. The next day, a death threat against the mayor is made in the obituary section of the Gotham newspaper. Gordon and his team stand guard as the memorial for Commissioner Loeb is being held. The honor guards turn out to be the Joker's men and they all attempt to shoot the mayor as he speaks, but Gordon pushes him down and is shot.    Barbara Jim's wife, is notified that he is dead. After those deaths, Bruce Wayne decides to adhere to the Joker's wishes and turn himself in. When Harvey Dent holds a press conference, the Batman is revealed to all to be Harvey Dent. Of course, this is incorrect but Harvey announces that he is, before Bruce can say it himself. Harvey is then attempted to be captured by the Joker while he is being transported by a Detective Ramirez. This fails, and Harvey and his girlfriend Rachel Dawes are transported by cops Ramirez and Wuerst in separate cars, while the Joker is captured by a supposedly deceased Jim Gordon.    Harvey and Rachel never get home however, and are instead sent to separate locations in the city. The Joker soon escapes from holding, but before he does so he gives the location of Rachel and Harvey, switching them around, telling them that they are strapped to drums of gas, rigged to blow. Harvey and Rachel are given a phone to communicate with. Batman goes for Rachel, while Gordon and his team go for Harvey. Batman ends up saving Harvey, but not before half of his face is burnt by the exploding drums. Later, the Joker announces that the city will be his in a matter of hours. Gordon sends a ferry of prisoners and a ferry full of civilians away from Gotham. It is revealed however that the ferrys are rigged to explode and each ferry is given the other ferrys detonator as part of a social experiment by the Joker to see who will blow each other up first. The location of the Joker is found and Batman soon captures him. Harvey kills the cop that drove him to his location, based on the flip of a coin, and captures Jim's family.  Jim's son is almost killed before Batman shows up, unintentionally killing Harvey. Batman then tells Gordon that he and his men will have to has him, and that marks the end of the movie.    This movie was great, with an excellent plot, terrific villains, and characters you really care for. Even if yo are not a Batman fan, it is still a must see movie. Director Christopher Nolan once again shows his superb movie making skills in the latest installment of the Batman series: ""The Dark Knight"".",1
1049,"My favorite movie of all time, the performances were perfect. I enjoyed every minute. It is a great movie and I have watched it many many times. Best Batman movie ever.",1
1050,"Why isn't there an 11 rating on this thing! The dark knight is absolutely brilliant, it's one of the greatest movies ever!! It's just so awesome, I mean, seriously, the action is really amazing and exciting, the joker is awesome, the acting is really good, the special effects are very good and the story-line is fantastic. The dark knight is the best super hero movie, by far, if you haven't already watched it, you should definitely watch it, I truly recommend it!",1
1051,"The Dark Knight a story about one man's struggle with his conflicting ideas of justice. It is raw, emotional, and bold as it presents its own twist on Batman, and ultimately, on the common misconception of a superhero and what he stands for.",1
1052,This movie is interesting for me. Action scene was so cool. Bat man doesn't have surper power. He is just human. But it is good. That's why this movie is good. But this movie is a little long.,1
1053,"This may be the best Superhero film ever made. Batman Begins was a brilliant film but Chris Nolan really brought things up a notch with The Dark Knight. The dark and realistic tone is nailed once again thanks to some brilliant direction and writing and once again, everyone plays their parts perfectly, both the returning cast and the newcomers. And of course the most notable newcomer has to be Heath Ledger as the Joker. His performance is one of the biggest reasons as to why this film is so amazing, Heath's portrayal of the Joker is the best of them all and it is such a same that Heath is no longer with us. The scenes that involve just The Batman and The Joker are some of the best scenes not just in the film but in cinema in the last few years. The Joker is so genius and evil that it is almost impossible to stop watching when he is on screen, many people say The Joker is the best thing about this film and you cannot blame them. Another brilliant aspect of this film is how thought provoking it is, some scenes truly made me think about what I would do if I was in the same position as the characters, even after the film has stopped. Overall it's hard to fault this film, it may have a few slow and boring parts like Batman Begins but its all relevant to the story and just gets outweighed by everything else. If you watch superhero films for just fun and excitement then The Dark Knight may be a bit too deep for you, but for everyone else this film is an absolute must see!",1
1054,"The Dark Knight is monumental. One of the biggest fan favorites of the decade. Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all-time as The Joker amidst engrossing chaos. It may be ever-so-slightly overrated, especially with an average portrayal of Batman from Christian Bale.",1
1055,"This movie deserves the hype.  Heath Ledger plays the best joker we've seen thus far on the big screen, and even in death his legacy lives on.  I didn't like that Rachel died but seeing as she wasnt in the comics (as far as i know) i guess she had to sometime.  Harvey Dent's character had some pretty great development as we saw his transformation into the scarecrow, and the entire thing was very believable.  I don't watch many movies but this is a must see!",1
1056,"I reviewed Dark Knight a while ago, and messed up a little. This is my new review. First off, I would give this a 9.75. Almost near perfect. Probably one of the best superhero movies ever. Acting is good. Everyone does a great job. Score is epic. It's just amazing coming from Hans Zimmer. Story and action sequences are great. It'll keep you watching. Plus the visuals are pretty good to. Overall, this is a great superhero movie that all superhero fans, and everyone else should go and see.",1
1057,"This was a solid film. It is clear why other people thought this was excellent, but it left me a little indifferent. I just don't think I will ever be that intrigued by the entire Batman story. However, it has a very good performance by Ledger, good editing and music.",1
1058,"I never really paid much attention to Batman Begins but I went into the Dark Knight knowing the backstory and my god! TDK is easily one of the best superhero films ever. It is dark, gritty and it has balls. Gotham City's crime rate has significantly decreased since the rise of Batman but there are still some ends that need tying. A new threat in the form of the Joker has emerged from the criminal underworld, a ruthless and utterly off the wall psychopath. Bruce is also having personal problems in the form of Rachel and the new district attorney Harvey Dent A.K.A Two-Face. Cristopher Nolan should direct all superhero films!",1
1059,"I hear many people bashing this move as ""overrated"" or ""just because heath ledger died"". I believe this is a simple case of people that love to hate whats popular. This movie is not overrated, it deserves the hype it gets, ESPECIALLY heath ledgers performance, whether he died or not. (R.I.P.), his performance is absolutely phenomenal. Christian bale's, Morgan Freeman's, and Micheal Caine's performances aren't bad by any measure but they are out-shined greatly by Mr. Ledger. This is one of the few movies in recent memory that is made with passion and not just to make a quick buck off a franchise or gimmicky ""3D"" effects. I'm not even a fan of batman and I really enjoy this movie.  do yourself a favor see this if you haven't already.",1
1060,"Nolan destroys the preconceptions of what a Superhero movie can be. After watching this movie I was blown away. It topped the first film in everything. The movie was very deep, dark, and a masterpiece. Heath ledger gives the finest career of his life and possibly best performance of all time. The chemistry in the interrogation room between Batman and The Joker was chemistry at best. The dialogue was dialogue at its finest. People can hate, but people who hate like Transformers. The Score was beautiful by Hans Zimmer. My all time favorite film. 5/5",1
1061,"Is humanity worth saving? Are we truly good people or are those smiles we wear every day a denial mechanism we use to cope with a universe that remains apathetic regardless of our needs? If given the opportunity, would we remove our hypocritical cheery war paint and tell the universe to stick it were it belongs?Needless to say, this is a superb Hollywood popcorn circus irresistible to most. Tour-de-force dramatic performances by all, and specially by one. A director delivering visuals as one does at the top of their career. A marriage of cinematography and visual effects so perfect that is sure to outlast any tinsel town relationship. But all of these things have been said already by better wordsmiths than myself.What has remained in my thoughts long past its multiple viewings was the philosophical exploration of good versus evil.The hypocrisy of human existence. We are raised by our parents and society to be good. Religion certainly tells us so, even if it involves killing others, the goal is ultimately to be ""good."" Hell, on TV, the bad eventually gets it, and the good guy walks away with the blond. We all have to be good... Or do we?Enter the Joker. The catalyst for an experiment in truth... If given the opportunity, if there was no lock with a key, If you could pull the pin on all those people you smile at every day but wish they were three feet under water, would you? No one needs to know. No one needs to care. You know you only do it because someone else is keeping scores on you.That is the beauty of the Joker. He points out perfectly that Evil is not so much the guy with the guns. True Evil is the guy that allows you to reveal yourself exactly as you are with no one keeping tabs. Then, we'll see what we are made of.Let's keep things in perspective. This is, as I said earlier, the ultimate Hollywood cupcake. Delicious no matter how you bite it. And, as such, it has to leave a good after taste.The Joker is in fact proven wrong. And the beauty of this, if you pay close attention, is that Batman has very little, if anything, to do with this. His main goal is to stop the Joker from carrying on his mad experiments on the human mind, and so he does as the hero that he is. But the Joker's tests are answered face forward by the people themselves. It turns out when you open the doors to the asylum the crazy folks are simply normal... At least in Hollywood.I still wonder, though. If this wasn't Hollywood, and the Joker was around to give us that switch on that boat, what would you really do? Who are you without that fake smile you put on every day?",1
1062,The Dark Knight is quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time. This movie is much darker than any other superhero movie to date and Heath Ledger's performance is absolutely stunning. Bale is great once again and Christopher Nolan has shown us how great of a director he is once again.,1
1063,Batman Beginsâ,1
1064,"It is rare I am giving this movie a 10.But this is probably the best movie I have seen in a long long time.Heath Ledger performance was excellent, Oscar worthy indeed.There are still some slight fault in the movie, story line lacks coherence in some part but I can hardly fault Christopher Nolan for squeezing everything in a 2 hour film.Definitely worth buying the Blueray and rewatch over again.",1
1065,Probably one of the greatest movies I have ever watched in my life. The Joker in this movie is one of the most bad-ass villains in history The acting is amazing as well as the dark tone of the movie!,1
1066,"I don't have much history with the batman comics or movies, but I know a good movie when I see one. This is probably one of the best super hero movies to date in my opinion. It has a lot of action in it and batman doing his thing, but it also carries a surprising amount of depth in it's character development. We all know the joker is great, but I personally like Harvey Dent the most.",1
1067,"The greatest super hero movie of all time. From the opening scene I was hooked on the style and performances in this film. Of course it all revolves around Ledger and his amazing performance as the Joker. Ledger eats up the screen in every scene he is in, and his character sets the dark tones for the movie. A lot of critics had issues with some of the other characters in this film, specifically Dent. But once again i love what Nolan does with his villains. He gives Two Face such a nice arc in this story, and proper motivation for what he becomes at the end. I can't say enough about the way this movie looks and feels, there are so many memorable scenes in this movie. I will digress.",1
1068,"Simply put, this is the greatest superhero movie ever made. It is the best on so many different levels, no other superhero movie has such prominent actual thought provoking moments, no other superhero movie has such a captivatingly unhinged villain, and really no other superhero more is this thrilling. It builds on the promise of Batman Begins and achieves heights few other movies can hope of achieving.",1
1069,"Christopher Nolan's directing mastery is exemplified in this brilliant interpretation of one of the most beloved DC Comics' characters, completing its legacy by intertwining the brooding and dark tone defined by the sadistic and unbelievably electrifying performance by Heath Ledger with plot complexity that only Nolan could deliver. The Dark Knight is that rare one-timer that strides and devastates any apparent boundaries of its genre that has been long-avoided by film junkies because of the immaturity and previous filmic failures such as 'Batman and Robin'. Nolan has created not only the best superhero film ever, one of the best films in existence. Get ready for a rollercoaster ride into the true roots of Batman by exploring themes of tragedy, bitter loss, chaos and the horrrifying descent into the realm of madness. The Dark Knight succeeds in all levels, and is the shining example of Christopher Nolan's unprecedented storytelling prowess.",1
1070,"This is the best movie ever nuff said, Christopher Nolan does an amazing job directing this. It deserved al the money that it made. I can't wait for the new one coming out this mont it is going to be amazing.",1
1071,"The Dark knight hurts me literally not. Not because the picture is bad, it is just substantially good. A rare cinematic experience which makes me upbeat and I do feel lively. It is sharp, destructive and epic. Like what the critics have generally mentioned in their reviews- the Dark Knight is not entirely a superhero movie, it is too an epic crime thriller. The film has the elements to be a great show. Editing shows me perfection; they are sharp, strong, and impregnable. Hans Zimmer's powerful score adds up to the excitement of the action scenes - rightfully being composed and could wrap it up that to some great extent, some 'Power' values of the movie clearly belong to the music. The cinematography is beautiful; I witnessed gloomy images of Gotham City being captured. Some shots in the movie are undeniably dark, but it is well blended with beauty. I would say, a beauty in a moody mood. Its screenplay which was being written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan, Johathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer is a Tour De Force, a brilliant spark. In my opinion, the script, alongside with the performances, clears to me that the movie is a superhero classic. First of all, dialogues are brightly great; I am literally 'High' after paying my focus for the dialogues. Too many memorable lines for one film! They are like ""Why so serious?"", ""Let's introduce a little anarchy"", ""How about a magic trick?"" and much more. Im real, those dialogues punched me in the face. Well consisted of a complex storyline, devoid of clichés - the writers' top notch writing ability is very much in evidence. The Dark Knight is an acting masterclass. The actors for the film, truly delivered, I mean every single one them. True acting talents in them and Nolan's impeccable direction are proven. Christian Bale hits the right note playing both Bruce Wayne and Batman, Michale Caine is beautifully artistic, Morgan Freeman is as calm as hourglass, Aaron Eckhart is charismatic and engaging , Gary Oldman is honest and Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfectly fine . Through honesty I claimed that each of the actors in the movie played their 'A' game. But how about Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker? I wouldn't want to repeat the past comments which was being triggered by critics on his performance, but I gonna say this - Heath Ledger is not Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, he is The Joker. I repeat, Heath Ledger is NOT Heath Ledger , he IS The Joker. I would not choose to have the notion that the film is entirely an entertaining action packed, comic book cinema, I think Christopher Nolan goes beyond that. Try bother to pay close attention to the film, one would see hidden, interesting messages in the movie, and I think, in my opinion, many of them is being injected through The Joker. For example, in the conversation between Harvey Dent/Two-Face and The Joker at a hospital, The Joker talks about events which could be labelled as reality , he talks about how things will move at ease when things go according to plan, and that makes the scene very exciting to watch but surely too, backed with great acting by both. My belief is this - not only that The Dark Knight is an entertaining epic cinema, it is also a fun piece to interpret. Nolan's second Batman motion picture is easily one of the greatest superhero films ever made and it is also one of the best films of the year. Finely shot, well-acted, accurately complex and freshly interpreted, The Dark Knight is statuesque. (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/AlexDesmall)(http://facebook.com/alex.desmall)",1
1072,"""The Dark Knight"". The greatest superhero film ever made. It holds no boundaries. Christopher Nolan knows what he is doing with the Batman character and should not quit while he is ahead. Nolan is not the only person to credit for this incredible movie, Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker has redefined the role of the antagonist in any movie. Ledger plays the role so well and if he were still here, he would still be getting praised for his work. This movie is nothing short of excellent and i know fans and critics alike cannot wait for it's highly anticipated sequel, ""The Dark Knight Rises"".",1
1073,there is nothing to say about this movie . a superhero movie where you see characters & story has more depth than action is very rare . Heath ledger has done a job that can be done by only the greatest actors of all time . it was 2 & a half hour of pleasure . this is the kind of story telling that was missing in all superhero franchises . the psychological values of the character was great . it was a great combination of everything .,1
1074,"The Dark Knight is a dark, well-acted, and unforgettable installment in the Batman series. The only issue I had with the film is that there is way too much talking.",1
1075,Quite simply a technical and emotional masterpiece that leaves you wanting more. The best superhero movie ever made but also simply one of the best movies ever made in general. Nolan is definitely the best director ever and he proves it again and Ledger's performance is absolutely stunning. Not forgetting Bale who has simply taken Batman and took the character to another level. Astonishing. Excellent.,1
1076,"The list of things that make this film so great is too large to write. In short, I have never seen a comic book film that brought so much suspense and story-driven action as this one. The characters are very realistic, even the Joker, which is arguably one of the best performances in film history. The movie never wanders or becomes distracted to the point where it is torn away from its intended destination, which you are unaware of. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time waiting to see what that was.",1
1077,"Ultimately the joker steals the show,, unbelievable acting by late Heath Ledger,,, hats off to him.But at last batman makes an needful sacrifice to defeat Joker but he didn't...........",1
1078,"The Dark Knight. There is no doubt in me that this second Batman movie from Christopher Nolan stands as out of the best movies ever made. I ain't saying that The Dark Knight is the best movie ever, mind you. But witnessed Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker, the enchating visual and the depth of the story that The Dark Knight offers, one will never argue that most people have a good time watching it. And for those who claim that they don't enjoy this caped-crusader's saga against its arch-nemesis The Joker, my question for you is: What movies that you usually watch?",1
1079,"This is probably my favorite movie of all time and especially my favorite performance by an actor. Heath Ledger makes the movie with his portrayal of the Joker. The movie is full of twists, great acting in general, emotional moments and of course moments of craziness. If you haven't watched it you should do so now!",1
1080,"This is one film I will remember for the rest of my life. If you want a happy film that is suitable for the entire family, which has a happy ending and everyone skips off happily into the sunset, you're in the wrong place. Again, if you're after a superhero film like those made by Marvel which is full of jokes and cheesy lines, just so they can show off how powerful their heroes are... you're in the wrong place. But if you want a movie which is dark, gritty, tense and has the single best portrayal of the Joker across any medium, then this is the film for you. The Dark Knight is a cinematic masterpiece. One of the best films ever made. This is not some forgettable ""popcorn movie"". And quite frankly, anyone who gives this film below an 8 wouldn't know a good movie if it hit them in the face whilst letting out thousands of fireworks. No matter what you think of DC, or of Batman - this is a well-made and wonderful film. This movie pits Batman (Christian Bale) against Heath Ledger's Joker, who has been hired by the mob to kill the Dark Knight after Batman and the GCPD have been taking their money and generally causing a nuisance of themselves. Straight away, I will say that Heath Ledger's performance is wonderful. The single best portrayal of the Joker I have ever seen - and I've played the Batman Arkham games which has Mark Hamill's Joker in, and I've seen the 1989 Batman film with Jack Nicholson's Joker in - the other two contenders to the throne of ""best Joker performance"". Ledger blows them out of the water. He puts a dark, psychopathic twist on Batman's greatest adversary, while retaining the familiarity of the character. It is one of the best acting performances of this generation, hands down. With Hans Zimmer composing the music for this film - just like he did for Batman Begins - the soundtrack for this film is amazing. I cannot stress how good and dramatic the music is, and how well it fits the scenes. It can, quite easily, stand among my other favourite musical compositions from films, video games, etc. This is a seriously awesome film. By far the best superhero film ever made, and also one of the best films ever made in general.",1
1081,"will never see something like this again.best movie of all time.the thirll in the movie when joker chases the police van and when dent goes out of the box was somthing legendry.will see it again and again",1
1082,"This film is without a doubt one of the best films I have seen in my entire life, the madness that is The Joker , with brilliant acting by Heath Ledger, made this film a masterpiece. And people saying that it is overrated and they ""tried too hard"" with it, are being absolutely ridiculous.",1
1083,"Amazing film....brilliantly acted, specially Heath Ledger's performance........very good plot. This film has changed the way we see comic book movies forever.",1
1084,"After getting warmed up with the great origin and character development in Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan, now presents us with an even better sequel. Heath Ledger is great as The Joker.  I liked Aaron Eckhart as two-face who is actually an interesting character in this franchise (unlike the Tim Burton Franchise where we seemed like a minor character given little attention). This is a great continuation of the franchise.",1
1085,"""The Dark Knight"", hands down, is fantastic. With It's great story, fantastically terrific voice acting (especially, I admired the Joker's voice acting) and bad ass actors, ""The Dark Knight"" is highly recommendable from my opinion.",1
1086,An aesthetically beautiful and well written film. The actors committed and I can tell they put their emotions into each and every scene. Thumbs up all around on this very intelligently written art piece. Easily one of my favorite films.,1
1087,"Theres nothing bad about this film at all. It had awesome technology, a worthy batman, the best joker ever, and intense action. Like one critic said, Its not your ordinary superhero movie, its better",1
1088,"This is the movie that completely redifined the way of making superheroe movies. Chris Nolan's view of Batman takes it to inimaginable levels, even further than what seen in ""Begins"".",1
1089,"A fantastic reworking of Batman. Talk about revitalizing excitement in the series. The dark tone of the movie allows them to explore a story more similar to the original comic series. And beyond the comics, the Joker's character presents one of the most sadistic, contemporary villains in modern narrative. This is an instant classic with fantastic chemistry.",1
1090,"It will leave you speechless from the beginning. Heath Ledger gave an amazing portrayal of the Joker as his facial expressions change from unseen calmness to craziness in matter of seconds. The sensational climax is stretched throughout the run time and you'll just want to watch it again just to focus on the beautiful little details. The action scenes are incredible and beautifully executed, with every move carefully planned. The Dark Knight will meet the requests of all the Batman fanatics; from the deeply characterised antagonist, the unrepeatable fearful and depressing atmosphere the Joker brings upon the city to the most beautiful Batman costumes and high-tech gadgets you could have ever imagined.",1
1091,"This film was pretty overrated and really hyped...but it was still a pretty good film. Heath Ledger's performance was spectacular, he made the Joker twisted, divine, evil, and cunning at the same time. Even a bit nuts, but that's just me. Overall, good film. Good action. Not bad.",1
1092,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in cinemas in the past 10 years or so, the set pieces and technical codes are top notch, the scale of the film is huge and the characters are so rich and diverse and brilliantly played by their respective actors. Incredible. A word on the DVD also; the sound of the film on the DVD is the best of my large collection, it's extremely well produced.",1
1093,"a phenomenal masterpiece whose creators aren't content with simply making a great comic book movie, but craft one that transcends the genre to become one of the best films this decade. http://www.facebook.com/pages/Carrie-2013-has-hemorrhoids-/154149308058300",1
1094,"One of the best movies of all time. Exciting throughout, great characters, especially the Joker, and loads of undying scenes. Apart from the action and plot, it gets a little psychological with Batman put in a moral dilemma, and also philosophical showing consequences of extreme nihilism. For me it is a huge lot better than the predecessor or the sequel, the indisputably best part of the trilogy.",1
1095,"The Dark Knight is something I don't know why gets so much praise. It's definitely an above average movie, but is this really a masterpiece as almost everyone says it is. Then when people say it's the best superhero movie ever, that's where I really get a little frustrated. First off this movie is way too long and boring and confusing at most times. I can barely understand what's going on as if I had to watch Batman Begins or a prologue in order to understand this. Plus when I hear the words Batman and superhero movie, I expect action, The Dark Knight barely has any of that, and really irritated me. I don't hate this movie, I actually have it on Blu-ray and watch it every now and then, but I will say Heath Ledger as Joker was awesome, and for me saved the movie a lot.",1
1096,"The Dark Knight is one of the greatest comic book films of all time. Heath Ledger literally becomes the Joker and he makes the whole movie with his amazing performance. But the actual movie itself is really great, it's a really compelling crime thriller with intense and exciting scenes, a fantastic story and more great performances from the rest of the cast. A true masterpiece.",1
1097,"Best movies I've seen in this year 2012 is Looper and batman the dark knight rises  ,my all time favorite movie's are  The Godfather (1972) .Taxi Driver (1976).  Carrie (1976). Scarface (1983). GoodFellas (1990) . Raging Bull (1980) .Casino (1995) there masterpiece movies, what i don't like are the silly remakes why a new carrie movie ? this is the 4th movie carrie the made it's just stupid ,Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are absolutely perfect ,they both got Oscar nominations out of it, for God sake!. Rest in peace Heath Ledger you will never be forgotten",1
1098,"AMAZING. In my book, this movie is a CLASSIC. I don't like superhero movies, and I never really found anything interesting about Batman but...this doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. It feels like a deep analysis of people's mind and goes into an almost psychological rampage of the movie. Clever, well acted (Heath Ledger's Oscar) and more importantly, I loved it. Great, great movie. A plus-plus. Classic.",1
1099,Chritopher Nolan has made dark material indeed. This thriller explores how fear can make a civilians do anything for a solution including almost killing each other. And it's almost too much for Batman to get over. The Joker is one of the best villians ever and Heath Ledger showed us how serious you can play a role thought to be a funny role however it's made as a terrifying role thanks to Heath Ledger. Events happen in ways that surprise me even when I've seen about 9 times.,1
1100,"Incredible. Just incredible. Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Aaron Eckhart's performances are the most superb I've seen since The Godfather. It's amazing how well Christopher Nolan captured the lives of these remarkable people.",1
1101,"Dark knight is one of the most spectacular movies ever created. I feel lucky to have been born in our time, now, viewing this piece of absolute art in my youth. What a perfect movie. Fantastic.",1
1102,"The Dark Knight is a brilliant movie and the direct sequel to Batman Begins after Batman had accquired a card of The Joker after a dangerous villian apparently robbed a bank. As the second movie in The Dark Knight trilogy it proves to bring Batman's arch nemisis back more dangerous and insane than ever seen before. Plot: Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)  is dedicating to protecting the peace of Gotham as the vigilante Batman. However, many have been inspired by him and are now copying his suit and killing those making him look bad after he vowed to himself never to directly kill. After his alter ego had recieved much critism, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) a growing power in the Gotham police department is very inspired by Batman changing his title to The Dark Knight as Batman disregards the law in order to preserve peace. Harvey Dent on the other hand is considered The White Knight as he preserves peace to the best of his ability while abiding by the law. The Joker (Heath Ledger) is a criminal mastermind who keeps plaguing Gotham with his sick psycotic plans to make it burn. Wayne cannot allow this and makes it his goal to make sure The Joker is stopped once and for all as he is making Gotham suffer after every move. Comparison to Batman Begins: The Dark Knight upgrades Batman's technology within his suit making him more of a badass then he already was as well as the Batmobiles ability to divide into a Batcycle. Batman also fights his arch nemesis and is already an established character whearas in Begins he was rising to heroism. Compared to Batman: The Joker is more dangerous than he was before due his coordinated attacks that aren't meant to financially fuel him, but more into watching the world burn. Batman is also more of a badass due to his more evolved Bat suit. In The Dark Knight though The Joker does not have an origin story. My opinion: This movie should be watched by anyone to witness the true wrath of the Joker and Batman's true heroism as they constantly duel their beliefs throughout the movie.",1
1103,"""Epic"" is the word for this movie! This series just keeps getting better. The Joker is exactly how I see him, ""Heath Ledger"" was going to be legend! No other super her movie even comes close, and I happen to like most of them. This is the only DC movie I like, but it`s better than all other comic movies.",1
1104,"This movie is a needle in the haystack. This movie h as too many positives.Perfect acting from heath ledger, amazing pace, amazing plot line, well developed bad guy, emotional satisfaction and soo much more. The dark knight is a movie that is almost or maybe even perfection, best batman movie and probably the best superhero movie of all time",1
1105,"""The Dark Knight"" is the crowning achievement of Nolan's Batman trilogy. Forsaking ""Batman Begins""'s ugly brown visuals with a clean, polished, modern urban look and feel, this movie sees the caped crusader pushed to his limits as he deals with a recklessly psychotic new face of terror in Gotham - the Joker. The film is dark, brisk, brooding and intense, hardly letting up a moment, and is accompanied by an eerie and haunting new music score that brilliantly emphasizes the mounting chaos rippling through the city. The action scenes are exponentially more entertaining this time around, and although Bruce Wayne's character is somewhat sidelined this time around, it's made up for by the Joker. Heath Ledger's performance as the ""agent of chaos"" is undeniably impressive - the unbridled insanity and dementedness he delivers makes the character so authentic and genuine, and the scenes between him and Batman are just so well-done that I'd consider them classic. Yeah, the conclusion does stray a bit too far with Two-Face, and the ending - although deserved - may seem a bit hokey, this is without a doubt the best ""Batman"" movie ever made.",1
1106,"I would give this a 9 because of the great acting especially from Heath ledger, and the storyline which was a masterpiece but for me there wasn't enough fight scenes.",1
1107,"Nolan's magnum opus, The Dark Knight, focuses on the psychological aspects of the characters and takes you on an unpredictable, unbelievable ride you won't soon forget.",1
1108,"Not only one of the best sequels of all-time, but one of the best films ever made. Heath Ledger did a brilliant job portraying the Joker, as did Christian Bale for playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.",1
1110,one of the best films ever made. Heath Ledgers performance as the joker is the beat peace of acting I have seen. Christian Bale was great once again as batman. the story was brilliant and well written. It is so incredible to watch the joker rise to power and batman's attempt too stop him. The way the joker rose to power was so realistic it made me wonder if someone could really do this.  commissioner Gordon and Harvey dents side  story leads to a brilliant end to what is one of the best movies ever made.,1
1111,"Best comic book movie ever made to date (2013). The darker and more realistic tone director Nolan gave Batman and this trilogy changed the way mainstream audiences saw super hero movies and made them take them seriously. Terrific plot, action scenes, pace, acting and pretty much everything. There are two things that are worth the special mention: Heath Ledger´s performance and the score by Hans Zimmer. Heath Ledger´s performance is absolutely stunning, scary and memorable. This one and his role in Brokeback Mountain are two of the best performances given by a male actor in the 00s decade. The score is just outstanding, I still listen to it to this day frequently, and the same happens with the final chapter of the trilogy. Hans Zimmer is a genius. Kudos to Nolan, he makes great film after great film.",1
1112,"This is not a blockbuster either. It is an excellent film, if not the best in special effects, if not as picturesque as they were earlier, it does not matter: Batman has essentially unlike other blockbusters is visually attractive, exciting and above all, deep and disturbing.In this sequel, our hero (Christian Bale) must face a new enemy The Joker (Heath Ledger), extremely dangerous individual, who will head to Gotham and its legal system. Batman has his faithful assistants: the butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and the scientist and his company right arm Lucius (Morgan Freeman), his old flame Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gylenhall, replacing Katie Holmes), Commissioner Gordon  Gary Oldman, thank god), and the district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who, as many know, will later become the villain Two-Face.The actors did an excellent job in his performance, but the teacher, the idol, the incomparable, glorious God in this film is nothing more and nothing less than Heath Ledger, really exceeded many of its actions to reincarnate the madman and worst enemy Batman, the Joker.The joker in this film is not a lot of criminal and, unlike others, does not seek money, which makes it an extremely dangerous to be without remorse or reason in their actions. The Joker is an agent of chaos, whose actions directly impact Batman and Gotham's residents, but beyond the screen so that the fight against Batman called it an excuse to go throwing small statements about the nature of human being, of a supposed goodness of their irrationality, their need to have heroes and limitations of these champions of justice.Moreover, we will see some personal aspects of life as Bruce Wayne Batman: inability to hold a formal relationship with Rachel and the possibility that it is for another man: Harvey. But this love triangle is far from being a key feature shoehorned, only an instrument for the resolution of the plot. The result: The glorious Starring of Heath Ledger, a dark and excellent history, expléndidas performances, an excellent score, a epia direction from Nolan glorious, incredible action scenes and excellent result:The best film of the decade 2000, would be a sin not to see. Do not be disappointed. My Score: 100 definitely.",1
1113,"Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece. Finally, Batman as it was actually intended, with a Joker who isn't crappy (I'm looking at you, Cesar Romero). Heath Ledger, you will be missed. This movie can be best described as the ultimate ""screw you"" to Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale is the best Batman EVER! Sorry, Adam West.",1
1114,"Two words; Heath Ledger. This movie is history, and is now legendary. And Mr. Ledger has put himself up there with the legendary actors. Bravo, bravo.",1
1115,"An Simply Outstanding film. The Joker's performance is so on point by Heath ledger it's unbelievable. A lot of people say this movie is very long but the only time wasted are in scenes like the hong kong bit, other than that, this movie was incredible....a ground breaking achievement in cinema history.",1
1116,"I never thought that a super hero-movie like this would ever see the light of day. Luckily, Christopher Nolan has the talents to make a masterpiece like this. ""The Dark Knight"" has great depth, amazing acting from all of the cast members (especially Heath Ledger who made the performance of his life as the Joker), an epic soundtrack that completely goes in style with the movie, an atmosphere so dark and chilling that amplifies the feeling of despair in this movie, and much, much more that makes it one of the best pictures of the 2000's. The story is so smart and so elegantly put together that it will always be remembered as a masterpiece of the highest standard.",1
1117,"Heath Ledger's performance is dark and enthralling and it speaks volumes that the plot, visuals and other characters pull us in just as close. Plot holes, while present, are easily discarded.",1
1118,This is the middle of my favorite movie of all time. This is perfect in absolutely every way. Every actor plays their part perfectly. Nolan was definitely snubbed by the oscar's.,1
1119,"I'm surprised this movie gets bashed as much as it does/did. Not only does this movie have a great story, (Which was made by DC Comics,) but it also has great humor within, the Joker who is Batman's enemy, which you probably already know. Although some parts do get a little boring.",1
1120,This is by far the best batman movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!! Heath Ledger's performance was phenomenal. The action scenes were fantastic and Christoper Nolan is an insanely brilliant director!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
1121,"I'm not the biggest Batman fan. He's probably one of the worst Justice League heroes FOR ME. But this movie is without any doubt a masterpiece! Excelent acting, great story and visual effects. If you like DC, watch it!",1
1122,"The Dark knight hurts me literally not. Not because the picture is bad, it is just substantially good. A rare cinematic experience which makes me upbeat and I do feel lively. It is sharp, destructive and epic. Like what the critics have generally mentioned in their reviews- the Dark Knight is not entirely a superhero movie, it is too an epic crime thriller. The film has the elements to be a great show. Editing shows me perfection; they are sharp, strong, and impregnable. Hans Zimmer's powerful score adds up to the excitement of the action scenes  rightfully being composed and could wrap it up that to some great extent, some 'Power' values of the movie clearly belong to the music. The cinematography is beautiful; I witnessed gloomy images of Gotham City being captured. Some shots in the movie are undeniably dark, but it is well blended with beauty. I would say, a beauty in a moody mood. Its screenplay which was being written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan, Johathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer is a Tour De Force, a brilliant spark. In my opinion, the script, alongside with the performances, clears to me that the movie is a superhero classic. First of all, dialogues are brightly great; I am literally 'High' after paying my focus for the dialogues. Too many memorable lines for one film! They are like ""Why so serious?"", ""Let's introduce a little anarchy"", ""How about a magic trick?"" and much more. Im real, those dialogues punched me in the face. Well consisted of a complex storyline, devoid of clichés  the writers' top notch writing ability is very much in evidence. The Dark Knight is an acting masterclass. The actors for the film, truly delivered, I mean every single one them. True acting talents in them and Nolan's impeccable direction are proven. Christian Bale hits the right note playing both Bruce Wayne and Batman, Michale Caine is beautifully artistic, Morgan Freeman is as calm as hourglass, Aaron Eckhart is charismatic and engaging  Gary Oldman is honest and Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfectly fine  Through honesty I claimed that each of the actors in the movie played their 'A' game. But how about Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker? I wouldn't want to repeat the past comments which was being triggered by critics on his performance, but I gonna say this  Heath Ledger is not Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, he is The Joker. I repeat, Heath Ledger is NOT Heath Ledger  he IS The Joker. I would not choose to have the notion that the film is entirely an entertaining action packed, comic book cinema, I think Christopher Nolan goes beyond that. Try bother to pay close attention to the film, one would see hidden, interesting messages in the movie, and I think, in my opinion, many of them is being injected through The Joker. For example, in the conversation between Harvey Dent/Two-Face and The Joker at a hospital, The Joker talks about events which could be labelled as reality  he talks about how things will move at ease when things go according to plan, and that makes the scene very exciting to watch but surely too, backed with great acting by both. My belief is this  not only that The Dark Knight is an entertaining epic cinema, it is also a fun piece to interpret. Nolan's second Batman motion picture is easily one of the greatest superhero films ever made and it is also one of the best films of the year. Finely shot, well-acted, accurately complex and freshly interpreted, The Dark Knight is statuesque. (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/AlexDesmall)",1
1123,"definitely the best superhero´s film ever made in history an the most outstanding of the trilogy, all the elements are just where they should creating a complex, deep and real world.",1
1124,"All time top 5 favorite movie. Fantastic performances from entire cast, particularly Ledger and Bale. Great action, story, special effects. Dark but not too dark, The perfect superhero movie in every way possible.",1
1125,"I am watching this movie for the billionth time right now on FX and it just goes to show how excellently crafted this movie is. Not only one of the best super hero movies of all-time, this is one of the best movies of all-time period. This is without question the best movie of the last decade. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it.",1
1126,"This movie re-writes the rules for comic-book movies by making the darkest, most realistic (and psychologically enduring) take on a super hero yet. I won't write too much on this review because I don't know what to say to express how good this movie was. If there ever is a comic-book movie that can surpass the dark knight, this movie will still leave it's mark for being the one who turned the industry on it's head first.",1
1127,"If you wanted to know what I think is a perfect movie, then i'd probably say this one. This movie is perfect for ME, let me just be clear about that. Just because I think it's perfect, doesn't mean I should get hated by the minority who disagree with my decisions. Anyways, this is perfect telling of the cape crusader. No other Batman film has come as close as this one has to showing Batman's true potential. Nolan got everything right in this movie, actors, writing, camera work, action/effects, and just an overall tone. You have an all star cast that just keeps you entertained all the way through, from Christian Bale; though the voice is rather annoying, of course Ledger playing the now iconic role of the Joker, and even the supporting cast: Gary Oldman, Michael Cane, Aaron Eckhart, and that girlfriend (I don't remember her name). The way this entire film is shot just makes it feel gigantic and makes the atmosphere feels more as well. The writing id really good too, although it is a bit of a bummer in how they constantly talk about everything; by that I mean they don't make it so you can try to think about the film yourself, but instead tell you what's it trying to convey. The action may not be as spectacular as some heavy effects film may be, but it doesn't have to be. The action in this is by far some of the best realistic sequences in cinema (of course I'm just referring to action only). Probably going to sound like every other positive review on this movie: An awesome experience overall.",1
1128,"The best of Nolan's Batman Trilogy.  The entire cast was solid, but it was Heath Ledger who stole the show as the Joker with one of the best performances I've seen in cinema.  It doesn't have as much action as other recent super hero movies, but it more than makes up for that with great writing and intense scenes.  This movie deserves all of the praise it has gotten.",1
1129,Best superhero movie of all time. The acting writing directing superb. It is an excellent piece of work that succeeds my expectations. Should have been nominated for best picture,1
1130,"This is arguably, the most awesome comic book film of all time. With amazing story, emotional tension, fantastic acting, music and all round, a brilliant piece of cinema. With a extremely awesome performance from Heath Ledger, a mentor act from Morgan Freeman, a really intimidating Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine in one of his best performances ever, this is a should-see film. Nuff said.",1
1131,超级英雄电影颠覆之作，全片基调黑暗也带有不少恐怖元素，诺兰对黑暗系电影的把控相当到位，Harvey Dent的设定最佳，而希斯莱杰将Joker的疯狂表演得淋漓尽致，结尾得设定很好。,1
1132,"What can be said? This film is just simply amazing. many believe Avengers was the best superhero film of all time, but I believe The Dark knight is the greatest.",1
1133,"An extraordinary adventure film with action all the time. One of the best Batman movies. Fans are going to love, Haters are going to love. Christopher Nolan is probably the best director nowadays.",1
1134,"Perhaps the most influential blockbuster of the modern era, Nolan bests his previous effort by amping up the despair, focusing more on Gotham's organized crime, and giving us one of the greatest acting achievements ever put to film with Heath Ledger's Joker.",1
1135,Surprisingly enough this sequel was somewhat better than Batman Begins in many ways. I would strongly recommend this movie for anyone that enjoyed the first movie.,1
1136,"To me, this was the perfect Batman story brought to the big screen ever. It was dark, and played with different levels of good vs evil and everything in between. The acting was top notch, especially Ledger's performance which will go down in Hollywood history it was so well done. Kudos to the Nolans for putting this fantastic movie on the big screen for us fans to enjoy.",1
1137,"The best action movie of all time in my opinion, even better than Terminator 2. There is constant action with great special effects, but also great story with my favourite super hero and nowadays legendary acting by Joker Heath Ledger and Batman Christian Bale.",1
1138,"Dark, complex, unforgettable and an excellent production, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.",1
1139,"There is no way we can say Christopher Nolan is not from the elite in Hollywood, with this movie he proves that he can even make a superhero movie become an Oscar contendant not only in visual effects categories, he just delivers a masterpiece that is so real that starts to be scary. And not only Christopher Nolan, also the extraordinary cast starting with the breathless performance of the joker, and the excellent choice for Batman, Christian Bale.",1
1140,"The best director in modern times,the best story for a superhero movie,extraordinary performances from the actors(Special mention-HEATH LEDGER-Hats Off),best music director putting up the best background score ever and many many more aspects which will be among the best for a long,long time.WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!!!!!!!",1
1141,"OK, why 2,5 hrs?  Honestly, the first hour of the film just felt unnecessary...it was after the road chase that I basically become more interested in the film. After all, it is suppose to be a comic book based action film. The acting was very good. It seemed to me that at times Maggie Gyllenhaal was exaggerating a bit, but she did her job well and she was definitely better than that other girl (Katie whatever....brrrr). But one man really stood out  Heath Ledger rocked! Undoubtedly the best Joker EVER! (c'mon, go give him the Oscar...). This film can only be described as good as the previous Nolan Batman due to Heath's performance. Overall, the film involves a lot of twist and turns that are so over the top, they become enjoyable (dead people turn out to be alive, seriously injured people seeking revenge as if they have no injury at all, helicopters being brought down coz it got caught in wire-rope, batman catching a ride on (or rather, outside of) a plane  while it's in flight, etc). Oh, and expect that feel-good utopia American ending...",1
1142,What an amazing film. To all the critics who say that the movie is too long need to understand that it needed to be that long to fit such a good movie into. Bale and Ledger were the stars of the show and the effects were top knotch. A true classic.,1
1143,"Best joker (Heath Ledger) ever and my favourite Batman movie. The last scene with the 2 ships is thrilling and very tense, I also enjoyed Morgan Freeman's performance as Lucius Fox.",1
1144,"A masterpiece by Christopher Nolan! Nowadays, we see a massive amount of computer generated objects in our movies. But with Nolans’s The Dark Knight, we notice that he really tries to make the batman franchise as real as possible. Just look at the Batmobile, so incredible! I totally love the action and crime in The Dark Knight, and both the opening scene and the ending was just awesome. I’m also amazed by how groovy the movie was, and with the great music and the awesome actors couldn't the movie have been done better. Every small detail in the movie is perfect, except that there are some confusing and slow scenes in some places. The Dark Knight is a spectacular movie, and the best to date by Nolan. 9,3/10",1
1145,"I can not believe that people actually complained about its length. I would watch this masterwork if it was 5 hours. Another Nolan movie, what did you expect? Twisters at their best, magnificent acting by Heath Ledger... Seriously I am speechless about it. Watch it, and be amazed by The Dark Knight.",1
1146,"A monumental accomplishment in comic book cinema. The Dark Knight improves upon its already outstanding predecessor, with a performance of the century from Heath Ledger as The Joker.",1
1147,"Estamos ante una obra maestra de proporciones epicas, un villano tan carismatico, una trama que se vuelve interesante y con giros inesperados, es la mejor pelicula de superheroes hasta ahora, bueno eso de superheroes o mejor dicho antiheroe, porque Batman no es un heroe, es el caballero de la noche.",1
1148,"Chris Nolan is a fantastic Writer and Director and he shows his skills once again in 'The Dark Knight.' Everything from the music, acting, writing, and story telling is excellent and perfectly fitting in the Batman universe. The tone of the film is very dark and mature themed, but thrilling from start to end. The performance from Heath Ledger is outstanding and by far the most believable joker. The performance from Mark Hamil in the cartoons and videos games is also great, but Heath gives you the whole performance rather than just voice. If you are looking for a thrilling action movie, The Dark Knight is an absolute must see!",1
1149,"The best movie I have ever seen,I have watch it so many times and it never gets old, I would recommend it to anyone, and also recommend the whole trilogy.",1
1150,"This movie is brilliant. Every bit is enjoyable. This takes Batman to a whole new level in character development and story. And it's surprisingly realistic. Nolan outdid himself for sure. Heath Ledger gives the best performance if the Joker ever. He's funny, intimidating, scary, and so much like a real serial killer. He's just here to create chaos. The side cast is also great. This movie brings tears, action, and laughs. It was a Batman movie purely for adults, its big with action and characters. It never disappoints and is a great watch every time I see it. Great movie and one of my favourites.",1
1151,"One of the greatest movies, I really in love with Christopher Nolan's work. I enjoyed each second I spend watching this amazing movie. The Joker deserved the oscar for this incredible performance.",1
1152,"The Dark Knight has too much of the coldness found on Batman's comics, and for this reason it's maybe one of the best superhero movie. I refuse talking about Ledger's Joker because talking about his genial acting is like raining on the wet.",1
1153,"Heath Ledger is definitely the all-time best Joker portrayer (take that, Jack Nicholson!) and really pulled us all in with his performance. The movie focuses on a more dramatic level than the previous Batman installments, and as a result, it resonates better with me. This series just gets better and better.",1
1154,"This is the best superhero movie, or perhaps, the best movie ever made. The acting is brilliant, the script was great, and the villain was one of the most realistic ones I've ever seen. It has that dark sense to it as every superhero Nolan film does.",1
1155,"As I mentioned in my previous review, ""WALL-E"" was released in 2008 and, to this day, is considered one of the greatest films of all time. How crazy is it that, 3 weeks later, another film was released that ended up being considered one of the greatest of all-time? ""The Dark Knight"" somehow managed to do that. It's beautifully written, it's thrilling, it's dark, it feels like a Batman movie should, it's brilliantly filmed, and it features possibly one of the greatest acting performances in a superhero film in Heath Ledger's Joker. The other actors are great, sure, but it's Ledger that steals the show here, providing a tremendous, powerful and terrifying performance as one of the most iconic villains of all time. There's no two ways about it, ""The Dark Knight"" is cinematic excellence, and regardless of your feelings towards superhero films, it's an absolute must-watch.",1
1156,"if in batman begins christopher nolan took out the franchise off the mud,in the dark knight he put it in an great level,this is one of the most greatest films based on an super heroe character,with great featured of the acting of heath ledger.",1
1157,"This movie is the my best movie of all time. Heath ledger acting was OUTSTANDING.His every dialogue is just legendary.The starting scene(bank robbery) is just great.I have watched this movie many times and i never get tired of watching this movie",1
1158,"Batman's latest version of ,The Dark Knight(July 14,2008)was a high grossing,Batman movie.It began what Batman was when we were trying to interoperate,Bruce Willis as a person-when Batman was going through his hard/dark times.  It  embraced Batman becoming more of a strong man and not being afraid of the world like he was as a young adult. He opened his eyes more. It welcomed,Heath Ledger's character-the joker.Heath Ledger was great at playing the joker.So great that he was known as a actual human being-who transformed into his character.  His soul was like the Jokers. It was very dark. During the periods of his life,when he was playing the dark character-the joker-he was 'using' drugs. Christian Bale(as Batman)was everyone's hero,while Heath Ledger who was dark-depressed all the time,who was playing-the venomous to the heartbeat,joker-was dieing inside.Even though the movie,the Dark Knight- was great and we couldn't get enough.There were deep secrets within the movie-it self. Besides that,I loved how Batman was as a grown adult. He over came his fears.It makes you wonder,if you 'let go of YOUR fears'-what could you achomplish? After note:Rest in peace,Heath Ledger.We will all miss who you were-as a living bright,person.",1
1159,"I cannot say enough about this film, it's truly so fantastic that it is hard for me to describe. Everything about this movie is an A+. From Ledgers grim and terrifying performance as the joker, to Aaron Ekhart's believable and stunning depiction of Harvey Dent. The story of this film is not only believable, but perfectly executed. This movie is one that you must see in your life",1
1160,I'd have to say probably one of the finest films ever made. The relationship between Batman and Joker has never been captured as strongly in this film.  The unfortunate death of Health Ledger however makes me wonder what Nolan would have done in the third one had he lived.,1
1161,"The Dark Knight is stunning.A masterful sequel to Batman Begins, The Dark Knight introduces realism to what were once two dimensional comic book drawings. A great plot, amazing acting by Heath Ledger, and a very entertaining super hero film to say the least.",1
1162,"The best Superhero/Comic book movie of all time. This is one of the movies that made Batman so popular today and lets not forget Heath Ledgers amazing portrayal of The Joker. The story was amazing and was never predictable, new things kept popping up keeping the plot fresh and never stale. 10/10",1
1163,"The Dark Knight is the closest any superhero movie has come to ""perfect"" with amazing dialogue, a sturdy plot, great casting and Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of The Joker.",1
1164,Nobody saw this performance by Heath Ledger coming and we couldn't take our eyes off of him.  His portrayal of the Joker is easily one of the most intriguing characters I have ever seen on film.  Just brilliant.,1
1165,"This is the only superhero movie that has ever achieved pure perfection, while I may give other films 10's, I want to explain, only a select few I have ever given something which I call a ""Perfect"" rating. A Perfect rating is where the movie is either perfect because it has no real flaws or so good that the bad is nonexistent, 10's are important films and Perfect films are examples of unrivaled filmmaking. So much has already been said about The Dark Knight that I don't need to say much, but I must say this. Nowadays, superhero films are trying to copy The Dark Knight and fail to see why this is a perfect movie, not because its dark, not because it has blood, or violence, or because it has swearing, or any of that stupidity into thinking that is what makes this film great, No, it is because it is mature, intelligent, and a thought provoking story about morality, choice, justice, anarchy, evil, good, and how madness can triumph in the end unless good gives into some kind of evil. That is why The Dark Knight is a perfect film, executed beautifully, and remaining loyal to it's source material while raising new questions for both comic book fans and film goers, that make it a marvel, an achievement that hasn't been matched by many, and won't be knocked off of it's throne as the greatest superhero movie of all time, for a long, long time.",1
1166,"Oh. My. God. If anybody's been on the IMDb Top 250 lately, there's a reason why this movie sits at #6 with a 9.0 rating. This movie is absolutely unbelievable, and it blows my mind that it was not even nominated for Best Picture in 2008. Christian Bale does a fantastic job, the best I've seen for a super hero protagonist. The minor roles of acting legends Michael Caine (Alfred Pennywoth) and Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) were stupendous, and Maggie Gyllenhaal was fantastic as Rachel Dawes, much better than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. Gary Oldman is back and better than ever as Lt. Gordon, and played a role that forced the audience to fall in love with him, even those that went into the movie thinking it wouldn't live up to all the hype. Aaron Eckhart did a fabulous job throughout the movie, from first being the White Knight DA of Gotham Harvey Dent, and eventually as Two-Face, the psychotic criminal obsessed with chance. But the most spectacular acting job throughout not just the movie, but the series, was Heath Ledger, the Joker. His acting job was one of the best I've ever seen, and it's an absolute shame that he passed. The Joker's combination of insanity and sensibility was astonishing. Everything he said throughout the movie was absolutely crazy, but at the same side, made sense. He deserved the Oscar he won for the film, and the Dark Knight is worth watching solely because of him. This film had an absolutely amazing cast, and it is an outstanding film. Also, Hans Zimmer did a fantastic job with the score, so a hat-tip to him. All of the music was perfect for every situation, and that screeching sound that symbolizes the Joker was perfection. So a huge hat-tip to Christopher Nolan (the director), Hans Zimmer, and the entire cast, especially Heath Ledger. This film is STRONGLY recommended. 10 stars out of 10.",1
1167,"Is it overrated? Absolutely. It suffers from the same problems as Batman Begins- namely, the over-reverential script and the over-analysis of the movie's themes. But this one is much better, and I can explain why in five words: Heath Ledger as the Joker. This is the one part of the movie that deserves as much praise as it got. Ledger finds that tiny, tiny spot between funny and terrifying and milks it for all it's worth. He's a wounded puppy-dog of a jester who won't hesitate to slice your mouth in two or blow up a cruise ship, and he'll be laughing all the way. Also, he's the only actor in the crowd who can ably handle Nolan's Script and fuse it into his character, though that might be more of the Joker psychology that Ledger's acting. Whatever it is, he nails it. I just wish the rest of the movie was as clever and nuanced as him.",1
1168,"The Dark Knight is Batman pushed to his mental limits. After years of Batman disrupting their operations, hammering  them and putting them to the corner, a desperate mob turn to psychotic madman ""Joker"" in an effort to put an end to Batman. Heath Ledger's performance cannot be understated here, his performance is so brilliant, visceral and terrifying that he leaves you eating from the palm of his hands with his performance. Ledger's performance is the cinematic benchmark for how to perfect the compelling villain, something comic book movies these days still sorely lack the idea of. This movie is a masterpiece no doubt about it",1
1169,"The best superhero movie I've ever seen. Ledgar's performance is perhaps the greatest acting I've seen. This is a dark, realistic, action-packed masterpiece",1
1170,"There have been many Batman movies, some were good, some were okay and some were just awful. Throughout this collection of movies that tried to depict the Dark Knight, this one is the only one that does it right... no, scratch that, it does it perfect. A simply amazing and captivating movie, that puts the Dark Knight into the perfect 'light': darkness. It presents him, not as a hero that saves the day, but as a man who sacrifices everything for justice and for the city that he loves. The screenplay is just fantastic, taking the hero-movie genre to a whole new level. Christopher Nolan's dark and modern directing style also fits perfectly and Hans Zimmer's score makes you feel like this is something special, this is something different, this is the ultimate superhero movie of all time. The dark score captures the corruption and the decadence in Gotham just perfect. The acting is also extremely well, and I think you already know where I'm going with this... Yes, Heath Ledger's Joker is simply perfect. His twisted, homicidal personality it's only beaten by his little and detailed tics. A truly mature and unique story, 'The Dark Knight' impresses through its serious and dark atmosphere, incredible writing and the unique mature approach on the story of the greatest superhero and villain of all time.",1
1171,"This has no competition. It is the very finest comic-book character movie ever made. Knowing the Burton, Donner and Nolan filmic adaptations of Batman and Superman exist helps me to sleep at night. They are Exhibit A of 'How to Make a Comic-Book Movie'. Nothing else has ever come even remotely close. These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition. Peerless.",1
1172,"The atmosphere is very intense in the movie, like the comics. Also Heath Ledger's performance was brilliant, he achieved to show the psychotic and crafty side of Joker. Story was fluent and deliberative, it makes you think after you watch it. But, it was not like a superhero movie. It was like a exciting psychological crime movie. That's the only disadvantage maybe but I ignore it, because Batman has more serious style than the other superheroes. He's like a detective rather than a superhero. After all, this movie is a masterpiece of Nolan. Deserves 10 out of 10.",1
1173,"Christopher Nolan clearly is one of the few directors of comic book movies who actually cares. You can tell, because he elevated this movie from a simple comic book movie to an action packed thriller. The first thing I would like to talk about is Heath Ledge. Wow. His performance blows my mind every time. As the Joker, he is a murderous psychopath. He really makes all of the tense scenes work. Christian Bale plays a great Batman, as per usual. Everything in this movie looks real, and that's because most of it is. Nolan is not a fan of CGI. These stunts are real. Speaking of these stunts, the action sequences are also done incredibly. This is a must see, comic book fan or not.",1
1174,"This movie is not just an excellent comic book movie, it is one of the best movies ever made. It incorporate elements from multiple genres (crime,action,suspense,horror,psychological..............). Solid performances from all the actors makes this plot heavy movie one of Nolan's best.P. S. Heath Ledger as Joker is AWESOME!!!!!",1
1175,"If one movie captured what it was like to live in the post-9/11 decade, this is it. This is the movie of a generation. It seems to lack a traditional narrative structure, instead pounding away relentlessly with jump scares, psychological horror, and real action. Terse direction and a chilling manical score drive the action. The bank robbery prologue remains one of the classic film openings, but memorable scenes and quotable dialogue abound, culminating in the epic Batman/Joker interrogation scene. People rightfully remember the profound tragedy of Heath Ledger's death so soon after this iconic performance, but there is an abundance of strong acting. Aaron Eckhart provides a nuanced foil before making a scary turn, and Maggie Gyllenhall sells the horror of the Joker's machinations, and of course Christian Bale somehow conveys the weight of the world being on his shoulders in an oddly thankless role. Largely grounded in reality, the film nonetheless reveals plot holes and implausibilities upon rewatching. However, it is a testament to it greatness that despite the Joker's seemingly impossible schemes or the muddled ending, the emotional impact of the film as a whole remains untarnished. The film's brilliance is that in the climax with an unknown everyman, not a superhero, is given a choice to kill or be killed, the film genuinely sells that he might go either way, and the audience invests in his decision. Even a cynic cannot watch The Dark Knight without laughing at its black humor, squirming at its horrors, and doing some self-evaluation afterwards. What has fear done to us? What is the right response to terror? Where do we go from here? Simultaneously a work of cinematic art, a philosophical treatise, and a pop culture classic, this movie's place in history cannot be denied.",1
1176,"The Batman film everyone should deserve, even for people who don't like Batman. The films atmosphere, relatable characters, well-done action scenes, tension building are the things films need more of these days. The Dark Knight is a film I watch just to remind me what any other film but this one should try and be like. I mentioned action scenes separately because they are one the biggest highlights for me. Every single scene ranging from fist fights and car chases is perfectly edited and choreographed to show the realistic Batman in action. The car chase showing the Joker trying to catch Harvey Dent is perhaps the most detailed and perfectly executed piece of cinematography in film history. It might be a little disappointing that they got rid of the Bat mobile so suddenly and without warning. However the bat cycle blends in perfectly with one of Batman's many fantastic vehicles for the trilogy. Batman himself has become much more easy to take seriously which is saying a lot. He has now moved on from his only works by himself cycle in the first film, and now shows him with Harvey Dent and Jim Gordon working together to take down crime in the city. All the while knowing that Batman is a vigilante. Bruce Wayne is now still onto Rachel despite her having found out his secret in the last film, who has now moved onto Harvey Dent and seems to use Bruce's secret against him as would anyone. However the most interesting character for me is the joker himself. He is perhaps the most well-chosen actors for the part as Heath Ledger portrays him in a way its creepy. He is a man driven by nothing but chaos and the very destruction around him. He is also driven to bring down the Batman. This is a brilliant plot device since the Joker has nothing to sacrifice but his very life. Whereas Batman has his social life and his secret identity at stake. The Joker only wants Batman to give in. This is good for tension building because the audience are with Batman and realise that the Jokers plan is technically impossible to beat unless Batman... well, kills him. I won't go any further because I am positive that you've already heard enough hype for this film, and let me say that The Dark Knight has lived up to every bit of it and more.",1
1177,"I know that this might sound to consistent but this is probably the best superhero film of all time, the camera work, the makeup design (The Joker) , the direction, the writing and  especially the performances are just great, Christian Bale really gives Batman some finesse and intimidation and handles the character well, Ledger's last performance was just great, i didn't think of him as that kid from Brokeback Mountain or 10 Things I Hate About You, i actually thought that he was a sociopath, and that is what i call amazing character study. Nice supporting cast as well. Christopher Nolan's best movie  that's for sure",1
1178,Inexplicably good. One of those movies that you have to keep watching once you've started. Probably the best superhero film to date.,1
1179,"Where to begin with this brilliant superhero film... Well one of the outstanding reasons would have to be The Joker (Heath Ledger), firstly the performance by him in this film is fantastic and absolutely deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor. Another reason why this is a great feature and most definitely the best of the trilogy is because there's no stupid backstory that's just a load of nonsense, the Joker is just simply crazy or messed up and even as Michael Caine says in the film 'Some people just wanna watch the world burn' the joker mentions a few times about his past and how he got his scars but changes them each time so no ones actually sure what's wrong with him.I also think Christian Bale plays a great Batman, compared to George Clooney or almost any of the othersChristopher Nolan is a great director and has directed many great films and this is right up there with the others and deserved all the credit it got!A definite 9/10",1
1180,"While Batman Begins was a good film, The Dark Knight is grand. It's darkness and it's intense action will hold you captivated throughout the film. Christian Bale did an excellent performance playing Batman, I don't know why people are hating on his voice. The drama was cool, there were some emotional scenes, I overall had an amazing time when I first saw this film and I kind of want to watch it again right now. This is probably the greatest Batman movie ever made, so I would highly recommend it.",1
1181,"Nearly every aspect of this film is fantastic. The creative designs and aesthetics of the movie are very pleasing, from the designs of Batman's suit and arsenal to the sprawling city of Gotham. Hans Zimmer's composing is, as always, genius. The Jokers theme is one of the highlights of this soundtrack, complementing the character perfectly. The acting in the film is top notch, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman deliver more rock solid performances and newcomer Aaron Eckhart also packs a punch as Harvey Dent/Two Face. But Heath Ledger steals the show as the, in my opinion, best interpretation of the Joker's character in any Batman media. The story is tense, well paced, and thrilling. The Dark Knight is easily one of the best Superhero movies ever made.",1
1182,"master piece!!!! the action, the lines, the reality for a hero. . . . is just amazing i think this movie goes for my top 5 of all times . . .btw so much jealous people hiting 0 score -_-",1
1183,"Overrated my left testicle. This movie is dark, complex, clever, unforgettable and Heath Ledger's performance is completely phenomenal and memorable. Christian Bale did another great job with this movie and once again, Christopher Nolan proves that he does not only deserves an Oscar for best director, he also proves that we can always trust on him.",1
1184,My favourite film of all time. This movie is absolutely incredible. Heath Ledgers portrayal as Joker is amazing and my favourite character ever in a movie. I can't praise this movie enough. It is just so dark and all the acting is amazing. If you haven't seen this movie make sure you check it out best film I have ever seen!!,1
1185,"Rare breed of film which is both serious and impossibly entertaining. Why so serious. The acting is first rate with already classic landmark performances from Ledger and Bale, with strong supporting acts from, Oldman,  Freeman and Caine. The audience are able to feast there eyes on cinematic magic from the breathtaking visual effects, shown extensively through the chase scenes with the Bat-pod and Lorry. Whiles Hanz Zimmers theme keeps you heart pounding throughout the film. The film which is already seen as a classic for the genre has no major shortcomings though of course people will dig plot holes. Definitely the best superhero film of all time, though a wide range of successful themes allow it to almost transcend its genre.Ultimately its Nolan at his very very best and i can think of no higher praise than that.",1
1186,"Pulp has never been so artistic. Chris Nolan's neo-shakespearean magnum opus soars across the cinema hall, proving to the world that sometimes even comic-book adaptations can be worthy of novelistic ambition. Despite being a blockbuster, the Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movie never touch like - the road to fascism is paved with good intentions, idealism is always easier to corrupt than greed, light always coexists with darkness (or as the Joker would say freaks attract freaks) and perhaps most disturbing of all, the Dark Knight proclaims that in a world where there is no justice there's no way to fight the system without falling into corruption, apathy or worse. Nolan wants us to take a good long look at the brutally bleak streets of Gotham and reflect on its striking perspicuous similarities to our own post 9/11 world. It makes us wonder if nature in it's most elementary form is governed by chaos and the structures we've erected just create an illusion of harmony (or is it the other way around?).",1
1187,"Theres only so many franchises where the 2nd film is the best. The Dark Knight is hands down the best Batman movie but also the best superhero movie. everything one could want in a superhero film. it takes superhero movies to a whole new level. here are my ratings: 1. Cast: 10/102. Action: 9/103. Score: 10/104. Effects: 10/105. Theater experience: 10/10",1
1188,"The perfect Batman movie. Realistic and grounded, creating a perfect world where Batman can exist but we also can feel like it is real. Very complex especially for a comic book movie.. actually it is so much more than a superhero movie... it is a crime drama with Batman characters. And that makes it so awsome. Great performances (especially from Heath Ledger), storytelling, directing, everything!",1
1189,"Thanks to great acting, amazing performance by Heath Ledger and brilliant guidance by director Christopher Nolan this movie is destined to be remembered forever.",1
1190,"Great, serious and realistic film like Batman Begins, great acting of the cast, good action scenes, interesting and engaging story, well worth watching.",1
1191,"This is a monumental piece of cinema. No film has ever portrayed chaos so well. Ledger gave one of the best performances in cinema history, Nolan's masterful directing has never been more prominent, weaving The Dark Knight into the best action movie ever made. The Dark Knight is a beautiful tale of destruction, a flawless take on crime, and a plea to mankind's nature. Christopher Nolan creates a world where being a hero is a double edged sword, at best, and yet that hero keeps doing his job. An absolutely fantastic piece of work, that every person on this world should see.",1
1192,"The Dark Knight is as much of a superhero film as it is a horrifying tragedy. With excellent casting, twisted and sickening characters and a devious plot make this the most outstanding Batman film in history. 10/10",1
1193,"I found The Dark Knight to be great film, living up to it's name. Although it is a shame about Ledger's death. He played The Jokers part perfectly. No one could have played the chaotic clown any better than Heath Ledger. As for Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne to be very exceptional as well. The movie itself and the plot to be devised exceptionally well. With Gotham in diss array and Batman trying to clean up the streets and is shunned by the law; while a megalomaniac is on the loose blowing up hospitals and killing without remorse. A great work of Art, better than the other two films in my opinion. Introducing Aaron Eckhart as Two Face; I found to be very exciting to see, seeing as he's one of my favorite DC villains. Although the film is very long and some parts to be boring it's the little things that was fantastic. With Ledger's fantastic portrayal and improvised parts, showing the Joker in his true form. This movie will be cherished and remembered for decades and the one of the greatest live action Batman movie.",1
1194,"The pace of The Dark Knight far surpasses that of its predecessor, as Bale's brilliant Batman is forced to stop Ledger's wonderfully bizarre interpretation of the legendary Joker. The thrills are plentiful, and the story is poignant.",1
1195,"By far the best super hero/batman film ever made, the second best film of all time in my opinion behind shawshank redemption, every actor gives a excellent performance especially heath ledger",1
1196,"THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! all the actors in this movie was great, Especially heath ledger as the Joker. the story was really really good. don't die before you watch this movie",1
1197,"unbelievable!!! this movie is so good the acting by Heath Ledger as the joker is amazing the joker is also very well made on script to. The action is great to the whole movie is just incredible very well done best superhero flick ever.my ratting 9.5/10 a 9 for action 10 for acting 8.5 for story 9.5 for style and a  8.5 for character development",1
1198,"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins. Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. The film introduces the character of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's newly elected District Attorney and the consort of Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal replacing Katie Holmes from the first film), who joins Batman and the police in combating the new rising threat of a criminal mastermind calling himself ""The Joker"" (Heath Ledger).",1
1199,"It truly is an outstanding CBM, and a great film in general. The acting, the cinematography, and writing are all top notch. There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said.",1
1200,"Despite being overrated, The Dark Knight shows viewers a strong villain and dark atmosphere. Sadly, Heath Ledger died postumously to its release however, he still earned a Oscar for best supporting actor and cemented himself in film history.",1
1201,"Has to be one of my favourite films of all time, filled with action, you are gripped to the TV, also Heath Ledger does an excellent job as the joker, in the facial expressions, to the small details.Overall an amazing movie.",1
1202,"Because, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, and, yes, Christopher Nolan rocked the show.The movie is a take apart from the comical Joker in DC Comics, and the mentally-affected Harvey Dent. These two elements raised the thrill completely.The best superhero flick, till now. Intensity redefined. Mind-blowing plot, brilliant sequences.",1
1203,"A genuine crime epic that fits into the Batman mythos with ease and certainty. Obviously there are a few problems with the film, but that goes for every other movie. The pros easily outweigh the cons in this case. The film is beautifully shot, the action scenes are viscerally thrilling, and it never ceases to be thought-provoking. Everybody involved in the production seemed to have given everything they had to make the best film they could make, and they came very, very close. The screenplay is sound, structure-wise, and it's impressive how the film seems epic in scope, yet maintains a level of palpable intimacy. One of the best films ever made.",1

1206,Well where do I start Nolan's films are always great but this is the best Bale is amazing but is nothin compared to Heath ledgers Acting if you say he won cause he died just watch him the film has a great plot terrifying moments great villains and an unbeatable hero well done Chris.,1
1207,"The best 2008 movie, a great movie with charismatic characters like Batman, Alfred, Gordon and The Joker: This version of The Joker is the best version ever.",1
1208,"Pulp has never been so artistic. Chris Nolan's neo-shakespearean magnum opus soars across the cinema hall, proving to the world that sometimes even comic-book adaptations can be worthy of novelistic ambition. This haunted and poetic Batman diegesis deals with dark thematic issues most movie never touch, like the West's responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations. The Dark Knight meditates on the significance of morality, the imperfection of fortitude, the justice in anarchy and the corruptibility of humanity. Nolan wants us to believe in the darkness within each of us, the mask we all wear, to hide our two-facedness.The Dark Knight touches on these themes boldly and bravely, not ashamed of the fact the the lead character is a man dressing up like a Bat. How long has it been since we've seen a blockbuster that's so thought provoking? Not since Apocalypse Now, I would say. The sign of a great film is if it's impact lasts longer than its screen-time, and the Dark Knight lingers long after the credits have rolled. It leaves us reflecting on its striking perspicuous similarities to our own post 9/11 world and makes us wonder if nature in it's most elementary form is governed by chaos and the structures we've erected just create an illusion of harmony (or is it the other way around?).",1
1209,"Christopher Nolan really showed his skills with this movie. This is the best Batman film ever made, followed closely only by The Dark Knight Rises. The story is absolutely brilliant, Heath Ledger as the Joker is the best villain I have ever seen on screen, the acting is marvelous from everyone involved, the script is flawless, the action is mind-blowing and the characters are fantastic. There isn't one single thing I dislike about it.",1
1210,"People will say this isn't a superhero movie it is a cop movie. That's not the point. This movie surpassed all doubts and expectations, with an incredible cast, a gripping story, edge of your seat suspense, and above all a great antagonist. Heath Ledger gave us a villain that scared and amazed at the same time with his unforgettable role as the Joker. It may not be a superhero movie to its core but this became more than that it became a work of art under Nolan's guiding hands. In my opinion this is one of the best movies of the 2000's. 10/10",1
1211,"The Dark Knight is the benchmark against which all other comic book movies are judged. Featuring strong performances across the board from a star studded cast, particularly the now iconic performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker, supported by fantastic production design, and skilled direction from Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight reinvents the comic book movie as a gritty crime thriller and it benefits enormously from this more down to earth treatment. Purists have criticized the film for its reinterpretations of established characters, but the decision by Nolan to make the otherwise absurd world of masked superheroes and villains more believable is a masterstroke, and is what elevates it above all other comic movies. The Dark Knight is a triumph because it does not abuse the audience's ability to suspend disbelief in the way many of the other more bombastic comic book movies (Avengers) have tended to do, and instead presents a world and characters that one could almost believe might actually exist. With strong writing, mesmerizing acting performances, strong direction, and fantastic production, The Dark Knight is quite simply the best comic book movie ever made, and its hard to see anything else coming close to topping it any time soon.",1
1212,"I cannot deny this is a superior superhero film. Or just a superior film. I'm not a Batman fan (I used to hate the guy) but I've always liked ""The Dark Knight"". I will say that some things, as usual in this trilogy, are a bit exaggerated, but if you overlook these few things, you'll find this movie to be thrilling, exciting, touching and freaking cool. This will be repeated to death, but the big highlight is obviously Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker. Lastly, a dark tone will always suit a character like Batman in such a good way, that you'll barely believe it.",1
1213,"From the fairly sublime to the mostly ridiculous, The Dark Knight begins well, with character and plot working together hand-in-hand.  But before this excessively long movie is over it devolves into a Grand Theft Auto orgy of gratuitous violence and effects that gets tedious around the two hour mark.  If you like the Jason Bourne trilogy style of non-stop action flicks you'll probably love The Dark Knight.  Myself, I just dream another little dream of how things might've been.",1
1214,"""He's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight"".10 years laterWe will never get anything like this ever again. This is not a superhero movie, but a crime drama, almost like a Michael Mann movie. It's also been 10 years since the passing of Heath Ledger.This movie and his legendary will live on forever.",1
1215,"The one singular thing I loved more than anything abotu this film was Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker. The one thing that touches me about his performance is that he was so into his character, he couldn't get out, and so he became The Joker. He WAS the best Joker I've ever seen. This film, all in all, was a great second chapter to the trilogy!",1
1216,"I love Batman because the story of his plight is more than about good guys vs bad guys. It's also about doing what is best for everyone and it explores the realities of problems in society. That movie to world connection really captivates me because every character seems to symbolize something. If you haven't seen this, you're missing out the best superhero film right now in the past two decades. Everyone raves about Christopher Nolan but his innovative storytelling really sets this movie apart. The fight scenes are good, the MUSIC complements this well like ketchup and mustard, and the scenes contributing to the plot are all very good. What I really liked was the boldness to go dark in a superhero movie. That was definitely a shocker at the time, but it has been triumphant because of the emotional performance by all the actors in the movie. 10s are very hard to come by and to all the haters, I can't think of any superhero movie or action film that tops this. I guess every man is entitled to their opinion. Overall, do yourself a big favor if you have not seen this and set aside an entire evening served with good food and drinks to watch this film. The performances are extremely memorable and it sure ain't basic. Word to describe: sympathy, you will feel empathy for both protagonists and antagonists...a good thing all movies have but it ain't Stockholm Syndrome level.This is a fine movie to watch alone or with a few friends but don't make this a big hoorah and definitely DO NOT invite the annoying friend. He/She will ruin everything you planned for that time. Set aside a different time to catchup with that person.",1
1217,"The Dark Knight is hands-down the best comic book movie of all time, and it's among the very best MOVIES of all time, All of the actors did a spectacular job in their roles. (especially Heath Ledger) The story picks up right where Batman Begins left off, Batman, Gordon, and Harvey Dent are on the brink of bringing down the crime network that rules Gotham City: the Mob, when suddenly a mysterious crimelord known as The Joker makes a deal with the Mob to kill Batman. Now, before I continue, can I say that the Joker was written and acted PERFECTLY, good job Nolan for writing such brilliant dialogue for the Joker, and Heath Ledger for acting and voicing the dialogue spectacularly. Anyway, The Joker commits a number of serious crimes to get Batman to give himself up. The crimes get more and more horrific, and Batman is getting stressed out. I've probably spoiled enough by now, but if you read this review and don't watch this movie, then we can't be friends. WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!",1
1218,"A good film critic, a really good film critic, is a film critic that you can trust to be the film critic you need and not just the film critic you want. It would be easy, quite easy, to get swept up in the media masses who are desperately pining for ""The Dark Knight,"" Heath Ledger's cinematic swan song and Christopher Nolan's second ""Batman"" film, to be a slice of cinematic paradise worthy of all the pre-opening Oscar surrounding Ledger's turn as The Joker. The good news is that the awards hype is warranted...Heath Ledger doesn't so much burst from Jack Nicholson's shadow as he simply and beautifully and maniacally reinvents The Joker as a psychologically tortured criminal that is society's most dangerous type of criminal...the type of criminal who makes you compromise your own values in order to even have a hope of catching him. Ledger's performance is a little bit prancing and preening, a whole lot menacing and taunting. Ledger would have undoubtedly cast himself into the Hollywood stratosphere with this performance, especially coming on the heels of such diverse work as ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Casanova"" and ""I'm Not There."" The simple fact that Ledger can, unbelievably, make you forget his tragic death with this performance is even more haunting as you leave the theatre and reflect on the performance. In other words, an Oscar nomination is a given. An Oscar award, while a bit more of a stretch, is certainly not out of the realm of possibility.Yes, Ledger really is that good in ""The Dark Knight.""Indeed, Nolan's second visit to Gotham is as intense, exhilarating and intelligent as his first with ""Batman Begins."" ""The Dark Knight"" is even more relentless in the psychological warfare that is unleashed before your very eyes. Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" isn't the fantasy world of so many superhero flicks, rather it is a startlingly realistic and uncomfortably authentic Gotham that sets Batman (Christian Bale), The Joker, Gordon (Gary Oldman, Scarecrow Cillian Murphy) and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) in OUR world. This is a Gotham that could just as easily be a Chicago (where much of it was filmed), New York, Los Angeles or Indianapolis. Nolan's Gotham is a world not unlike our own, a world in which the righteous and the evildoer are easily confused and, ultimately, all are disposable. It is a world that requires a superhero that transcends it all to become the superhero that is needed not just wanted. It is a world that needs not just a ""white knight,"" the label given the new do-gooder District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), but a dark knight willing to do whatever it takes to save the community. It would be a foolish and critical mistake to fault Nolan for this dark vision. With ""The Dark Knight,"" Nolan does not always make the popular decision nor the comfortable decision. Instead, indeed, Nolan becomes the filmmaker ""The Dark Knight"" needs him to be by avoiding a reliance on the romantic conflicts of ""Super-Man"" and the more audience-friendly lightness of the recent ""Iron Man."" ""The Dark Knight"" is intense, morbid, uncomfortable and exhausting. It is as much an action film as it is a superhero film, if not even moreso. It doesn't aim to please, it aims to envelope the senses and even one's sense of being. ""The Dark Knight"" succeeds. From the opening moments of a perfectly choreographed bank robbery, Nolan makes it completely apparent that ""The Dark Knight,"" especially in its preferred IMAX format, is going to plop right down in our laps and rattle every cell of our bodies until we're pleading for a mercy that never arrives until the closing credits. Christian Bale feels even more comfortable as the caped crusader, with a performance that is even more focused and precise than his turn in ""Batman Begins."" As chiseled as his abs, Bale turns Batman and Bruce Wayne into characters disturb because they leave you thinking that you really ought to be a better human being yourself. While I'm still not sold on the digitally manipulated vocals for Batman, Bale's presence is as maniacal as Ledger's without ever giving into The Joker's chaos. The film's supporting players are uniformly strong, most notably Aaron Eckhart's quieter yet equally career-transcending turn as Dent, who experiences an unexpected tragedy that transforms him into his already assigned nickname of Harvey Two-Face. It was Eckhart's casting that, for some reason, made the least sense to me and the early trailer's hadn't put me at ease. Yet, within the first few minutes of ""The Dark Knight,"" Eckhart removes all doubts with a performance that is moving and scary and frighteningly real. Both of Batman's confidante's return, Pennyworth (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Pennyworth harbors a secret that could potentially change everything, while Lucius becomes Batman's conscience when even he becomes ever so slightly consumed by the power he possesses. Both actors bring their A-game to the proceedings, turning what many films would project as minor characters into essential players. Gary Oldman, as well, deliciously underplays Gordon and proves a nice contrast to the chaos that surrounds him and, perhaps most notably, Nolan corrects the miscasting of Katie Holmes in ""Batman Begins"" by adding the weightier Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, the woman who is in the midst Dent and Wayne and Batman. Co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, ""The Dark Knight"" often seems to be as chaotic as the world in which The Joker lives. The script infuses The Joker with the film's greatest lines, lines such as ""What doesn't kill you makes you stranger"" and a well-placed, cinematic flashback will haunt you long after the closing credits. Yet, the script is far greater than the sum of its parts with little bits and pieces that will permeate your brain even moreso after you leave, as an effective script should. As all-enveloping as ""The Dark Knight"" is, it is not without its flaws and, depending upon your cinematic preferences, these flaws may impact your view of the film even moreso than it did mine. As beautifully choreographed as was the opening bank robbery, there are at least a couple of occasions where Nolan struggles to make sense of action sequences that are NOT choreographed with any sense of style or purpose or clarity. It feels unintentional and, fortunately, Nolan keeps the proceedings moving so quickly that it's easy to be so swept up in the action that one barely notices. Still, I noticed. Similarly, on occasion, the special effects seemed a tad run-of-the-mill. Most notably, an extended sequence involving a city-wide sonar device felt like it was more out of ""Wargames"" than Gotham and lacked the rest of the film's exhilarating sense of awesomeness. ""The Dark Knight,"" while certainly not a graphic film in terms of violence, is nonetheless a graphic film in terms of its psychological warfare. Ledger's The Joker means business and, coupled with Nolan's relentless intentionality, ""The Dark Knight"" may not be a film for smaller children unable to fully process this darker, morbid Gotham. There are moments, quite a few moments, in ""The Dark Knight"" that transcend anything you've seen in any other superhero film. It is a feral beast of a film that will impact you like it impacted me, waking me up at 4am to write a review of a film I simply cannot stop thinking about for even a moment. Brooding, captivating, unforgettable and awesome, ""The Dark Knight"" isn't always the film you want it to be...instead, Nolan compels us into a world that is equal parts fantasy and disturbing reality. ""The Dark Knight"" is the film we need it to be.",1
1219,"Batman (Bale) hopes to hang up his cape and hand over crime-fighting duties to District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). But the arrival of clown-faced master criminal The Joker (Ledger) forces the masked vigilante to question everything he stands for. Nolan navigates through a moral maze and some pointed politicking, but without ever stinting on stunts or explosions. It is thoughtful but never dull, and the OTT action and expansion — underscored in IMAX sequences which will no doubt look spectacular on the enormo-screen (Empire reviewed from a 35mm print) — are generally to its benefit, even though Nolan still appears more comfortable and engaged with interacting people than trucks and Batbikes. After a blistering opening, there’s a second act lull and a story shift not quite as elegant (or, some might argue, even coherent) as you’d expect from the director of The Prestige. But The Dark Knight is spectacular, visionary blockbuster entertainment: pretty much everything you could hope for and then some. It isn’t perfect but then, like its hero, like his late co-star, and as Nolan’s fitting tribute so ably observes, nobody is. Ledger’s performance is monumental, but The Dark Knight lives up to it. Nolan cements his position as Hollywood’s premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts – and the Batbike is kinda cool, too.",1
1220,"Consequences. In real life, these ramifications emanate from every action like ripples from a stone thrown into a pond. Often in movies, especially those that feature characters who don't play by the rules, such penalties are suspended. However, in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe, decisions and actions have consequences. The Dark Knight, arguably the moodiest and most adult superhero motion picture ever to reach the screen, illustrates this lesson in ways that are startling and painful. This is a tough, uncompromising motion picture - one that defies the common notions of what is expected from a ""superhero"" film. While there are plenty of action sequences and instances of derring-do, The Dark Knight's subtext has a tragic underpinning that would intrigue Shakespeare or the Greeks. It's about power and impotence, sanity and madness, image and reality, selfishness and sacrifice, and - yes - consequences. It has often been said that Tim Burton's vision of Batman was the darkest representation we were ever likely to see of a superhero. Compared to how Nolan sees the character, Burton's version was a pantomime. For many long-running franchises, Burton's included, the second volume stands tallest. Nolan has followed up on his gritty and successful Batman Begins with one of the best all-time sequels, and perhaps the most impressive mainstream entertainment experience since 2003's The Return of the King. The Dark Knight builds upon the themes and premises founded three years ago. With the introductions and origins dispensed with in Batman Begins, Nolan uses this opportunity to expand upon his portrait of Batman as a haunted individual who, driven by forces rooted deep in his psyche, must dispense justice according to his own strict code. Often in superhero movies, there's a sense that, no matter what challenges the protagonist must face, all will be right in the end. That certainty is missing here, and its absence may represent Nolan's most impressive accomplishment. Batman is fallible and his world is dangerous. No character, no matter how well-established in Batman lore, is safe. This director's Gotham City may be less garish and gothic than Burton's, but it is in many ways a bleaker and more oppressive place. It's a joyless venue and the hero takes his demeanor from his city. Batman is a grim, brooding superhero. He rarely speaks while in costume and, when he does, his voice quivers with menace and his words are devoid of the quips and one-liners audiences have come to associate with action heroes. For all of the heavy lifting done by the movie's screenplay, dealing as it does with substantive issues and existential questions, there's still plenty of the meat-and-potatoes content of any superhero movie: action sequences. There are numerous fights, chases, and races. The Batmobile gets its share of screen time as does a new Bat-cycle. Batman takes on bad guys singly and in bunches. And there's a heart-pounding sequence in which the Caped Crusader must race against time to save a life, where the price is almost as terrible if he succeeds as if he fails. Nolan's inherent sense of how to transform a relatively mundane fight scene into something involving is in evidence here, much as was the case in Batman Begins. He avoids flash editing and allows the action to evolve in a coherent manner, drawing the viewer in rather than keeping him guessing what's going on. 2008 may be the year that the superhero movie comes of age. Iron Man represents the best screen adventure of a Marvel hero. Now, D.C. has answered with The Dark Knight, a film so impressive in every significant facet that it makes one wonder why it took so long for the genre to reach this high level. Christopher Nolan has provided movie-goers with the best superhero movie to-date, outclassing previous titles both mediocre and excellent, and giving this franchise its The Empire Strikes Back.",1

Yet this Joker is unlike any we have previously encountered. Cesar Romero's interpretation of the character (in the '60s TV series) was that of a deadly prankster. Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance made 1989's Batman all about the bad guy. The late Heath Ledger, however, gives us something darker and more twisted - a role that would have been no less memorable had it not been his last and most grueling. There's nothing humorous about this freak. No flowery lines like ""You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?"" This is no caricature - The Joker is a frighteningly vicious and intelligent monster who represents a legitimate match for the title character. The other major character to join the ensemble is Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's charismatic, photogenic D.A. Harvey Dent is Gotham's Knight in Shining Armor, and that's how Eckhart plays him - an individual with a pure heart who makes his own luck. Those even passingly familiar with Batman lore know Dent's fate, and it plays out here as one might suspect, although Nolan puts a different spin on things than did Joel Schumacher. For all of the heavy lifting done by the movie's screenplay, dealing as it does with substantive issues and existential questions, there's still plenty of the meat-and-potatoes content of any superhero movie: action sequences.

1228,"Batman The Dark Knight is simply the best movie ever made, every thing in it is just so perfect, some people say its overrated, but those are just people who don't like super hero movies or Marvel fanboys, Heath Ledger's performance is the best, Christian Bale's Performance is the best and all other performances are the best. Joker>all villains",1
1229,Continuing from where Batman Begins ended peerless director Christopher Nolan reunites with Christian Bale for the continuing story of The Dark Knight. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman sets out to put a halt to the criminal activity that plagues Gotham City. Just as everything seems to be going their way the peace is shattered by a criminal mastermind known as The Joker.Batman may be on the DVD cover but this is really The Jokers movie. Following the death of Heath Ledger prior to the movies release there was huge hype regarding his performance and he certainly delivers. His portrayal is a far cry from the camp 1960s iteration and as creepy and disturbing as any villain in cinema history. Running at about two and a half hours in length The Dark Knight needed a worthwhile plot to go with the high quality action scenes and on this count the movie again doesn't fail featuring plenty of twists and surprises.The Dark Knight is without doubt the best super hero movie of all time.,1
1230,"In this movie we can talk about the joker only, coz he is one who make ""the dark knight"" one of the greatest movies in the cinema.Heath Ledger & Christopher Nolan gave us a psycho character that will stay in minds forever.I don't think there is someone was liking The Joker before, but after ""the dark knight"" everyone talk about The Joker more than Batman. The insanity, intelligence, pure evil, etc. all this performed perfectly by Heath. Honestly, the cinema lost one of the greatest actor in history, R.I.P Heath.",1

1238,"""The Dark Knight"" is a Masterpiece that focus' on the characters more than the action. Heath Ledgers Joker is amazing and is one of the best portrayals of a villain in movie history. This movie might have Batman as the main protagonist but its not a superhero film its a gritty crime/ thriller movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",1

1242,"Consequences. In real life, these ramifications emanate from every action like ripples from a stone thrown into a pond. Often in movies, especially those that feature characters who don't play by the rules, such penalties are suspended. However, in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe, decisions and actions have consequences. The Dark Knight, arguably the moodiest and most adult superhero motion picture ever to reach the screen, illustrates this lesson in ways that are startling and painful. This is a tough, uncompromising motion picture - one that defies the common notions of what is expected from a ""superhero"" film. While there are plenty of action sequences and instances of derring-do, The Dark Knight's subtext has a tragic underpinning that would intrigue Shakespeare or the Greeks. It's about power and impotence, sanity and madness, image and reality, selfishness and sacrifice, and - yes - consequences. It has often been said that Tim Burton's vision of Batman was the darkest representation we were ever likely to see of a superhero. Compared to how Nolan sees the character, Burton's version was a pantomime. For many long-running franchises, Burton's included, the second volume stands tallest. Nolan has followed up on his gritty and successful Batman Begins with one of the best all-time sequels, and perhaps the most impressive mainstream entertainment experience since 2003's The Return of the King. The Dark Knight builds upon the themes and premises founded three years ago. With the introductions and origins dispensed with in Batman Begins, Nolan uses this opportunity to expand upon his portrait of Batman as a haunted individual who, driven by forces rooted deep in his psyche, must dispense justice according to his own strict code. Following his defeat of Ra's Al Ghul at the end of Batman Begins, Batman (Christian Bale) has become a mythical figure in Gotham City. The Caped Crusader, as he is now known, is the city's great hope, although the debate rages as to whether he is more hero or menace. There are copycat ""Batmen,"" as well - vigilantes who wear similar costumes but whose methods are crude. Batman's nocturnal activities are taking a heavy toll on Gotham's organized crime syndicates, and things take a turn for the worse when the new D.A., Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), decides to take them on rather than turn a blind eye or take a payment. Abetted by incorruptible police lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Dent meets with Batman and the two come to an understanding about how to proceed in this war against crime. But a new threat is rising in the form of a sadistic lunatic called The Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers to become the mob's enforcer in the pursuit of a single goal: chaos. And this brings him squarely into conflict with the city's black-costumed guardian. To Batman, he makes one demand: remove the mask and turn himself in or the streets will run red with blood. When Bruce Wayne's identity remains secret, The Joker makes good on his word. Of the newcomers, the Joker is the biggest addition. One could argue that it's impossible to make a Batman series without facing the main character against the Joker at some point. No superhero and villain are more inextricably linked. Yet this Joker is unlike any we have previously encountered. Cesar Romero's interpretation of the character (in the '60s TV series) was that of a deadly prankster. Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance made 1989's Batman all about the bad guy. The late Heath Ledger, however, gives us something darker and more twisted - a role that would have been no less memorable had it not been his last and most grueling. There's nothing humorous about this freak. No flowery lines like ""You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?"" This is no caricature - The Joker is a frighteningly vicious and intelligent monster who represents a legitimate match for the title character. For all of the heavy lifting done by the movie's screenplay, dealing as it does with substantive issues and existential questions, there's still plenty of the meat-and-potatoes content of any superhero movie: action sequences. There are numerous fights, chases, and races. The Batmobile gets its share of screen time as does a new Bat-cycle. Batman takes on bad guys singly and in bunches. And there's a heart-pounding sequence in which the Caped Crusader must race against time to save a life, where the price is almost as terrible if he succeeds as if he fails. Nolan's inherent sense of how to transform a relatively mundane fight scene into something involving is in evidence here, much as was the case in Batman Begins. He avoids flash editing and allows the action to evolve in a coherent manner, drawing the viewer in rather than keeping him guessing what's going on. The Dark Knight, a film so impressive in every significant facet that it makes one wonder why it took so long for the genre to reach this high level.",1
1243,This is by far the best film your watch in a very very long time it is by far the greatest comic book movie of all time it simply cannot be beat from Heath Ledger's performance to Christian Bale as Batman bad ass. It is a wonderful movie crime drama thriller with the greatest villain of all time. Perfect hope you enjoy it.,1

1246,"The Dark Knight is simply the best movie that exist today, thanks for its passion and love for filmmaking that Nolan did alongside with the rest of the crew that was doing everything in order to make it a perfect movie. We as viewers got to witness some of the best performances from Health Ledger as the Joker and Gary Oldman as Gordon, it was truly special to watch. What is so unique about this Batman movie is that it does not feel like a typical Batman movie, but a psychological crime drama mixed with a dark story. Christopher Nolan knew that bringing too much CGI could destroy the quality of the film so he chose to go for a realistic Batman movie and it just worked so well! The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard are absoutely brilliant that really matched with the movie's dark twisted theme. The movie is the closest as flawless you can get, and possible the best movie ever made in history of cinema.",1
1247,"Thanks to Haeth Ledger's terrific interpretation and Christopher Nolan's professional direction and production, The Dark Knight is an eficent; action-packed and tention-full film that cannot follow in a better way to its predecessors.",1
1248,"Having memorably explored the Caped Crusader’s origins in “Batman Begins,” director Christopher Nolan puts all of Gotham City under a microscope in “The Dark Knight,” the enthralling second installment of his bold, bracing and altogether heroic reinvention of the iconic franchise. An ambitious, full-bodied crime epic of gratifying scope and moral complexity, this is seriously brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every expectation raised by its hit predecessor and then some. That should also hold true at the box office, with Heath Ledger’s justly anticipated turn as the Joker adding to the must-see excitement surrounding the Warner Bros. release. With the Bruce Wayne/Batman backstory firmly established, “The Dark Knight” fans out to take a broader perspective on Gotham City — portrayed as a seething cauldron of interlocking power structures and criminal factions in the densely layered but remarkably fleet screenplay by helmer Nolan and brother Jonathan (stepping in for “Batman Begins’” David S. Goyer, who gets a story credit). Using five strongly developed characters to anchor a drama with life-or-death implications for the entire metropolis, the Nolans have taken Bob Kane’s comicbook template and crafted an anguished, eloquent meditation on ideas of justice and power, corruption and anarchy and, of course, the need for heroes like Batman — a question never in doubt for the viewer, but one posed rather often by the citizens of Gotham. Indeed, with trusty Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, superbly restrained) and golden-boy District Attorney Harvey Dent (a cocksure Aaron Eckhart) successfully spearheading the city’s crackdown on the mob, even Wayne himself (Christian Bale) figures his nights moonlighting as a leather-clad vigilante are numbered. The young billionaire hopes to hang up the Batsuit for good and renew his relationship with assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, an immediate improvement over Katie Holmes), who has taken up with Dent in the meantime. But Batman’s stature as a radical symbol of good has invited a more sinister criminal presence to Gotham City — and, as seen in the crackerjack bank-robbery sequence that opens the pic, one who operates in terrifyingly unpredictable ways. Utterly indifferent to simple criminal motivations like greed, Ledger’s maniacally murderous Joker is as pure an embodiment of irrational evil as any in modern movies. He’s a pitiless psychopath who revels in chaos and fears neither pain nor death, a demonic prankster for whom all the world’s a punchline. After Ledger’s death in January, his penultimate performance (with Terry Gilliam’s “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus” still to come) will be viewed with both tremendous excitement and unavoidable sadness. It’s a tribute to Ledger’s indelible work that he makes the viewer entirely forget the actor behind the cracked white makeup and blood-red rictus grin, so complete and frightening is his immersion in the role. With all due respect to the enjoyable camp buffoonery of past Jokers like Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Ledger makes them look like — well, clowns. The pic shrewdly positions the Joker as the superhero-movie equivalent of a modern terrorist (one of several post-9/11 signifiers), who threatens to target Gotham civilians until Batman reveals his identity. Batman, Gordon and Dent uneasily join forces, but the Joker seems to have the upper hand at every step, even from a jail cell; the city, turning against the hero it once looked to for hope, seems more fractious, vulnerable and dangerous than ever. Though more linear than “Memento” and “The Prestige” (both also co-scripted by the Nolans), “The Dark Knight” pivots with similar ingenuity on a breathless series of twists and turns, culminating in a dramatic shift for Dent. This subplot reps the film’s weakest link, packing too much psychological motivation into too little screen time to be entirely credible. Yet Eckhart vividly inhabits the character’s sad trajectory, underscoring the film’s point that symbols of good can be all too easily tarnished. Viewers who found “Batman Begins” too existentially weighty for its own good will be refreshed to know that “The Dark Knight” hits the ground running and rarely lets up over its swift 2½-hour running time. Nolan directs the action more confidently than he did the first time out, orchestrating all manner of vertiginous mid-air escapes and virtuosic highway setpieces (and unleashing Batman’s latest ooh-ah contraption, the monster-truck-tire-equipped Bat-Pod). In a fresh innovation, six sequences were shot using Imax cameras, and will presumably look smashing in the giant-screen format (pic was reviewed from a 35mm print). Plus a fantastic moody score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. A superhero crime epic saga. Loved to hear that Chris Nolan is also a big fan of Heat which inspired a majority of the film.",1

This director's Gotham City may be less garish and gothic than Burton's, but it is in many ways a bleaker and more oppressive place. It's a joyless venue and the hero takes his demeanor from his city. Batman is a grim, brooding superhero.

1250,"Nolan is the only director that can pick up a superhero franchise and not only make it believable as also turn it into a cult film. The Dark Knight, second of the trilogy and the best by far, is an accomplishment reachable only by one of the best of all time Mr. Chris Nolan. Joker twisted, psycho and anarchist mind brilliantly executed by Heath Ledger, most likely to reason for him to commit suicide, fills every corner of this film. The well deserved Posthumous Oscar for a best supporting role for a superhero is a statement to Ledger's performance. The dark noir tone of this film combined with Joker's mind as well as the dark twitch present in the film leaves you with a sense of emptiness but also hope. Here lies the beauty of this film, the mixed feelings you get, the struggle between good and evil and where does it come the grey area. The Oscar for best movie would never go to Dark Knight, no idea why always thought the category was best movie and not best drama movie, however this is without any doubt the best move of 2008 and the one of the best of all time.

Christian Bale has become the first Batman where it matters which actor is under the cowl. Keaton, Kilmer, and Clooney were all interchangeable when wearing the Bat-suit. Not so with Bale, who owns the role. His presence in the costume is forceful in a way that none of his predecessors achieved. Michael Caine's Alfred acts not only as Bruce Wayne's butler but as his conscience. Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) is Batman's version of ""Q."" Indeed, there's a scene in The Dark Knight that could have been lifted from one of many James Bond films. Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon, who wasn't too sure about Batman for much of the first film, is now fully on board as his unofficial liaison to the police force. Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes remains the girl who got away, the woman whose promise of a normal, happy life provides Wayne with hope for the future. For The Dark Knight, Maggie Gyllenhaal has replaced Katie Holmes, but the change in actress isn't a detriment. Gyllenhaal is a better actress and makes the character her own from her first scene. Of the newcomers, the Joker is the biggest addition. One could argue that it's impossible to make a Batman series without facing the main character against the Joker at some point. No superhero and villain are more inextricably linked. Yet this Joker is unlike any we have previously encountered. The other major character to join the ensemble is Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's charismatic, photogenic D.A. Harvey Dent is Gotham's Knight in Shining Armor, and that's how Eckhart plays him - an individual with a pure heart who makes his own luck. Those even passingly familiar with Batman lore know Dent's fate, and it plays out here as one might suspect, although Nolan puts a different spin on things than did Joel Schumacher. For all of the heavy lifting done by the movie's screenplay, dealing as it does with substantive issues and existential questions, there's still plenty of the meat-and-potatoes content of any superhero movie: action sequences.

1252,"Dark and twisted, but mezmorising and memorable, The Dark Knight is the finest movie to ever include superheroes or superhero themes, and unlikely to ever be beaten. A true masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. I can not go any further without discussing Heath Ledger. His portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of unbelievable, and the lengths that you can tell he went to just to bring do that character justice need to be applauded. An exceptional piece of acting brilliance, some of the finest acting you will ever see. Christian Bale is, once again, a solid Batman. Michael Caine is such a loveable Alfred, which is also matched by Morgan Freeman's Fox. Other performances also worth mentioning is Gary Oldman, who you are routing for from start to finish, as well as great debuts in the series from Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, and Aaron Ekhart as Harvey Dent. The movie's original score is outstanding, and a real credit to the composers there. The atmosphere throughout the whole movie is dark and slightly hopeless, thanks to the presence of Joker, but this adds to what is an incredibly well written story. A scene in particular between Bale's Batman and Ledger's Joker is outstanding, and so well written it will have every movie-goer on the edge of their seat. If you haven't seen The Dark Knight, make it happen. Seriously.",1
1253,"Joker Joker Joker, this is what you heard a lot about  ""The Dark Knight"" which is obviously true. Heath Ledger`s Joker is one of the greatest anti-hero or what i call bad-man characters and besides that one of the best performance that an actor could perform (don`t you agreed?), but this is not the only strong point of the film; Nolan`s superhero is more human like despite what we seeing these days (i write this in march 2016) of so called super mega heros that you can not do anything to them!I think this will be enough.",1
1254,"Not gonna lie, my favourite movie of all time, wtached it for my birthday in the cinema , and I was astonished 8 years ago, and everytime I watch now.The whole cast is awesome, Bale is my favourite Batman as he gives a deep look inside the man behind the caped crusader, Oldman was perfect, Freeman and Caine served almost as comic reliefs, Eckhart's Dent is simply breathtaking. And are there any words to describe Ledger's acting ? Well, a brief sentence maybe : The best acting performance in modern day cinema history.But what I liked most that Nolan made Batman accesible, touchable and feelable for the first time, it's not like near.superhuman.being like Ben Affleck's Batman in BvS, it's the very first time a vigilante seemed exceedingly vulnerable, less physically than mentally or pyschologically of course. The realistic set-up of the Nolanverse truly suprised and fascinated , as for the bery first time, I felt like "" yes, all of this could this exist in real life too "", which really made me think a lot about it. Nolan deserves true respect for truning it into a realisitc set-up so flawlessly, he already did it in Batman Begins, but he has stepped up the game for this sequel like no one else. I think it wil take a quite long time for any superhero movie to beat ""The Dark Knight"", simply because almost everything about this movie is perfect. And yes , BAtman sounds like he has throat cancer, but if I was criminal, I would be afraid of a the best detetctive in the world who is a trained ninja, has awesome gadgets, looks menacing and beats other ciriminals to pulp, plus sounbds like he has a serious disease in his throat area",1

The Joker's s viewpoint on chaos, order, anarchy, morality of an average human being is a key example of what I'm trying to explain. This film surpasses all the superhero flicks we get today because of complexity it has to offer to it's characters and plot.

Also, Christian Bale seems more conflicted, yet strangely confident as Bruce Wayne/Batman offering more weight to his character. We finally get to see that there is more to Bruce than ""the hero that Gotham needs, but doesn't necessarily want"". His conflict is internal, but also external in some way. That aside, this film is a genuine masterpiece.",1
1267,"THE BEST SUPER HERO FILM EVER. This film is so incredible that it deserves oscars from every direction, after the success of Batman Begins, I was afraid that the sequel would not be able to deliver a good enough meaning. I was wrong, this film defined greatness when it came to pictures. This super hero movie is a rare film that drills deep inside the character and the script more than the action. The Dark Knight dares to be more than it should be. It transcends the barriers of being labelled a ""Batman movie"" or ""superhero movie"" by excelling in all areas: character, plot, action, writing, acting, directing. The Dark Knight is not for fans of Batman or fans of serious drama. It is a film for everyone and stands as one of the most important films of the decade. However it isn't the director or The Dark Knight himself who made this film what it is. Its HEATH LEDGER. Unfortunately after his death, he was never able to witness what he had created, and that many people loved this and that it was one of the best creations in the super hero genre. Heath Ledgers joker is by far one of the best Jokers we have seen. Its hard to say that any other joker could beat him. The shear direction of this film was incredible.Overall: 9.5/10",1
1268,"This is Joker movie, and its outstanding, Ledger was fantastic and created a credible version; and gave such a realistic take of the Joker that makes the character more plausible in real life than batman himself.",1
1269,"Heath Ledger as Joker was the spotlight of this movie and kicked Batman into the curb with his acting. Don't get me wrong, Batman's acting was still really good, but compared to Joker, he was not the best. But this movie and it's almost non-stop action is perfect along with it's story was very interesting. I would definitely recommend this movie!",1
1270,"The best super hero movie ever made in my opinion.  The joker is fantastic.  The final scene can drag a little bit, but the way this movie ends is amazing.  I'm not sure how people can rate this movie so low.  The story is great, making it seem like batman could actually exist making this movie borderline non fiction.  I love how Bruce Wayne even tries to fight crime on two fronts, one during the day with politics and the other being at night as the caped crusader.  Amazing movie, it is a must watch.",1
1271,"One of the best DC films ever made, slightly overrated but still a great film nonetheless despite its flaws such as the long runtime that drags on towards the end and illogical decisions that many of the characters, mainly the cops, make in the film.",1
1272,"This movie is very close to perfect, it does so many things right. The paceing of the movie was near perfect, making sure that enough was explanied before moving on to a different problem in the movie, but also, leaving enough for the viewer too think of what just happened. The movie also set in the theme of dark versus light very well, but by the end of the movie questioning what was immoral and what was left just in the world. The movie also gave us a set of characters that we could love and really care for and actively worry weather they lived or died. And best of all was the acting. Every actor in this movie seemed to poor their souls into this film but, the shining star of the film was Heath Leadger as the Joker. He stole the show and if anythjng is the one reasson you should watch this movie.",1
1273,"best batman movie there is imo. especially the best joker ever, the dark humor and dark filming style suits the batman franchise the best. Its the saddest thing in movie history that we can not have another movie with this joker",1
1274,"Probably the greatest superhero film of all time.  Rarely do you see this level of cinematography, acting, and depth in a superhero film.  Must-Watch.",1
1275,Let's all take a moment to appreciate how amazing did Heath Ledger act as the Joker.Maybe he hasn't got the voice like Mark Hamil but he did it better then anyone.The movie was awesome and it's my favorite super hero movie.,1
1276,"I never had a chance to appreciate this movie when i was little, but after re-watching it after 8 years, i finally realize the brilliance of this movie. The story is brilliant, the acting and dialogue is superb and of course, Heath Ledger Joker is amazing! I've never seen a superhero movie that can surpass this masterpiece. Simply one of the best movie ever!",1
1277,"Even more darker than known, with a psychotic, deranged Joker performed masterly by tragic Heath Ledger. Christian Bale excels himself with a non-heroic dark knight, obligued to hard dillemas. A must have for fans.",1
1278,"What an adaptation. One of the most top rated adaptations that makes it the greatest of all time, it pays attention to an iconic villain we've wanted to meet but Nicholson is still with us on the other hand.",1
1279,"Dark Knight (2008) is one of the best movies of this century. With a score of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, the rest of the casual movie watchers and reviewers think like I do. The well know, comic book superhero known by many as Batman is brought to life on the big screen, but this time with a more dark and realistic tone. The movie is masterfully sculpted with extremely talented actors and overall plot.In a city that is flooded with crime and evil known as Gotham, the people are searching for a savior. Billionaire Bruce Wayne slips on his all black armor and gadgets at night to become the no-powered crime fighting superhero that the city deserves, but Batman believes that the city needs to be saved by more than a masked vigilante. So district attorney Harvey Dent is there to be Gotham’s light knight. Dent and Batman have one more ally in Jim Gordon, Gotham’s police commissioner. Together they try to mop up the scum from the streets. Unfortunately, the world that they live in changes before them. Along comes the Joker. Nobody knows who he is or where he came from; all they know is that Joker is a mentally unstable, agent of chaos that kills for fun. This criminal mastermind seems to have jurisdiction, yet is always one step ahead of the police force and Batman. Joker’s character will really make you question reality and the difference between right and wrong.All of the actors do their parts extremely well, but Heath Ledger stands out in a pack of stars. We get to watch Heath Ledger during his best performance of his career. Ledger really put his heart and soul into his portrayal as the Joker. For instance, cast members have even stated that Ledger locked himself in a motel room for an entire month to get into character. Keeping track of written sinister notebooks and laughing at himself in the mirror for hours in order to get the Jokers cackle just right. After the movie was released, Heath Ledger died on January 22, 2008. Most say “it was the character that killed the actor” believing that he put his life into the role. In 2009, Heath Ledger won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It takes a special breed of actor to become a unpredictable, criminal mastermind with little jurisdiction, but I believe that Heath Ledger knocked it out of the park.The Dark Knight was a masterpiece. It seemed to be a cross of the comic book hero Batman, mixed with Interstellar and Criminal Minds. Gotham is dark and scary. The characters are well developed with great dialogue between each other. The action scenes are thrilling, and there seems to be a list of memorable scenes just from this one movie. Although this is definitely not a movie for young kids, and the viewers have to think a bit to figure out the serious and philosophical meaning of the plot, I would recommend this to anyone that loves superheroes and/or a great action thriller.Words cannot even describe how brilliant and thrilling this movie is. You will have to watch it yourself. The extremely talented actors and never ending excitement of the story line make this one of the best movies of all time.",1
1280,"IMO the best superhero movie in existence. Usually when I tell someone I like a movie, they think it sucks and I have to give them a full rundown and explanation of why the movie DOESN'T suck, and my movie reviews end up being super-long for the same reason. I don't think that will be necessary for TDK. The amazing director Christopher Nolan has done it again. Most people will agree this is not only one of if not THE best superhero movies, but also recognized by many to be one of the best movies ever, period. Not just because of its dark cynical twisted essence, or its great storytelling and plot, but because of how iconic and revolutionary this film is. Also, three words: Heath Ledger's Joker. The movie may be about Batman, but Ledger is easily the best part of the film, giving one of the most legendary spot-on performances in all of cinema. Simply put, TDK is a 10/10 film. If you haven't watched it yet (which isn't likely) then DO IT.",1
1281,"This is the first DC movie that I liked. Up until this point all DC movies I've watched are subpar at best. This one was fantastic. I never expected Joker to be that great of a villain. The plot is also surprisingly good for DC standards. As a Marvel fan and a DC disliker (at least up until this point), I am impressed. Hope ""The Dark Knight Rises"" dont disappoint.",1
1282,"An absolute masterpiece, the cinematography in this movie was on point, heath Ledger's Joker has been one of the greatest interpretations of a character i've ever seen, The soundtrack was absolutely epic (especially songs like ""A Watchful Guardian"" and ""Like A Dog Chasing Cars"") and although Christian Bale's Batman is not as interesting as other characters (like Harvey Dent and The joker) he still does not disappoint, at all, although i have to say that one of the only problems i have with this movie is the ending, i just dont get why batman decided to take the blame for harvey dent's death, i mean they could've blamed The joker, but all of that just goes away with comissioner Gordon's speech at the end, everything about that speech is absolutely epic, this movie is dark,gritty,thrilling, entertaining and over all realistic which is how a superhero movie (specially a batman movie) should be, and yes, this movie is not perfect, but is as close to perfect as a movie can get.",1
1283,"This movie is the best superhero movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It is a pure masterpiece of cinema, as well as the superhero genre. I don't want to giv anything away, but you should watch it now.",1
1284,"The Dark Knight is not only the best comic book movie of all time, but it is one of the best movies of all time, in general. Heath Ledger was amazing. Everyone else did a spot on job, as well.",1
1285,"The BEST movie ever made, great effects and sounds, the ambiance is AMAZING and...The Ledger Joker !The Dark Knight was a very intense action movie, with a very good choice of actors.",1
1286,"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, a sequel to Batman Begins. I'm a huge fan of the director, his vision, the scope for his films are truly stunning. His storytelling skills to me are masterful and honestly this movie views as a psychological, drama, thriller. From the start to the end, you'd be on the edge of your feet. All the actors brought their A+ game, Christian Bale's performance was electrifying, and Heath ledger's performance as the Joker was absolutely terrific. HEATH LEDGER'S JOKER stole the show, he was sinister & frightening, gripping to watch. Brilliant work from Christoper Nolan.",1
1287,"Rewatching this 10 years later, it's interesting to see how the strengths of character and script outweigh continuity errors (my favorite is the 28 caliber Chinese pistol Dent takes off a thug in a courtroom-3 continuity errors in 1 instant).  Never for an moment is this movie less than enthralling.  You could put a clock next to the tv and watch it fly by.  I particularly like how the camera never lingers for a second, once the message of the scene is carried, boom next.  I think this movie is, above all, a triumph of editing.  You never question for a second where we are or what we are set up for.  Cuts of cityscapes are especially effective at cleansing the palette for the next plot maneuver.  Most notable in this movie are what is absent.  Joker has no definite origin in this movie even though the story is taken from the same source as this year's Joker, which was totally an origin story about a failed comedian.  Batman and Joker in this story both wrestle with their own origins, debating themselves how they came to be who they are, the question is more important than the answer in every case.  The Joker is a study in flawed narrative, remembering his past however suits the occasion.  Batman reinterprets himself, changing his armor and tactics to suit the occasion.  Both are dealing with loss and identity in in their own ways.  Joker, being narcissistic, seeks to alter reality to suit his goals.  Of course, like every narcissist, his goal is always to get attention-never to succeed.  Batman, being codependent, changes himself to suit the needs of those around him. Both have something to learn from one another.  If Batman could learn to be more selfish and Joker learn to be more considerate, each could try to repair the broken world they live in without making it worse.Roger Ebert said this movie is a study in how morals become sacrificed in attempting to justify the ends, and the only real winner is the Joker, who just wants to see destruction.The end of the movie has a wonderful message.  All people really need is to hate the person who looks out for them, so the Joker had the ultimate victory.  I guess that explains why people love the Joker so much.  It really is a depressing movie.",1
1288,"The Batman movie we needed and we got it. Even if the ending conclusion didn't make much sense it was beautiful and encouraging. Also the way, Heath Ledger was playing the Joker should be remembered in history of the film industry.",1
1289,Without a doubt the great director Christopher Nolan has brought us a great movie of the best in history and will undoubtedly remain in our hearts as the best movie of superheroes ever performed.For my opinion many comic-based movies that do in the future can not match the great performance of Christian Bale in the trilogy and the late Heath Ledger as the epic and beautiful Joker 10/10 The best Movie of Superhero,1

1295,Perhaps the best argument towards the illegitimacy of the Academy Awards. The fact that The Reader gets Best Picture / Best Director / Best Adapted Screenplay nominations while all this gets is a bunch of technical awards + Ledger's Oscar shows how the Academy is unable to put away biases and just select the best films of the year. Unequivocally the best superhero movie of all time and the movie from 2008 that everyone will remember when they think of films from that year. As perfect a movie as you can make.,1
1296,Basically a Scorsese film but with Batman. If that doesn't sound good enough throw in a manic central performance by Heath Ledger and a screenplay that elevates every character's performance into an operatic stratosphere. The high standard for a superhero adaptation.,1
1297,"I love this movie very much. This is an example of a good movie. Christofer Nolan is a genius of his work. The plot is very interested and exciting. The actors played their roles so magnifisent. Hans Zimmer wrote one of the best soundtracks in the world. I love this and listen often. So, I haven't any words to say about this masterwork and ""The Dark Knight"" gets 10 of 10!",1

1300,"This movie somewhat baffles me with how it gets ranked as ""one of the best movies of all time.""  Yes, it's a great movie, but it just downright makes me rant every time about I hear about it.  The reason I don't think this is one of the best movies is that I hate the character of Rachel.  They weren't able to master her in Batman Begins, and they weren't able to master her in this installment either.  Even if you avoid the acting of the actors playing said character, she felt so much like an unnatural plot device that I was getting irritated by how she was influencing the decisions of our characters.  When we get past that point, this movie is actually pretty phenomenal.  The directing of the action sequences, the cinematography, the writing,  and the perfect Nolan everything-thing-is-practical adds that flare you just can't get with CGI.  I would have given this a 100 if the character of Rachel wasn't so downright irritating and unbearable.  This is definitely the best superhero movies of all time, and is no doubt a ""Nolan Classic"".85/100",1

Batman Begins was a great watch, but this gorgeously crafted piece of art will amaze you until death. From the acting to the dark characters I cannot explain in words in how entrancing this film will spiral you towards. A movie cannot just be put into a category of masterpiece, but this is the closest I have reviewed one. People who generally dislike comic books will come to realize how a film adaptation of it is spectacularly made. The Sam Raimi trilogy of Spiderman movies was truly the first good take on a superhero film, but this will completely pull you into the expanding universe of comic book movie adaptations.",1

1314,"Undoubtedly the best superhero movie till this date. Dark theme, creative plot, ingenious acting; simply put this movie doesn't lack in anything at all. The director and the screenwriters deserve a big round of applause for their creation. As Matrix revolutionalized the scifi-action genre, The Dark Knight surely revolutionalized the superhero genre. The DC comic stream have always had deeper philosophies than their competitors and it was about time one of their movie adaptations had also. Usually, the comic based movies depend a lot more on stunts, action sequences and visual effects rather than captivating plot sequence or sophisticated philosophies. The Dark Knight has all of them. Though it portrayed both the protagonist and the antagonist differently than the comics; in the end, all of it turned out to be great.",1

1318,"The laugh rolls down a tear and tear, a satisfying shock, a film attempting to reach all the levels of the emotions, succeeds on all of them; that has got to be rare.The Dark KnightNolan's Hamlet-alike Batman is a wise old soul that has reached a place and places a stone so deep and so illuminating that it almost feels unfathomable to be touched or even seen. Continuing the legacy of The Dark Knight comics, Nolan explored the aftermath of a vigilante marking justice with his bare hands in the previous chapter. Ergo, this season is politically influenced, challenged and correct. Above all the intricacies of the plots suggested in this crime saga, my personal favorite, is how human this said-superhero is treated.With clean crime comes a clean film. Compared to the previous adventure of the Batman, the action is crisp, smart and a complete fanatic of itself. Take the characters, for instance. On what stage and state they are in. The reason I'd like to think, they all fail and never were ever going to reach the salvation they hope for, is because they barely are thinking about others. And here comes the final Nolan touch. All the ""bad guys"" of the film are actually thinking about others. Their ideologies hence remains above our heroes and their deeds not so much.And hence emerges, one of the finest and sensible villains, the history of cinema has ever encountered. The Joker played hungrily by Heath Ledger will stay timeless for both its performance and what it leaves and breathes for. And they are the questions, his cheats and lies, are actually vital questions that whips us now, just as they did then and they will in the future. For there is no definite answer or any answer that Nolan is throwing out in the world, it can float untouched in a bubble as much as you like. Personally, I felt Harvey Dent played like a bad boyfriend by Aaron Echart, has a last act that exceeds the Joker's final bluff in the game. Probably because the Joker's is a question- which comes in early- and Dent has a cold answer that no one wants to hear. And since his crux of the trick feeds on the last moment, watching those three wrong-doers play a game of chance feels like the best note to end a film on.",1
1319,"Batman Begins focused more on the figure of Batman. Dark Knight focuses more on the figure of Gotham and his other characters and ambitions, such as Dent or Jocker himself.Technically Dark Knight is superior to Begins in practically every aspect. Personally I stay with Batman Begins, which I personally think evokes more feelings to the viewer, but objectively Dark Knight is superior.",1

It's been 10 years and STILL, people talk about The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight rivals The Avengers as to which comic book movie changed the game of the genre.With The Avengers, it showed how you can build an entire cinematic universe around individual characters just to have them come together and fight alongside each other.With The Dark Knight, it showed that comic book movies could go the extra mile, doing different things that you wouldn't expect from the genre. It's been called the comic book movie that even people who don't like comic book movies will watch.The Dark Knight takes the Batman character and puts him in situations that are not only very dangerous, but with a little pressure from The Joker (played brilliantly by Heath Ledger), it puts the main hero in a situation that has him questioning his own morals.The Dark Knight is the gold standard for superhero movies, rivaled only by (in my opinion) its other two installments and 2017's Logan.",1

1323,"This is the second film of the Christopher Nolan's trilogy, and here Batman will face one of his most famous villains: Joker. The film has screenplay by Christopher Nolan (who also ensures the direction) and Jonathan Nolan. It has the participation of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger.This film follows on from ""Batman Begins"", keeping more or less the same team and achieving a good unit with the previous film, which prevented the great continuity failures that infest sequels and sequential films. This is an psychological action movie with great scenes, dramatic moments and a good dose of special visual and sound effects that help to intensify the events but manage to avoid having too much prominence. The actors were up to the challenge and toasted the audience with flawless performances, although there aren't able to surprise as much as the first film. Aaron Eckhart deserves congratulations by giving his character a very particular and intense psychological wealth and Bale, one of the actors that stands out naturally by having the leading role, makes a very complete performance, worthy of an actor who has reached maturity and eagerly want to fight for stardom and the massive recognition. Congratulations. But this cast was almost overshadowed by a thunderous Heath Ledger. This actor wore the coat of Joker perfectly, embodying a character who has undergone a great reevaluation in this film, and that Ledger, with this sublime performance, will probably mark for decades. It was the best farewell to this actor, a promise of Hollywood that we never get to see develop due to his sudden death.",1
1324,(97/100)The Dark Knight is the most emotional movie that I've ever watched. To believe in someone so much because he is a fighter for the greater good and even going as far as to save him instead of your own ex-girlfriend and than seeing darkness consume him and turn him evil is so heart breaking. Heath Ledgers performance is the best performance I've ever seen.,1
1325,"The Dark Knight definitely deserves it's spot as the the greatest comic book movie of all time. The best part of Nolan's Trilogy is that each film feels different, with this film it feels like an action thriller or suspense as this film has you waiting on what The Joker does next. And let's talk about The Joker this was the film that introduced us to Heath Ledger's amazing performance with a portrayal retaining his psychopathic tendencies and adding enough to make the character his own. This film has many elements that make it great which is why if you haven't seen it I suggest that you go out and see it right now",1

It's more of a crime/thriller movie than a superhero movie that change the superhero gerne into a new big step and one of Christopher Nolan best.

1327,"This grim and dark film transcends The Dark Knight above super hero films, and truly making it into a league of its own. Its constant climaxes and edge of your seat action, Nolan truly created something special. Ledger is a memorable Joker that brings a very real and dark twist to the movie. It shows a true chaotic view of the world, and it truly gives our super hero the challenge that would rise against him. Christian Bale makes Batman feel more real and relatable, and does an excellent job of portraying the highs and lows of living a double life of pain and commitment. The Dark Knight is more than just a super hero film, its a crime drama, and it's arguably the best.",1

I do wish that the final fight with the Joker was a bit better, but there are really no flaws with this movie...just tiny little things that don't have any serious impact on how good it is. The acting is absolutely incredible, the story is riveting, and it's a Nolan film so of course it looks great. I'll never get tired of watching this film.",1

1334,"The dark knight is a monument to the cinema, where the performance of the joker and the action makes the show totally enjoyable, it is perhaps one of the 5 best movies of the 2000s",1
1335,"some part of me actually hates this whole trilogy because every new superhero movie that comes out now, i end up hating it because of how groundbreaking this trilogy was. masterpiece. thank you Nolan.",1
1336,"Dejando a un lado la perfecta actuacion de heath ledger. Esta película no es es tal vez la mejor pelicula del genero de superheroes de la historia, al principio parace una obra unica, sabe manejar el ritmo del suspenso cuando el guason va a actuar, sabe escribir distintos temas en una trama en la que los propios personajes se ven reflejados en esto y en el fondo hace parecer a un maniatico como el guason y lo convierte en un hombre con filosofia coherente, no aceptable pero coherente. Nolan por primera vez que veo en sus peliculas se dja de exposicion al publico, en explicar todo los que esta pasando y creo que no es necesario porque Quien no conoce a batman? Aunque tampoco lo hace todo bien solo hace falta mirar con mas detencion y empiezan asalir varios fallos. Uno de ellos es que el director fuerza al guion hace pasar todo por conveniencia para que la trama se de, no deja fluir con naturalidad para que todo a sido palneado para que suceda asi. El caballero oscuro es una de mis peliculas favoritas pero no es perfecta para ser excelente pero si es muy buena, la recomiendo si eres fan de batman y si no igual te va a gustar.",1
1337,"The Dark Knight takes what its predecessor, Batman Begins, did so well and improves upon it. All the actors are great, including the recasting of the character Rachel Dawes, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. But, the standout performance is, by far, Heath Ledger as the Joker, who has an Oscar to prove it. This villain is so compelling because he is different from other villains in that he doesn't have a clear motive, which is all the more fascinating. Heath Ledger nailed this character, and it payed off hugely. The tone is edgy and dark, like Batman Begins, and it works so well in this movie. You can tell that Christopher Nolan knew what all the other previous Batman movies had done wrong, and corrected it. This movie is a masterpiece and, even if you don't watch this genre, you should still view it because this movie is truly amazing.",1
1338,"the first outstanding superhero movie tells us about a hero not just to be hero, sacrifice a trust to save all people, how to be keep in people heart in place, makes sense how to use a opportunity/advantages from brick to brick, from minimum to maximum crime saga, and make antagonist wins with logically process screenplayall about this movie are almost perfectly to tells us how to be People of Justice or Chaos",1

The acting is great, the visual effects are stunning and hold up very well today, and the characters are the best. Joker and Harvey Dent are the best characters in the movie. I love what the Joker did to Harvey on the 3rd act. Batman himself is badass. Just everything about this movie is badass and amazing.",1
1346,"This is the best superhero movie of all time, and one of the best movies that I´ve seen.",1

1348,"It doesn't get any better than The Dark Knight for a superhero movie, I could write a thousand words about it but I'll keep it simple, The Dark Knight is the best movie you'll find in the genre, there are only a handful of movies that I think are must-see for all audiences, and this is one of them.",1
1349,"The Dark Knight has great cast, very good acting - highlighting Heath Ledger -, excellent cinematography, speciel effects and sound mixing, editing and design, and a different, complex and very well-elaborated plot that most of super-hero movies lack. It's a very intelligent blockbuster which escapes a little bit from the cliché and predictability of many Hollywood works. It's no surprise that will be considered one of the best super-hero comic book adaptations of all time.",1

1352,"The Best Batman Movie to be put on Screen, One of the Best Villains of All Time (A.K.A. The Joker), And Christopher Nolan's Best Movie of All time, And it will definitely be one of the best Superhero Movies.",1
1353,"BEST superhero film (until now). It’s about The Battle for Gotham City, in which the Joker puts at test Batman not just physically and mentally, but ethically, he makes him question his only rule, while trying to corrupt Gotham’s White Knight(Harvey Dent), since he’s Gotham’s beacon of hope, because the Joker is not a a physical threat, but one to Gotham’s only hope. In the end the Joker is the one who truly wins, because he corrupted Gotham’s White Knight an even if they keep it as a secret he turned the people of Gotham against it’s own protector.Best superhero film (until now).Awesome acting from Christian Bale to Aaron Eckhart, but specially and definitely the best actor in the Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy and in 2008 Heath Ledger, INCREDIBLY GOOD story, character development special effects an PERFECT pacing. TRULY A MASTERPIECE!",1
1354,"Tim Burton's Batman may have established both Batman and the superhero genre as mainstream blockbusters, but the dark knight is the film that perfected superhero cinema. The Dark Knight is a rare example of a film that manages to stray a little from the source material but still be just as effective as the stories it is based on. The Dark Knight proves that Batman and the Joker are timeless characters that we as a society may never forget.LETS PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE!",1
1355,"The Dark Knight is one of the greatest films of all time. Well in my opinion. But a lot of people agree. The dialog is the perfect blend of comedy and serious, the action scenes are brilliantly made and done with perfect visuals and overall they culminate into a cinematic masterpiece.",1

The action is perfect, all acters are perfectly in their roles, the script is amazing, Hans Zimmers score is perfect and the dark tone makes the whole experience even more memorable.

1368,"What an entrance of the Joker. Interesting plot, full of twists. The movie kept its dark, dramatic touch from its prequel while still maintaining humorous elements here and there. Enjoyed it till the end. Was a little annoyed by the drawn out action scenes, but nevertheless one of the best Batman movies.",1

1384,"Easily the best Comic book movie ever made. A simply perfect follow up to the already amazing Batman Begins, The Dark Knights shows us what truly makes Batman tick. The Dark Knight introduces us to the famous performance of the Joker portrayed by the late great Heath Ledger. The Joker is the perfect foil for Batman in this film as he is the complete opposite to him. They say opposites attract and that is completely true here as The Joker's chaotic nature is the perfect antithesis for Batman's strive for justice. Throughout the film Batman is constantly questioning what he stands for and if what he does makes things worst. This sense of self awareness and conflict within the character automatically makes the film better and makes for a more intriguing watch. One aspect that truly makes this film stands out is that its not just a conventional comic book movie. At its core this film is a crime thriller. Delving into the deepest darkest depths of crime and what effects acts of anarchy can have on society. If your a fan of the Batman mythos you will enjoy this film regardless but if you are looking for a smart, well directed and exceptionally acted film you will definitely not regret watching this epic, directed by Christopher Nolan.",1
1385,Nolan has given us one of the best movies of all time. He dared to make a movie that feels realistic and credible. It's simply a masterpiece.,1
1386,"I must say this movie is MASTERPIECE.Brilliant,Amazing,Great,Awesome,Dark,Realistic,Serious.One Of My Fav. 3 Movie.A Movie We Need,But We Don't Deserve.I've Seen This Movie 20 Times Or More I Don't Know.That's How You Made A Great Movie,Musics,Athmosphere,Acting,Storyline One Of The Greatest Piece Of Cinema.",1
1387,"Nolan is a genius. This movie rules on every single **** front. The set up, the subsequent story the follows, the acting, the cinematography, every single bit of this movie is masterfully done and you can feel the amount of thought and love that went into it. I could watch this movie over and over again and never get bored. Possibly the best superhero movie of all time!",1
1388,No words can explain the story behind this. This really is amazing to see such a good performance and it is real.,1
1389,"Best film ever made.Best superhero film, best Batman film.JUST WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE!",1
1390,"The dark knight is what really brought batman to life, people love this movie its very succesful with heath ledger's stunning performance. Batman's no killing rule is focused a lot on this movie and is personally my favourite superhero movie.",1
1391,"This movie is dark and amazing. It dives deep into Batman life. The Joker is the best character in this movie, he sets up everything just to prove to people that it doesn't matter how good a person is everyone can fall.",1
1392,A great follow up to the amazing first movie. Everything about this movie rocks.,1
1393,"The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book films ever made, but one of the greatest films ever made. Acting is amazing, writing is amazing, directing is great, it’s everything you want from a movie.",1
1394,"The movie was decent. A solid 7/10 for acting, 6/10 for the storyline, 8/10 for supporting cast, and 4/10 for the title.Artiiseo",1
1395,"This is the most epic and best version of a Batman movie. This movie showed what good directing can do. We know who batman is and we don't need to watch Batman begins to pick up this movie. But best part of this epic story is The Joker. Heath Ledger turned the clown prince of crime into a terrifying antagonist. He plays so well on batman and even wins at the end of the movie. He creates a perfect enemy for a perfect heroe. This is besides the best comic movie I've ever seen, also one of the best and well written movies of all time. R.I.P Heath Ledger",1
1396,"Two giant thumbs up! It appeals to a wide audience, old and young, those familiar with comics and those not. It has strong characters, a riveting story, great writing, strong emotion, intense scenes and award winning acting. The joker is the perfect amount of dark and comedy. I loved it!",1
1397,"What an amazing movie, the story is brilliant and the actors do more of an amazing job then they did previously in Batman Begins, dont get me wrong they're all amazing in the first one but this one they get way better than they did the first time. Also, Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) does more of an amazing job playing the Cape crusader then he did in the first by his performance and the action scenes which happen with him throughout the movie, speaking of the action scenes they're so good and intense to watch and they make me want to see what happens next throughout this superb movie. Finally, the villains of the movie The Joker (Heath Ledger) is phenomenal, the reasons on how he's phenomenal is on how he gets into the role of the character and another thing which I like about his joker over the others is how he plans to do certain things which might end up killing someone in a certain way but a very joker way, which really adds to his character and this really does make him into one of the best villains out there. The other villain in the movie who is known as Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) is really good throughout this movie he really does get better more into the movie when we get to understand his character a bit more. I almost forgot to mention during the fight scenes the camera work is so smooth during them and its fantastic. I'd honestly say most of the green screen and CGI effects hold up pretty well throughout this amazing movie, the rest of the crew do an amazing job and they make this movie brilliant for what they're given. Overall, I'd honestly say you need to watch this movie as soon as possible because its brilliant and its honesty worth the watch.",1

1399,"it's the best superhero movie ever.. it's a terrific drama based on fiction but we can see the whole thing clearely and with christian Bale, Heath ledger and  Nolan's take made it legendary ",1
1400,"One of the best superhero movies of all time, right along side Avengers: Endgame and Logan. A great performance by all characters, especially Heath Ledger. Really moves you, keeps you on your toes, and has a solid story, too. It's grounded, but not too much so that it feels boring. A great film that any superhero fan should watch.",1
1401,"Dreary, gloomy, and excessively grim. Hollywood has plunged Batman into a completely dark and lifeless affair which atrociously concludes its supporting characters in order to provide a problematic message for a meaningless story that manipulates its audience closer to the devil with the glorification of its evil character.",0
1402,"There is not enough good I can say about this film! After watching it again for what must be the umpteenth time, it is still one of the best movies I've ever seen. Heath Ledger is phenomenal, just absolutely stunning as the Joker. Even after seeing Jouaqin Phoenix's amazing go at this character, Ledger stands head and shoulders above all the rest. Christian Bale brings a gravitas to his role that is not easily duplicated in the other entries of this trilogy. And Aaron Eckhart makes a great transition from the ""white knight of Gotham"" to Two-Face, albeit a rather short and sudden transition. Lastly, although I love Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine as much as anybody else, Gary Oldman deserves the highest praise as Commissioner Gordon; he is always fantastic in every movie.I'll share a key quality of a great movie: when you think it's over and excitedly find that you are just halfway through! I'll never forget thinking that it would be fine if the movie ended after Joker was initially captured, and to my surprise had another hour of wonderful movie to enjoy! In the end, the Dark Knight is hands down the best Christopher Nolan movie, the best Batman movie, and one of the best movies, period, of all time, in my opinion. If it's on, I'm watching.",1
1403,"I am a Christopher Nolan's movies fan.Nolan's finest movie, Heath Ledger steals the show",1
