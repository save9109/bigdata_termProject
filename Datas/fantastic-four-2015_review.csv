0,"""Fantastic Four"" 10 Scale Rating: 2.5 (Terrible) ... The Good: The first 10-15 minutes of the film are great. Showing child genius Reed Richards and his friendship with Ben Grimm (pre-Miles Teller and Jamie Bell) when they are 5th graders was entertaining and somewhat endearing. The cast itself was not the problem. These are talented young actors who did what was asked of them. Jamie Bell before his transformation into the rocky Thing was especially solid. Reg E. Cathey was great as the father of Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) and gave the film it's few emotional moments. Toby Kebbell was the best of the bunch as Victor von Doom. They make it obvious to non-comic fans that he's destined to be a villain, but he did an amazing job pre-transformation. While the effects mostly missed their mark (more on that later), a couple of scenes looked good. The Bad: There is a long list of things that went wrong with this film, but the most glaring is the story. Completely basic and straight-forward, the film offers nothing new or interesting and even calling it a run-of-the-mill sci-fi story would be an exaggeration. The film instantly starts breaking down the moment the foursome get their powers and gets steadily worse from there. Kate Mara's Sue Storm (Invisible Woman) did little aside from looking concerned and MIcheal B. Jordan's Johnny Storm (Human Torch) was forced into the film and never felt like he belonged. Much was made about the casting of Jordan as Mara's brother in the film due to their skin color, but that ultimately didn't matter as you wouldn't know they were related if they didn't tell you multiple times. There was no heart to the film and zero sense of family, which is what makes the source material great. Tim Blake Nelson played government bad guy Harvey Elder and I cringed every time he appeared. I don't know if he chose not to take the role seriously, but he was so hammy and over-the-top that he was difficult to watch. The film's main villain, Doctor Doom, was terrible. His origin is silly and made little sense. Unlike the Fantastic Four themselves, Doom had a vague and ever-changing set of powers ranging from telekinesis to geokinesis to the odd ability to make people's head explode with a mere thought ... which he decided not to do to the film's heroes, for whatever reason. While Jamie Bell does an admirable job as Ben Grimm, once he becomes the Thing, his voice is a horrible fit and stuck out like a sore thumb every time he spoke. The film's effects, which should have been a plus for a film like this, were sloppy and laughably bad. At times Human Torch and Thing looked like cartoons and every action scene looked better in the trailer than in the finished product. In fact, the majority of the exciting scenes from the trailer were inexplicably removed from the film. Lastly, the film's final act is rushed and you're not even sure what exactly happens. Doom returns from Earth X for all of five minutes, the Fantastic Four follow him back and defeat him five minutes later. Roll credits. While it is not one of the worst movies of all time, it is hands down among the worst super hero films of all time. It is better than Batman and Robin as well as Catwoman, landing it in squarely in the range of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Spider-Man 3.",0
1,"This is one of the worst films I've seen in years. The special effects are terrible, the script is garbage, and worst of all it is totally boring to boot. It's worse by far that the last films and that's saying something. The director is renowned for being a bit of a ass and it shows in this pile of nonsense. Avoid this movie torrent it of you must. Don't give them your money.",0
2,I am simply amazed how little attention was given to the source material. The story was brutal and rushed. The cast was pretty good but the story and script were just plain terrible. It;s a shame that these iconic comic characters have once again been dragged through the mud.,0
3,"Well, well, well...after months and months of controversy surrounding principal photography, this is the result of a movie that was doomed from start to finish (no pun intended). 'Fantastic Four' or ""FANT4STIC"" is a half-assed, lazily made, dull and rushed cinematic defecation. Not many people were fussed on seeing this movie due to the controversy, and it seems that they were right that this would be a disaster. The movie starts off where we see a young Reed Richards (Owen Judge) as he attempts to create a dimensional transporting device that will lead to another planet. He becomes friends with a young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann) who helps him with this experiment. First problem with this scene is that it is incredibly rushed and their friendship is built, but we do not see it growing, they just agree to help each other for some reason. Then, 7 years later, a much older Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) are taking this project to the next level, presenting it at a science presentation and the teachers and staff have their doubts. That is, until they are approached by Franklin Storm (Reg E Cathey) with his adopted daughter, Sue Storm (Kate Mara). Franklin is intrigued with Reed's experiment and wants him to join his lab where they can further this technology. Michael B Jordan plays Johnny Storm, the biological son of Franklin, he is a bit of a hot-head (no pun intended, again), always getting himself in danger with racing and being rebellious. Franklin wants him to join to build the experiment, he refuses at first, but tags along anyway. Franklin then calls in the last person, Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbel), who is jealous that someone seems to be more successful at stealing his idea. He reluctantly joins only because he ""trusts Sue Storm"", apparently, they had some kind of history, but this is not further developed properly, only through small, awkward talk do we see them looking as if they had any sort of history. The actors in this movie do fine in their roles, playing them with as much charisma as the screenplay allows them, but there is no chemistry between any of the actors. It just feels like four talented actors from really good movies forced by some devil-may-care director to get along with each other. This is a huge problem, as when it comes to superhero ensemble films, chemistry is the most important thing. Joss Whedon did this very well with the different kinds of heroes in 'The Avengers' (2012), bringing in different heroes with different backgrounds, but their chemistry felt real, you can tell the actors got along. Bryan Singer also achieved this in the ""X-Men"" movies, bringing in different mutants with different abilities and how they team up seamlessly to fight their enemies. The ""Fantastic Four"" are supposed to be close friends from the get-go, but the fact that these actors could only make small talk with each other is problematic, you don't believe in their ""friendship"" because they don't seem to care, and neither should you. Dr Doom's design is also laughable, Kebbel is a gifted actor and proved it with 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' (2014), but here, he is weighed down by cliches. The cliche that the villain has had something done to him, he is tied to a hospital bed, an agent tries to talk calm to him, but the villain looks and says ""You can't stop this!"", kills the doctors and agents around him, blows the massive door open, unties himself from the bed and walks down a corridor with the lights flashing constantly in the dark...it's 2015! We don't see this in comic book movies anymore. The final battle scene is also cliche and very quick, it involves Doom sucking the earth in a black hole...why does every villain want earth to be sucked in a black hole??? He stands before the four heroes looking at the destruction, the lead says ""Victor! Don't do this!"", he then answers ""It's already too late"", I'm paraphrasing, but that's what you get. The lead hero then looks at his ""friends"" and says ""He's stronger than us, but he's not stronger than all of us!"", and then Doom is taken down in one punch and the final battle only lasted five minutes leaving you with a big ""Is that it???"" Josh Trank clearly didn't care for this project, the troubled production and his unusual behavior caused Fox to just throw this film in release and just pretend it never happened. They were selling 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014) like it was ""The Avengers"", but you can tell they were ashamed of this movie. The only good thing is that it looks less animated than the 2005 film, but I'd prefer to watch that movie...",0
4,"Fantastic four in my opinion isn't a much better rendition than the earlier movies with a heavy atmosphere along with a light story. I do believe that this version could have been executed as a much 'fantastic' movie.Although on the bright side, good delivery by Kate Mara, Miles Teller,and Jamie Bell bringing a few(ill say it again--few) 'smile & 'giggle' moments where in most were dull.I did expect a better performance from Michael Jordan and his depiction of the human torch and i believe it needed more.....'torchiness'..., Overall, it was very bland in its story lacking a good plot and storyline. A good cast but poor overall execution.",0
5,"A film that makes Batman & Robin look like the Citizen Kane of Superhero movies. A failure of a film that is worse than the 2005 movie (my god... was that possible?)Everything is bad:The direction is shoddy and nothing flows, feels all over the place.Acting is lifeless beyond belief (Like... Hayden Christensen lifeless).Script is awful (Example): ""What if I say no?"" ""Say yes"". That's it... wow.Editing seems to be done by blind drunks.CGI is worse than Terminator 2, which was from the 90's.Ending is....... well bad is all I can say Overall the second worst film so far this year (1st being United Passions)Don't see this, please don't.Oh and Fox... DON'T YOU DARE MESS UP DEADPOOL.",0
6,"Fantastic Four is utterly terrible. It plays like a TV pilot than movie and as a result nothing happens leaving it to be an uninventive boring mess that makes you want to yell at the screen for something anything to happen. With awful characters that have little depth and no progression, terrible miscasts and acting and a plot that went absolutely nowhere this was a complete waste of 1 hour and 40 minutes. The effects and fight scenes are awefull and it’s clear this was a shameless get them in get them out movie off the conveyer belt made because 20th century fox realized they still had the rights to Fantastic Four and were hoping to fool people with the top quality of comic movies. They failed and it’s just as bad as the 2005 version. Fox plans to have a crossover between Fantastic Four and X Men but this film is so bad I think that’s been squashed before it’s even started like this films terrible attempts to have sequel.",0
7,"Dull, dreary and unfun.  Much like the Roger Corman film of the same name,  this movie should have never been released. If you want a good Fantastic Four film, rent The Incredibles.",0
8,My oh my what have we come to.... you guys know I absolutely hated Terminator Genisys and Jurassic World but honestly this makes those movies seem like good flicks. Fantastic Four is even worse than Batman and Robin. Fantastic BORE gets an F !!!!!,0
9,"It is a good film, even that after the middle the quality gets down, it doesn't deserve your bad opinions!!! Besides it's better then the two first movies.",1
10,"Do not waste your time... I'm usually not that hard on films but oh man was this movie terrible. It just felt as if the whole movie was rushed did not feel at all like a fantastic 4 movie should have it's more like a sci fi film.The 3rd act of the movie was completely rushed , the final fight was barley entertaining. I'd rather watch the first 2 fantastic four movies than this.",0
11,"A movie with absolutely no redeeming qualities. bad story, bad special effects, bad dialogue and poor direction. Will go down as one of the worst super hero movies of all time.",0
12,"This move suffers from a lot of things I don't even know where to begin. There is very little character development, there is very little action, there is very little good with this movie. On a side note the cast was great however they all share little screen Time together and barely interact. The finale is plain stupid the villain is utterly wasted and overall the film is a pile of rubbish.",0
13,"The only thing they got right was the cast, unfortunately for them they had to endure the clumsy pacing and cringe worthy character development which envelopes the entire film. This is a ""must miss"" film, simply don't watch it unless you enjoy weeping at wasted potential.",0
14,"How could this movie all of a sudden get so bad so quickly? Honestly I would say the first half was terrific, it made me say to myself 'Why does everyone hate this?' and then BOOM a half hour towards the end we have a rushed superhero battle with over-explained plot lines, a villain who is more laughable than villainous, overall acting and even worse special effects. The director was right to try to get his name off this hunk-o-junk.",0
15,"This movie is so garbage, even 2.5 is too low. I advice everyone from going to cinema for this movie.Beware of fake 7+ score reviews, they are done by either trolls, or... Or trolls. I don't think any sane person would rate this movie higher then 4.Do not watch it. Don't you dare give more money to the producers. This movie belongs in a dumpster.",0
16,"Just don't bother, it's not worth the 100 minutes of your life. Everything about this movie is wrong. In a time where superhero movies are epic, this is as dull and ill-thought as you could possibly imagine.",0
17,"Fantastic Four (2015) is a failed attempt to reboot the Fantastic Four comic franchise that I grew up loving. Fantastic Four (2005) was the movie I felt that this franchise was doomed (haha get it ""Doomed"") from it's rather weak start in the film adaptations. Fantastic Four (2015) fails across the board with bad acting, undeveloped plot, rushed editing, and rather cheap looking effects. The first half of film is nothing but settings and characters that fail in retrospect to its comics. One problem I had with it's predecessors was the lack of storytelling but at least it had somewhat of a story. This film however is so uneventful that it completely devolves from it's predecessors making it the worst adaptation of them all",0
20,"Well into my 50's now, I can tell you that I read a lot of comic books as a kid.  I couldn't wait to go to the news stand to spend my allowance on the 10 cent comics.  I was into Super Hero's and Fantastic Four was one of my favorites.  For me this movie was a disaster, too bad it failed as I really did like the casting.  I have seen the young talented actors Miles Teller in movies like Whiplash, Jamie Bell in Billy Elliot/Definace, and Michael B. Jordan on the TV series Parenthood.  All can act and thought it would be over the top before it came out.  Sadly for some reason they just can't bring this comic book and its characters justice.  I did somewhat like the original two movies, but they still weren't quite the ticket either and came up short.  This last installment with all that talent that they had was truly a huge disappointment.  The depth of the script felt shallow and the action wasn't there either.  The only depiction I found interesting was with Doctor Doom both in acting and the effects.  Actually as bad as it was, I was still hoping with all the talent it would get another go around, but hear that they have already axed the sequel-too bad.",0
21,"I honestly tried hard not to be outraged at this disgrace, but it's just too hard for me to keep it down. I don't want to discourage anyone from watching the movie, but it's really not worth spending your money on it. The first 20 minutes I find interesting and captivating, the cast was good enough to bring us a great movie, especially Victor Von Doom. I can relate to Doom much better than with the old movies and his appearance is also much better as is Ben Grimm's, however the overall gargantuan failure of the script writers and the budget managers is just unbearable.Apparently they've wasted most they had on the first half of the movie and had to make due with what they had left for the second half, resulting in a horrible ending, and makes it very obvious that there was little thought put into the scenes, especially the last fight scene, not the mention the absence of the traditional end credit scene in almost every Marvel movie. All in all, this was a spit in the face of every Marvel fan, even if you're not a fan of the Fantastic 4. Every script writer is smug when it comes to hearing out ideas from fans, but I guarantee that 1 out of 10 fans, who have some vague idea of script writing would've given a better story for this budget and this cast as for the terrible effects, I have no words.",0
22,"Honestly, this is the almost as bad as Batman and Robin. There is nothing good about this movie. I know this is an origin story, but it wastes good talent and creates a boring plot with terrible writing.  There is no chemistry between the characters and Dr. Doom is the worst villain I've seen in portrayed on the big screen. This movie did not deserve any money because it is definitely one of the worst movies of all time.",0
23,"Okay, we got a great director, a great cast, and an awesome superhero team, that should be awesome, right???  What the hell happened here????  This is the biggest cinematic abortion I have seen in 4 years!!!!",0
24,"What even happened here? This film doesn't just miss the mark it seems to be aiming at a different mark all together! The tone, story, characterisation, effects and even the casting are just a series of phenomenal misfires. The fantastic four aren't the makeshift surrogate family from the comics, they're a bunch of miserable bland zombies who don't even seem to like each other. And Doctor Doom....Christ I don't know what they were trying to do there.This film is worth seeing just to see how wrong they got it, but I wouldn't recommend paying for it.",0
28,"Srl bad movie. Poor plot, poor characters and pathetic  villain. What a waste of time. But the most important thing is that this movie is so f*****g booooring.",0
29,"Definitely up there in the 'worst superhero movie ever made' top 5 list. What's worse is that unlike the reboot of Spider-Man (which had a very successful original trilogy run), this reboot fails to learn any lessons taught by the two absolute **** films which were released less than 10 years prior. With a running time of only 100 minutes, to explain the origin stories of FIVE main characters, as well as then developing a scenario for the Fant4stic to fight the fifth, it's simply an absolute mess. The film uses a 'one year later' fade out/in for Christ's sake, because it's that lazy and badly written.Throw in some terrible directing, bad casting, bad acting, unremittingly patronising dialogue, less than stellar special effects and, worst of all, the most anti-climactic end 'fight' scene ever..... And you've got a Turkey that Ebeneezer Scrooge would be proud of the morning after his ghostly visitations! It really is that bad. I cannot begin to vent my frustrations at what a huge missed opportunity this could have been, if the lessons from the first two films had been taken on-board. I suspect their won't be a Fan4stic 2 coming to cinemas anytime soon!",0

31,"Yes I was dragged to see this ""fantastic"" reboot of a dead franchise. It really makes one re-evaluate the actual meaning of the word fantastic which this movie is far from. Retells the origin story of these four characters who gain superhuman powers and save the word etc. Throw in seriously messy pacing, cringe worthy dialogue and a giant blue laser and you get this boring, unnecessary film not worth the time or money. On a good note Fantastic Four hasn't claimed the title of worst marvel movie ever but it made it into the top five. Not recommended.",0

What else can I say.  Fox, you need to release this franchise back to marvel please. Listen to the fans and stop putting out mediocrity. You have two great franchises. X-men and now Deadpool. Let Fantastic 4 go back to marvel. This movie reeks, stinks and has one of the lowest scores in rotten tomatoes and meteoritic. I cant even begin to start how bad this movie is.  My brain cells felt like they were slowly dying one by one.  Dialog is bad, script is bad, plot is laughable, pacing is awful, special effects are bad and everything is slapped together with no rhyme, reason or thought. its almost like fox just slapped this together to keep the rights to the franchise another four years...",0

36,"What saves the Fantastic Four from being a complete ""1"" is that I don't think I have ever laughed harder at such a ridiculous reboot. The CGI is just terrible, I'm going to say that right off the bat. The script tried way too hard to mimic The Dark Knight. The acting was okay until the CGI really appeared in the third act of the film.",0

41,"What do I like about this movie? Reed Richards' character. Some little humour points. That seems about it. What do I not like about this movie? It's non-canonness and lack of Marvel movie finesse. There's no Stan Lee cameo or credit suggestions for upcoming movies. Dr. Doom dies. Big whoop. That sequence felt close to 10-20 minutes. What's the rest? Origins and post-beating Dr. Doom. What`s next? Some story about how they're going to interlock Silver Surfer's life story with there's? I'm sorry if I'm beating a home-made story line to death, but if they're going to try to make another one, they should spend more time on a plot-line rather than a whole life's story again. This movie was certainly a bold step into the unknown, but it may have been a better idea just to use the original story again, with some new characters, or an HD remake of the original movie(s). Overall, I'm giving this movie a 1/10.",0

46,"Seeing this movie was not on my schedule.  Instead, I was going to relax at home with my sister and play and think about Las Vegas.  Yesterday, I received an invite from my friend to go see Fantastic Four.  I was kind of excited to get this invitation because it would be a great hangout.  To celebrate this moment, I played one game of Elvis Presley Pinball.  When it came to the actual movie, instead, it was a very boring movie with little to no good parts in this movie. The movie starts out fine as two boys making an invention to teleport things.  Then they got the quartet together.  But when a horrid experiment goes wrong, they gain their powers and battle Dr. Doom.The substance in this movie diminishes so quickly that it became a formulaic bore.  The movie was boring, clichéd, and predictable.  I actually slept through some parts of the movie.  And I don’t want to tell about the third act but I HATED the climax.  And I thought third acts are supposed to be the greatest part of this movie. This movie had a solid cast and the torch was my personal favorite but I did not get a grip and feel of these characters.  The actors did not do their best.  I felt like they were not interested in this project.  Dr. Doom was very undeveloped too as he only appears in the third act.  There were no information, no back story, or no anything about him.  He was a very clichéd with no developments at all. Perhaps the best thing about his was that the movie was only 100 minutes long and that the beginning had a nice set up.  Otherwise, it was all downhill to me. I really want to like this movie to get some fresh Marvel humor and some nice performances since the last two Marvel movies (Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man) had both good humor and nice performances.  But oh my this movie did awful at this job.  It was horrendous, tedious, and boring at once as this movie did not try. There were no funny parts during this 100 minute trip.  I kept looking through the theater to see if anyone left before the movie ended. The story was simple and formulaic unlike the unpredictable and complex Inside Out.  The effects were not special unlike those of the likes of Ultron and Ant-Man.  I was checking my watch to see what time it is so that the movie can be over soon. Speaking of special effects, I do not need to explain what the special effect were since the directors are not interested to make the movie look cool.  When there were special effects in the movie, I thoughts the effects were unmemorable and lame.  It almost felt like they did not try their best to make a good Marvel movie which is a shame after all. Overall, I was incredibly bored and incredibly disappointed in this movie.  While it can be a bit entertaining in some points whether it was the cast or the beginning or the soundtrack, it was severely let down by dull performances, a clichéd story, and an awful villain with an awful climax.  When the movie was finally over, I felt like my butt was on fire and I asked the host to use the restroom.  When she said yes, I ran out of the freezing theater to take a refreshing bathroom break.  That shows how I cannot recommend this movie to anyone but only Marvel fans and ONLY Marvel fans will be surprised in this movie.  Trust me, but I would rather stay at home than watch the entire movie without checking my watch. (Fantastic Four is now playing in theaters but if you’re looking for a great action movie that’s now playing in theaters, check out Ant-Man or Mission Impossible 5.  These movies are still playing in theaters and they are both great movies.  If you want humor, check out Ant-Man, if you want action, check out Mission Impossible 5.  Either way, you’re going to get a great deal of entertainment along the way!)",0
47,"Fantastic Four is an unmitigated disaster. A great cast is wasted by poor direction, horrible storytelling, bland action sequences (especially the final one), and A LOT more. Dr. Doom looks like garbage and his evil motives are non-existent, the film strays too far from the comics and is awfully stupid, and the film, worst of all, is extremely boring and gloomy. This is hands down the worst Marvel film adaptation of the modern superhero genre (post-2000). Heck, its possibly one of the worst superhero movies ever The cast is wasted and the film is atrocious. However, this movie did make me happy in one way. I'm happy knowing Josh Trank is not going to direct any Star Wars film in the future. Sorry Trank, nobody to blame for this catastrophe but yourself.",0
48,"This movie before its release received a huge amount of lukewarm comments from fans, who thought Marvel's oldest team would have fitted much better in the MCU. I was one of the few people who defended this film and I'm going to be the first of those people to say this: ""Fantastic Four"", a 2015 movie directed by Josh Trank, produced by Gregory Goodman, co-written by Jeremy Slater, is an ungodly boring piece of dogsh*t with p*ss-poor scriptwriting, balls-to-the-wall effects, horrendous dialogue, horrible pacing, bored direction and most likely the worst villain to date since Mr. Freeze in ""Batman & Robin"". It's an epic disaster on all accounts, one that will bomb at the box office, and much deservedly so. This movie will definitely rank not only as one of the worst movies of 2015 but also one of the worst super-hero movie flicks ever. The first thing I noticed this in this cinematic failure was absolutely, its questionable pacing. Right out of the gate, this movie started to telling Reed's story as a young boy. He explains to the whole class that he intents to create a machine that will transport anything that breaths into another dimension, without harm. The students laugh (because that's obviously funny, right?) but that won't stop Richard from doing it, so while he does that, he gets the chance to know a guy from his class named Ben Grimm, a warm little kid who gets bullied by its one-dimensional brother. His bro actually says ""It's clobberin' time"" but it's not stupid as it sounds, impressively. So Richard tries to make his dream come true and he literally causes a blackout in his neighborhood. Ben says to Reed: ""Reed you're insane"" , ""Thanks"" and the screen goes dark, appearing only ""Years later"". Nice scene-changing right there! The movie sloppily introduces us more characters, and while the cast is apparently talented (seriously Miles Teller? Michael Jordan? Great actors), they look bored as hell, and there's absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between the group members, not even Sue and Johnny have a decent scene together. When someone dies, you don't feel pity. You feel indifferent. You don't give a sh*t when Johnny's father dies. You don't give a sh*t about anyone! But the worst character in this movie is undoubtedly, Victor, the villain. Oh... my... God. Where do I start... holy motherf*cking Jesus. How bad is this villain? On a scale of 0 to 10? -2. This villain is so f*cking bad it makes me wanna puke. From the stupid design of his persona Doctor Doom to the inexplicably, poorly developed motivations as to why he's annihilating Earth. And... oh Christ, is this guy a dick. Usually, filmmakers try to make us sympathize with the characters, especially with the villain. Not what's happening here. Victor is such an assh*le you couldn't care less whether he dies or stays alive. Actually, you would beg for this person to die a woeful death. And he pointed the finger to the government, LoL. And when he gets swallowed in the other dimension and he comes back in the second half of the movie... holy sh*t. He comes back, says a few stupid words, returns to ""his world"", gets beaten by Fantastic Four...... and that's it. I swear to God I'm not making up sh*t, that's what really happens. And that leads me to another idiotic element. The action. There's ONLY two action sequences: One that takes 45 seconds, and another that takes 3 minutes (and most of the action is seen in the trailers). Oh my Goodness. So the first half of the movie is boring talking and idiotic character development, and the second half is more boring talking and a little of action, which is not exciting in the least. The special effects could have been worse, but they still look pretty mediocre. Human Torch and the Thing looked weird to me. I don't know, they just looked cartoonish. And that scene where the team is running from the green lava, ok, that was some truly bad CGI. Doctor Doom looked erratic, and the rest is... meh. The dialogue is clichéd and just plain bad. ""What if we say no?"" , ""Say yes"" haha, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh harder! But for real, this movie lacks the heart, thrills and silliness that made the Fantastic Four great in the first place. I'm still surprised this movie made it into the theaters without a warning advice, 'cause this movie is so...... dull. Nothing really happens in this movie. If you've seen the trailer, you know what happens: They become Fantastic Four, they met Doctor Doom and they stop him. THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL. Okay, Sue and Johnn's father died, but no one knew or cared about that guy anyway. SO WHAT THE F*CK WAS THIS? Final Score to Fantastic Four: 1/10. This movie should be extinguished from humanity. It's a boring super-hero origin tale with no payoff. Obs: Such a waste of DOOM.",0
49,"Fantastic Four may have some good cinematography, decent special effects and Michael b Jordan was good as Johnny Storm but the films characters are very bland, the film tries to cram so much plot points and set up for sequels and as a result feels rushed, the villains rise to power is very abrupt and very cartoonish and the final battle was very anti climactic.Verdict: the movie felt like one big set up for bigger films to come despite having some fun and nifty moments.",0
50,"I honestly can't believe I'm going to say this, I never thought the day will come when I say that Batman & Robin is no longer the worse superhero movie ever made after seeing this movie, but the difference between the two is that at least Batman & Robin was fun to watch and not depressingly dull that Fan4stic was. The story is about a contemporary take on the classic super-hero team - four young scientist are involved in an experiment where they find themselves teleported to another dimension. When they return, they find themselves gifted with unique powers - ones they will have use to stop an evil rising to power. It's been 10 years now since the 2005 ""Fantastic Four"" was first release. Looking back on that film is like looking back on a bad memory that you wish will fade away. The 2005 movie wasn't all that good, but to me it wasn't on the same level as Batman & Robin as some people think. Rise of the Sliver Surfer was the squeal that nobody asked for but they're made anywhere because...well I don't know they just did. The squeal wasn't all that great just like the first movie, but the movie itself wasn't like the worse thing on the planet as some people have make it out to be. I'm not going to talk about the 1994 movie because it's not worth it. Now here's 20th Century Fox fourth attempt of making a Fantastic Four movie. We got a new director and a new cast to start off fresh and try to make a new franchise. Many people didn't react very well to the news of a reboot and people got even more mad at the new cast and the fact that they young and Michael B. Jordan was cast as Johnny Storm. I was the only one giving this movie a chance as I believed that Josh Trank will make a great Fantastic Four movie and make us forget the other ones as Josh Trank is a good director. But it's not until I sawed the movie myself and my jaw was on the floor not because the movie was amazing, but how god awful this movie was. Fantastic Four (Or best known as Fan4stic from the posters) is one of the worse superhero movies of the year and of all time. I heard a lot of bad things coming from director Josh Trank. Some people who have worked with him on this movie have openly said that he was awkward to work with and at one point he actually came on set drunk and intoxicated while filming a scene. The problems that happened behind the scenes really do show in this movie, as I can tell they did some re shoots as Kate Mara hair keeps changing color in a couple of scenes. I blame the studious for changing a lot of things and making it a living hell for the director and the cast. Josh Trank is best known for directing Chronicle and that movie was a smallish movie that Josh Trank had a lot of freedom to work on with and at least they're wasn't any studious coming in and changing things and making it really hard for everyone else. It's very clearly that Josh Trank wasn't ready for something big like this as he was originally suppose to direct the upcoming Star Wars movie but dropped out because he had enough. The biggest opportunity that was wasted was the cast. They didn't do a terrible job as they characters but they didn't do anything special and that's a real shame as these are great actors that had nothing to do in this movie. The visual effects in this movie are probably some of the worse looking effects I've seen since the early 90's and it's quite shocking that this movie with a lot of money behind it and have such awful looking effects. The CGI used on The Thing was completely hideous and I kind of miss the 2005 Thing a little bit. Some people may like the CGI used on The Thing but I didn't. These a shot in the movie where Reed Richards after he gets his super power stretches his face to look like someone else to be in disguise, when he puts his normal face back and the CGI used in that one shot looked laughably bad. There wasn't a single shot in this movie that didn't even look convincing. Now lets talk about Dr. Doom in this movie or I like to call him Mr. Freeze number 2, because Dr. Doom is this movie was a complete joke and he wasn't in the movie that much, he just turned up towards the end of the movie. Dooms motivation in this movie was pretty random and wasn't well written at all. Before Victor turns into ""Doom"" the only character development that we got from his character is that he thinks he's smarter than ever one else and he just hates people...WHAT!. The way Dr. Doom looks in this movie is so freaking awful, I mean he looks like that robot from Superman 3, but if put a black bin bag around it and set it on fire and let it dry out a bit, then you add some Christmas lights around it and now you got Dr. Doom. The final battle scene with Doom and The Fantastic Four is only five minutes long, yes I actually timed it to see how long it was and it was too short and disappointing.",0

56,"Probablemente, Fantastic Four sea la candidata ideal para ""la peor película del 2015"" al menos Sandler puede presumir que ""Pixels"" ya no es considerada la peor del año. Vi esta película para descubrir el motivo por el cual toda la critica la considera un asco y mi sorpresa final fue muy parecida a la de todo el mundo. Fantastic Four es una película decepcionante, aburrida y sin sorpresas, ¿Cual es el error? No son los actores, cada uno de ellos hizo un trabajo decente, el problema aquí fue el guion, la trama y la historia. Esta película es una introducción de 1 hora con 46 minutos, lo cual es un error total. Toda película tiene una introducción, un desarrollo y una conclusión, pero Fantastic Four no cuenta con los 2 últimos aspectos (y que son demasiado importantes) la historia se desarrolla de una manera lenta, dando a conocer a los personajes uno por uno de una manera poco llamativa y pobre. El desarrollo en los personajes no existe, no hay personalidad en ellos, ni siquiera el villano es interesante, no tiene motivo ni razones para ser villano. Josh Trank y la misma FOX no supieron manejar el inicio de estos super héroes, esperemos que en un futuro, los 4 fantásticos o ""Fantastic Four"" tengan una película justa y decente, esperemos que Disney-Marvel aproveche esta situación. Decepcionante, Aburrida y con una introducción eterna sin un desarrollo y final.",0

I must say this film is worst than the first 2 original film, but at the same time while I didn't like the first 2 films, the first 2 films had better developed characters than this one. You just cannot connect to these characters at all, they just have no souls. The CGI is the only thing that is acceptable, everything else is crap, to the slim plot and to the bad development on the characters. I more so feel sorry for the actors though, all very young and wanting to be actors, ave there images put into a crappy spotlight. They even deserved better.",0

Great cast but gets brought down by a horrible storyline. its a action movie trying to be better than other action movies but gets brought down by a 10 minutes action scene.

You spend the whole movie being unattached to the characters due to poor writing and poor performances by the actors/actresses. You think ""oh well there's gotta be action to make up for it right?""  But no.... you wait 90% of the movie for a couple minutes of action then an ending that made everyone in the theater collectively ask ""that was it?""",0
75,"The onslaught of comic book heroes continues with this origin story about a quartet of unusual characters. As such, it takes almost an hour before any transformations occur and by then, the audience is asleep. The writing is flat, the action (what little there is) falls flat and the cool demonstration of their powers is in short supply. Despite the charisma of the talented cast (Miles Teller, Jamie Bell, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara), they're given nothing to work with. Even the effects (the basic currency of any super hero flick) range from dumb to just OK. This has to be the worst of the genre so far.",0
76,"To me this is a passable movie, the special effects (CGI) are pretty good, the acting is almost convincing and the music is on par. However, the big problem is the story makes no sense and the alchemy between the characters, let alone the actors, feels wrong. I felt the story made no sense because the character are shifting continuously from one type to another without sensible explanation. At some point they serve the military like obedient puppets then suddenly have a change of heart and decide to grow up. The character of Victor Von Doom does not make much more sense either. As for the story, the big point is clearly the establishment of a new franchise (which seems to be the exclusive selling point of any reboot these days) by declaring the name of their new group of buddies is ""fantastic 4"". Oh, shall I mention there is absolutely zero form of humour in this movie ? It is all just doom, gloom and superpowers, no lightheartedness. For me this kind of production goes straight on the shelf of failed reboots, as if a reboot could be anything but a failure in its core...",0
78,"The movie can be divided in halves, the first half is solid and set up a lot of the background story of each character, particularly Reed and Ben's childhood friendship. Victor, like his comic book counterpart, is insufferable as ever yet there's valid reasoning for his attitude against authorities (his glory-seeking behavior clashes against . Then comes the event on which everyone get their powers and the plot suddenly derails, a few timeskips leave a lot of unexplained events and the acting start to look very awkward. As this wasn't enough, the main villain pops in out of nowhere exhibiting an unexplained set of new powers and a completely irrational and out-of-character mindset. What was awkward until then turns into a VERY cheesy last battle, complete with forced heroic lines and a fight with almost no action in it (you read it right, it's a last battle with little fighting to speak of). In short, this is a strong contender for the worst superhero movie in the last decade.",0

83,"Another fantastic failure. Fox's failed attempt to produce another marvel franchise is unsurprisingly disappapointing. It starts with a long, unimportant, and dragging introduction to the back stories of how the fantastic four started. It was visually success but the whole idea and plot of the movie was completely out this world. It tried to hit high but it missed without a doubt. The depiction of Dr. Doom was another missed shot. A failed origin story, a failed portrayal and an ending fight scene that lasted for five horrible minutes. Fox should give back the rights to Marvel and save the franchise from dying another time.",0
84,"A high quality movie with poor cuts that just scratches the surface of the director's intentions. A preface film entirely since they don't get their powers until thirty minutes from the end of the movie, and even when they get their powers they hate each other! The story is completely wrong and Dr. Doom looks like he's wearing the iron mask from Man in Iron Mask and gets so many powers that he wasn't suppose to get. The final ""showdown"" - if you can call it that- takes in total about 15 minutes and has zero build up. The end of the film is corny and will leave you feeling like there's going to be a sequel, even though that would be the worst possible choice to make. The only thing I would say that is good is the actors chosen for the Fantastic Four- not Dr. Doom, Toby Kebbell seems to ruin every movie he touches, and they played well off of each other, that is when they actually liked each other.",0

Where fan4stic's first mistake was not releasing during the summer blockbuster phase were it might have otherwise been bearable to watch within the cinemas, Fan4stic breaks past mediocrity and into the abysmal below with a passion, lacking prominent movie features such as ambition and the love of storytelling, coming across as a film in which everyone who was involved looked disinterested and ready to dig a six foot grave for the film which would be filled with quick drying cement. Were everyone expresses the fact that the film has a talented cast , i believe that it somewhat a half-truth, were they have shown once they are good in atleast one form of media, it seems as though this gang of young cast members came across as one hit wonders, lacking chemistry and character imagination  yet proudly receiving a paycheck by the end of it all. However enough of that lets talk about the plot, Fan4tic simply is the largest origin story ever made with simply enough sound and noise to signify nothing, leaping across the finish line, almost like watching a person with Parkinson's disease trying to play Frogger. The film is completely dis-interesting, motives are no longer established and the threat of anything is not established until the third act which consequently is the worst part. In the end not even a bottle of scotch and a bunch of dead babies can't drown the sorrows of this fantastic flop",0

This movie sucks. I hated watching every single second of this movie, there is no redeeming aspect to this film. The characters are one dimensional, the actors don't seem to care, terrible script, awful special effects, the pacing is nonexistent and Fant4stic has one of the worst third acts I have ever seen in a movie in my entire life.

93,This movie has a lot of flaws but buried beneath them is something really unique and fresh. It may not be for everyone with it's slow pace and few action scenes but this is sacrificed to allow more time for you to get to know the characters which are played by a great cast. The movie has a relatively short running time so the slow pace isn't as harmful as it could have been. Overall this is movie is a breath of fresh air and it shows getting super powers not as this amazing thing that everyone wishes for but as a horrible accident that makes you feel sorry for these characters.,1
95,"Ok, this movie has a good thin (very **** thin) crust, to a superhero movie if you will. Despite what critics say, I like the look of Doctor Doom, I like his powers as well but we'll get onto that. It has fine cinematography and a decent soundtrack, now lets move on to the negatives. What the f*ck were they thinking. There was no back story to this, zero, and I'm not exaggerating, literally zero explanation as to why Reed richards is a super genius child and why for some reason there is advanced scientific parts in a junk yard in America, why johnny has a car that he loves so much and that he apparently wants badly so he'll work for a scientific organisation rather than doing something else and why susan has about as much facial expression as Bella from twilight. I cannot believe how much this movie infuriated me. Doctor Doom, no explanation as to why he hates the earth so much, he's just some hipster loner douchebag who is a dick and hates the earth for some bizarre unknown reason. And the thing, another loner with an abusive background (at least SOME background my god) and not one redeemable quality too him makes him seem relevant or cool. Oh and by the way, this movie is 90% having awkward conversations and 10% actually doing fights. What a steaming pile of dogwank.",0
97,Worst then worst. This movies is so bad that fox couldn't hope to keep the franchise. Let's all hope that Disney get it back. It will hurt Fox for a long time.,0
98,"Fantastic Four is a mess, The first act of the movie is watchable at least, there is so much wasted potential in this movie. In the first act there is a bit of humor, you see where they are going with the Film and the problem is that this movie drags on and tries to justify itself in the Last third of the movie and does a terrible job. The cast performances were at best mediocre Kate Mara is dry as Susan Storm she does not make the character come to life, Micheal b Jordan is okay as Johnny storm, but there is no deeper connection with his character this is the same for Milles Teller who seems unsure as Reed Richards sometimes, Jamie bell is Jusrt there as a Plot tool the character development is the a bit but never satisfying and Toby Kebbell as Doctor Doom is just STUPID, before he is doom there is hope for the character but comes of as underdeveloped, generic and when he becomes Doom his presence is forced, His powers don't make sense and as the villain he has a super generic plot which would have worked but with the boring acting, forced scenes it comes off as ridiculous and the final act of the movie is pathetic the showdown, stakes are meaningless. There is hardly any action in this movie with the dragged on scenes and boring conversations. The only good things about Fan 4 is the representations of Reed's powers in action sequences and The soft of neat stuff in the first half and the effort to build realationships in the last act but fails. In the end Fantastic four does not know where it's going, Bad chemistry between characters, Pathetic Doctor Doom and boring, dragged on scenes, there is potential but not fully exploited so it's really a bas movie AT BEST",0

100,"The first 20-30 minutes of ""Fant4stic"" are actually pretty good, but not many people will say that. This movie could have been decent if only FOX would have let Josh Trank make his damn movie instead of cutting out half the damn movie and replacing it with halfass reshoots that were not even directed by Trank or included in the script he wrote, and then locking him out of editing. Seriously FOX what the **** was wrong with you ? It's obvious Trank had a decent movie going for the first act which i assume were scenes he filmed before you re-shot 75% of the movie leading into an almost non-existent 2nd act then straight to a tacked on 3rd act. It's **** how FOX tries to justify their ****ery too, like ""His pet dogs trashed a trailer"" or ""Trank & the cast didn't like each other very much"",  then there are these baseless claims that Trank would arrive on set Drunk and then proceed to shout obscenities at the cast & crew. Here is what i believe happened, Trank, from the start was not making an average cape movie. His idea was a Science Fiction Thriller in the vein of a Cronenberg Body-Horror film (the way they get their powers are similar to the way Brundlefly happens) that just so happened to include the FF characters and yes that would call for a ""dark"" tone. then while he was filming or finishing up filming, FOX realized that Fant4stic wasn't gonna be like Marvel's The Avengers so they turned on Trank then the media lead a smear campaign against him, blaming him for a film in theaters that he technically did not do.",0

I have gone through many phases, from me liking it to hating it to liking it again.I actually really like this film.It fleshes out its characters and has a great story with some great acting performances. And I actually really liked the darker turn on the light hearted superhero team/family. I'm probably in the minority here, but I thought this film was pretty good.",1
106,"Can we just skip the origin stories in all of these reboots? I think we're all a bit tired of seeing the same dance, but with a different song. With that being said, Fantastic Four has 2 main problems. The first is that it is a reboot. The second problem is that there is just too much dialogue and not enough things blowing up (or maybe it seems like there's too much dialogue because we're so tired of origin plots). Anyways, other than those two flaws, the movie actually is not bad. It has a ""darker"" more X-Men like feel to it. The heroes were portrayed well be the actors. The CGI was actually very impressive. Human Torch, The Thing, and Dr. Doom looked amazing, it terms of CGI. Overall, I give Fantastic Four a 7. Why? Because Iron Man got a 7, and this movie is by no means any worse than Iron Man.",1
108,Seriously its not a bad movie. It was an origin story and it does a good job of that. And its  tight 90 mins so I know a bunch of stuff got cut out. I think people wanted more explosions or whatever but this theatrical cut in my opinion makes it better then the 2005/2007 films. its not  slow as they are making it out to be.,1
109,"I thought the first hour of the movie was well done. Character driven and dramatic. It's unfortunate that it began to defy logic in favor of explosions after they got their powers, but this movie is still better than the ratings would suggest.",1
110,"Wow! I can't believe this movie turned out to be as bad as everyone said it was. This movie went from starting off with a little hope into ending with an unforgettable and disappointing climax. The biggest problem is that it lacks any focus on any sub-plot, development of characters, etc. it's just all over the place. Personally, I blame Fox rather than director Josh Trank. At parts, it felt like it was going somewhere. But it immediately goes nowhere as Fox decided to not develope any characters, sub-plots, etc. And of course, the third act is even worse than I thought. This movie just wanted to get rid of itself so quickly that it lacked any pace. Overall, this is a wasted reboot. I need to sleep this off. This gets an F!",0
111,"Marvel went three for three duds this summer with this being the worst as expected.  The generally serious tone in the beginning with some real human beings as characters is good, but it goes nowhere ultimately and just implodes into sheer boredom making the motions through the same old clichés we've all seen hundreds of times before.  The cast is utterly lackluster which is saying something since on their own they've all shown to be good actors, but here no one stands out to any degree whatsoever and they prove completely interchangeable.  The film's structure is awry too as it feels like only half a movie.  That said when it ended was a delight!",0
112,Lmao I didn't see the movie but I bet it's **** soon as I saw the first trailer and I knew they are going to start all over again with Fantastic Four I thought like WHY?!WHATS THE POINT?And I was right lmao,0
113,"The first half, barring some questionable elements, is a solid science fiction movie with good performances and strong direction.The second half is written in crayon and snot. And it's clear that the second half does not come from the same creative minds as the first.",0
114,"Oh, man do I feel bad for the people starring in this movie. Not that acted well, but what a career ending movie. Most super hero movie have hype... not this one. It would have helped if the movie was comically awful. The humor isn't there to me, the acting is some of the worst I've seen, and most importantly: the heart and spirit of The Fantastic 4 is completely missing. It's heartbreaking when you think about it.",0
117,Fantastic Four is one bland origin story with a rushed action sequence near the end of the movie just so that 20th Century Fox can play it safe just in case they were going to get a sequel. So many wasted opportunities are easily seen within a single minute of the movie. The running time for this movie is 100 minutes long and 90% of that running time was used just for the origin stories that we did not need to know about. The characters are very hard to connect with because the plot is just one boring origin story that did not need to go on for roughly 90% of the movie and it doesn't even show them in action until the end.,0
119,"Let's get this out the way: A LOT of the negative comments on this films are from people with an agenda. Many have wanted this film to fail since day one and had zero intent on giving it a shot. I'm glad I did. While I admit there's some rushed/rough stuff towards the end I thoroughly enjoyed FANTASTIC FOUR. Yeah, I said it. I didn't go into this wanting/expecting a superhero movie. I went in wanting a sci-fi film and that's what I got. Sure, the last 25 minutes could have been better but that doesn't outshine the great start of the film for me. Plus, Doom's hallway scene is one of the most violent and dare I say bad-ass scenes in a comic book film. It is the best FANTASTIC FOUR film to date but if you're looking for tights and superheroics...this one won't be for you. But if you're into films like THE FLY, SCANNERS and CHRONICLE...I'd say give it a shot. It's a good start and here's to hoping the sequel moves forward.",1
120,"It's good sci-fi. I have no existing attachment or affection for the comics or the characters as originally conceived therefore this was just another sci-fi film for me and I had a good time watching it. It actually reminded me, in tone, appearance and story resolution, of Chronicle which is a movie I love. It's not a ""Big Summer Movie"" but it is great little science fiction film.",1
122,"O filme superou minhas expectativas, um filme com um ambiente mais sério diferente do que estamos acostumados aos filmes da Marvel é de se estranhar para alguns, mas foi feito de modo que fosse harmonioso e deu uma visão diferenciada da origem destes heróis. É um filme que quem não é fã de quadrinhos pode assistir.",1
123,"Thanks to Josh Trank, this film is better than the usual Marvel trash. If critics wish to curse this film because of the poor plot, I challenge them to come up with a Marvel film that has even remotely a good script. Trank accually managed to infused a sense of excitement of exploration and discovery into the film.",1
126,"The CGI was amazing. I was impressed with the cast, they were really great but what lacked was the storyline. above all, it was a pretty great film for the kids. children will really enjoy it.",1
128,"Josh Trank, Director of the Fantastic Four has had a hard time straight from the start. He did what I thought was an awesome job on Chronicle. Now the good things come to those who wait. Those who don’t listen to all the bad press, the colour of a certain hero and the actions of a director’s personal life.I will start by saying this. The movie has no place below its current Critical status under 50% On Metacritic. It has been brutalized by the fact that it stands on its own. It does not lend itself to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and as it stands right now, it will never get the chance.At least Sony have handed over most of a certain ‘web crawling menace’ into Marvels hands. But right now we have another rendition of a comic book franchise being re made for a new generation. In the same generation as the first two movies were made!! It really makes no sense why. If it is not joining the larger universe it must be bad right?Wrong.This is by no means, an amazing movie or even a great one. But it deserves to be seen and it deserves to do well. It is another Origin story. You may yawn at the fact we have seen them all before. But believe me when I tell you, there is no yawning when this movie starts to put its feet on the ground and move towards, what we all know will eventuate. A bunch of good guys, stop a bad guy and or corporation and happy endings all around. Is that so hard to enjoy?All the right cast are here and they all make what seems a bit far fetched, so smooth and likeable. The feeling that, if they are ok with it, then hell, so am I.Mister Fantastic (Miles Teller - Whiplash), Susan Storm (Kate Mara - The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo), The Human Torch (Michael B Jordan – Fruitvale Station & Chronicle), Ben Grimm/The Thing (Jamie Bell – King Kong & Tin Tin) & last but not least Victor Von Doom played by Toby Kebbell the wonderful actor that portrayed the Ape ‘Koba” in Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes. All of these eventually join forces, to become unlikely allies as the first ever Inter-dimensional Travel Consultants. Until they decide it’s ok to take the trip themselves. This is when things start to go terribly wrong, especially for old Victor Von Doom…being left behind and left to rot in a world we all know so little about and will probably never even see any answers to sadly.The powers and problems they bring back are then far too focused on the Government being the all-powerful evil corporation that it is. Without giving too much away, let’s just say, they are not set free when they return and are used for the sole purpose of certain organisations and another trip back… because the first time went so well! The music is composed by Philip Glass (The Hours) and sadly there wasn’t one thing I could take away from this composition apart from the awesome music they used on the Official Trailer. It brings nothing to the movie and that is not how it should be for a super hero flick. The entire film does feel like a boxed in world with nothing existing outside its walls till the very end when they need something to threaten. Two sets built solely around the creation of our heroes in a lab. Then onto an alternate dimension and then back to a lab again. This for me was the most disappointing concept for a film about super heroes growing into their own. It felt like they lost a budget and had to constrain it to the size of two football fields. Any bigger than that and the team gets tanked and they use another director. It feels boxed in yes, but at the same time it feels fresh. A time in cinema when it all goes back to its roots and is just a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed each and every one of these characters and enjoyed watching them grow into The Fantastic Four we know they can be. Sadly it is taken down a generic path. That actually abruptly ends all too quickly and no threat is ever really felt. Leaving our heroes not quite heroes until the sequel it hopefully deserves. The Special effects were above par. Everything from Jamie Bells The Thing ... to one amazingly horrific Corridor Sequence with a certain someone. The only thing i found distracting the whole movie (other than the lack of a decent soundtrack) was Miles Tellers facial hair. Just staring at it made me wonder, is this real? Is it glued on? As it stands however with all this bad wrap and not giving this basic, back to form, comic book movie a real shot, we may never see them again and quite frankly that is upsetting.",1
130,"Highly recommend seeing this film for yourself before listening to people who think it's cool to bash the film BEFORE EVEN SEEING IT. There are some seriously epic moments, some that will terrify you and some that will just let you down. Really liked it, didn't LOVE it, but you won't feel like your money is wasted. The cast surprised me and their chemistry is great. The cast is chosen very well despite 'that' controversy and they mesh perfectly. It's downfall is its somewhat rushed editing (particularly in the third act). I think it's worth more than what people are saying it is. This is coming from a huge superhero movie buff. 8/10 (rounded up from 7.5)",1
131,"First of all: I really liked the movie (exept of the rushed and frankly speaking terrible end)The end is very generic, poorly written and was obviously not part of the original movie. This part feels a bit like Frankensteins experiment going wrong. An ugly head attached to a great body.I want to concentrate on all the positive aspects of the movie.The kid versions of Reed and Ben did a great job, teir friendship made sense and you lear A LOT about their family backgrounds and their personalitys when you pay attention to details. The first part of the movie reminded me of movies like Stand By Me, focussed on their friendship and them being outsiders. You learn that even years later  nothing has changed, they (especially Reed) are still misunderstood and laught at. Its a perfect lead up to Reeds wish to be part of a ""family"" that undersatnds him. Dr Franklin, who discovers him takes the place of a father figure. And it seems that Sue (his adopted daughter) had a similar fate. It seems like Dr Franklin adopted her BECAUSE she was gifted. Her brother Johnny is taleted as well as a mechanic, but obviously not as smart as Sue. The family seems to be realiticly dysfunctional. The father ""prefers"" the adopted daughter to his own son. Johnny has a craving for being respected for having a purpose in life. These are just a couple of examples of how the characters are built to explain their behaviour later on. Victor van Doom was portrait as a difficult but likable person, who (for very real reasons) doesnt trust the government, doesn't really like humanity, because we are destroying our planet.  He is not a 2 dimentional villain. In the middle of the movie the editing started to be a bit sloppy, but the movie was still great up to the point where they go back to Planet Zero ad find Doom. From this point on, everything feels rushed and badly edited even badly performed. But lets try to find the positive aspects in the last part of the movie:Doom: even though I didn't LOVE the look of Doom, I thought it looked exactly as if somebody had an accident. He looked manecing, powerful and insane. Being abandoned on a planet, being genetically altered by the planet clearly had an effect on his personality and radicalized his paranoia and hate. He could have been a great antagonist, if they would have giving him more screentime and well-written dialogue. His powers ware AMAZING and terrifying. He could have been the scariest and most impressive villain ever! The scene where he starts to kill people is shocking and shows you, how dangerous he really is.The Fantastic Four: there are moments where they work togather as a team and it works. Unfortunatelly they act completely out of character. Instead of acting as the intelligent people they are, they act like typical superheroes.The evil plan: Dooms evil plan actually make sense and there was a build-up to what could happen in the movie, unfortunatelly it happened all too sudden and without tention build up. Was the movie good? the first part was very good, thanks to the actors and a good script, the last part was terrible. I still enjoyed the movie and I wish there was a directors cut.Would i recomment the movie? Yes, absolutely, but I would always warn people that the ending sucks. I feel sorry for Josh Trank and all the people that put a lot of love and energy into making tis movie. I don't think the terrible review the movie gets are actualy justified and I am shockt at how black and white some critics paint this movie that has two very differen parts.",1

133,"Superhero films have been doing a lot of incredible things lately, especially the ones based on Marvel comics. With so many characters to be brought to the big screen it doesn't seem likely for the trend to stop anytime soon. Giving the Fantastic Four another shot was a good idea. However this movie wasn't the way to do it. It's rushed and incomplete. Fragments of the story are missing, the villain has little motive, and the characters never really come together in any way that actually makes their team believable and satisfying. I applaud the attempts at change, but the execution is severely lacking. All that being said I still enjoyed the movie. It's definitely not the Fantastic Four movie I wanted, but I still found it to be an entertaining, yet highly flawed, sci-fi flick. There is a certain appeal to watching these talented actors come together on their project. However, once the powers come into play things go off the rails. It's a decent sci-fi flick, but a disappointing superhero movie. The charming cast is given some cheesy lines and their powers are brought to life with some surprisingly dated special effects. It kind of reminded me of an old-school, alien invasion flick in ways both good and bad. There's a lack of emotion and certain plot-lines, such as the broken friendship between Reed and Grimm, never see any sort of resolution. It's evident that some good ideas were behind this project, but ultimately something went wrong and the majority of the film was pieced together in ways that leave it all unfinished. Then there's Doom himself. The big baddy of the film, and one of the most significant super villains in all of comics, just sort of appears near the end of the film with some bogus plot and zero real reason for actually doing it. Part of why superhero films have been so successful recently is because of villains with real motivations and at least some attempts at being fleshed out. Those elements are strangely missing here. It feels like Doom was just included because ""oh yeah, this is a superhero movie. It kind of needs one of those."" You can tell there are a lot of good ideas here and lots of areas that maybe the writer(s)/director wanted to expand upon, but ultimately either didn't get to or just didn't care enough to actually try. The end results feel lazy and thrown together. Yet, despite is disjointed execution and fragmented nature, I still found myself enjoying it. Yes, it's a highly flawed bit of filmmaking. However it's got a great vibe, a likable cast, and a certain amount of likability to keep it entertaining despite all of the totally obvious flaws. I honestly think had it not had the Fantastic Four's name attached to it then maybe we all could have been a bit more forgiving. To be honest it just doesn't do these characters or their stories justice. For some reason though I still like it. Not because it's a good superhero film, but because it's a good bit of sci-fi nonsense that really could have been great had more effort been put into it. It's a flawed, yet strangely fun movie. One that doesn't do much for the heroes it tries to mimic, but does enough good despite itself to still be worth a watch so long as you are willing to put with a large list of flaws. For some reason I was apparently ready to. Somehow it was able to give me reason to even with the odds stacked against it. Because of that I give it a 7.7/10. I don't know how or even really why at all, but I enjoyed it. I would still like them to go back to the drawing board for these heroes in the future though. The Fantastic Four deserve better.",1
134,"I like the way the paint is all flat and then a bit starts dripping down, slowly trickling its way towards the bottom of the page... oh the movie, yeh nothing happens. The movie is 1 hour and 40 mins long and it takes the entire first hour for them to even get their powers. Amazingly tedious. The comparison to watching paint dry is unfair to paint, even before Bob Ross became popular again.",0
136,"Just.Sh!t. I'd rather watch Batman and Robin than this. Batman and Robin made me laugh and cry while this made me sleep and want to cut myself. I'm glad Stan Lee stayed away from this, no cameo or anything... Not going to make any puns but this is unfantistic :/",0
137,"Believe the hype, this movie was awful. Not like 2005 FF awful but Batman and Robin awful. Other than the performances of the main cast being Miles Tellar, Michael B Jordan, Jamie Bell, Kate Mara and Tobey Kebbell, there is literally nothing redeemable about this film. The special effects are terrible, the script is garbage, the direction and pacing of the film itself is half-assed, poorly made, dull and rushed cinematic defecation. The plot is filled with holes and goofs, the direction of the characters is poor as are their motivations. Doom is again poorly equalized, he starts out the film as it seems to be a genius who started the project but for reasons not explained left and became a shut in. Do not waste your time here, this movie was awful. It felt as if the whole movie was rushed which made it not feel at all like a fantastic Four movie and more like a Sci-Fi flick. The 3rd act of the movie is where it gets really bad as the movie basically goes from 0 to 60 rushing past everything that was important , the final fight was short and barely entertaining, like you could blink and its over. After watching this movie, you can see why Trank had a nervous and psychological breakdown during production and now refuses to ever do a comic book movie again.",0
138,"to be honest this movie is alright. i cant understand the bad reviews. i saw it and it was good, it was just a little bit short at the end. they should make it 1 hour longer and they should show more of their talents.i hope there is a sequel of it, i had a blast watching it.",1
140,"1/5★I'll break it down to the level of Fanatic Four:This is dumb movie. Movie waste of my time, your time and must never be spoken of again.Did the director watch The Avengers, saw what made it good and go yeah, lets have none of THAT, and proceed to make a boring, lazy and sad film that would only serve as a contrast to better films? Verdict: Skip Plot: Don't care. Don't watch.",0
142,"Good times, FF needed a new look, very reminiscent of the Ultimate FF by Millar. Enjoyed Doom as well. Love the Sci-Fi explorer approach. The new actors on board were great",1
143,"We get the realistic Fantastic Four film we deserve, but maybe it was a little bit too late for its time where twists and superhero films have become more super and stronger than before",1
144,"The first time a Marvel flick let me down... I can't say that I was overly excited to see this film, however it was a Marvel production so I was optimistic. Boy what a let down.  The film started off great, and then just drug out until it left me disappointed in the end. I think this film, no matter who makes it is gonna suck.  I expected so much more seeing how they plan to mesh all Marvel these films together in the future with the release of ""Civil War"".  Lastly, I sat in the theater with my Girlfriend and assured her that there would be additional footage as they always do after their movies.... and we got nothing!  Do not waste your time on this one.",0
146,"This was.... something. Something that the Marvel needed to strip it's rights of because this movie was terrible. Not to say there weren't some good things about this movie. I could tell Miles Teller intentionally didn't try to act after the whole director fiasco and the whole ""emotional"" scene when they lost Victor was so obviously script-read that it was hilarious. So seeing him not giving a damn about the movie was nice to see (I'll explain that later). The Ben actor (Both adult and kid version; the kid version of Reed was terrible IMO) was actually quite good and the best part of the movie. He actually could create chemistry with the characters (Again, I'll explain later). Michael B. Jordan's line delivery was alright. I have heard complaints about the special effects, but I think they're actually quite good, besides the green rivers on planet Zero, which stood out too much. My favorite scene in the entire movie is when Torch tells off Franklin about being wanting to be good for something (Once again, I'll explain later). Here come the negatives.... this will take forever. The humor, while witty at times, was so poorly delivered that it was unimpactful; The entire movie is predictable; there is zero chemistry between anyone except for Ben and Reed, which made the movie awkward and bland; there are many plot points left unresolved; the pacing was godawful, either too fast or too slow about through the entire movie; there is even an unintentional grammatical error in the movie said by Doctor Doom, speaking of Doctor Doom, his costume was...laughable, to say the least. I also found an obvious crew member in the beginning in one of the scenes. The Doctor Doom laboratory corridor ravage scene was unnecessarily gory for a superhero movie, and then, mid-scene, the movie realized that and went unrealistic again. Also, there wasn't much character development which lead to relation issues with the audience and the characters. Now those were only the bad parts of the movie. Here are the parts I HATED about the movie. -The comic book failures: Doctor Doom was not a weak as he was in the movie, making it so much easier to hate him. Speaking of that... - The villain himself: He did not explain on why he hated the world for what it is, so I couldn't reason with him. And that was painful for me because I couldn't side with the villain or the protagonists because of... - Franklin Storm: He was the second worst part of the entire movie. I hated the writer's intention's of his character in the movie. Franklin was treated like a revolutionary hero (and what was left for the braindead audience to think), but I was somewhat relieved at his death. He never guided the F4 to their future as the plot says. And when he made mistakes, he blamed everyone else for them. Oh yeah, and by the middle of the movie, he became no use to the F4 anymore, but still acts like he's a prodigy afterwards. I can't explain it all that well, but I just know that the writer's portrayed his character effortlessly. The actor was horrible as Franklin by the way, which made it that much worse. - The final battle: Only a conjoined word to describe this abomination of a showdown: Anti-climatic. - No staff effort: The worst part of the entire movie - The director, screenplay, writer, and Fox are all guilty of not trying. You can tell in the dialogue, script, leading, and screenwriting that nobody cared about this movie. Miles Teller I'll give a pass on because he was already halfway through the movie when he saw the issues that lied ahead for the movie, but the whole staff, aside from the actors, did not put effort into this movie, and I saw the laziness in this cashgrab that it is. That's what I hated most about the movie. Terrible movie, don't watch, don't waste an hour and a half like I did.",0
147,The first 15 minutes were good. But the rest was just absolutely garbage.Doctor Doom was the worst part of the movie.How did they beat doctor Doom in like 5 minutes?,0
148,"Fan4stic is a bizarre movie. Not only does it make similar mistakes to the previous films from taking too long to get powers and action but more. The film is one slow dull origin story that suddenly speeds up towards the end. This film is an hour and forty minutes and feels like it is missing an act. Dynamics have changed and there is corny dialogue as if a different writer has taken over.  Then the film sets up a sequel ripping off the ending to the new Avengers in the process. While I would love to dismiss this as them just getting the lame origin story out of the way, even origin stories aren’t this dull. Josh Trank said he wrote a brilliant script for this film that we didn’t get to see and after seeing this film I believe him.",0
150,"I couldn't be more sad to be giving this film this rating, especially because, in the months leading up to the film, I saw a lot of potential despite the rumors regarding shooting problems. There's an excellent cast here with tons of potential for energy and chemistry. There's a director who has proven himself to be a good filmmaker and storyteller. And there's an exciting concept at the core of this movie: presenting the Fantastic Four's origin like a sci-fi horror film, similar to movies like The Fly. I give one point to a sequence in the film which shows the potential of this original concept. However, everything else in this movie is awful... Fantastic Four reeks of studio control, leaving the film confused as to what it is and what it wants to be. The story is a series of plot points with no coherent way of connecting, the characters are nonexistent, and the film's pacing is awkward, with only one and a half action sequences and no second act. Overall, this is as bad as comic book movies get. A film with such great talent and so much potential squandered by trying to fit a mold of cliche superhero movies. Studios, take notes. Let filmmakers make good movies.",0
151,"By calling it as the title itself, I should retitled this franchise and turn it into ""Lametastic Four."" Because that's how Fantastic Four truly is a broken piece of needle that tries to hatch an egg and then destroys its shell for itself. This movie is s**t. Everything that the movie studio hopefully promised to bring a dark and unheard of gritty Fantastic Four us comic book freaks wanted is s**t. I felt very bad for director Josh Trank because he's done a prètty nice job on not only introducing him to ""Chronicle,"" but i think it was the right thing that he openly made a twitter rant saying ""it was a piece of s**t."" Well done, Josh. You're a great director no matter how those dimwits at Fox always likes to piss people off and saying ""this movie should've been a lot better if it weren't for me or the ones that already interfered my vision. Way to burden the series. Fox."" I kinda rented it on DVD and it was awful. Everything except the casting of the movie. Maybe Michael B. Jordan, Miles Teller, Kate Mara, and the underrated actor who played Billy Elliot, should have their own superbero movies in the future. The acting was underwhelming, the story is so bad even DC's Batman VS. Superman couldn't even decide who wins in a pie-eating contest, the CGI effects are chringeworhy to watch. And seeing that it is a Marvel reboot (allegedly), I think the better Marvel reboot simply awarded by 2008's The Incredible Hulk is just by saying: it's time for a change, guys. We have some fun moments and we screwed up for the fans. Looks like I'll hang my suit, make a decision, and hand the Fantastic Four's rights back over to Disney. "" And as an avid longtime comic nèrd, it needs to make a change right now. So if you desperately want a Fantastic Four sequel, than I suggest you make a deal and see what Disney is adding to their deck of cards by dressing up as Spider-Man or still haunted by Rupert Murdoch's house of horrors. Just give it up, Fox.",0
152,"I was with it in the early part of the movie focusing on Reed Richards as a kid, having some aspirations to make a teleporter with Ben Grimm as a childhood friend helping him out and then a chance meeting with the Storm family, and from there on the movie just decides audience are as stupid as everybody in it.",0
155,"Don't believe the hate - people are so entitled to their own expectations these days.  As a long time fan of the books (back in its heyday) I really enjoyed this retelling.  It's different, it takes it's own licenses with the material, but I found it refreshingly different from superhero movies these days (and thus the vitriol). Not unlike the comics used to be - FF is more drama than action.  Sorry kiddos.  You still got your video games and Avengers to get off to.  ;p",1
156,"JUst saw this movie on regular TV last night.  Glad I didn't pay to see.  This movie is bad, really bad!. Horrible acting, bad script, slow moving.  You can see that they are setting up for a 2nd Fantastic Four movie to follow this first one and although I am sure there will be another remake sometime in the future, it won't be with this cast and director.  I watch the movie in the evening and actually had a hard time staying awake.  The reviews for this movie are dead on.  I have to give it a zero since I can't think of one part of the movie I enjoyed.  Don't waste your time like I did.",0
157,"""1"" is even more than this parody of a movie deserves. I don't really know why they keep coming back to this particular franchise and keep making such a bad entries of it. This Fantastic 4 movie is the worst comic-based movie I've ever seen. But in reality – it can't even be called a movie. Its just a parody of a super-human flick with no real acting and worst dialogues in the entire history of movies. This movie should've not existed in the first place. But since it exists everyone shoot spread the world of its awfulness, so that people should not make the grave mistake of seeing this flick in the cinema. And thats our duty as a gentleman and as human beings.",0
158,"The Fantastic Four is not quite the disaster that every one said it was but it isn't much better than that. The three largest problems are lie in the editing, writing and pacing of the film. Starting with the pacing. The film is about and hour and a half. The first two thirds are all background and the villain is not even introduced until the very end! This is very poor pacing and leaves you confused about the central conflict of the film. When regarding the writing the Storms' father is written in a completely unsympathetic light and when he died I found myself saying ""good"" when that was clearly never the filmmakers intent. Also it seems that the fantastic four should rename themselves the Fantastic Stockholm Syndrome based on how the writing portrayed their ""partnership"" with the military. Lastly the editor should have caught Kate Mara's magically changing hair color. It was just bad post production editing or something. A character's hair color should not be the game of whoever is watching the film unless you're watching Harry Potter and the character is Tonks. All those flaws aside the directing is fairly average, Josh Trank reused several shots from his far superior film, Chronicle, and showed none of the creative ability that he exhibited while directing Chronicle but he also didn't show any lack of the basic principles of film making. The thing that was well done was the majority of the cast acted well. Diagnosis: Bad but not unwatchable, but at the same time is it really worth watching?",0
160,"Too slow and dramatised superhero flick, but acceptable. I can't say I liked the previous films and not this one. In fact, I kind of enjoyed watching this reboot. It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end. Obviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures. I agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts. 6/10",1
161,"It's a good film 6/10 , gave it an extra point for the body horror scenes and waiting for the DVD , I hope they'll give us a director's cut or an extended edition.",1
162,"Man, what a mess of a movie. The most boring and uneventful comic book movie i have ever seen. It's like they were doing the same thing all movie OVER AND OVER AGAIN. The villain was just horrible, they wasted Dr. Doom so bad, plus he looked horrible. I was honestly relieved when the movie finished. Overall it's just a mess of a movie that takes a **** on the fantastic 4 name, as if the previous 2 movies didn't do that properly.",0
163,"Fantastic Four (2015) is devoid of the cracking dialogue, humour and sense of fun that often characterizes Marvel films. It also has a poor villain, outdated special effects and a scattershot plot.",0
165,"A bad bad bad movie that feels like it pushes back the comic book movie genre that has been on the uprise for years now, with great movies like Iron man and Guardians of the galaxy etc. This movie tries to destroy all that and shows that FOX seem unable to make a good comic book movie that isn't X-men, and even then they can't always make a good X-men movie, but thats a tale for another day. This movie does so much wrong I don't even know if Marvel got the rights to this back if they could fix it, and that is saying a lot.",0
168,"I have no problem with the first act of Fantastic Four but it is not long before the whole film begins to feel rushed. There is no development between the group members because they spend too much time trying to set up this world in a different dimension rather than just tell an origin story. When the Fantastic Four get their powers there is a bit of turmoil among the heroes but it is never resolved. I didn't really feel like this movie was too short at 100 minutes but it just did not make very good use of its time. You can not blame the cast for a disappointing film though because the characters really didn't get enough development so you weren't even sure if the chemistry was good or bad in the group. The CGI in this film is also so bad. I think that The Thing actually looked better in the previous versions of the Fantastic Four and his voice sounds ridiculous. The CGI that is used when Mr. Fantastic stretches is also just so crude and fake. This dimension that they try to set up is very fake looking as well and you don't buy that this film is a world at all. Finally Doctor Doom, the famous nemesis of the Fantastic Four is so poorly portrayed in this film in so many way, just like the Thing his voice sounds so lame and he looks so terrible. He looks almost exactly like Robin Williams did in Bicentennial Man. He doesn't even appear in the film until there are only 20 minutes left so needless to say the final battle between good and evil is fairly uneventful. Sadly Fox has failed again with the Fantastic Four and I'm thinking its just about time to give up. I don't even want Marvel to carry on with these character because their own universe is starting to get crowded and I'm not sure where you could fit them in now. I have a feeling that we will see another Fantastic Four movie despite the critical and commercial flop this movie became.",0
169,"I tried....I tried to write a decently made review for this film...but I'm speechless. Absolutely speechless. This is now the fourth attempt at a Fantastic Four film. 4 TIMES AND THE BEST THEY COULD DO WAS OKAY. The FF deserve better than this. The casting was pretty alright and the cast tried there best to act around a terrible script, but for the most part, they just fail. And the whole cast has talent! Even the director, who created Chronicle, a film that I personally enjoy a lot, doesn't even really try! Awful CGI, awful green screen, awful story, everything for the most part screams...awful. This doesn't deserve money, it really doesn't. Go spend money on the better Marvel film still currently out, that's what most people are doing.",0
171,"The 2015 reboot of Fantastic Four is one of the worst superhero movies since Catwoman. Despite the great performance of Reg E. Cathey and the 20-minutes of the relationship between Reed Richards and Ben Grimm as young kids, which is kind of interesting, This is a fine example why Josh Trank will never work on superhero movies ever again, all thanks to its predictably rushed plot, not showing the superheroes to learn about their powers, no real relationship between the Fantastic Four, poorly-developed characters, horrible visual effects, terrible casting and acting performances (besides Reg E. Cathey), unpleasant tone, lack of humour, some of its action scenes that lasts for over 6 minutes that are ridiculously dull and weak and its anti-climatic third act. Everybody should stay away from this movie. If you're a Marvel fan, maybe you can only rent it for one day. I think that the 2005 version of Fantastic Four and its sequel are better if you ask me. I gave it a 2 out of 10.",0
173,"One of the best, perhaps even the best, superhero flick to come along.  Probably what a lot of viewers didn't like is the fact the characters spend a considerable amount of time talking to each other rather than beating each other up for a half hour at a time.  It's a classic origins story.  It's not Casablanca and it's not Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and it's not Guess Who's Coming To Dinner or In the Heat of the Night.  It's a superhero flick.  It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  The characters are likeable.  And for once I found myself watching an entertaining movie instead of checking my watch every fifteen minutes like I do when trying to tolerate yet another typical action-adventure spectacular -- which have become yet another name for boredom.",1
177,"If your looking for a film with action, and about super heroes then this isnt for you, if you are looking for people talking in dark rooms for most the film and being broody and not smiling then this is for you, this film got it all wrong, even the colourful cheesy campy films before it are more of a pleasure to watch, at least their closer to the comic, and fun! please dont waste your time, I didnt belive it when others said it was terrible, I thourght it would have something good about it, my god was I wrong, even the director after a year commented that it was not what he wanted it to be.the film tried to be more dark, and gritty, and realistic, but it just ended up being a depressed film that took too long to get to the heroes whom arnt even heroes just stupid high IQ teens who want to be famous and cause the problems they created, and none of this was fun, the only action comes at the end of the film and its a stupid beam in the sky, with an uninteresting fight, the only thing this film is good for is to educate about bad script, dialog, acting, pacing, how to screw up a franchise etc blah blah, so if you are a writer watch it and learn what not to do.",0
179,"The best word to describe such a movie is disappointment. There is a point in the beginning of it where you thing that it isn't that bad as it's being said, but after that it's nothing but mistakes. Specially when you realise that the movie has ended, and you thought it was just starting to maybe get good. I wouldn't waste Money on seeing it.",0
180,"Let us heed please! But that movie as re- bad indeed , there are many reasons , missed some parts of some scenes and a few to seal three hours , but the short 80 minutes, another because the image was very poor resolution, one that saw me the worst superhero movie I've seen in my life, because the director Josh Trank I tell him mature and not so f***ing , not again muddy , and canceled the sequel , what if either the same or worse than the I better not see me first sequel if it is bad , the f*** of movie !

This movie is so hard to laugh at as it has the dark tones of Batman and robin. this movie deserves to go up their on the mount Rushmore of comic book movies next to Batman and robin, Steel, Halle Berrys cat woman. This could be one of the best movies in history right next to the likes of Terminator Genysis, tooth fairy and the adventures of Pluto Nash",1
188,"""Dull and downbeat"" and ""woefully misguided attempt"" are not the words to describe this film, at least to me. There are cons, though, because this and everything else that exists in the universe, is flawed. Doom is handled poorly and looks dumb, the film skips a year ahead when it's unnecessary, and the ending is no doubt rushed, nonsensical, and a colossal disappointment. To make up for these cons, though, I really enjoyed the performances and characters, which somewhat overshadowed the flaws with this film...except the ending. The ending was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous! Rushed and predictable. Doom was the worst aspect of the film, no doubt. Toby Kebbell did a swell job on his acting part, but the writers did not know what the heck they were doing with him. The fight between him and the Fantastic Four must've been at least five minutes tops! Usually, the final conflict between the protagonist(s) and antagonist(s) lasts longer than at least ten minutes, in previous experiences. The best part of the ending was seeing the terrible villain being killed because I could finally be relieved (partially) of the torture I experienced watching this bland and poorly handled villain for the previous thirty minutes or so. Though to try to forget about the ending, the first ten to fifteen minutes were great, with young Reed and young Ben beginning their friendship. The child actors were great, with a few minor slip-ups from Reed's child actor, but other than that small nitpick, those were easily one of the best segments of the entire film. The most memorable performances came from Miles Teller (Reed Richards), Kate Mara (Susan Storm), and Reg E. Cathey (Dr. Franklin Storm). Michael B. Jordan (Johnny Storm) and Jamie Bell (Ben Grimm) were fantastic as well, but the previous three stood out to me more. The last thing I'll say before I conclude is that I wished that, besides getting a much better ending, they would've expanded on the arc of Susan's adoption. That was really intriguing and I hope that in the sequel (if they still decide to make it) that they'll expand upon it more.",1
189,"Die-hard, obsessive comic book fanatics who tear their hair out at the slightest change in movies will detest this but laid back casual comic readers will enjoy it. I'm part of the latter party so I enjoyed it. Look, it's not ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but it wasn't bad either. In fact it was better than I expected. One of the best things is that the climax is really short. You heard me. A short climax. In a superhero movie. A dream come true. The facial expressions on The Thing were really good and Dr. Doom was a badass villain. Don't watch it if you worship the comics as your God. But if you like the superhero genre but not as an obsession, you'll like it. Not quite Fantastic but still good.",1
190,"Alas, I actually thought that this movie had potential. Yet, I was so wrong. As this 2 hour bore fest kicked in, I thought  ""Oh god. Its that kid from Divergent. I'm gonna die.""

194,"This movie clears up alot compared to the other 2. It explains well how each individual recieved their powers. This is a great origin movie that has great graphics and a cast of good characters. That being said the only problem I have with this movie is that the action scenes arent the best. There are like 2 or 3 punchea and thats it, not much of a fight. A little rushed but worth watching.",1
195,So Going into this movie I saw it get a lot of flank. I thought poor film it really cant be that bad can it. I understand it was trying to go for a darker feel. Sorta like the dark knight trilogy or man of steel but it really does not work for this type of film. The dark and broodingness of this film only works for so long that after awhile it becomes redundant. I don't know whos idea it was to have the actors play a bunch of emotionless scientists but mo one seemed like they were trying. Take queen amadals's acting from the pequals and multiply it by the entire cast and oh while your at it make the whole film really brooding and emotionless. THat's fan4stic if you have not already seen it. Other problems that plaged this movie was the movies pacing and charcter develpment was really lacking. I found it super weird that they were using many phrases that the fantastic four uses as punch lines which was really weird. If i had to find something positive to say about this movie it is that this movie is bearable all the way until reed Richards reaches the Baxter building. That is where it all falls apart. Oh they got Dr.doom completely wrong too. I don't know who ever thought this abomination of movie would be a great idea. Guys stay away from this movie at all possible costs.,0
197,"The opening scenes of “Fantastic Four” — 20th Century Fox’s reboot of its Marvel superhero franchise — take place in 2007, which happens to be the year that the second movie in the prerebooted franchise (“Rise of the Silver Surfer”) was released. Ben Grimm and Reed Richards (played as children by Evan Hannemann and Owen Judge, later by Jamie Bell and Miles Teller) don’t mention that fact, because if they did the cinematic universe would collapse on itself and all light would be extinguished from the cosmos. Also, the thoughtful people at Fox probably don’t want to remind anyone of those earlier movies. Some of us have long memories, though, and can summon the bad cinema of the mid-aughts with furious clarity. Looking back on those days, I remember — Jessica Alba. O.K., forget it. I’ll just go ahead and reboot my 2005 review of the first “Fantastic Four” origin story, which I said was “fantastic only in its commitment to mediocrity.” That’s still true, though a decade later it’s true in different ways. Are you offended that I’m recycling material? Sorry, but I’m as susceptible to the influence of movies as anyone else. This “Fantastic Four,” directed by Josh Trank from a script he wrote with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, feels less like a tale of superhero beginnings than like a very long precredit opening sequence. As boys growing up on Long Island, Reed and Ben are brains-and-brawn science-fair buddies. Reed is working on a teleporting machine that attracts the attention of Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), who runs some kind of boarding school/research center in Manhattan. There, Reed meets the Storm kids, Sue the scientist (Kate Mara) and Johnny the hot-rodder (Michael B. Jordan), and also a brooding intellectual named Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). Much later, after they have traveled to a parallel dimension where a planet full of energy (please just fill in whatever exposition you feel will get you to the next part of this sentence), Victor will face down his erstwhile classmates and say: “There is no more Victor. There is only DOOM!” There is nothing wrong with that kind of line — he’s a newly fledged ultravillain in a comic-book movie, after all — but it needs to be earned, with gravity or wit. The best superhero entertainments have both. “Fantastic Four,” despite the dogged efforts of its talented young cast, has nothing. The special effects are at about the level of the early “Harry Potter” movies — lots of glowing green clouds and ice-blue bolts and force fields. The human drama is meager. Once again, the only real pathos belongs to Mr. Bell’s Ben, who finds himself trapped in a stony new body and weaponized by a ruthless government. Mr. Teller stretches, not as an actor but as a digitally enhanced body. Mr. Jordan burns in the same way, and Ms. Mara disappears. Her character also has the power to make other things vanish. I would say she should have exercised it on this movie, but in a week or two that should take care of itself.",0

202,"Ugh this film is bad. It started well but it just goes bad after a while. They pulled too many timeskip in the film which to me is a sign that you don't know how to cover the entire film properly so decided to use timeskip to cover up for that. Then the characters, it's bad not because of the stars but rather its the chemistry between them. Michael B. Jordan did a better job as Human Torch then i expected but this is Fantastic Four, collectivism is as important individual. Seeing the four characters in this film as Fantastic Four was just awkward.

I seriously thought the story was brutally rushed and it made me a little bored.I loved the characters. I love Michael B. Jordan as the new Human Torch. But the movie and everything else kind of sucked. The quality of the film was...Just, not good. The CGI was just awful.They ruined my favourite SUPER HERO TEAM of all time!I NEVER. WANT.

The acting was crap, there was a lack of action, they ruined Dr.Doom and the scenes from the trailer weren't even in this! How could they do this?? I could give this a 0 but the reason why i gave it a 2 is because the first 30 minutes was all right and they used The Thing's iconic catchphrase.

The result is a movie that's not worth your time or your money.

Pourtant mis entre les mains d’un réalisateur talentueux Josh Trank est âgé de 24 ans (trop jeune et casser dans ce milieu) son premier film était Chronicles qui était pour moi un excellent film. Avec les 4 Fantastiques, il y a un bon fond, mais c'est complètement décousu. On ressent le travail dans certaines scènes et pour d'autres je dirais que c'est un gros colmatage à Le « Fox ». Pour moi la Fox ne voulait pas perdre les droits et vu que le prochain X-Men est prévu en 2016 il leur aurait resté moins de 1 an pour la postproduction ce qui faisait trop court. Donc ils ont sorti ce film malgré le fait qu'il est un moyen. Car sinon Marvel aurait récupéré la franchise... ‪#‎Dommage‬",0
218,"A lot of people expected action the whole time, I didn't. The story was very good, they showed the backstory, and how they grew as a team. My only complaint, the final fight was very short and not that good.",1
219,"Seemingly rushed movie, terrible storytelling, with a cast like this, it's a shame that these characters were completely bland and that the movie gave us no reasons to cheer for them. I can only find positives on Miles Teller's performance and Doctor Doom's reveal, apart from that, a great letdown...",0
220,"Outright AbysmalFant4stic had a very ambitious vision of a dark, gritty, and realistic Fantastic Four, But the studio completely destroyed Trank’s vision and his career.",0
221,"Fantastic Four is a disastrous attempt to reboot one of Marvel's best-known families, has a confusing direction, a messy script, poorly-directed actors, mediocre special effects and a disappointing final act, it was not this time that we will see a decent movie of this franchise.",0
222,"I like comic books, but I've never been a fan of the Fantastic Four, that group is not my thing, but I admit that I saw their first two movies and had some enthusiasm to see this reboot.First came the images of the filming and did not look encouraging, then they released the advances and these did not look interesting, and at the end of everything came the premiere and many already know the story, criticis has shattered this reboot everywhere, calling one of the worst superhero movies to dateWith those precedents anyone would avoid going to the movies, after all when half the world says that the movie is bad, one as a spectator expects the worst.But is it really Fantastic Four the massive failure that everyone says it is? Personally I say not that huge deblacle, it is a very weak, failed, very poorly structured and poorly written movie but I've seen worst.",0
223,"Yeah the first two Fantastic Four movies were full on hoaky cheese, but this reboot has way to much edge and has no sense of fun to it at all.",0
224,"Probably one of the worst superhero films ever seen, poor storyline, don't see this film!",0
225,"STRAIGHT TRASH!!!!! What is the director thinking, he must have limited chromosomes? This movie must put itself in the bin and cry itself to sleep.",0
226,Made Elektra look good!! I hate this movie so much right now. This is on the 5th spot on worst movie I've ever seen in life. Don't buy this movie or rent it because it could ruined your night.,0
227,You stupid little babies don’t like this because it serious and it has no action except for the last 5 minutes which is really boring that’s what makes the movie this.This movie second favorite superhero after the really Batman and robinPlease pay me money and watch this or you will get punched like pubg,1
228,"""Fantastic Four"" is a nonsense that passes without pain or glory for our eyes.Honestly, it starts well, but then everything goes down the toilet in an impressive way.",0
229,"Was Sue Storm as developed as I would like? No. Should Dr. Doom have had a more personal reason to be evil? Oh yeah. But for the most part, I enjoyed the newest iteration of Fantastic Four. At least this actually LOOKED like a movie, unlike the garbage versions of the 2000's and the unreleased 1994 version.Not great, but pretty investing.",1
231,"What? Why the dark tone? Look at Spider-Man he's a campy character and that's why the films are successful but this film try to take The Amazing Spider-Man route but fail so badly! Bad story, weak character, poor script, and makes the Fantastic Four from the 90s look like an Oscar worthy masterpiece! The concept is good, and good acting but it doesn't save the movie! I rather watch Batman & Robin this this ""film"".",0
232,"This movie is a real shame to its predecessors.Weak plot,Laughably cheesy dialogues ruined it entirely and not to mention the lifeless dull acting..really disappointed",0
233,"Just bad. What can I say? They fought for a minute while they get super power for an hour and 30 minutes. The villain was the worst. I just have one question.Which is better(or worse), Fantastic Four or Green Lantern?",0
234,Fant4stic takes itself so seriously that it forgets to be a fun movie. I think I would rather watch Batman and Robin over this movie because at least it’s unintentionally hilarious.,0
235,worst movie in all time.I hated every godamn second.Even worst than Justice Leauge and the amazing spider man.I hope fantastic four goes back to marvel.,0
236,"This reboot is lifelessly dull, with boring characters that barely have any chemistry with each other, CGI effects that look outrageous, and action scenes that look absurd. What a disaster of a movie.",0
237,"A film that is simply vexing, confusing and badly planned. It will not come as a surprise if you join the next ""Worst Movies of All Time"" lists.",0
238,So-So Superhero Film. more like fantastic bore. Boring plot and character like a kid movie.,0
239,The Fantastic Four does not deserve what's happening to him these last years.,0
240,"No. Do not waste your time or money by watching this sad excuse of a movie. Nothing works here and it is not even remotely enjoyable for all of its faults. The 1994 film adaptation, while also terrible, is at least a whole lot more entertaining.",0
241,"Fant4stic (2015), directed by Josh Trank, is one of the superhero movie remakes which are always concerned to have better special effects than the previous versions of them but this movie turned out to be much different than other remakes. It’s so BAD! Almost everything in here sucks! The acting was also one of the problems that turned Fant4stic into a…Fantastic Four parody starring Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, Michael B. Jordan as Human Torch? I mean that character in this movie was nothing like in the comics. Blonde hair, white skin but in here black hair and black skin. You got the wrong cast! Also Victor Von Doom looked like a piece of turd. He was more like a parody character and spoke like a character in a parody. Everything he did was funny. His hood and cape made him a bigger turd. He looked completely worse than Dr. Doom in Fant4stic (2005). The plot was a complete **** People didn’t want to spoil plots to others but the thing is this movie doesn’t have anything to spoil! The Fant4stic got their powers, Dr. Doom came and created his new universe and they had to stop them which they succeeded. This plot was almost the worst of the worsts. The screenplay was mostly terrible. They talked like children and teens but they’re adults and the screenplay made them act like their childhood. There were more significant stuffs from the comics that they didn’t take: humor, joy,… I barely laughed at this movie, like there’s nothing funny at all. I only laughed at the terrible CGI they had done. The visual effects was thought to be the best of the movie but then it was opposite. It was also one of the worsts about this movie. The background’s okay but the CGI was quite cheesy. I mean look what they had done to Reed’s arm when he stretched it. It looked so bad (as bad as a movie from the 90s trying to use CGI that wasn’t invented yet like The Mummy Returns (the Scorpion King looked like something we wanted to laugh at, not to fear)). Even though thi movie was owned by FOX, nothing could be done greatly. I really wanted to like the movie, but there was nothing to like, nothing to be impressed. We are talking about superheroes, not science projects and this movie, it took most of the minutes about science projects here and science projects there. There’s too much. The superheroes time was so short like only half an hour when Doom came back and the Fant4stic tried to stop him. It was a terrible idea to add too much of science in this movie but anyway, it was already bad. This is one Marvel movie nobody wanted to see.",0
242,Best example that you should trust your Director and let him do. Even he himself doesn't like the Movie because he couldn't create the experience that he wanted to show the audience. Doctor doom is awful and looks like **** the Main cast is talented but you cannot see it here. The Movie is 75% exposition and the end fight is really boring. I fell sorry for everyone who worked on this Movie,0
245,Not the best movie in general but it is still the best Fantastic Four Movie.,1
