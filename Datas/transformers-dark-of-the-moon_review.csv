1,"Transformers 3, action action ACTION, forget about the plot, Transformers 3 is the best action movie! Tons of special effects and sci-fi action that you feel guilty if you blink your eyes once!3D will be your main choice seriously, though I still think it's a bit expensive, Transformers 3 really show what 3D effects are capable of!I found some parts are not that logic, otherwise Transformers would have win OSCAR!",1
2,"You better start looking for the red carpet leading to the Oscars because Transformers is sure going to be at it's TECHNICAL end.  Michael Bay, with all his grace, delivers one of his finest peaces of contemporary cinema up to date. You wouldn't believe it without seeing it. Close to the end of the film, my friend sitting next to me turned at me and whispered: ""This is beyond Blockbuster madness"". And it made sens. What Bay and his team have achieved is beyond conventional summer movie making. The crafting here is so perfect and detailed  that it pushes and redefines the boundaries of film making. From the chilling sound design, to the godlike visual effects, and perfect attention to detail from Bay's part when choosing his shots.It's an honest work that re establishes what fun is all about when the lights dim down and the screen springs to life.Just... Have fun and don't pay attention to all those lifeless critics who's conceptual fun is merely based on egocentric shallow intellectual show off and pragmatic dismissing of Bay's work. Criticising his editing and shot compositions which are, to a large extent, unique, but welcome.",1
3,"This film frustrates the heck out of me. I had high expectations, I wanted to like it so much. But I cannot because there is too much of the film that is just BAD! Essentially everything that held the second film back holds this film back as well. Horrendous dialogue, useless characters, annoying characters, preposterous plot, lame attempts of humor...it was just not very entertaining. The action in this film is pretty AMAZING! I was so entertained by the second part. The effects, sounds, explosions, music was all perfect. Michael Bay is definitely a master of awesome action. But in-your-face nonstop action is not enough for a good film.",0
4,"It's loud, long, meaningless, pointless, it's lost in it's own story line. Transformers 3 feels thrown all over the place, and I was wondering throughout the whole movie: 'What is going on?'. I don't care about the effects, which are breathtaking (especially in 3D), cause it hadn't brought me any satisfaction. Where is the plot, people? Cause that's all that I care about. The script was terrible, made for kids. When the movie was over I've felt tired and mad at myself cause I was dragged into this mess. I have to admit that  It's a little better than the last one, but that doesn't mean it's good. It's dreadful. It's cheesy. Next time, (if there's going to be a next time) just give more money to the writers to develop a better script. This one falls flat.",0
5,Here is a summary of the entire movie: MICHAEL BAY! awwww yeeeeeah explosions! hot girls! robots transforming with annoying sound effects! MICHAEL BAY! explosions! blah blah dark of the moon! pillars! explosions! shia labeouf screaming! shia labeouf shedding a single tear! explosions! pointless dialogue that leads up to an explosion! cool cars! a freeway chase scene with EXPLOSIONS!  a super hot British girl! more cool cars! the most embarrassingly unfunny  dialogue i have ever heard! MICHAEL BAY! collapsing building! plot holes galore! robots! more unfunny dialogue! epic music! MICHAEL BAY'S SIGNATURE 360 DEGREE EPIC PANNING WIDE ANGLE CAMERA VIEW! explosions! shia labeouf! tyrese gibson saying something dumb! other people that dont matter at all! people jumping out of planes in slow motion! explosions! MICHAEL BAY! epic music! explosions! THE END!,0
6,"Truly strong as a movie. This movie stands high with its epic sets and most epic music. But would be better to bring some of the best autobots such as prowl and also ressurect jazz. And also, MORE ACTION! 9.6/10",1
7,"The Worst Film of 2011, just behind of ""Abduction"" and ""The Human Centipide II (Full Sequence)"", is visually ugly, and worst and worst and worst! I wait that Transformers IV never exist.",0
8,"Worst film I've ever seen.  The first movie I can recall that I haven't been able to finish.  It truly is that bad, no characterization, plot, emotion.  Truly a mess.",0
10,"It may be better than Transformers 2, but Dark of the Moon is still a sloppy loud train wreck.  You would think replacing Megan Fox would help improve the acting, but it may have gotten worse.",0
11,"A lot of people say that ""Dark of the Moon"" is better than ""Revenge of the Fallen"", which isn't saying much, but I think it's actually worse than the previous film. The film is long, bloated, obnoxious, annoying and damn right bland. Shia LaBeouf returns as the main ""hero"" Sam Witwicky, and this time he has a new girlfriend, Carly, who is played by British model, Rosie Hungington Whitley...that's right, Model, not actress. This just goes to show that director Michael Bay only cares for young, attractive women who have to look good instead of act good. The problem is that these two actors have no chemistry whatsoever. A girl who seems unrealistically calm like Carly, what is she doing sticking around with someone who is loud and not-so-courageous like Sam? I'll tell you why...because the screenplay says so. There are some really tasteless and unfunny moments that involve Ken Jeong, such as the scene where he takes Shia LaBeouf's character to a workplace bathroom and constantly says ""Deep Wang"" numerous times. Does Michael Bay honestly think this is funny? This is supposed to be an action film not a comedy film, then again, if it was a comedy film, it isn't very funny. Humor in action films are supposed to be subtle and occur when the film gets a little too serious, but I honestly cannot remember a single actor taking any of these events seriously. 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is worse than ""Revenge of the Fallen"", after watching the film for about an hour and a half, I was already done, but clearly Michael Bay hadn't finished yet and he had to rinse the film for another hour too long.",0
15,"This movie was okay, but it really felt tiring and long in the end. Firstly, this movie was structured oddly. For the first hour, the movie felt fine, having action scenes separated by a few scenes of dialogue. It felt nice until the Chicago sequence. This scene took the 90 minutes left of the movie, consisting entirely of every single step these guys had to do to defeat the Decepticons and it felt like a chore to watch it as it just kept going on and on. There wasn't any character development in this section too, just non-stop action. This would be fine if the characters had developed before the scene, but rather are left on a climax and magically end up being developed in the end. The computer graphics looked fine, and it wasn't too impressive since it was done equally well in the past two movies. As for the actors, they didn't really play too well. It wasn't really stand out for me. The dialogue mostly killed the acting for me, because it felt like the actors were doing a mediocre job when really it was just the scripting that's making them suffer. And finally, I watched this movie in 3D, and I can say that it didn't stand out once to me. None of the action felt any better or worse, and it just ended up being unnecessary. I couldn't really tell if anything came out of the screen. Overall, this movie is below average. It is plentiful of action, but if you wanted anything other than that, you're better off seeing another movie.",0
16,"You don't go into a Michael Bay movie worrying about the story, but wow, this one had plot holes you could drive a sentient semi trailer through. At times outright ignoring elements established in the first two movies- just don't think about it too much. The new lead actress is a Victoria's Secret model with no acting experience, so we're not subtle about the whole ""style over substance"" concept. But most viewers only care about one thing only: Giant Robots Fighting. And this delivers in that area. Bay now uses ""bullet time"" to make it clear which robot is fighting which, so he is learning, and you will walk out with your Giant Robot Fighting desire satisfied. A popcorn flick that delivers mindless but fun, but if you're looking for the 2011 version of ""Inception,"" this 'aint it.",0
17,"When I saw this film yesterday, I was expecting two things: Transformers and explosions and that's what I got. This film is indeed better than Revenge of the Fallen leaving out a lot of the jokes which made that film look kind of stupid. The acting and story in this film is decent, but the action is what you really come for. I also saw this film in 3D and yes, see this film in 3D because the film was filmed in 3D, not converted! Appreciate what this is: one of the best blockbusters of summer 2011.",1
18,"Still remain a big transformers fan, despite the thrashing Michael Bay and the franchise has taken over the years. The only problem for me was the acting of rosie Huntington- Whitely,",1
20,"I know saying this will get me considerable hate mail from any normal cinephile but I think Transformers 3 was good. I was at first skeptical of this film like every other person in the world, I grew more skeptical when I learned that Megan Fox was fired...she being one of the two reasons I watched the transformers movies. The other being giant alien robots fighting in fantastic, special effects filled battles, and let me tell whoever is reading this...Transformers 3 does not disappoint on the latter. Yet i did have some problems with the movie because few movies are perfect and transformers will never be one of those few no matter how hard Michael Bay tries. My main problem is the pacing of the movie...just like every other transformers movie, the fighting is saved for the last hour or so in spectacular set-pieces. It was the first hour that nearly killed me here. The first hour follows the forgettable human element Shia Labeouf as he tries to find a job amidst the terrible job market that is the United States SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!! He gets a job with film veteran John Malkovich and asian funny man Ken Jeong...both actors I love. Yet they aren't right for Transformers action oriented style which is immediately apparent. They simply help to develop Sam(Shia) and progress the main storyline. Yet after that horrific first hour you are treated to some further plot development and the realization that **** is hitting the fan in the film. Now the movie gets good...As usual Megatron and his crew are scheming to destroy the autobots just like every other transformers movie to date. And this is the best part, Michael Bay effectively  makes the stakes feel high. Gone are the days where you never saw a Decepticon kill any humans. Theres plenty to go around, and quite frankly i'm okay with that...imagine a sort of War of the Worlds...with Decepticons. And then of course the final hour of glorious robot fighting begins just like the past 2 films and this is where the film exceeds. The fights are beautiful to watch and the set-pieces are exquisite...nothing says awesome like a building collapsing with Shia Labeouf in it. The wing suit sequence also looks terrific, and the action just feels fun to watch. The entire hour long robot-smashing festival was a great redemption for the annoying characters of Turturro and that annoying RC autobot thing from the last film(the one that wouldn't shut up). And it was just good. Optimus doesn't sacrifice himself at every moment he gets and there aren't jokes throughout the entire fight sequences which made it good. My only problem was that any time any of the robots did anything half the audience of the movie theater would start applauding which got really annoying as its an hour long robot fight scene. Other than the bad first hour or so, I liked the movie. Transformers 3 is definitely a must watch for anyone who likes giant robots fighting or any of the first 2 movies.",1
21,"People might think I'm crazy, but I actually liked Revenge of the Fallen better than this. When I saw that movie I saw it for what it was. An awesome visual eye-candy fest, and that's what the Transformers movies are; films that are fun for how great they look, and I actually felt that that was lacking here. Yes the last forty five minutes are ridiculous and crazy, but that's pretty much it, aside from the Chernobyl bit. What we got was basically an hour and a half of Shia Laboeuf looking for a job, then forty five minutes of robots kicking ass. What I wanted to do was forgot about anything that resembled a plot, and  just immerse myself in the VISUAL genius of Michael Bay, but I couldn't because there is just some awful butchering of cinema culture by the screenplay and story. For example I can't focus Shia Laboeuf being swung around holding onto a wire latched onto the eye of a massive decepticon in a flurry of wildly unrealistic, dumb fun, because my mind keeps on going back to the worthlessness of John Malkovich'srole in the movie. Lot's of people say that Michael Bay is a bad director, but when they see his films their complaint is usually the plot and script, but what you have to keep in mind is that he doesn't write his films. Ehren Kruger (the writer of scream 3(an abomination)) wrote this not him. There was actually decent directing in this film but it was ruined by that horrible script.",0
22,"Transformers 3 is one of those movies that you just completely ignore the characters and the story and just be lay back and enjoy the awesome CGI visuals. Michael Bay and learnt from his mistakes from Revenge of the Fallen and toned down the amount of stupid, cheesy jokes (*cough* *cough* BALLS). One thing I really enjoyed personally was how creative the Transformers look even if they were based off the Cartoons/Toys. Overall I rate this film a 7/10. +AWESOME CGI+Great looking Transformers-Seems bloated sometimes when there is too much special effects going on.-Bizarre, unexplainable moments.",1
23,"I just saw this movie,& i have to say i REALLY enjoyed it! It does take a while to build up to some significant action(not that theres anything wrong with that,alot of films do),but when it gets going,it doesnt let up,& blows your socks off! In fact i have to say i've never seen action this intense & gripping in a film before,& i'm a movie buff.The action & music is VERY,Very cool,& the film in general bears more resemblance to No1 than No2(but i did enjoy No2 also).This is Micheal Bay doing what Micheal Bay unashamedly does best,Epic Action.This film gets a 10 from me,as i found it HIGHLY entertaining,& has the best action i've seen so far in a movie!(my own opinion). I'm very tired now,of people knocking Micheal Bay &/or his films,Yet they watch every single film he makes?! (They know who they are,they're the ones that are going to press 'No' to my review).If you dont like his films,dont watch them! Its THAT simple.Geez.. Anyway,onto the 3D,Although it is very good in this film,& the closest(Albeit not quite as good)as Avatar,It is an easy second,& is one of the 'very' few films worth watching in 3D.Though i think i'm generally done with 3D now on the whole.Its not as good as it likes to think it is,& i'd rather watch a film without the glasses(& extra cost),& just watch my films in future without the gimicky,(& in my opinion mostly not very good)3D effects.I'm just happy to watch a film the normal way,& save the extra money.To be honest,i wouldnt see any more 3D films if it was no extra cost even.Its too distracting,yet underwealming..",1
24,"I would like to open by saying I was very wary of going to see this movie because of the reviews, and I have to say DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU! I went to see the movie and I am so glad I did. I would like to say sorry to all of the negative reviewers, but you must all be decrepit seniors with weak hearts. The movie leaves you feeling somewhat stressed and overwhelmed, but if you follow to plot (which is good, and really not all that complicated as many have complained about) that feeling is what you should have, it fits in perfectly. Shia's acting is great here, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays a much better leading lady than Fox ever did. As far as for those that say the movie is loud and dumb I must say that the heavy and fast paced action doesn't even start until more than half way through the movie, the first half is set up for the plot. All in all I would say this is a fantastic movie that you shouldn't miss. Think for yourselves people, don't blindly follow the Bay-haters.",1
25,"After the second crappy Transformer movie ('' Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ''), they made a third one. Well, I liked it ! It was enjoyable, it had bad-ass action, with awesome villains, and the girl (Sam's girlfriend which is played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) was hot ! I'm glad that this movie didn't disappointed me like the second one. It kind of brought back the '' good '' mark in the Transformers series. I was glad that Megan Fox was replaced by this new chick (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Her character was funner and made a better match with Shia. Also, Optimus Prime was epic ! He had a sword and a shield. I like the fact that after the fights, he always gives those cool speeches. Some people are just complaining about the plot. It's an action movie ! We're supposed to enjoy it ! It's entertainment, that's what this movie was made for.",1
26,"The Transformers movies so far have mostlyy  been about visuals more so than deep storytelling. This one is no exception and does a top  notch job doing just that. There is an equal balance of human and robot action with everyone serving a purpose. The 3d in this movie is pretty good too but still un-needed. The story takes elements from actual historical events stemming around the moon landing. These events show a deep cover-up by humans who were very aware of the robotic aliens. The plot is coherent and compelling giving much weight to the pacing of the film. Character development isn't as prevelent and this does hurt the movie. Not in a big way but with a story this big, i wanted the characters to have a little more weight. The main point is the action and this is nothing short of perfection. A special nod to a fight involving Sideswipe and Ironhide. Explosions and shootouts galore with the violence level taken up a notch. Of course this is one of the best summer movies this year and Michael Bay raises the bar again.",1
27,"First things first. This movie is leaps and bounds better than Revenge of the Fallen. There are no robots with testicles, no humping robots, and stereotypical robots. They play it close to the chest with the tongue in cheek humor at a minimum. The story is simple enough but the enjoyment is endless. I can see why some critics are ripping on the movie, Bay is terrible at directing actors. Most actors in the film have no direction and just seem silly, but lets face it did you want to see Transformers for the acting, or the action? If you're looking for non stop action like no other director but Bay can deliver then go see this film.",1
28,"solid action and better story and better camerawork than the second.  Also this is the first movie worth watching in 3D.  Yes just like the last two you an pick apart details about the movie but this one has the right combination of pacing, action, comedy, with a story that is more engaging than the sequel it follows.  While it is over the top it is not so over the top you become self aware or lose interest in it.  I enjoyed seeing all the famous actors in this movie including Ken Joeng, John Malkovich, and Frances McDormand.",1
29,"I try to be a legitimate film critic. I really do. That is why I am almost ashamed that I am quite in love with this movie. No, it has nothing to do with the fact that I am a massive nerd. Itâ",1
30,"I feel that some people critique films badly just to feel special, this movie is based off action figures.... When it was brought to the world as a film did you actually expect them to come up with a more diverse and deep plot then the one that we came up with when we played with the TOYS as children? It's supposed to entertain you and bring life to the games you used to play as kids and it most certainly did that for me. Excellent special effects the one-liners did their job and they kept the new girls lines to a minimum so she didn't take away from the film.... If you're looking for a movie with super plot and depth, why do you go see movies like this? Overall great summer movie I recommend to everyone",1
31,"Do I dare to say it: I hate this even more than Revenge of the Fallen! The acting is worse. The storyline is worse. The dialogue is worse. The only thing that improved was the special effects, which saved the movie from being the worst action movie EVER!",0
32,"This is a film in witch you have to enjoy. It's not a film which sends out some ""deep message"" about the ""meaning of life"" or whatever. It's a film with tons of excellent special effects, great computer animation etc. so it can be watched from two different perspectives. One being an action perspective (here you study if the special effects, computer animation are well made) and the other being a ""message sending"" perspective (something like dramas, comedies). In the first one I would give it a 10/10 score and in the ""message sending"" perspective I give it a 3/10 score. So next time when you write a review try to think if this film was shot to amaze you or send you a deep message.",1
33,"Like it or not, the ""Summer Blockbuster"" is a permanent part of the Hollywood landscape, and so we must treat it as a reputable genre. And in that genre, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is as solid an installment as any. Easily the best of the three Transformers movies, Michael Bay has actually given the rest of the world a reason to like 3D movies, but not for the reason you think. Shooting in 3D made Bay slow down his traditional shaky cam quick cuts and left us with a much more visually beautiful film. And that's not even including the addition of Victoria's Secret model, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who proves just about anyone can fill the female lead role in these movies. Overall, this is a fun action movie, which is all it set out to be. Enjoy it for what it is.",1
34,"This is not a deep, philosophical film. This is a movie you watch to see giant robot fights and explosions, and cousin, they deliver. Unfortunately mixed up in a goofy romance plot that seems like a second, crappier movie was haphazardly spliced in, but the third act keeps it out of the way of the action. Worth a watch if you can enjoy brainless awesome.",1
35,"This movie is really good for the action, but it does try a bit hard for a plot to sink in. I know I'm going to go see a mindless action movie don't try to spruce it up. So in the case the slow parts are long drawn out and not needed. This would work better as a action movie alone and not try to delve into the thickening plot story line it tries to pursue throughout the movie.",1
36,"TRANSFORMERS 3 IS: action, feminine breathtaking curves, action, a full immersion in characters life story and their nature, action, a good storyboard, action, and especially a great cartoon remade in a great movie blockbuster! only that.. bay made a great job!  the only bad thing is the final scene.. too short!",1
37,Transformers 3 is my favorite movie in the The Transformers series. It was amazingly done. The plot was fun. The action was freakin sweet. It had alot of good comedic timing. I never do this in movies but i found myself geeking out rooting for them. People say that the girl can't act... they are wrong she as good as Megan Fox and just as hot. It was a great film filled with nonstop action.,1
38,"After the colossal disappointment of Revenge of the Fallen I wondered if the series could correct the wrongs it had made. With Transformers: Dark of the Moon new and out of the shop many are hoping it measures up to the first film, well it doesn't. It does, however, correct the wrongs of Revenge of the Fallen. One of the improvements this movie makes is that it tones down the humor, its still there and it gets pretty bad sometimes but it doesn't kill the movie. The humor is mostly present during the first half. The first half of the movie is where a lot of my problems lie. The first half of the movie is not paced very well and the action scenes are spaced out pretty far (I know I can't believe I just said that about a Bay film). I know that all of those scenes are there for story and character development but all of that isn't very good in this movie anyways. I would have rather seen some more battles before Chicago. Speaking of Chicago, the last half of the film is spectacular. Its amazing how well it all turned out, and you can really follow the action this time. The movie is also much darker than the other two, and it works the movie actually takes itself seriously this time. At the end of the day when compared to the other two transformers movies this one almost meets the greatness of the first but barley misses. I must also say that seeing it in 3D is really worth it! Dark of the Moon is a vast improvement over the last and is a fun ride from beginning to end.",1
39,"I went to the theatre expecting a sucky  movie with a hazy plot and more decepticon revivals and scenes with Shia crying ""OPTIMUS !!"" atleast 16 times  ... once again Michael Bay screwed my expectations ... the story was well formatted and the CGI rich action sequences were well done. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley ( the ex-lingerie model who i believed couldn't act )turned out to be an excellent replacement for Megan Fox .   The Arri Alexa and Sony F35 camera 3D shots, speak for itself and brings a whole new perspective into the movie ... Linkin Park's Iridescent proved to be a great hit and added to the emotional turmoil portrayed in the movie . The story was a bit of a drag with a couple of unwanted scenes and unnecessary action ...  Nevertheless the movie is a huge landmark in Michael Bay's career ... Hope u guys will enjoy it as i did ... :)",1
40,"If you thought Tansformers 2 couldnt get worse, thingk again. Transformers 3 has lowered the bar again of how cheesy, annoying, pointless, and stupid a movie can be.",0
41,"Much better than the second film (which I enjoyed for the action) with a solid story and a greater focus on the human story. The only let down is 'MeganFox2.0"" who simply is expressionless for 80% of the film.",1
44,"If you're really on the fence about this movie, all you need to do is ask yourself the following question:  Do I enjoy the concept of giant alien robots fighting each other with battle axes and particle cannons in glorious, high definition detail?  If you answered yes to this question, then you will like this movie.  There is no better example of giant alien robots fighting each other with particle cannons and battle axes than in this movie.  The rest of the cast is totally passable.  We're not here for Forest Gump or Sleepless in Seattle style acting people -- we're here for some hot chick to bounce around a bit in between the robotic violence.  I am a serious adult movie-goer and critic, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself because I got exactly what I expected and wanted.",1
45,It a good movie if u like non stop action. I don't think there would be a 4 but if they do they should have a really good hook. This movie i would say was epic because of the fighting but the plot wasnt super good but loved the effect.,1
46,"This is the best transformers movie to date. The 1st one was good this was great. If you love action,cars and robots then this is your movie! HBO should do a live action TV series on this. Two season a year would be great. Just following  The Autobots against The Decepticons  war on earth.",1
48,"The critic review is obviously from a 80-year old fart. If you want action, cars and beautiful women,  then this is the movie for you. **** off haters",1
49,"Transformers- Dark of the Moon gives its fans something to cheer about. The third instalment of the series makes up for everything Transformers 2 failed at, and goes a step beyond the Transformers (I) glory. The movie serves a huge helping of special effects, complete with a strong storyline. The car chases, the cars transforming or the giant robots in mortal combat- each scene is crafted with attention to detail. While the metal clashing against metal can be overwhelming in certain scenes, the fantastic VFX applied results in a visual delight.  Read more http://bit.ly/lIROJ1",1
50,"First of all, I'd like to say dont pay much attention to some of the negative critic reviews - its not your bog standard oscar winning film - if your after a deep meaningful realistic storyline then Transformers 3 is not your cup of tea. Its for kids and big kids like me! Personally, I think you'd be missing out if you DID NOT see this movie!I have to say I was blown away by the CGI/SFX, there was so much going on it was a CGI assault on the brain and I loved every bit of it.  It was an wicked use of 3D and Bay has excelled himself in this movie!   While I think the Oscars will overlook it (it might get some nominations) you have to respect the stuntmen/women, production team and CGI staff who were involved in the technical side of this movie.  The storyline was fairly good, how they worked it in to the moon landing was amazing, it was darker, but with some light comic relief, but there was a moment wehere I thought how the hell are they going to come from this?  To be honest its all about the action scenes and resonating tones from the Autobots.  For true fans of Transformers, I think they'll be disappointed with the lack of character development here.  The movie is long and alot of focus was on humans, with lots of cameo appearances which werent really needed.  I left wanting more (from the Autobots) but I think thats a good thing.  The fight scene in Chicago is one of the best fighting scenes I have ever seen, the scale and detail of the effects were immense (I wanna go back and see it in 2D just to compare!) I was watching this thinking this is way better than Avatar!  There were 3 major scenes which blew me away.On to the actors then...hate to be nasty but Rosie was meh, her part could have been acted much better, she has no acting experience so I guess we can let it slide, we all know her purpose in the film.  Reminds me of a young cameron diaz but without the natural charm.  Having said that Fox wasnt really any better.  They act like they're afraid to look weird or something.Shia is such a talented actor, he's believable, funny and charming on screen.   Look out for Andy Tudyk who plays Dutch, he was the best new addition to the cast BY FAR.Overall, I absolutely loved this film and I find it difficult to understand how anyone could hate it.  I was praying that it wouldnt end up like the new X Men film or Terminator 3 and thank god it didnt.  Well done Bay & co.",1
51,"Awesome movie Awesome movie Awesome movie Awesome movie Awesome movie.I loved this movie! believe me no one is more surprised than me :) I liked the first, hated the second but I loved the third! This movie is incredibly fun and funny!",1
52,"Definitely the best of the 3 Transformer movies in my opinion, with moments that created genuine laughs throughout the cinema. Additionally, like any final movie in a trilogy, I walked in knowing that there was going to be tragedy on the autobot side.This, along with plenty of close calls made things somewhat unpredictable - yes it was obvious who would win and yes we saw Megatron's attack on Sentinel Prime coming from a hundred miles away, but there were other twists I didn't see coming - Sentinel's betrayal for example came pretty much out of the blue for me, particularly due to the amount of hype that was placed on him being the prior great leader of the Autobots.What really egged me were the scientific details, like how Earth wasn't ripped apart by Cybertron's gravity (keeping in mind that at one point the lightbridge stops aiding its arrival, meaning that any anti-gravity fields or whatever should have been off long enough to end the story there and then). Or how the guns of the Autobots appeared majorly inferior to human weapons, despite having a larger calibre, etc. Or how a wire holding 80kg of flesh being thrown around, while rubbing against angular, super-hardened alien metal was able to be cut by a small steel knife. Or how Sam was able to walk away from a crash-landing of a large alien aircraft while being unrestrained and hanging onto the outer hull (which flips multiple times after striking the ground).Still, I guess it's just as believable as giant humanoid robots that transform into human vehicles of completely different material (metal alloys =/= leather seats) upon having first scanned them for a couple of seconds.Point taken, the movie isn't about realism obviously, but rather action and practical comedy, of which it delivers both. Some have mentioned that it had too much slow motion, but I would prefer that a hundred times over than having cameras and scene change every second while objects across the focal range whiz past, obscuring the action even more. One other gripe I had - is it necessary to have the intro of Linkin Park's Iridescent play 5 or so times throughout the first 2/3 of the movie?",1
53,"Not only is Transformers: Dark of the Moon the best of the series, but it's diffidently Michael Bay's best work and probably one of the best films so far this summer. Now unlike a lot of people, I like Michael Bay as a director. Is he great film-maker? No. But he has a lot of ambition, and that's what I respect about him. Michael Bay has made is fair share of good films and some bad films, but I wouldn't call them TERRIBLE films like some people do. Maybe you can call Pearl Harbor terrible, but that's about it. I happen to like The Rock, Bad Boys 2, Transformers, and The Island. Now the Transformers films are, in average, a good series. I thought the first film was lots of fun, the second was mildly entertaining, it was a bad film but had some great moments. Now, onto this film. The plot got really incomprehensible at times. Kind of like the second film, it goes all over the place. But this isn't as a mess as the second film. The plot is actually cooler than that of the second film. And you know what, as much as a mess this was, I really didn't care. I went into this movie expecting robots kicking each other's ass and a bunch of explosions going off everywhere, and that's exactly what I got. People need to understand that this film was made to blow the minds of the audience with dazzling 3D effects, jaw-dropping action sequences, and a great new girl. The film has a plot to back up all of the action, but the plot just isn't well executed. One final thing that irked me as well was the poor character development. There were many new characters that I wanted to get to know more and the film was long enough to get into some of the new characters. Shockwave, for example, basically had almost no screen time; he pops up in the beginning and does some fighting at the end, and he barely says a word. Hangover's Ken Jeong also has a small role, and he nails it. He is very funny. The film is written by Ehren Kruger, who co-wrote Revenge of the Fallen. The writing is fine, nuff' said. Many of the same auto-bots in the other films return, such as Optimus Prime, Bumblebee (who is a bad-ass in this film), Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, and Weelie, along with some new ones including Mirage, Que, Brains, Sentinal Prime (who plays a large role in this film), and the Wreckers. Also most of the performances are pretty good. Shia Labouf did a great job, as always, as Sam, the new girl Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is great, she can actually act unlike the previous girl. What was her name again? The film also has some strong emotional points with Sam and the robots, which was done really well. Steve Jablonsky's score is awesome! It's epic as hell and it's really well placed into this film. It somewhat sounds like a mixture between the Inception score and the previous Transformers score. Linkin Park's Iridescent is great, though I think they overplayed the opening of the song way to much in the final hour. After a first half of plot and dialog, we finally get kicked off into an action-packed second half with a phenomenal car chase featuring The Dreads (three dog-like deceptacons) and the final battle between NEST, the auto-bots, and the deceptacons. I don't want to spoil a lot of the final battle, so all I'm saying is that it's one of the most epic movie- going experiences you'll ever encounter. It's an all-out war. Nothing else. It's an almost an hour long with lots of fighting and shooting and things blowing up and buildings falling and stuff getting torn apart and everything you'll find in a great summer blockbuster. This IS the summer blockbuster of 2011. Overall, it doesn't have a well executed plot, but you really won't care when the action scenes come along. Believe me. Also, see it in 3D!!!!",1
54,"The best Transformers by far, it's like they save the best for last. Loved it. Definitely gonna see it again. When watching this movie you can't do nothing else but just come alive. Totally the best movie out so far for 2011. Micheal Bay is at his best with this one for sure",1
55,"Transformers 3 is, in my opinion a return ( or a first for some people) to the routs. It is well more centered on the actual fight between Autobots and Decepticons and this time, showing off a far more darker story. Some people will say that it is lacking actions, but I totally disagree since the amount may not be as big as the first sequel, but in this film, the quality and the drama of it makes up for it. In my opinion, Transformers: Dark of the moon is the best Transformers YET of the franchise.",1
56,"I'm going to be honest, Revenge of the Fallen had me lose all my faith in Micheal Bay as a director, the movie had plot holes everywhere and characters would jump out of no where and suddenly be essential to move the story. Dark of the Moon is Bay's redemption. DOTM had fantastic momentum, a story that made sense, and surprises here and there. You know haw the commercials for the Blu-ray say ""The greatest action movie ever"" well they're not lying. If you want your lust for violence to be satisfied then here is your movie. this movie is a testosterone driven masterpiece of giant sentient Robots like to have ridiculous wars on the streets of human cities.",1
57,"Transformers, a film that is loud, boring, and pointless, showers us in debris, has extended scenes that are just basically robots playing karate, gives us inane dialogue between battles sequences, shows us some hot girls so we know girls still exist- and then, after all this, it expects us to be entertained. Did I mention its two and a half hours long? Jesus Christ save us now!!",0
58,"First off, I must say that this movie was not as good or better than the first (4.5/5) was far superior to the notoriously bad sequel (and Worst Picture winner) known to many as ""Revenge of the Fallen"", or ""TF2"" (2/5).Â Now, lets decrypt this film so that we may know the good and the bad;Â BADThe script by Ehren Kruger was poor. The dialogue and cheesy and unnecessary one-liners (Optimus while flying: I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU! from 1000 meters away) are abundant here, but this is a ""Transformers"" film, but it still seemed to have slight resemblances to RotF, which it was said it would try to stay away from. Its not bad, but it sort of degrades the quality a tad bit, preventing it from being on-par with the first. Rosie Huntington-Whitley's acting in the film was poor as well, but that was expected, especially since she was probably just picked straight out of a Victoria's Secret magazine, especially since she models for them and was chosen just to look pretty and just have a big sign on her forehead saying, ""HEY GUYS, I'M REPLACING MEGAN FOX!"". She was the only really ""bad"" actor I witnessed throughout the film. Comment if you wish to try to educate me about everything else.Â GOODWell, the humor of the first is back (no fart/ball/weed/kid jokes, mainly the type of humor from the first), and it was actually enjoyable instead of stupid like the second (and Sam's parents are slightly restrained also, participating only in the first half). The score is excellent, reminding me a little of the ""Inception"" score a bit, and Michael Bay did an awesome job directing the action sequences (my favorite part was when the paratroopers jumped out of the planes and flew through the city to find Decepticons to fight), but not very well with the plot scenes (although it was slightly more coherent than TF2).Â Also, the last hour of the movie, which starts with the climax of the brutal destruction of Chicago and DC (Megatron destroys the Lincoln Memorial and sits upon his throne, which I found somewhat ironic), and ends when the long battle is over, especially in 3D, makes up for the gaping flaws.Â FINAL VERDICTCompared the the first, its only average, but compared to the second, its like the first. It was a bit cliche at the beginning and the end, but the last hour makes up for some of it. I would give it a 3/5 (a B-), but I'll amp it up to a 3.5 just because it met my expectations.Â It was some good fun, and the 3D is quite good. See it while the gas prices are down.Â GRADE: B (3 and a half stars out of 5, 7 out of 10)",1
59,"As a Transformers fan I am quite pleased by this movie. No doubt making this movie after the writers' strike, instead of during it (like Transformers 2), has had a big impact on its quality. There is, of course, a general lack of character depth when it comes to the robots that has been present throughout all three films. Other media, such as the cartoons and the comics, have provided much more in this area and it is quite a letdown that we don't get to see more characters behind these robots. My eyes were overjoyed with a camera that was less shaky than the last movie. I felt as though I could actually tell what was going on. Actions scenes were more abundant than I normally care for, but their pacing and execution were impeccable. Having been filmed in 3D (in a way similar to Avatar) the 3D effects were well placed and were rarely used in any gimmicky fashion. The comedy was much more sparse this movie and much of what was there seemed far less forced or contrived than in Transformers 2. It just seemed to make sense why one thing or another was funny. I sometimes felt like the movie was trying to forcibly tell me what was funny, but this didn't happen very often. The plot was filled with twist after twist that kept the movie rolling right along and kept the action in perspective. A few aspects of the Transformers movie storyline have been retconned (rewritten after the fact) to fit the plot of this new movie. Few will notice these changes, but rest assured, they make the story work a lot better. I rarely go see a movie twice, in theaters, and this movie may end up being one of those rare occasions.",1
60,"Never enjoyed a movie in a theatre (IMAX 3D) more than I did tonight. DSOTM - I Loved the story, the action, the comedy even sitting in row 2 in full 600 seat venue. I didn't see the plot twists coming, and I can't say enough about how much I was ""in"" to this film.",1
61,"Note: This is taken from my Rotten Tomatoes review just like my Sanctum one. So here it is: Wow. All I can say is wow. This movie is just amazing! Awesome explosions and action scenes! This movie is just all you expect from Michael Bay and more! I have to say that this is the best Transformers movie! It surpasses the first by just a little but beats the disappointing second instalment by a long way! This is Michael Bay's best film since The Rock! Why? Well with this Transformers movie this one actually gets it right with the human characters. The Transformers movies have always been about the robots and have totally ignored the humans but this time Michael seems to have given the humans some emotion. Which is a good thing for it makes the script pretty decent in my opinion. And this also makes you feel something when a character dies in the film. This bit contains spoilers so if you don't want the movie to get spoiled for you then don't read the next sentence. For those who don't mind if the movie gets spoiled are you still here? Good. The following Transformers die in this movie. Ironhide, Que/Wheeljack, Sentinel Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Shockwave, Soundwave, Laserbreak/Laserbeak and Barricade. Yeah Barricade. That Transformer that turned into a police car and the one that was in the first movie but disappeared half way through and never came back in the second one. Yeah that one. He's in this movie. And he finally officially dies. No more conspiracy theories I guess! So to get to the bottom of it a few of the Autobots die but all of the Deceptecons die. Right guys who didn't read the huge spoiler you can come back now. Right so here's all the good points about the movie. It has great special effects and fighting sequences and has proper human characters this time round so both robots and humans can share emotions. Now here's the bad stuff. The jokes can be a bit boring and annoying sometimes so the humour still isn't all that great but it is way better than the second. So as a result this movie gets a 9/10 for having amazing and great action sequences but has a bit of boring humour. So that's my review for Transformers: Dark of the Moon and I hope you liked it!",1
62,"In a movie where you should only be expecting great visuals and nice babes, you shouldn't leave dissatisfied. Now achieving great visuals and nice babes isn't bad, but it also isn't anything above mediocre. Don't watch with the intentions of having to think or getting into a complex storyline, because you will then write a negative review",1
64,"Transformers 3 is a movie crafted for people who prefer the sensation of living in the moment, hot babes getting boy friends, nerdy dudes becoming cool and getting hot girlfriends, hypo excentric people complaining in a funny way, hypo excentric screaming, cool cars, pro awesome heroic American military, lots of robots that shoot stuff and look cool, fighting, violence with not repercussions, good guys winning not matter the odds, bad ass action that doesnt slow down for 2 and half hours to a mega super action finale. On the contrast if you prefer thinking about the big picture, looking for meaning, metaphors, watching movies that leave a lasting impression and giving you something to think about later, then Transformers is not going to provide you very much. It is made exactly to do what it does and appeal its crowd and thats it.",1
65,"This movie was the best 3D since Avatar. Maybe better, time will tell. Megan Fox missing helps. Rose is so much hotter and with the English accent, helps cover the bad acting, cause lets face it, if Paul Walker was British he'd be a descent actor.",1
66,"This was a waste of my time and money. Special effects or not, a movie should at least have a plot. I gave it the one point for the special effects, but after a while it just becomes overkill.",0
67,"I would first like to start of this review by saying that the critics are stupid, dont listen to them. They must seriously be paid to rip on Michael Bay or an actual good movie. This movie was absolutely amazing and i recall one of the critics even said 'this is a mindlessnaction film about robots fighting each other and knocking each others heads off' um are you serious, yu do know what the title of the movie was before you watched the movie right, because if you didnt, it was TRANSFORMERS! Thats what Tranaformers is all about, the ongoing battle between the autobots and the decepticons, or as you say it, robots knocking each others heads off. Now onto the movie. I am a diehard Transformers fan, except i only wish i grew up with it, im only 18 years old but i own all of the seasons of the original g1 series, and have seen all of the episodes, and i own ALOT of the transformers figures too, i love transformers and i loved this movie. It had everything in it. Their was mindblowing action, stunning cgi/visuals, and im sure the moronic critics will disagree when i say their was an excellent story going back to original launch of apollo 11, it even included original footage of the landing, how cool is that. Their were so many detailed plots intertwined into this action extravaganza. From sams relationship, to his neverending struggle to find a job, to the space race of the 60's, to decepticons destroying the human race! Their was just so much to this film it was unbelievable. I was in love with this film from the exciting beginning all the way, 2 and a half amazing hours later to the pulse-pounding ending. Their was even some good acting in this movie, not oscar worthy but good enough to get the job done. I was even proud of the job newcoming actress and beautiful victorias secret model Rosie Huntington Whiteley did in this film. At first i thought it would be annoying with nor seeing Megan Fox in the film anymore but that was gotten over real fast, plus, we can all admit that neither her nor Rosie were in the film to make an oscar worthy acting performance, they were there for their incredibly good looks and nothing else. The second film was still good in my opion even though it didnt have a script and the screenplay was written in a rushed 3 months during the writers strike, but yes it wasnt the best film ever created but this new and hopefully not final addition to the franchise is by a million miles better than the first and second film combined in all aspects pf the word. Michael Bay did an absolutely amazing job with this film. Their was the action, and ALOT of it, ther was the eye candy aka Rosie, their were the stunning visual effects which are definitely oscar worthy, Michael Bay did himself justice by using James Camerons technology for this movie and he did a great job with it. Their was alot of comedy in this film, especially from Sams little autobot companion Brains, but the biggest part of this film was the emotion. Their was an utterly HUGE amount of emotion in this film, i felt excited, i felt happy, i felt energized and pumped, i felt shocked and i felt sadness, from multiple parts in the film which i wont go into because i dont want to give anything away but this new edition the Transformers franchise was a massive success. Michael Bay did damn good. Neverr have i been so excited for a film and come out so pleased from it. I hope anyone who reads this will listen to what i say and nothing of what tbe critics say. This was entertainment at its best. I have already seen this film twice now, the promo on monday and the midnight premiere 4 hours ago. I enoued it so much i plan on seeing it as many more times as i can. This was the definition of an epic summer blockbuster, Transformers style. Epic characters+Epic battles=Epic movie. Their is no doubt in my mind that Transformers: Dark of the Moon deserves 10/10 stars, of i could give it more i would in a heartbeat, definitely go see this movie because it is worth every penny of the ticket price. Not only saying this because im a diehard Transformers fan but because i know how to enjoy a good movie unlike the uptight and highly unnecessarily negative critics. My favorite film of all time, thank you Michael Bay for a successful and very entertaining trilogy.",1
68,"this film to me pretty much sumerises micheal bay's thinking on making movies . he gets bashed heavily on the second one for a crappy plot , crappy charicter develpment , and other things . so How does Bay respond to all this? by making a better story and likeable charicters? HELL NO! this is micheal bay we are talkin about . his method is well if it must be that the special effect and action sceanes arnt cool enough. so i must improve that. so what we are left with is pretty much the same lame plot from TF2 decepticons find a wepon to destroy earth and god knows why that stuttering prick shilo boof has to save us all . so most of the movie is focused on Sam whining and complaining how he wants to live a normal life and that no one appriates all that he's done for us blah blah freekin blah. yeah its not like the movie goers dont wana know more about the transformers themselves out side of them just being dragged out to beat the living hell out of each other... noooo we need more shilo . megan fox is now gone and this new girl is brought in cant remember her name and with her god awful acting its unlikely we will see her in much more movies. shes some model who couldnt act well enough to get in a sci fi B movie but apperntly Bay thought she was hot even though her face looks like some one took a metal rake over it for a few days . not to sound shallow or any thing i could have cared less how she looked if her acting was passable like megan foxes was ... maybe thats giving fox to much praise but she wasnt horrable like this girl is thats for sure. in the end if you wana see a mindless action flick with no redeeming qaulitys but its action . you will probubly like this film . if not stay far far far away. i unfortunitly got dragged to this mess cause my 13 year old nephew wanted to see it and begged me .",0
69,"This is one of those movies that assumes the audience are either 13 years old or just plain dumb.  The comedy seemed like it was trying to hard, and came across as bad jokes.  They added so many new characters, and yet not one were you able to connect with.  The dialog was so bad, and so uninteresting that it made you feel mad at the crappy writers.  75% of the action scenes were cool to watch.",0
70,Have you ever wanted to see a movie so bad it makes you want to punch yourself in the face over and over again? Well you're in luck because Transformers 3 is out now in cinemas near you!,0
71,"I wanted to love this movie. I hyped this film up to the people I went to see it with. I told them I had read the reviews and this one was different and more action packed. Wrong. The action is muddled and chaotic. The transformers all look virtually identical at the speed the action is happening, and several times I could sense a shot that was supposed to be jaw dropping was utterly lost on me and my friends- who looked at each and mouthed ""what?"".  Some movies have comedic relief characters and/or lines of dialogue. This film is comprised entirely of those lines and characters. This is the kind of film where the more you talk about it- the more you realize how angry you are at it",0
72,"Gonna keep this short. Gets a 3 for a great action package (FX,CGI,Sound) Everything else was god awful. I enjoyed the first the most, the second had better transformer battles, this had some great action moments tied around a cluster F of fade to blacks and nothing but trash.",0
74,"best visuals in any film ever, its a **** movie about giant robots that transform what more do u want i think the only person who cares less about reviews is Michael bay look at what hes made over the years, regardless of reviews he **** drag's in millions by the boat load. this film has massive plot hole but it looks **** brilliant and isnt trying to be anything different and thats why its so **** good.",1
75,"A dull plot, yes but we already knew that coming in. Transformers 3 is visual eye candy that will allow all that see it to enjoy it if they want to. The first one straight up action film that I have ever truly enjoyed. Far better then Transformers 2. Still if you are looking for a story line you are going to the film for all the wrong reasons.",1
77,"This film was fantastic. It is the best action packed epic of this year, and in 3D...wow! Probably the best 3D film I've seen. I hated the second film so I was very much surprised at how great this film was. I actually really enjoyed the story of this one too.",1
78,"Sure, the humor in this film was unnecessary and unfunny but everything else entertained me to the max! It's not as good as the first transformers but it wasn't as bad as the second one either. And I'm sure everyone can agree on that. There was actually a story I could follow along with, and the special effects were just extraordinary! But like I said, Micheal Bay needs to learn his lesson. Bad humor! That was what ruined the movie, but there is no sign of those annoying twins and I enjoyed it a lot!",1
79,"If you're a Transformers Fan, this would be a very fun movie with big special effects. Though, there are some inconsistencies with the characters on the previous films and more Autobot screen time would be good, but overall a better movie than the second.",1

84,"Transformers 2 was a horrible sequel to a pretty good movie, but luckily, Dark of the Moon is a major improvement, and the best of the 3 Transformers movies.  The special effects are once again top notch and the 3D is fantastic, the first movie since Avatar that actually made good use of 3D.  The action scenes remain some of the best in the business, with the battle for Chicago worth the price of admission alone.  The problem with this movie, like its predecessors, is the plot.  While the plot in Dark of the Moon is much, much better than ROTF, it still is not good enough for Transformers to be considered ""great"" movies.  overall, Transformers gives you exactly what you would expect: big robots knocking the crap out of each other, and that isn't a bad thing at all.  This movie is the perfect summer action flick, but not a movie you need to see multiple times",1
85,"3D and IMAX versions are not worth the extra money. Some movies you have to watch it in 3D and only in 3D like ""Avatar"" but unfortunately ""Transformers: Dark Of the Moon"" does not go in this category. It just didn't have that extra WOW factor. 3D felt more like an after thought. The Plot: The lead human character, ""Sam Witwicky"" seemed more like a desperate 40 year old virgin then a hero who saved the world TWICE. He was more concerned with saving a girl which is just met then actually saving the world. Poor guy... it seemed like he was still recovering from his break up with Megan Fox Oops meant to say Mikaela Banes. By the way the new girl has nothing on Megan Fox. Too bad Katy Perry isn't much into acting (yet), she would had made a wonderful replacement for Megan Fox. The movie ran for 2 hours and 37 minutes but it felt like it ran for 5 hours. This movie could not end fast enough for me. This movie was not all bad. The action was what you expected of a Transformer's movie. I like how they incorporated the lunar landings into the mix and the gamer in me liked the 3rd person shooter bit they had towards the end of the movie. We NEED fresh eyes and fresh minds for the 4th installment (if there is one)",0
86,"I'm not going to say how bad this movie is, about logic and physics - defying plot, about horrible acting, about this movie being just a random sequence of mostly disconnected clips. Many people said that already. It redefines word shallow, but at least it looks good. I'm concerned with other problem that many people prefer to ignore. ""Robot"" violence. This movie depicts very anthropomorphics characters ripping each other to pieces in a very sadistic way. Transformers are very humanlike, they are at least as intelligent, like we, they talk, feel emotions, they even bleed like humans. And they seem to enjoy ripping each other's limbs, crushing heads and internal organs. And many people are taking children to watch this movie. How evil can you be, Michael Bay?",0
87,"Here's what I have to say about this movie...Don't watch it.  If you are a fan in anyway of the Transformers movies, let the Revenge of the Fallen be the ""Ending"" for you.  If you thought that one was bad...please...you haven't seen anything. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Two and a half hours of mind-numbing special effects, Optimus Prime giving motivational speeches, Shia LeBouf screaming out robots names, and wondering what happened to Meghan Fox.  Please... don't watch this movie.  2/10",0

It's poorly filmed for the most part, and there's not nearly enough of it. For the most part, the robots stand around and do nothing until the final 30 minutes of this 2 1/2 hour long film.I laughed at the film, but only because it was so terrible. Shia LaBeufs' character just comes off as a complete ass in this one instead of a quirky outcast. What a wasted trilogy. Several hundred million dollars of some of the worst film making in years.",0

You have the Nemesis and the Ark as mere mentions in this hideous failure i hope is the last in a trilogy that went from good to okay to crap. Although 2 wasn't so bad compared to this. Notice also recycled footage from other Michael Bay movies (The Island anyone?) and all the cars are craptacular GM bailoutmobiles.

96,"This movie succeeds in making even good actors look like total morons. I only watched it because I happened to be in DC last fall when they shot the movie. It was quite impressive to see thousands of people lined up along Pennsylvania Avenue, which was shut down almost entirely, and to see the Lincoln Memorial lit up like a supernova, in the middle of the night. I had a feeling back then that MAKING the movie would be far more exciting than actually watching it. But I had no idea that it would turn out THAT bad. I mean, it is just really embarrassing for a major studio to dish out tens of millions of dollars, and then come up with utter garbage. Even the CGI is stunningly bad. There is no story. One of the decepticons looks like, yes, it is quite unbelievable, the PREDATOR !!! Yes, from the movie franchise. Shia LeBoeuf's ADD/ADHD really, and I mean really, goes on your nerves. There is no clear explanation on why his girlfriend is his girlfriend, because there is not the least bit of chemistry between the two of them. She is also nauseatingly ugly, couldn't they have screwed another head onto her neck ? In all, definitely a good candidate for worst movie of the year.",0
97,"First of all all the critics are stupid because neither they gave the second film nor to the third one the right judgement.The film is very much cool as the title is ""dark of the moon"". The action is mind blowing with jaw dropping special effects. 3D scenes which are used is hardy seen in some great action films. This one is far more better than Avatar. Its the best action/sci-fi film of the decade.I will also buy the blu - ray of the film. I advice everybody that go and watch the most perfect action film with heavy loaded action of the famous Transformers from the planet cybertron.""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" Rocks........",1

The first transformers was, in my opinion, an epic film and the sequel ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was, also in my opinion, almost as good as the first, but at least it was still entertaining. Now, it turns out that Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Michael Bay's final installment of the series (as we already know it) and I think it's actually the right the same plot that we already know about.While Sam now works for the Washington DC with his new girlfriend, he and the Autobots learn that a Cybertronian spacecraft is hidden on the Moon and with that in hand, the Decepticons plan to use its secrets and power to bring Cybertron to Earth. With emotional conflicts and fateful sacrifices being made, the Autobots and the humans have another (and presumably) final battle against the Decepticons as you've never seen it before.Now that we already know what the plot was about, I'll go to my opinion. The only problem that I had with this movie was the pacing. In the first few minutes of the film, it seems well fast-paced, but near the end of the film, it seems to be very slow. That's it for the bad.Everything else turned out great. The action and the CGI effects were impressive once again (seriously, you have no idea when am I going to stop saying that), the acting was entertaining and the science keeps you interested in what's going as most sci-fi action films do. The music score by Steve Jablonsky was amazing and very emotional and the comedy was very hilarious.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is almost as good as the first, but just like the previous installment, it was still very entertaining.Little known fact: Whether or not a fourth Transformers film would be made, Michael Bay states that he won't be directing it, so it turns out that Steven Spielberg would be directing it. I mean, hey. At least he was the producer of the first two films, so I guess that would be good.Long story short, it is amazing and it's worth seeing and if the critics hate it, they'll have to deal with Michael Bay himself.8/10",1
102,"You know what. I am not gonna take my advantage for loving this movie that it's a total waste of the movie that how horrible it is same as the Revenge of the Fallen. For me, I dislike this movie for so long that it's nothing work, just like the rest of the terrible Michael Bay films. It throws everywhere with horrible people, horrible story, horrible effects, and horrible jokes that it gives to the audiences to enjoy this crap movie and it's very sad for me that this director wanted to get a decent action robotic movie. Not even one good moment, not even one! This is the kind of movie that your best friend wanted hang out with you at the Applebees and then you spend quality time with your best friend with lots of drinks and then your friend ask you to see this Transformers 3 with good money and then you started to get drunk while watching and then you don't even remember what happen went you spend time with your friend for watching Transformers 3. THAT""S THE KIND OF THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE THAT I WOULD RATHER TO SAY TO EVERYONE!!! Once again, the robots are really amazing with CG effects around everywhere, but everything else it so horrid, so disaster, and so forgettable. The story is a complete mess, the characters are so annoying (that I hate when Bay put all these fillers with stereotypes that drives me nuts), the action scenes are so long and boring as the same as the second one, the jokes are so bad, and the setting of this movie is so dark, violent, inappropriate, and completely wasting much time with adding stupid ideas to make. But I hate this movie when it's for kids and teenagers to make it too dark, too edgy, too goofy to make it so dark and it fails. And tell me that it's just a popcorn flick that people and fans are watching this movie and talk stupidity to every critic and hate goers that it's good and don't give a f@#k for anything to be more positive. Please, you can't judge every movie that gives pleasure of all these gimmick toys that kids will enjoy everything that they watch these dumb three movies. Beyond everything, it's way way way too far that it takes too serious and I had enough watching these terrible movies has to offer. I hate this film that the director won't give nothing credit that if he will promise to make it decent and I can see that this director is so mean that he'll team up with Uwe Boll or any directors out there that every product that doesn't work for me. I'm sorry for everyone and for those people didn't enjoy this movie of dislike it, it's horrible. I HATE IT!!! HATE IT! HATE IT! HATE IT! HATE IT! and 1,000 HATES IT TO THIS MOVIE ON THEIR FACES!!! HATE IT!!!",0
103,I want my time back.  Give me my time back Michael Bay.  This movie is brainless idiocy that does nothing more than rape cinema and storytelling.  Michael Bay even uses previous footage from his old films in this.  This entire movie is nothing more then garbage that should have been left on the editing room floor.,0
104,"Much better movie than TF2. Not quite as good as TF1 but I doubt anything could ever match that. Its a summer popcorn movie & should be taken as such.  Michael Bay has adjusted his directing style a little & slowed it down to allow for the 3D so the pace is a little slower now & the action easier to make out as the camera steps back a bit to let you see the action from a distance. All the acting is fine really nothing to complain about its passable as the actors are treating it for what it is non serious summer sci-fi entertainment. Humour is juvenile but quite funny in places. Story is more defined than TF2. Action & CGI is all top notch as you would expect. Overall if you want a fun to watch summer popcorn blockbuster this is the movie for you if you liked TF1 then you will like TF3. If you do not like Michael Bay movies then nothing here will change your mind but I think most audiences know beforehand what to expect & here Bay delivers in his final Transformers movie (it wraps the story up so does not demand another installment anyway....).",1
106,"I loved this movie! believe me no one is more surprised than me :) I liked the first, hated the second but I loved the third!This movie is incredibly fun and funny! Shia is great and the new female lead is HOT x 3!",1
108,"A certain aspect of Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon seems to appear time and time again in the Transformers saga... terrible film-making. With one of the worst plots existent, a flat and unimaginative script which leeches all feeling and emotion from the characters and an incredibly repetitive sequence of events the third edition to the Transformers saga is much like the second, crap. Yes there a number of senseless idiots existent in this world who would happily compare the depth of this film to perhaps ""Shakespeare in Love"", so my advice is to ignore them, let the pleas of your misguided and misinformed children slip your mind and just watch something else.",0
109,"Wholly inadequate in story and direction, this move is only for those easily entertained by shiny baubles. The best that can be said about it is that it's not as terrible as the second one.",0
110,"The action scenes were entertaining and the CGI was spectacular. The plot was pretty bad. What I found to be the worst part of the movie was the Decepticon character development. In the cartoon there was always that tension between Megatron and Starscream. The first two movies sort of had the tension but IMHO they should have started with it from the first film. It sounds silly for robot character development but it would have made more sense than all the human rambling. Just a different perspective I guess lolThe first half of the movie at least tried to make some sense, the second half was all over the place.",0
111,I Did like TF 3 better than ROTF PT 2. There's so much stuff going on it's hard to get it all seeing it just once.The lame ass plot does'nt matter because it's based off of toys & the cartoon. I enjoyed mostly the S.E. & The 3D.SEE IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
113,"Things blow up, an it i noisy. The plot has all the depth of a wading pool.  If you really must see this ""film"", take ear plugs and dramamine.  Eye candy with no plot or substance.",0
116,"I greatly enjoyed this film, particularly the spectacular IMAX 3D! This is a beautifully filmed picture, with absolutely stunning special effects. The script is much more solid than ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and we are treated with some highly impressive cameos, in particular with one of America's finest astronauts. While this one was great fun, the first of the franchise still remains the strongest. However, this is definitely worth a look......see it in IMAX!",1
117,Surprisingly this movie starts off well enough with an actually story. I know it's hard to believe that a Michael Bay movie starts off with a story. Well all that seemed to be going well all went down the drain fair;y quickly . The story suddenly stops and the mindless action begins. I sat there asking myself am I the only one who enjoys good movies and doesn't just go watch a movie to see things blow up. The lack of story in this movie causes your mind to wander and focus on the text messages in your pocket instead of the mindless 1 hour long action scene.,0
118,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS A SPOILER REVIEW. DO NOT TAKE A PEEK AT THIS REVIEW IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE BLOWN FOR YOU. Well whatever, this review needs to start. Note that i saw the movie in 2D, but I loved TF3! I am not a transformers fanatic, yet i thought the movie was a great comeback from the poor Revenge of the Fallen failure. This movie had many pros and only two cons. Some of the pros include: The CGI and special effects, getting rid of the black stereotype twins, (having) emotion, Shia LeBouf being an OK actor, and it is a movie for anyone (except a critic). When Optimus Prime was killing Shockwave, everyone in the theater was clapping and cheering, and none of them were major Transformers fans.Now for the cons: The first con was, again, a poor plot, like the other movies. Now the other major problem was that there will not be another movie due to all of the Decepticons and a few Autobots getting killed off. Here's a list of all of the transformers deaths in the movie:Ironhide (Killed by Sentinel Prime)Megatron (Killed by Optimus Prime)Starscream (Killed by Sam)Shockwave (Killed off by Optimus, damaged by humans)Soundwave (Killed by Bumblebee)Sentinel Prime (Damaged by Megatron, killed off by Optimus PrimeWheeljack (Killed by Barricade)Barricade (Damaged by Bumblebee, killed by humans)Lazerbeak (Killed by Sam)Longhaul (Killed by Optimus Prime)A s***load of protoforms (Killed by Autobots. Mostly killed by Wheelie and Brains)Wheelie and Brains (Commited suicide to save world by crashing alien ship)Hachet (Killed by Mirage)Crankcase (Killed by Ironhide)and Crowbar (Killed by i think Optimus Prime)I still found it crazy to let Sentinel Prime betray the Autobots in the beginning of the movie.Overall, great movie.",1
119,"Almost three hours of an overly complicated plot mixed in with a ton of cool visual effects, explosions and total destruction.  A definite mixed bag and not nearly as good as the first.",0
122,"I'm only reviewing one of these movies scince they are so similar, but anyway, this is a great dude flick however, girls won't like it. the girl character is sexy the action is cool and the whole film altogether is awesome, watch this or the other 2, u will not regret it!!!!!!",1
123,"Your are not going to get anything out of this movie. Besides some cool action scenes, this movie offers nothing but a generic plo, annoying characters, and forced comedy. At least it's not as offensive as the second movie.",0
125,"I really can't understand why we all need to feed this evil greedy amoeba.  One day, I'm gonna grow balls and move to Boca Raton.  Then you'll see.  Yeah! Yah! Yeah!Just say no.  It's easy.;3",0
126,"If you loved the first two you will not like this one. This is Michael Bay worst movie to date. He didn't want to do it, he was forced by Paramount to film it immediately instead of postponing it to 2012 as he told the press, then Paramount forced him to use useless 3D gimmick to raise ticket price... and all of that shows. Previous Michael Bay movies were all excellent although BadBoys2 had some issues and was worse than the first one, but still all his movies were done by a true perfectionist, strong quality control on everything, good plot, good main characters romance and there came the trouble for Transformers3.. he decided to fire his leading actress Megan Fox for whatever personal issues that should never ever affect any professional production like this and then he did even worse casting his worst leading girl to date, the Victoria's Secret topmodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley which surely has an hot body but a really ugly anonymous face, and more he focuses on her on the movie and more she ruined every single scene, she is just awful trying to act. Also having her play Sam Witwicky's new girlfriend is the dumbest idea ever seen in Hollywood to kill a trilogy, really. And it's like Michael Bay wanted to commit business suicide with this move, otherwise he lost his mind. All his movies since The Rock featured the romance factor and a couple in love viewers could relate to, he spent so much time focusing on Sam and Mikaela characters on the first two Transformers movies that giving Sam a new girlfriend was really just plain stupid.. maybe he thought Sam Witwicky became Will Smith's Mike Lowery character on Bad Boys all of a sudden... well, that didn't happen, couldn't happen and it was just plain dumb thinking anything like that. He ruined Sam Witwicky character. The Carly girlfriend played by Rosie really looks like a prostitute Sam decided to pay for playing his girlfriend or something, and it's not funny to watch. All of this alone was enough to kill heart and soul that the first two movies had along with the hot sexy factor that topmodel Rosie can't give despite porn-style closeups..whenever you see her face unless you liked women with ugly faces you couldn't get excited at all, and whenever she spoke she managed ruining entire scenes. Ok, then what is left? Amazing action scenes and CGI you might tell... yes and no.. I mean the actions are there, CGI is there but: 1) Action scenes look pretty fake most of the time you can spot serious editing issues like they didn't care to fix things up properly; 2) The CGI by ILM it's top-notch on some scenes but really really bad that it looks painted/cartoonish like Hulk(2003) or Speed Racer, two of the worst CGI works by ILM to date. What happened there? Well, obviously the useless 3D gimmick added too much work for ILM to deliver and many scenes look badly rendered, in some you see CGI transformers models looking like they were miniatures moving in stop-motion ancient techniques.. an horrible mistake you wouldn't expect after top-notch outstanding CGI on Transformers2 by ILM. And yes the 3D... is it worth it? Really? Never. Stereoscopic 3D is fake 3D, it hurts your eyes, it's not worth it. And just like Avatar the 3D here is not really used at all anyway. It's all marketing hype. Don't waste you money on the 3D gimmick, they want you to watch it in 3D to rip you off, more money to them and less quality to you along with eye-strain added as a bonus... If this movie didn't have 3D but was just full IMAX 2D and Michael Bay didn't fire Megan Fox it could have worked but as it is it's a huge disappointment for whoever loved the first two regardless the hatred those movies got. There complaints were all wrong, here too many complaints are right unfortunately.",0
128,"While the kennedy era beginning piques ones interest, however the movie goes downhill pandering to gender stereotypes and awkwardness. The transformers themselves unnecessarily seem to slobber and bleed unlike they did in previous film and no longer seem very concerned in being 'transformers' and more like messy humanoid robots. For those of us that grew up playing with the original generation 1 transformers and , this film may come across as wholly unnecessary, disrespectful to its roots, taking more interest in cashing in on the transformers IP and nostalgia than paying homage.",0
130,"I liked the Transformers cartoon as a child and I even enjoyed the first two films for what they were: action movies with giant fighting robots. That being said, I found TF3 overly long and boring. It spends too much time following the humans running around and being tossed around. There are few good ""giant fighting robots"" scenes. It was rather disappointing.",0
133,"Great movie, though ,there's almost not to many stuff to see in summer, ( Captain America, Green Lantern  ) looks great. The third installment of transformers is phenomenal, it's funny , intense action, well, you know that already , the only thing that bugs me out it's that sometimes it can be boring.",1
135,"Excellent Special effects, non sens history, wort female character ever (Carly), too long. Bay killed my favorite comic... Low use of 3D effects (only sand, glasses, fire, nothing else AVATAR is 1000% better). I loss my money and time in this movie.",0
136,"it may not please the critics with its bad script and mediocre acting ,it is a perfect entertainer for anyone who likes the franchise or not.A must see with is thrilling action and awesome graphics",1
137,"First fault in direction of the movie after the movie starts  .... u start to wonder hw come a nerd, jobless fuk, non-handsome....in short the biggest loser ( Sam whitwicky) on the planet  land two hotties.....Megan fox and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley...WTF The title of the movie is repeated in the movie for lyk 136 tymsSAM: blah blah....Dark of the moon?Optimus Prime: Dark of the moon is.........blah blahEveryone: Dark of the moon FTW The third trailer of the movie is not a collection of scenes from the movie...but just the last two minutes of the movie....and believe me the trailer is the best part of the movie. (And the frst trailer is the frst 2 minutes of the movie)( the second trailer is the collection of scenes from both these trialers) Rosie Huntington-Whiteley proves again that hot gals doesnt have/need any talent....she cant act, she cant run, she cant cry, she cant speak...but hu cares she got an amazing rack. Then Transfomers get less screen tym than the other human characters...even during supposedly intense battle sequences they show humans flyin/running around rather than two insanely huge robots butt-kicking OPTIMUS PRIME IS A BIG **** When battle is intense there is no sight of optimus prime ...but wen finally autobots are winning (because of some human weilding a handgun) then he suddenly comes around and kills of the retreating decepticons. BUMBLEBEE IS A GOOD CATCHER....he seems to be appearing in the movies only wen the heros are falling towards their death or they need to run away from some super awesome decepticon with ultra cool weapons.(and then he gets caught) 200 super cool robots against 7 average robots and handful of humans and 1 supermodel...hu do u think will win? And finally again the biggest disappointment in the movie is definetly  Shia LaBeouf,...I dont even noe y is he der in the frst place ......he cant act, he cant run and he doesnt have an amzaing rack (thoguh he can shriek like a gal)  ..end of  acting career for him...   luckily this is the last transformers movie.....hopefully it will be the last Michael Bay movie...If u want to waste 200 million dollars ...learn it frm this guy",0
138,"The movie was a **** all its own. Most of the camera time and attention you would think would be given to the robots the whole franchise was named after, not so in this movie. Far too much time was spent on the tedious and boring human characters. Compared to the last two movies the highly entertaining bot-on-bot combat was frustratingly scarce.",0
142,"Oh say can you see by Optimus Prime... The lines from this movie that best describe itself include ""this is a clusterf-"", ""what's going on here!?"", and ""Spock goes crazy in this one."" That last line is foreshadowing of Leonard Nimoy's character's later betrayal and might have been amusing if I hadn't already been so bored by the redundant exposition of the human characters' lives, which drag on forever and still develop practically nothing. The previous movies suffered from the same fault: when the characters have no personality or depth, nobody cares about them and nobody cares during the time they are on the screen. Yet this movie fills so much time with these dull and overacted caricatures. Also, it is possible to make entertaining summer blockbusters without relying on the audience laughing at the movie's self-aware preposterousness. This movie motivated me to create a Metacritic account just so I could rate it down. I give it a 2 because it is better than the second movie (this one does have some funny moments - but oh so few exciting ones), which is easy because at no point does this one literally dangle giant balls over your face. It may seem harsh to be so critical of light summer fun, but one must reflect that every scene of a movie is a conscious decision that could have been made otherwise, and I can think of so many otherwise ways a movie based on the Transformers toys could have been made, even a third installment. The action was somehow boring despite the slow-motion (and here I thought slowing things down was supposed to make them more exciting), constantly rotating gears and multicolored laser lights - probably due to the lack of emotional anything; the plot was lost somewhere on the dark side of the moon; the humor was sparse; the sociopolitical under- and overtones blunt and plentiful (just count the shots of the American flag, the ratio of screen space occupied by medals, the summary execution of the ""intellectual"" Autobot). This movie was long, empty and confusing, and it just didn't need to be. Re-watching the original animated film would be much more worthy of your time.",0
143,"This was just as bad or almost as bad as Transformers 2.  All the faults that were there in Transformers 2 are basically here, but slightly muted.  If you've seen the previews, then there are no ""Wow"" action sequences to speak of in my opinion.  You know they're coming.  Michael Bay's direction has been so inept and mind-blowingly juvenile in the last two movies that you literally have to be his target age group or give yourself a lobotomy to see beyond it.  What HAPPENED after the first one?  I could do a better job (and that's saying a lot).",0
144,"This is one dumb a$$ movie.  Is it really so hard to come up with a story that makes a little sense?  ...has some semblance of a plot?  ...one that will only ask me to swallow a few fantastic premises, such as ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" rather than a whole bunch of ridiculous nonsense?  While the special effects were impressive, I found myself counting the time for this film to finish.  It was really tortuous.  I felt bad about giving money to producers who were so clearly taking the pi$$.  A stupid movie for stupid people.",0
147,"Most Spectacular Action film I've ever seen! Honestly, the visuals in this movie were out of this world and the characters were totally badass. Megatron will always be my favourite villain but the final battle with The Sentinel was Amazing and I can't wait to see the fourth instalment in the series.",1
150,"""The latest and I'm pretty sure the final installment of the Transformers series is no doubt way better than the crappy-extra-retarded Revenge of the Fallen."" *There was 10 of us that went and most of us had a good time while the rest was just tired-pissed. The Transformers series are famously known for overblown-overlong-mindless action sequences and this latest offering has it except we actually, finally know what they are fighting for and at (just look for the robots with red eyes then you'll know its a Decepticon). The Storyline: 6.0Its easy to follow and the characters back up the story with a little more information, info. well hidden in Ken Jeong's crotch area. For about an hour and a half, there are a few action pieces but mostly involves trying to figure out whats going on and if the resurrection of Sentinel Prime had any significance to what happened on the moon. Then there is Mr. Sam Witwicky, who is desperately striving to find a job that would support him and his girlfriend Carly Spenser (Rosie Huntington Whiteley) while trying to impress Mr. Gould (Patrick Dempsey) and his always crazy parents (Julie White and Kevin Dunn). Visuals: 9.0If you can blame Michael Bay for the reasons why you go to his movies, I believe there are two reasons. Number 1: The assembled cast and the strikingly beautiful hottie that just stares into space and all we see is the glimpse of her glowing physique/body. Number 2: The BOOMS and the BAMS and the huge-ass robots with their huge-ass guns. Seriously, we all go because of his special effects and I will say this ""It's Amazing in a Technical Scale."" The Best use of 3-D I'd ever seen since Avatar. Cast and Performances: 5.0It's completely serviceable. I mean, you know its Transformers and not some sort of Oscar-worthy contender (unless if the Oscars nominates them for their Visuals) Shia La Beouf seems to be on crack. He was kind of into his role especially when he has a new girl nearby but he just looks depressed. (In Revenge of the Fallen, he told Bumble Bee to get the hell out of his garage and now he wants him back because he wants to impress his girlfriend's boss. Somebody diagnose him with Attention Deficit Disorder). *He does deserve a slap, Carly didn't deserve all that crap. Rosie Huntington Whiteley is the female star chick of the show and she's quite charming. Megan Fox on the other hand is a bad-ass girl with a sexy attitude but Rosie is like the clean-cream girl who seems to fit Sam at the moment. She isn't the grandest performer though but not bad for a first time. The other characters are still the same except Tyrese Gibson's character is retired and Josh Duhamel still hasn't gotten any calls from his wife. John Malkovich is the crazy boss with a yellow-obsession and crazy hair. Ken Jeong is as funny as ever...yeah right. Other characters include Frances Mcdormand ""no mame"", Alan Tudyk (Dutch), Patrick Dempsey (the boy that loved to play with the bad side) and let us not forget Mr. One Man Alone (John Turturro) Overall. 7.0It definitely has the best visuals and jaw-dropping scenes like the skyscraper and the story is way better this time around.",1
153,"This movie was great to me and was a perfect summer/fourth of July release. It's got everything you need to get you going for this time of year. The action was amazing as well as the effects. I'm honestly sick and tired of these so called critics. If you have to go to school to tell me a movie was good or not then you didn't know how to enjoy a movie in the first place. That goes to you user reviewers to that are trying to sound like them and make a name for yourself on these reviews. Stop going into movie and dissecting it for real life situations and logic. Its a movie about giant alien robots and your are looking for perfect logic!? Put a cardboard box over your head with the front cut out and walk around wal-mart, would that be real enough for you? Sit down, shut up, and enjoy the movie cause it really is good. The numbers don't lie.",1
154,This film is by far 2011 Film of the YEAR. Remember The brilliant 1986 Transformers film that awed crowd after crowd. Well Transformers: Dark of the Moon blows the 1986 Transformer film away in every way shape and form. 1986 had such bad graphics and this Movies effects are just bloody spectacular. You'll wan't to hold off on the bathroom breaks because of this movies pulse pounding action. 20 out of 10. Side note: The ONLY thing that this movie did wrong was remove the 2 best robots ever to exists in the Transformers Universe. Skitz and Mud,1
155,I actually really enjoyed this movie. The critics need to lighten up. Nothing like some classic action and some quality humor. It was a fine time at the movies.,1
156,"As per usual, the animation was amazing. But, as for the story, terrible. Coming from a Transformers lover like myself, I was bitterly disappointed and had high hopes for this film. If youre a transformers fan and have seen the past two and watched the cartoons and read the comics and such you will get in the same frustrated mood that I was in. But if youre a first time Transformer-er in search for a half decent action film. I suppose it would do.",0
157,"I  went to see dark of the moon on the day before it was released i had alot of high hopes on the movie, I had seen Revenge of the fallen and unlike alot of other  fans I had enjojed the movie ,i enjoyed the humor and the story had some problems like all  movies that come out  these days. but over all it was a great movie ,specailly when you take a look at the movie made   0ver 110 milloin dollar more then the revenge of the fallen.    1st of all any   movie  that makes 110 milloin more the the 1st transformers can't be that bad...so how bad could it have been.    As a fan you must admit the movie had the best specail effects that have been out there in years ,the story was good and who cares about Megan fox the othere girl did a good job , I did have a few things that bothered me Like when I ron hide dead there should have beeen some type of word brougth up from prime about the death of his friend seems like at the end of the movie when Prime is about to blow off sentail's head he should have said something about this is for my freind he  killed ,that wold have been a great thing to due ,to me there was no emotion from them about his death.    i know that when you see a movie over and over you can find many  mistakes but  thats the nature of the beast,it a movie for all of us to enjoy and Mike Bay did a great job on that you I  would  like to think that we should thank him for that.   I like to see another one but I just don't see how........... but hollywood always finds away and when a movie like this make when it finishes the movie run it will make $ close to a billion dollars world wide  it has already broke the record for the fastest 500 million mark at only 9 days so we all know  that abiullion is in reach ,it has not been released in Japan or china yet,think about 700 million  movie profit that dose not include  blue ray movies ,rentals toys and all that other  toy items, all should enjoy it for what its worth  and the hell with the cridects  who know nothing,,, long live OPTIMUS PRIME AND COMPANY BOB",1
158,"I don't understand all the bad reviews, what were you expecting? This movie was pure AWESOMENESS! Non-stop action and entertainment and the story line wasn't too shabby. Special effects were incredible and the 3D was spectacular. You have to watch it in the theaters.",1
159,"a new good sci-fiction film for me .I like the film very much , well, not for all.the robots performance is awesome,but the humans acting is badhope the film will not receive any bad rewards like razzies.If the film got any bad rewards like razzies,I WILL KILL OFF THE **** !!!",1
160,"I wrote a racist 'poem' and my skype status read: ""i'm sorry, it is not you, it was that **** movie, i say **** and kykes and call **** dykes but transformers 3 has truly offended me!"" My friend may have been offended by the above and asked me why? I think he likes the movie. I replied: ""do you have a spare hour or two? i'll tell you. [15:27:23] calum: leaving aside the obvious lack of knowledge about the Transformers universe, Sentinel Prime (Alpha Trion) [Optimus Prime's Father] {Played by Leonard Nimoy, Galvatron, aka future Megatron} being but one glaring example. The whole use of the word race in general, both that it is used, when in reality the concept is imaginary, to refer to a whole species of robots is absurd. There is no real life proof that 'races' differ in any meaningful way besides minor ecological and geographical adaptations and evolutionary differences like my long thin nose to pick a rather vulgar example, which clearly changed from my African forefathers due to their migration to colder climates, thus allowing the more efficient heating of the air inhaled, to avoid hypothermia with the minor drawback of restricting the flow of air and thus reducing the amount that can be inhaled compared to those in warmer lands. In the movie however, race is used to define all of the transformers, their 'race' being what defines them and what they are fighting for the survival of. Also, the whole undertone of self sacrifice for ones 'race' or even planet, in the case of the humans, i find particularly disturbing as it glorifies suicide terrorism and our feeble attempt to combat such violence in kind. That isn't the morality that i grew up with in the 1980's. The Autobots would never and as far as I can remember, didn't kill anything. Let alone all the decepticons, and in the case of the usually docile and slow to anger Optimus, his own father, mentor and also a helpless and surrendering Megatron. It is this that got Prime killed in the very faithful, if a little market led Japanese Movie 'The Movie'. The Prime I know would never kill in cold blood, but then the Autobots are now an analogy for our brave and noble troops, who often are forced to murder, but Prime chooses this, so even as an example to the military, remembering this is a kids movie and not a rally cry, is still a rather disturbing moral example to set. The best performance was given by the CGI animators, but again, seemed more akin to the brutal comic books than the toys or cartoons with gratuitous dismemberment aplenty. The acting sucked, the script was worse and the director, it would appear is a racist facist homophobic **** Unless this movie is a true representation of the American worldview it can only be seen as, at best, a shameless marketing tool to sell toys with no thought given to it's content by it's creators and at worst a tasteless racist recruitment video for the so called 'war on terror'. The answer to terror it would have you believe is the merciless and complete destruction of ones enemies with no thought given to negotiation or understanding. And why the **** is Shockwave a giant snake with a separate dude that doesn't even talk and never turns into a laser gun? If any racial language used herein is offensive to you it is not intended as you can see above I don't even give the term 'race' legitimacy. Why? Because there is no such thing, simple. If you think you might be of a different 'race' to someone else or if the use of possibly offensive racial language perturbs you then it is because you are identifying yourself that way. If no ones a race, no one gets offended. Which is good because we are not and therefore we shouldn't. The word is used wrongly by most people to differentiate and in this movie, I guess they are using it well to refer to a species, eg the human race, or the cybertronian race. But it is still the wrong word, despite it's arguably accurate usage. So yeah, that's what offended me. Sure people believe in race, sure it isn't real, even surer everyone alive is racist, it is common sence to fear the unknown or the threat posed to the local womenfolk by a swarthy genetically more suitable rival. But when making a movie for kids, who should never be lied to, being so blatantly ignorant and misleading is in my opinion, unforgivable. In fact after watching the movie, i have a good mind to go and shoot all the dirty jews that made it in the head, even if they beg, like Optimus! Megatron is my inspiration no more! His feeble mercy is for the weak! Autobots, transform and kill em all!"" So yeah, don't even pirate this filthy waste of bandwidth unless you... Nah, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.",0
161,"I finally went and saw Transformers Dark of the Moon last night. Kinda put it off for a while because I **** hated the second one and this didn't seem much better. But uh, finally got bored and went, this summer's been awful as far as good video games go. They're saving up all the big releases for the fall and holiday season. Here's my thoughts, with spoilers. Though really, this film is so dumb it's not the sort of thing you can spoil. -The story here is taken from the comics and the cartoon. When the Autobots leave in a giant ark that blows up, it's from Dreamwave's first storyline in their Transformers comic. And of course, the Decepticons using a space bridge to transport Cybertron to earth is ""The Ultimate Doom"" episode from the G1 cartoon. So... no real complaints there, them using the actual source material is a welcome change as they've pretty much butchered everything else up to this point.-Who the hell is Q? He's some Autobot scientist that has hair? Why would transformers have hair? And how come I've never heard of Q before? I've watched the cartoon and read the comics and the character of Q, autobot scientist, never came to my attention before. Wait a minute. Q, that's the name of the gadget scientist that equips James Bond in every Bond film, isn't it? Is that what Bay is going for here, ripping off James Bond? Why the **** did he do that? The Autobots already have Ratchet and Wheeljack in the cartoons to outfit them with gear, there was no reason to make up some new lame character.-The comic relief, terrible as it is, comes from the two small robots Wheels and Brains. I'm not sure if Wheels is still voiced by Steve Buscemi but he sounds slightly different. Anyways, these two stupid characters are awful and try their darnedest to remind you of Skids and Mudflap from the second film. They might not be quite as racially offensive, but it's a near thing. Even viewing them without the racial stereotypes, they're just plain annoying as hell and contribute nothing else to the film. Also, Brains for some inexplicable reason has troll doll hair on his head. Again, why would Transformers have hair? These are robots.-Shia LaBeouf screams and acts like a **** idiot. This does not make him a good protagonist.-The comedy in this film is bizarre and off-putting, in other words... typical Bay. Ken Jeong of course has to straddle Shia LaBeouf in a restroom stall and call himself ""Deep Wang."" Of course he does. Of course Bay finds this funny. In fact, this is almost the exact same scenario that Bay gave us in The Island, where it was Steve Buscemi with Ewan McGregor. An unsuspecting innocent walks in on them and thinks they're gay lovers. I'm not saying this sort of situation is unimaginably lacking in comedic value, but the over-the-top manner that Jeong acts just made me feel so embarrassed and disgusted for humanity that the possibility of humor never arrived. Ken Jeong, man, he needs to try and think up some new schtick, because it's just getting old. Cringeworthy comedy is not necessarily a bad thing but it didn't work for me here.-With the way Michael Bay shoots her, Rosie Huntington-Whitely is not nearly as ugly as she looked in some promo stills. However... her acting sucks and she's still not as attractive as Megan Fox.-Optimus Prime appears to be a murderous psychopath. I'm not even sure if he's better then the Decepticons. ""We'll kill them all."" ""Let's find out."" Whatever happened to the Optimus Prime from the cartoon? That's the one that us kids all looked up to. The Optimus Prime here is either wimpering for his life or slicing and dicing everything in sight like a cold-blooded murderer. We bounce around from one extreme to the other, never quite coming into harmonious alignment with Peter Cullen's majestic and inspiring voice, perfect as always. Don't get me wrong, his voice is great, just not what he's made to say in that voice.-Optimus is also equipped with his trailer now, which is an improvement over the past films which always had him trailer-less. Here, it finally completes his vehicle profile and also serves a useful purpose as his equipment locker and battle station.-Why would the Decepticons use humans to rebuild Cybertron? How does that even work? Human slaves are going to be starving and beaten, how are they going to be able to rebuild a totally alien mechanical planet? The Cybertronians are highly advanced technological beings, right? How would 6 billion humans know how to repair this advanced technological planet? Hell, 4 billion humans on earth probably don't even have access to wikipedia yet. I mean, if you want human slaves to build ancient pyramids by dragging giant blocks up ramps, I guess we could probably do that. But I imagine Cybertron has completely alien and sophisticated systems that make up its structure.",0
163,"Michael Bay's Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon put to an end (for now)By W. Leung Saturday, 24 2011Giant robots, exotic cars, and sexy woman, Michael Bay's Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon, produced in June 29, 2011, is an action packed with stunning visual effects movie.Since this is the final chapter of this Transformers movie trilogy, Michael Bay seek to conclude the stories with the last two movies and produces a fascinating ending of this series. The length of the movie is 157 minutes, which is the longest one in the series.Unlike other computer graphics movie, Transformers movie series is based on long life TV animation starting in 1984, which was created by Hasbro and Takara Tomy. The series is about two races of aliensâ",1
164,"It's a movie that exists for the viewer to have fun. The plot is not hard to follow and you get to see giant robots and lots of stuff get blowed up. What else do you need? My only complaint is the over emphasis on Shia Lebouf's character which I really don't want to hear about in a movie titled Transformers. Michael Bay's sweeping camera shots and tendency for overindulgence got really annoying about 5 movies ago so you will be subject to more of it you're not a fan of his style. Pick up the blu-ray and grab some popcorn. Contrary to the critics complaints about this movie, the only way you won't follow along with the plot is if you are an idiot, or if you just have the predetermined opinion about the movie that you are just not going to like it. It seems that many of the critics were just dying to look down upon this film from the highest perch they could climb on to.",1
165,"Transformers 3.........its awesome....but some part of the movie wasn't that much good....after the 2nd half, the real transformers spirit had came to the movie....",1
166,"This was a amazing movie, this is better than all the other transformer movies and although it doesnt really have a plot it has some amazing action scenes. If you like action you should watch this but if you want a story, this movie doesnt have one.",1
170,"Many things I hate. Robots are just too large. I don't want to see robots wrestling, kicking, punching each other.and it's ridiculous that these robots are fighting each other for a box. This is like a movie Terminator, robots came to earth just to to kill Connor family.  Transformers robots appearance is horrible, too colorful.",0
171,"This movie was non-stop fun!  The action was epic, the characters were not annoying like they were in the 2nd film, and although it's a long movie, it does not feel like a long movie!",1
172,Just when you thought this franchise couldn’t’ get any worse it does. This movie was a whole lot of nothing. It has everything I hate about these movies. What makes this movie the worse is that it is excessively long. The first half is really slow and boring and the second half has the world’s longest climax and it never ends. I am sick and tired of these movies and I just want them to go away. I shudder at the fact that we are getting another one and that there are plans for a fifth one.,0
173,"They should have left Dark of the Moon on that side of the moon. Instead Michael Bay does only what he's good at - hiding his terrible movie making in swirling special effects. From the transformers to the actors, no one seems really human and as a result - no one cares what happens at the end of this cliche action flic.",0
175,"Incredible special effects, the argument of the film as usual is not a big deal, but the sound, the battles and action in general were the things that made this movie interesting.",1
176,"I swear, I liked the first 20 minutes, and the animation and effects were awesome, but when both the clichÃ© ''human badass'' actors came in, it just ruined it to me. I was begging to god for the movie to end, and I almost slept in the last 10 minutes. Trash.",0
177,"My favorite movies are Godfather II, Clockwork Orange, 2001, Good Bad Ugly, Raging Bull, and ROTK. So YES, I am a movie snob. But every once and a while I just want a full-on action movie. And you know what? There is a wierd sorta depth here with man-and-machine ala Term2, and you know what? The acting is actually kinda funny for this series. And you know what? That first ten minutes with the battle in Cybrotron leading to those discoveries on the moon in the 1960's. Youn know what? I feel like watching that right now.",1
178,"Just like the other Transformers movies plot takes backseat to the action, but honestly you don't watch these movies for the plot, you watch it to see robots fight and things go boom, and trust me a lot of things go boom, the action is intense and really enjoyable, Shia LaBeouf does another fantastic job as Sam, and they replaced Megan Fox with a far better actress, and the humor is a really nice touch as it shows a more human side of the movie and honestly at times had me rolling on the floor, all in all I had a blast watching this, and if you can forgive the throwaway plot you will too, a great action packed and sometimes hilarious movie that I highly recommend you seeing.",1
181,Great film i must say. Ok it is not a drama filled with great emotions or with extraordinary plot but is well developed and with great visual effect that take your breath away. And that is what i was excepting from T3 a lot of special efects.,1
182,"I have to compliment Paramount for great special effects.  Unfortunately, it does little to make up for the shallow characters, bad acting and horrible plot.   Megatron declares himself supreme ruler of Earth even though humans are technologically advanced with access to nuclear weapons.  He only seems to have only  enough troops to take over New York.  Everyone is OK with this and they send the Autobots away on a rocket.  No problem, they were hiding in the highly explosive rocket booster and they landed safely somewhere in the Atlantic ocean.  The Autobots manage to get all the way to Manhatten in 30 minutes even though they're 1000 miles away and they can only transform into GM vehicles.  Now we have half a dozen renegade robot heroes who all know karate and can win the war with Megatron by punching and kicking them to death.  Humans already discovered in the last movie that you can take out a Decepticon with three grenades and no one seems to have a few naval ships handy with a couple of guided missiles.  Not even the Obama White House is that incompetent.  Let's not forget that a couple of 20 yr old college kids always seem to get top secret information without any clearance.  I'm sorry, but the movie is just plain stupid!",0
183,"What a piece of crap! That movie was a complete waste of my time. Hollywood and Michael Bay has really clicked the Transformer franchise with this load of trash. The movie is simply full of cliches and nonsensical plotholes, it's just mind-numbing. CGI is a saving grace but the explosion are too much and simply distracting. Can't believe people actually pay to watch such movies. I'm glad I didn't.",0
184,"The third (and hopefully final) installment in the Transformers franchise is just as weak as its immediate predecessor and far weaker than the opening salvo in the trilogy.  The scenario setup had promise though.  The Apollo program and the space race were an elaborate front to get to the moon and check out a UFO which crash landed there.  This crashed ship turns out to be a casualty from Cybertron and naturally holds some cargo which both the Autobots and Decepticons desire.  These events are combined with more historical fiction including Chernobyl and with quality writing could really have taken off somewhere intriguing.  Unfortunately, Michael Bay chose to focus on an extremely uncharismatic Shia LeBeouf and his insecurities of unemployment, jealousy concerning his girlfriend, and wishing he had more recognition from his previous attempts to save humanity.  To extend an even bigger weakness, John Turturro is also back again and now seems like even more of a Daffy Duck sidekick instead of an actual human being.    Michael Bay tries harder this time to make the hand-to-hand combat amongst machines work but anyone sitting in the audience will continue to find it quite challenging to tell the difference between Autobot and Decepticon until they somehow untangle themselves.  Also, the humans scurrying around beneath their robotic feet while dodging falling bits of building somehow never get accidentally squished which should really give a lot of credit to the machines situational awareness.    The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, reprised his ministerial role and speaks only in philosophical platitudes which contribute nothing to anyone and is most likely why he receives far less screen time to perch on his soap box and spout them at whoever is unlucky enough to be in the room when he begins a sermon.  His speeches resemble a page-a-day motivational calendar.  The female lead this time, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is not Megan Fox but is interchangeable enough that it does not matter.  Casting also added ensured the new accent brought a British accent with her to make her even sexier to the American male audience.  The first hour of the film has her getting in and out of quite a few low-riding vehicles in extremely short dresses which have most of the audience straining to catch a glimpse.  I wonder if Megan Fox left this series before or after she read this script; she dodged a bullet here.    The new additions of Patrick Dempsey, Francis McDormand, and John Malkovich hold their own with limiting material but Ken Jeongâ",0
186,"Regardless of what people say about Michael Bay the one thing the man knows to do better than anybody is to deliver an action packed cinematic experience. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the the third outing of the Transformers franchise and is an imrprovement on the much maligned Revenge of the Fallen. Personally, I thought the negativity towards the second film was extremely harsh it's far from the worst film or sequel for that matter. Dark of the Moon is once again a very long film coming in at over 2hrs 30 mins but it flies by and never seems to drag along. The film this time begins in 1961 with the battle between the Autobots and  Decepticons where a spacecraft known as the Ark is launched carrying an invention capable which is capable of ending the war once and for all however it is shot down and lands of the Earth's moon. In the present day the Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeaouf) is sturggling to find a job after college as he believes he should be working with the Autobots. The Autobots who once again are working in partnership the US military make a shock discovery whilst tracking down Decepticons in Chernobyl. They find a fuel cell from the Ark and after realising the spacecraft surivived the attack Optimus Prime set off to the moon to retrieve the remaining fuel cells and revive an old friend. A discovery regarding the fuel cells leads the Autobots in a race against time to stop the Decepticons initiating a plan to bring their planet to Earth. The storylines have never been compelling and to be fair hardly logical but they are engaging and is sheer entertainment and do bring around some of the biggest action sequences in the cinema to date as thats were Transformers 3 excels. The visual effects are outstanding and its one of the few films i've found were 3D is actually awesome! There's never a dull moment and the action is always on the go and ofcourse there's always a bit of humour added into the pack. The big question coming into this film was could film debutant Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replace a certain Megan Fox as the eye candy? Well let's just say the way she is introduced in this film won me over straight away its unforgettable and whilst she will no doubt be panned in all honesty the role of Sam's sweetheart is more about how hot they look rather than how good an actress they are. The film is an action blockbuster from start to finish and succeeds in that department in every aspect, no doubt Bay and co will have their haters but the film itself does the talking and given the amount of money it has grossed I find it hard to beleive this is the last time we will see Optimus Prime and co!",1
187,"The Best Transformers yet by far. The action and effects were increased. The replacement of Megan fox wasn't that big of a deal, her replacement couldn't act very well also. The film had great twists that a lot of people didn't see coming. Optimus prime is one of my all time favorite film characters and he totally kicks some more but in Transformers 3. some scenes in this movie were a little over the top and weird but other scenes were hilarious. All action scenes were simply amazing and breath taking. I really enjoyed T3 and think it was a redemption of Revenge of the fallen, which was just ok.",1
188,"If you are looking for a story here, you'll be disappointed. But, honestly, this is TRANSFORMERS. What did you expect? Transformers isn't supposed to be about a great story story or character development. It's about insanely awesome visuals, explosions, special effects, and action. That is what this movie delivers. Basically, this movie is all about tying up loose ends, making puzzle pieces from the early films fall together, and making you laugh because your suspicions are becoming reality. Or, that's the beginning of the movie. From about the middle onward, it's pretty much nothing but action, explosions, and gunshots. there are a couple funny parts, but they will soon be lost in the mayhem. This movie is all about the action. If you want a storyline, go home, because that isn't what transformers is about. It's about awesome CGI visuals and non-stop action. Sadly, Megan Fox's replacement was the only thing that kept me from giving this a ten because, let's face it. Some think she's as hot, (me) more think she's less, and very few think she's more. (But believe it or not, the blondie was actually a worse actor than Megan was. I know, right?",1
192,"I saw this movie on a date, and me and her had an awesome time. The movie was great, and a just follow-up the first two Transformers movies. Dark of the Moon had it's heartfelt, funny, and just jaw-dropping awesome moments. While the story was not the strong point at all, you'll push it aside because of the special effects and action sequences. Plus, it has Ken Jeong from the Hangover!",1
193,"I thought that this was an exciting movie, with lots of action...pretty good story line.  I'd watch it again when it comes on DVD.  I didn't see this in 3D, but it was still worth seeing it in a theater.  :)",1
195,"Michael Bay has graced us with another air-headed, action-trash-of-a-film. It improves on the second (which isn't saying much), and remains inferior to the 1st film. Good visual effects and sound... but that can't save it from being one of the worst movies out this summer... I regret seeing it.",0
197,"I was quite disappointed after I had watched Transformers 3. It didn't reach up to the quality of the first 2 according to me. It had very funny moments, awesome CGI effects and the awesome actor Shia Labeouf. Even though those things are great for a movie, it lacked a lot of other things. To start with, I can't understand why Michael Bay changed Megan Fox to this new dumb blondie with silicon lips. She isn't sexier, and she is even worse at acting according to me. They also made a very weak ending on Megan's career. A few sentences.    This movie showed off the well-known rule ""Awesome things stops being awesome if you get too much of them"". There were simply too much CGI in this movie. The epic moment where you saw one or more transformers evolve or battle aren't gone, but they are everywhere! And it didn't help that the last battle lasted for one hour.    It is worth watching if you have seen the other Transformers, or if you get turned on by CGI effect.",1
198,"I never saw the first 2, but I must say this is an excellent movie! They suck you in right at the beginning. The first scene will have your attention for sure. There is a good amount of action and drama as well. At no point was I bored or checking the time. The only reason I couldn't give this a 10 was simply due to not enough Optimus and not enough Bumblebee. Also, much of the movie is predictable if you ever watched transformers as a kid. 8/10",1
200,"Maybe the second was so bad that anything glows in comparison but in many ways this one is much better. There is less useless action throughout, although the last 40 mins do start dragging after the millionth explosion. What Michael Bay seriously misunderstands is action. Explosions do not equal excitement, it is what's at stake and the investment in the characters that makes sequences exciting. Nonetheless I knew the kind of film that I was going to get going in so I was able to enjoy most of it. The plot is much more easier to understand and I did find myself caring for some of the characters. Although just like the previous films, I can never tell who's who when the robots start fighting. It's just clashing metal. This time is was fun though.",1
201,This movie rarely has a dull moment. there are a lot of twists and turns. Figuring Megan Fox left the cast the transformers movies for sure lost some male viewers. But don't be to afraid men. The new girl is smoking hot! The non stop action happens within 1 hour and 30 minutes into the movie. and once it starts it nearly ever stops! They spend a lot of time in Chicago. And while they are their they have a very tough task to handle. And with the rise of the ultimate transformer. This is for sure a award winning movie.,1
203,"Transformers 3 isn't Oscar-material, but it isn't anywhere near a plonker of a movie. The CGI is brilliant and some **** amazing Autobot-Decepticon action sequences are featured throughout, the plot line is really quite simple but it does draw you in quite effectively, with plenty of ""**** **** did not see that coming"" moments and an abundance of 'edge-of-your-seat' anticipation moments that really help get you emotionally connected with the characters (my favourite Autobot died during the first half and a universal favourite...I won't spoil this, but there's certainly a very intense moment with Bumblebee, but I won't tell you how it concludes) the actors are brilliant with plenty of big Hollywood names playing both major and minor roles, good and bad, the dialogue is hilarious and the characters are loveable and engaging. The final showdown is everything that it should be and more (it's not Optimus vs. Megatron, although that does happen) and Sam finally gets some real action, being responsible for the destruction of one of the Decepticon high-ups. I do have three complaints. One-The opening sequence that explains the conspiracy behind the moon-landing, it does drone on for a fair while and features a particularly horrible JFK impersonator. Two- Skids and Mudflap are gone! I know that some people found them offensive, but i found them hilarious, and I think they told the first crude joke that my dad has ever laughed at, which was something of a magical moment for me, the least they could have done was kill them off early on alongside my favourite transformer. Three- The Optimus vs. Megatron showdown takes about ten seconds, granted, the previous battle was the big one that everyone wanted to see by that time, but I guess it all comes down to the fact that since RotF, Megatron has been portrayed as a weak-ass **** and that's one thing that I will not forgive this movie for. Ultimately, this is a must-watch, with a brilliant plot to suck you in coupled with kick-ass moments of **** dude, ****s about to go down, **** **** **** and brilliantly choreographed action sequences. Better than any film in regards to action, but I still prefer the original movie when it comes to plot, but all-in-all, if you're looking for a perfectly balanced mix of Drama, Action, Comedy, Plot and CGI-Epicness, you can't ignore this movie",1
204,This movie is this summers best of all. This movie includes every robot in the transformers movie except the twins. Good luck transformers universe. If only this great movie got a better review it deserves a 100,1
205,"I thought it was a great action flick, actually the first in the series that really captured the essence of the 80's cartoon series which was where it was all at.  The only reason I didn't give it 10 was because the twist was too predictable and the end felt totally cut off, you sit through 3 hours of movie, only to have the credits start to roll, although that said, it was better than the first movie's ""10 minutes of Optimus Prime Speech"" ending.  All in all a fantastic movie, well worth watching, particularly the special effects are just perfect, I found myself forgetting that Transformer's don't actually exist.",1
206,"While this movie had its ups and downs I still believe that this is an extremely exciting movie.I watched it at a movie theatre in 3D and I recommend you do so aswell , not letting yourself watch the 3D explosions , sparks and destruction will be letting yourself down. Without trying to spoil the movie, this movie contains some big surprises, betrayal and over the top action scenes. Even my uncle who is a long time transformers fan said it didnÂ´t betray the novelties set by merchandise and the previous movies in the slightess and said it was true to the transformers formula. They manage to slip in comedy here and here and me and my uncle couldnÂ´t help giggling and looking at each other. Although I want to stress that it is not the best transformers film and the story is somewhat up and down. I recommend watching it at cinemas in 3D, donÂ´t know if I could say the same about DVD.",1
207,"If you are a big fan of CGIs and action scenes with car chases and explosions, then you should by all means watch this movie. But if you are actually into movies with a coherent plot, tri-dimensional characters and non-clichÃ© lines, then you'd be completely wasting your time here.The three points I scored were solely due to the visual effects, which were mesmerizing and will most likely get an Oscar nod. But that's all there is to this movie.",0
209,"A remarkably odd and unsatisfying entry. I loved the first and wasn't too impressed by the second. The first was tightly scripted with a solid main plot and little padding. It was a 2 hour roller coaster and all the better for it. The second was a mess with too many plot strands and characters linking towards the rather underwhelming final battle and virtually no main plot to hold it together. Sadly, Dark Of The Moon is actually worse. But not because it has no plot. The basic premise involving Sentinel Prime is superb, but it's comprehensively ruined by far too many characters, most of whom are dreadfully acted, especially the usually dependable John Malkovich, in too many plot strands that, unlike the second film, go absolutely nowhere, and all clutter up the film so badly in the first 90 minutes that by the time the action starts. Terrible editing and an almost wanton disregard for very significant deaths in the series rob two of the most poignant moments of any emotional impact. Not to mention the choice to remove Megan Fox and replace her with a fembot. I don't even like Fox, but at least she could act out more than one emotion, that being ""slightly confused"". Bay's ability to make action sequences look stunning is certainly present, but they are so CGI heavy and the lighting so determined to show off it's HDR abilities on the CGI models that you can't tell what the hell is going on or who's winning. After each battle, you often have to wait for the next dialogue scene to figure out which shiny robot is still alive. All in all, it's just a damned shame. An intriguing plot that should have massive emotional impact for a blockbuster, that turns out to be a confused mess full of throwaway one liners and jokes, none of which are funny, not to mention wasting some serious acting talent on plot strands that go nowhere and rob the film of any momentum. Almost a complete disaster.",0
210,"Michael Bay makes another terrible attempt at a good movie, I'm starting to think he's not even trying. This movie was at least better than the second installment in the never ending death penalty of a trilogy. I was forced into seeing it with my friends and wish I had just stayed out of it. The acting is good and the special effects are great, I must admit, but the storyline and plot of the movie and the characters are terrible and I just didn't care about them. There was no feeling in them and if they lived or died, I didn't care. At times, I thought maybe it would be better if they did. The movie is terrible and so is the director and almost anything is better than the Transformers series.",0
211,"Entertaining enough, but with iffy acting and a very long running time. Nevertheless, it's a wondrous bit of fun with incredible special effects that could even merit it an Oscar. But only in that field...",1
215,"This is proberly the best transformers made to date, the action scenes are epic the amount of transformers involed is amazing and the acting is of an okay standard. If you go into this movie expecting movie of the year you will be disapointed, but if your looking for a fun way to kill a few hours then this is a good way to do it. Be warned though there is no Story, its very basic and dosent hold merit. But the voice acting cast do there bit in portraying the Transformers well. Its fun while it lasts.",1
216,Bad. Boring. Stupid. Just a quick cash in. Not even the kids will like this movie. Action movie for kids with politics that don't make any sense what so ever.,0
218,"This movie was just OK. I found the plot lacking many things, and there was for the most part, poor acting. The only reason why I somewhat liked this movie was the action scenes in the movie. These scenes were incredible and were awesome in 3D.",1
219,"Man, what a boring piece of **** this turned out to be. It's just mindless moronic action with a brainless incoherent plot. I can't believe this sad excuse of a movie made over a billion at the box office, just sad.",0
220,"Its a horrible movie. You must wait for more than one hour for you can see the transformers fight and i don say that this have importance to me, but for other persons and children can be bored. The history is stupid, dont have the more minimun point of reflection or climax, is totally plane. The actuations are ver bad, dont express anything emotion, are bobas and ridiculous. Nothing are save of be bad un this picture.",0
221,"After the horrible 2nd installment of Transformers, my hopes were not high for third chapter. Maybe it was my lowered expectations, but I liked this movie a lot more. Special affects are spectacular. It also helps that they finally got rid of megan Fox, THANK GOD. Although she is easily replaced with another forgettable model, she doesn't irritate me the way Fox does. McDormand is too good for this movie and skates by with practiced ease. However, it is a great summer popcorn flick.",1
223,"Transformers 3 is an excellent action movie flik. The plot isb easier to follow now because it's more simple. I actually saw this in 2d format because at the time I didn't have enough money for me and my friend. I heard from some people that the 3d was as good as Avatar which I had seen. The 2d though to me wasn't really that bad so I didn't feel like I missed out on much.The plot of NASA keeping a secret about the Apollo 11 1969 landing on the moon was pretty cool start to the movie and also interplaying that with finding a cybertronian ship with Optimus Primes mentor, Sentinal Prime gave it a good mystery to the plot for me. Shia Labeouf again was top notch again as the funny Sam Witwicky. Also Patrick Dempsey for me played his role very well. The comedy to me was toned down to me in ways but the comedy in this one I thought was better than the 2nd one  without it getting to non serious. All of the comedy guys I thought did a good job.  Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel  also played their roles pretty well. All the villians in this movie are great for the most part. Overall the action is done mine blowingly well and the robots look to me quite realistic in all the places and city environments. There's gonna be a lot of wow moments for the audiences especially supposably  in 3d. As far as the pacing I thought it was good for the most part despite it being like a 2 and a half hour movie. Now the negatives are some of the robots and new robots in the film didn't get the character development, as for like Shockwave I don't even think it had a voice actor and it had some cool moments but they didn't really show much of Shockwave. Also some of the new autobots didn't get a lot of character development. Some of the deliberately comedy relief characters didn't bring anything to the plot as the movie unfolded as well s a few others as well I think.  But above the negatives this haves to be not only the best Transformers movie, but it's one of the better action movies of all time. This is definately a much watch. I give this film a rating of 8.9 out of 10 stars*.",1
224,Being a huge fan of Transformers characters and Animation i will see what ever they made . But that doesn't mean im gonna  love whatever they made . The first one was good . The second one ..... well i actually felt asleep while watching . At-least this one kept me awake . this one is really the best of the franchise . i like the story which . this story took me way back to the animation series unlike the first two . but the problem is (i don't know why) Bay always focus on the human characters like Sam and Us Military . sometimes it felt like im watching a movie about a war fighting by Military with their Robots . But  Transformers(animated) was like this . that was so wide and actually focused on the different Transformers and more about them . there are more awesome Transformers out there and lot of awesome fighting techniques which were missing . Now acting...... Rosie Rosie Rosie ! She is one of my favorite VS angels ! i was so excited to see her reprising Fox ! i think she did good(as first time) a lot better then Fox (of course) . Siha was more down then the last film as well as josh(i really like his acting but not in this one) .  Patrick Dempsey was good but John Turturro was awesome . as for the voice actors there's nothing to say they are the best of the best .really like Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime. i actually loved the V.effects and transformations it was much more clear and awesome then the last two . Overall it was the best entry but still i expected more .as i said at fast im a huge fan so i would love to see more films but i want to see a Reboot and with good story about Transformers not some kid and military . [P.S. Rating will show 7 but its actually 6.8 !],1
225,"Avec Transformers 3, Michael Bay et toute son Ã©quipe ont vraiment mis le paquet! Effets numÃ©riques ahurissants, bruitages exceptionnels, bande originale de qualitÃ©, montage Ã©nergique, scÃ¨nes d'action Ã©blouissantes, acteurs Ã  l'aise dans leur rÃ´le respectif... Le seul plus qui permet Ã  ce troisiÃ¨me opus de surpasser les premiers, c 'est (par miracle!!) le scÃ©nario. Plus sombre et beaucoup plus travaillÃ© que pour les prÃ©cÃ©dents films, il est Ã©tonnant d'exprimer de la compassion pour chaque personnage (mÃªme inhumain) et d'Ãªtre Ã©tonnÃ© par l'histoire elle-mÃªme, qui tient formidablement la route! Certains me critiqueront parce que je suis fan, mais je peux assurer qu'avec Transformers 3, jamais vous ne vivrez une telle expÃ©rience au cinÃ©ma cÃ´tÃ© action et destruction, avec une 3D de qualitÃ© (pour le Grand Rex en tout cas).",1
226,"This is certainly much better than Revenge of the Fallen, but it's not up to scratch with the original.  Its plot is the most intriguing in the series, but it spends over half the movie on thin character development, poor humor and awful acting. Then we get into the good stuff in the last hour, the action will blow your socks off and it's some of the best Bay has done and the 3D is mind blowing! Not the series best, but enough to redeem the series after RotF.",1
227,"Hidden on the Moon lies a secret weapon. A weapon used to manipulate time and dark matter, crashed onto the Moonâ",1
228,"Nice movie, except way too much human screen time. 3D effects are great. However, the plot does not seem to agree with what has happened in the first movie, and certain outcomes and events are unexplained. You could tell the robots apart if you watch closely enough. The car chase at D.C. and Mexican Standoff were impressive. Fun to see Buzz Aldrin make an appearance as himself. Also includes some real-life footage of Apollo 11. Plot is well written, with some flaws here and there, and may be too loud for certain people. But overall great movie. At the end, I was still hoping it could last longer, and it could, if Michael Bay elaborated on certain details. Those who claim that people who like it are either children or stupid. They are wrong. You wont be able to enjoy a movie if you are always seeing flaws everywhere. Children and so-called ""stupid"" people, enjoy the movie because we just sit back and enjoy the movie, not caring about the plot. And those who hate the movie (and most likely Michael Bay also) forgot that Steven Spielberg is the executive producer. Don't care what the critics say, if it is really that bad, then Transformers: Dark of the Moon will not have hit  $700 million, let alone 1 billion (which it acheived) and becoming the fifth-highest grossing movie of all time.",1
230,"Trust me, TF3 has more than enough story to keep up with the action thrills. There is a good balance between the 2, and thats why I like it. This was the Transformers movie I was waiting for.",1
231,"complete garbage, dont waste your money",0
232,"As I played the movie, one things popped in my mind, and that was Megan Fox was not gonna be in the movie. But I knew other than that the battle was gonna be epic. And the movie was Mind-Blowing!!!!! I think this was the best movie Ive ever seen out of the Transformers Movie Series.",1
238,"It's ironic that a movie should include its intended target audience in its title, because I can't fathom how anyone with half a brain could like this bloated, over-the-top, cliched, terribly, terribly acted atrocious mess of a film. I could not actually finish this film, because about half way though, Shia and whoever the hell the lead actress is, their ""acting"" was seriously starting to get on my nerves, as was Michael Bay's repetitive formula of  ""action, action, action, action, cliched action movie lines delivered woodenly, action, action, action"". How the hell Leonard Nimoy was roped into this I'll never know, and Steven Spielberg himself had absolutely nothing to do with this movie, he just had his name slapped onto it.This film does not deserve to be in the Top 10 best sellers of all time, it doesn't even deserve to be in the Top 1,000. This movie should have been buried 12 feet under the ground, and left to rot. The only reason this movie was a success is the same reason Nickelback are successful; they're so formulated they don't require you to think, at all, and that's a very bold statement coming from me. I normally scoff at people who say things like that, but seriously, when you watch this travesty of a film you see how little you really have to work. Someone should tell film makers, and especially the half-wit that directed this atrocious abortion of a film that action scene after action scene is extremely tedious and boring, because they should be used to enhance the film, and not become the film. Michael Bay, you need counselling. You need to be told what a good film is. You admitted that you knew Transformers 2 was the pile of steaming horse **** that it was, and what did you go and do? Make a film that was even worse. All in all, badly edited, terribly, awfully acted, no coherent plot, no depth, no character threads, nothing. This film is just a big, bloated nothing. If you're going to watch this film, then sure as **** don't pay for this thing, find it online somewhere. I guarantee, you pay for this to buy or rent, and you've definitely wasted your money. Thankfully, this will be the last ballache of a film that Bay releases in this franchise, so it can be buried and forgotten as quickly as possible, or perhaps remembered as one of cinema's most embarrassingly awful moments.",0
239,"Silly performances, loud cheesy action, and sometimes just stupid dialogue excuse anything in this movie from actually being serious. Yet the special effects are first class. I give this movie 22%.",0
240,"This movie sucked. Action is Okay, but the whole terrible plot, horrible acting, and everything makes it bad. Transformers: 6/10Transformers 2: 4/10Transformers 3: 2/10",0
241,"After the last transformers was very poor, they have upped their game and created a fantastic 3rd installment. The special effects are great and the storyline is ok. The actors are good and the girl is so attractive! It wasn't as good as the first one but it wasn't far off. It was a bit predictable at times and the middle dragged on a bit but on the whole it was really good.",1
243,"Where should I start with this one. I know how about that it's one of the worst movies for the year of 2011. Everything about this was horrible including the acting, directing, and writing. The only good thing was the action but I don't even like action. This franchise just keeps getting worst and worst by the movie. Why does this make so much money? I know why because spoiled Americans don't know what a good movie is. It is marketed towards kids and teenagers so you can tell that it's going to be bad before it even hits theaters. Michael Bay is going to be remembered for a long time as the worst directer in history. Who directs there actors to scream every ten seconds? The acting is also not even the least bit serious with people jumping around and doing things I never seen done on screen before. The directing of the camera man was also horrible. There where shots that cut off the top of actors heads and there where shots that I have never seen before. The writing was also very horrible. Even a 12 year old could have written this. But the worst part of it all I would have to say is the fast paced plot. The only good thing about this film is the special effects and the 3D. I would recommend this film to selfish greedy die hard capitalists.",0
244,"It's the same crap with a different title. Michael Bay bombards us with mediocrity once again. Just like ""Revenge of the Fallen"" the characters are worthless, the jokes are bad, and the action scenes are too long and repetitive. Granted, this time around the movie does try to take itself a little more seriously. Gone are the racist robots and the constant kid jokes. But saying this is better than ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is like saying ""I Am Number Four"" was a better movie than ""Battlefield Earth."" Michael Bay lowered the bar so much with ""Revenge of the Fallen"" that he really has nowhere to go but up on this one. The final action scene does have its cool moments, but the action is poorly staged and way too long. I felt like I could have watched the beginning of the action scene, left the theater for 10 minutes, come back and not missed a thing. It's one of those action scenes that's impressive for the first 5 minutes before it overstays its welcome and stays at the same level. I guess if you liked ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" you'll enjoy this as well. It's the same movie with a few improvements. But if you felt like Michael Bay grabbed the money out of your wallet the second time around, stay away from this. You're going to have the exact same experience.",0
245,"The first 15 minutes or so was actually pretty good. Then it quickly squandered the visually interesting and narratively promising set up and descended into one of the worst films I have ever seen, along with the second movie.The human characters are at best lifeless and two-dimensional with no emotional progression, at worst bizarre and unintelligible, behaving like no human I have ever seen (due to both the actors and the script); the robot dialogue is equally bad, and the side characters which are supposed to be funny are just plain cringing.The story is appalling, failing to meet basic dramatic criteria; a smart child really could do much better. There's a romantic subplot wedged in which is completely ham-fisted, undeveloped and pointless. Other attempts at subplots like the main guy trying to fit into society and find a purpose are set up then abandoned. Characters act in absolutely ridiculous ways with no sensible explanation (the good robots pretend to leave the planet in a rocket for no well defined reason and then do nothing whilst the bad robots destroy cities, just to allow the terrible cliche of them returning when all hope is gone; the leader of the good robots joins the bad ones and doesn't bother explaining why in any coherent fashion), and the whole thing doesn't make sense at all, with the first part focused on a MacGuffin which apparently plays no further role in the story, and the last hour motivated by the bad robots deciding that what a hyper technologically advanced race really needs is humans as animals for slave labour. And then... killing as many humans as they can? It really is that bad.I understand that this is an action film, but that doesn't excuse the total laziness and incompetence of all other aspects; action films can be good as films too. As for the action itself, if you've seen the previous movie, you've seen this one. With the exception of one original scene involving a tilting skyscraper which wasn't really used to full potential and was pretty much ruined by frustration at everybody apparently forgetting the purpose for which they climbed it in the first place, this is 3 more hours of robots and explosions. If you're under 15 then it kind of makes sense that this might appeal to you. Otherwise... well, have fun?",0
248,"I've sifted through the whole crazy, lazy, non sense filled, plot line to get to the  robot destruction. Worth it? Sort of..... but anybody that's that has lazy criticism or was stoned while watching this...Then soup's on!!!",0
249,Robocop is history! When you can care about robots feelings and feel their pain...then Mike Bay is a genius. IMAX 3D makes this an awesome experience. Robots may be getting Oscars soon if they get better roles.,1
250,"I LOVE Michael Bay's other movies (Bad Boys 1 and 2, Armageddon, The Rock, The Island). He has an amazing style that is definitely captivating.  I couldn't take watching this one.  It was just endless visual assault (in a bad way) with ridiculous scenarios I just couldn't buy into.  I knew going into this what it would be and it was EXACTLY what I suspected.  How's that supposed to entertain me?  It's not because there's no plot either.  I guess I'm not childish enough to believe in these life size skating, twirling things anymore.",0
251,"It started off promising but in the end it was a major disapointment. The plot was oddly enough the best the series had up to this point and it was interesting. The acting was below average though, The worst the series has seen imo. What killed this film is not only its length but the non-stop special effects that have lost their impressive value and have now become stale. What we need now is a reboot of the series without Michael Bay because he has achieved the most he can with this series.",0
253,"Transformers: the dark of the moon is a pretty darn big improvement on its predecessor, Transformers: revenge of the fallen. It's also an improvement on the first installment of the series: Transformers. Even though it has one very annoying character: Mikaela Banes (I got the name from wiki, I don't think it was said in the actual film). Sometimes, the film awkwardly tries to be funny at points, but very occasionally, you get a very small amount of laughter. The story-line is more thought out, in basic terms: it had a better and more interesting plot. The action was more intense and the dialogue was a bit better than the first and second's. I want to give an eight, but it doesn't quite deserve it, I recommend watching it either if you kind of like the old transformers show and toys or if you like exciting action movies.",1
254,"One of the best 3D effects so far (aside from Avatar and Tron Legacy).As they say in the movie:""Where have you been when they took over the world?""Like it or hate it Transformers is now part of a worldwide phenomenon. You can't change that. So you can start enjoying it as well.",1
255,"As a Transformers fan, I love everything about the franchise. I did however find it difficult to argue with people on how Revenge of the fallen turned out and how disappointing the movie was. But Michael Bay has  been able to turn it around and create a movie that was as good as the first one. The 3D affects were amazing and  the action was excellent. Michael and the writers were able to incorporate an actual story this time around that actually did make sense, even though there were times were it would break away from the story, which didn't disappoint to much as it was interesting to break away from the plot and see what else was going on. I felt that they did an excellent job of bring more emotion into this movie than the others which is great. If I had only one criticism, is the fact that I didn't like the acting of, new to the big screen, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley which I felt struggled with showing her emotions and overall acting as good as Shia LeBueof. Dark of the moon is the best out of the 3 and doesn't disappoint action fans.",1
256,"I will admit that this movie started out quite tedious. It started out quite broad and stretched out. Not much happening really; except a simple story being told.  But wow, after it got going... it really got going; Action, explosion, bullets, marines, giant metal machines; all became the sudden reality. Building started toppling, machines started pelting out the artillery. I tell ya, it was intense. I will admit that the story in general didn't hold much depth, but the overall experience and action in this movie is not to be overlooked. One of the best action movies of the year.",1
261,"An absolute disaster of a film. There are so many problems with it, they are not even worth mentioning. It should be illegal for Michael Bay to ever be associated with a movie again.",0
263,"I spent almost two hours of my life waiting in line to buy a ticket for this darn movie. That was a much better experience than watching this darn movie. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is the worst American movie I have ever seen since I saw ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" Like murder and adultery, both movies have no right to exist. For the third straight film, the Autobots and Decepticons are once again on a race for the possession of... something. The Autobots must find it before the Decepticons... or else. Let me ask you something. Does it really matter what they",0
265,"How did they get so many great actors to work in this POS?  Good acting all around accept for the female who's scenes need fast forwarding.  I made it 45 minutes in before I realized another 45 or so of the same garbage was pointless and turned it off.  I'll give 1 point for great animations, 1 point for good acting (despite horrible scripts), and 1 point because its sci-fi and robots.  Otherwise, garbage all the way.    ---    ---  What really turned me off, was when the lead actor (does the name matter?) refuses to cut off his hand to save the world, but thinks nothing of killing himself and all his friends in a vain and logically futile attempt to save the girlfriend.  So the hero turns out to be a selfish @hole.  Then, US Army and Airforce somehow manage to infiltrate the enemy's captured Chicago, but for some reason the combined Earth a military's can't get a single nuke within detonation radius of the city.  ---   --- Typical liberal Hollywood whose ideal heroes fall so dreadfully short of true heroism.  ---  ---  Turns my stomach as I turn it off.",0
266,"This is a great action movie from Michael Bay, better than Revenge of The Fallen but cant defeat Transformers(2007). But what make it even more awesome this time was the 3d that was really cool, but if you cant watch it in 3d it is enjoyable anyways",1
268,"There's something everyone should know about me when I watch movies. It's that I totally crave into action flicks and rared type of movies that are almost barely understandable. TF3 is one of those movies you'll have to wait for too little to get fully impressed, because if it weren't for the last 40 minute Chicago war scene, the movie would've probably be as **** as Revenge of the Fallen. The best one in the franchise!",1
269,"Definitely the worst of all the Transformers films, there is no attempt at actually making a good film here. All they are after is the consumers' money. Should have and could have been better, the story is beyond ridiculous even for a Transformers or a Michael Bay film. I actually enjoyed the dynamic between Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Shia La Beouf despite the fact that the former really cannot act. The first film was the only good film of this series.",0
270,"Gave it a 10 because of the haters out there giving it such a bad score.  Honestly would have given it a 7.8/10. Fun: 9/10Action: 8.5/10Character Build: 7.6/10Plot: 7.5/10Special Effects: 9.5/10",1
271,"Transformers 3 is an action pack sequel, the story plot is just awful and the script is awful, the actoring is awful. The only thing I enjoyed about this film was the special effects, micheal bay spent to much time planning and sorting out the effects that he didn't put much into the storyline and script. The running time is just to long for a robot-punch um up, it's an improvement from its predecessor, but not a huge improvement. In my opinion this film is the worst film ever made and to watch is just a waste of your time.",0
275,"It could be as good as the first film, but it's stupid love story between Sam and Carly and it's cliché elements couldn't make that possible. But it's still an really entertaining film, with the best visual effects I've ever seen.",1
277,"Just awful. The visual effects and Leonard Nimoy are this movie's only redeeming qualities. Nimoy is clearly doing his best and gives a fantastic performance as Sentinal Prime. The visuals are just breathtaking at points and gorgeous. But that's it! Other than those two things, the movie is utter garbage. It rehashes everything from the previous movies. There is no real focus on any character and doing anything to really develop them (aside from Optimus.) Sam is as annoying as ever in all his LaBeouf-ness. New hot girl is bland and uninteresting (but at least slightly better than Megan Fox.) The rest of the cast is forgettable and are really just there as plot devises. The overall story is nonsensical and most of the time seems to just make up its own logic, Transformers 1 & 2 did this too, but nowhere near as much as this movie. Overall: This is a movie that was designed to be an optical marvel and really is nothing more than an insult to fans and the general public. In short: It's the movie equivalent of a gold-plated turd.",0
278,"Exellent scene, nice scene. the scene is impressive, but the story is tottaly bad, it's so familiar that i could know the ending. I hope transformer 4 will be so much better",1

La bella e brava attrice Megan Fox (Mikaela Banes) sostituita dalla Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Carly Brooks Spencer) la prima ""gnocca"" che capita che  brava solo a mostrare le gambe e non ha il talento della nostra amata Fox.Il mio voto non può superare l' 1/10...il regista ha rovinato il sogno di un sognatore e ora vorrebbe fare il quarto capitolo per cercare di farlo continuare, ma il fatto  che mi sono svegliato e del sogno  rimasto solo il vuoto.",0
286,Definitely better than Revenge of the Fallen but still not good enough. The only good part was the last 30-45 minutes with an epic battle. This movie took too long to get going so an average performance from Micheal Bay.,1

290,"I was going to give this film a 5, but then I realised they got rid of Megan Fox. That's also probably the only change Bay has made from the first move to this one; otherwise it's just a rehashing of a thinly veiled human plot with a 30 minute robot fight at the end. Am I fine with that? Sure.",1
292,"I must be in the minority here, but I personally found ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" to be the worst of the first three Michael Bay ""Transformers"" films. Sure, it's visually brilliant and has some pretty great music, but all things considered, the film is pretty poorly-written, awfully acted, overly long, and worst of all, BORING! ""Dark of the Moon"" actually threatened to bore me to sleep. A movie about giant, fighting robots shouldn't make me want to fall asleep. All in all, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is not a very fun ride, and unless you're a hardcore ""Transformers"" fan that enjoyed the previous two films, you won't find much to like here.",0
293,"I distinctly remember watching this movie. I walked in hoping that Michael Bay could redeem himself after the godawful second installment in the franchise. I'll say this... This movie is truly awful. It would be safe to say that this is my least favorite movie of all time. Not only because of the truly horrendous plot, but also Shia Leboufs complete over-acting and horrible dialogue. All I can say is that Michael Bay tried really hard to make it more serious of a movie than what it was, and he should of focused on the fact that it's a silk about robots ripping each other to pieces. But honestly, don't even spend any of your time on this film, because you will be severely disappointed",0

So much of this film has been used in other films after it and you cant say not to it. It has better scenes then The avengers trust me. Watch where The avengers get their scenes and story from. The story was Ok, The characters were not bad but the special effects were something to remember.",1

Micheal Bay directs the third installment of Transformers  series. let me just say that Bay directs the best film of transformers series ever i know that he basically puts non stop Stereotype characters in Transformer 1, 2,3  but this is the best transformers film i seen. This is the best Transformers film in micheal bays career. Grade A+",1
300,The one word to describe this movie disappointing I didn't really have high hopes because I was let down with revenge of the fallen I at least expected a decent action movie though I thought to myself hopefully I will at least get to see a lot of giant robots fighting NOPE most of the time its humans surviving an attack from the decepticons there are two small scenes at the beginning and at the end where there are actual transformers fighting transformers the rest is like Jurassic park just replace the dinosaurs with robots and you've got this movie and deduct the greatness that is Jurassic park and what makes this worse is that the characters aren't really likeable either there is pretty much zero character to the main characters girlfriend she is pretty much there just for the audience to look at and I'm being serious its like Michael bay hoped she would be a bandaid for a really bad movie because I swear she has more screen time than the main actor and if you Google to see the cast for this movie she is the first actor listed even though she isn't supposed to be the main star after this review I'm gonna give this movie 2 out of 10 because of the first and last action scenes.,0

316,"This film is a definite improvement over the 2009 disaster ROTF. The plot is coherent, there isn't as much bad humour, and Sam's parents aren't in it that much. And the film actually is kind of... Good? It still has a lot of issues, but Dark of the Moon also has a lot of good things. The characters, both Human and Cybertronian have a lot more emotion throughout the events. And their motivations, even Megatron's a little, feel relatable. The action is great also. And Mr Jablonsky created another masterpiece soundtrack.  While still carrying a lot of flaws, this film still shines as an engaging, emotional film.",1
317,"Спасибо, что хоть сценарий не такой убогий, как в прошлой части, но зато убого всё остальное. ""О,взрыв,о, пошлая неуместная шутка,о,взрыв,о,пошлая неуместная шутка..."" и это происходит бесконечно. На это просто нудно смотреть, лучше пойти поспать - больше пользы.Итог: не рекомендую.",0
318,"In the wake of widespread criticism of the second live action Transformers movie, Revenge of the Fallen, director Michael Bay admitted dissatisfaction with the screenplay and blamed it on the writers' strike. So what's the excuse this time? If anything, the script for Transformers: Dark of the Moon is worse than that of its predecessor. In the future, maybe Bay should abandon using a screenwriter altogether and just fill up 90 minutes with disconnected images of robo-carnage. That would serve two purposes: eliminate the need to watch actors embarrass themselves trying to outshine the hardware and elide excruciating dialogue, exposition, and ""character development,"" all of which are inferior to what one finds in the average Pink Panther cartoon. Bay makes the Transformers movies for 14-year old boys. I suspect he's one at heart, which gives him insight into the mindset of his target audience. I remember what it was like to be a 14-year old boy but I'm not sure I would have been more enamored with this movie at that age than I am today. Maybe it would have struck a chord when I was eight. That's when I watched Japanese monster movies which, technological advances in special effects aside, are not all that different from Transformers. In those movies, men in rubber suits pounded on each other. In Transformers and its sequels, CGI robots wreak the same kind of mayhem as Godzilla and friends. The average Japanese monster movie didn't have much of a plot either (aside from the obvious - stomp Tokyo), but it managed to get the job done with about an hour's less screen time. It's pointless criticizing the action/destruction sequences in Transformers 3. Those are the ""money shots"" of this strain of cataclysm porn. People pay for extreme special effects. They want to see these Rockem-Sockem robots mash each other into the ground while Shia LaBeouf yells loudly in the hope that a big voice will compensate for his small stature (at least compared to the Transformers). In the biggest battles, I had some trouble figuring out the difference between the good guys (Autobots) and the bad guys (Decepticons), largely because (a) I'm not a Transformers fan (so the nuances escape me), and (b) things were moving a bit too fast. Aficionados will no doubt chortle at my ignorance. The story, which requires more than a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" to swallow (an infusion of a mind-altering substance would be a good start), begins in the 1960s when men travel to the moon to investigate a crashed Transformers space ship. 40-plus years later, Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen), having belatedly learned of this discovery, takes a salvage team to our nearest celestial neighbor. They return with the dormant remains of Sentinel Prime (Nimoy), who is resurrected by Optimus. Sentinel is the inventor of the Transformers' greatest weapon, which can be used to help or destroy humanity. The Autobots champion the former, but the Decepticons, led by a crippled Megatron (Hugo Weaving), have other plans. Old friends, like Sam, Lennox (Josh Duhamel), and Simmons (John Turturro), are joined by new ones, like Mearing (Frances McDormand) and Brazos (John Malkovich), to provide a human face to the resistance movement against the Decepticons as the evil metal creatures use Chicago as their base for an all-out assault on the planet. Bay's flip-flopping on the issue of 3-D has led to widespread speculation about how effectively it is used in Transformers 3. After initially voicing opposition to it, he changed his position after discussions with James Cameron. Transformers 3 employs a mixture of native 3-D and post-production conversion. To his credit, Bay has avoided many of the common missteps, including the most pervasive (murky, muddy images), but there is still motion blur during intense action sequences. The most curious thing about the 3-D, however, is how innocuous it is. In many scenes, the 3-D approach does a remarkably good job imitating 2-D. People wearing the glasses are apt to forget that Transformers 3 is in 3-D not because they're immersed but because the 3-D is so flat and unremarkable. That's more than a little disappointing because the closer a Transformers film can come to an amusement park ride, the better. Transformers 3 is like Transformers and Transformers 2 only bigger, longer, and louder. It's up to each individual to determine whether that holds appeal or is another cause to bemoan what the summer blockbuster has become.",0
322,"This is the best Transformers movie of all time. The plot may not be completely solid but special effects, action sequences and CGI are AWESOME. It is especially good when you watch it in 3-D.",1
326,"Dark of the Moon is the second best Transformers installment in the franchise. Think that's going to get away with a positive score? Well, YOU'RE.... W-R-O-N-G!",0
327,This movie is great! Micheal Bay always has such great effects and the story was good too. The music was outstanding as usual. Definitely worth watching.,1
331,"A great improvement to Revenge of the Fallen, the first half will make you, ehhh, its okay, but on the second half is where it becomes real. If you want robots kick ass this movie will serve just fine.",1
332,In the human part there is a lack of story development that is overwhelming and an insult to who Sentinel Pime is/was all the little story in this movie was pulled out of Mikels ass and doesent hold up whith any of the past lore that this grand franchise has,0
335,"Major Improvement Over 2Dark Of The Moon still has a fairly sloppy script and some stupid moments here and there, But it is a HUGE improvement over Revenge Of The Fallen with a F*CKING AMAZING 3rd act.",1
336,"A cinematic travesty of the lowest order. The CGI is extensive but it's shot so horribly that calling it impressive would be a gigantic stretch. Every single character's existence is akin to nails being dragged across a chalkboard. Yes that last sentence doesn't really make sense, but then again, this movie doesn't either and I don't want to feel like I've put more effort into reviewing this than Michael Bay put into making it.",0
337,"Wow Michael Bay! Are you going to make a film that is decent enough? Nope, it's a Transformers sequel. Even though it's probably the best sequel out of the 4 sequels, it still is dull and a repeat of the original, only worse.And yet the idiots all throw their money at this crap.",0
339,"Transformers Dark of the Moon Has a frantic action, ambitious direction, well-detailed character designer, an epic soundtrack and has impeccable special effects since Avatar, an honest blockbuster",1
340,"Like the first installment, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a perfectly functional blockbuster. The film is certainly overlong and self-indulgent, but it cuts back on toilet humor, has solid performances, and at least tries to have some emotional depth. The action that Michael Bay delivers here is also the best the franchise has seen. The set pieces are truly mind-blowing, and that was enough to keep me locked in for a majority of the runtime.",1
342,"I was unfortunate enough to watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon. It is a muddled, baffling affair that demonstrates just how poor Michael Bay's idiotic series is.",0
343,"I think this was the best of the movies, the story was far better than the previous ones and even better than the later two. I think the whole film was a CGI masterpiece, but all of the explosions soon got to be a little too much, which seems to be a theme with these movies.",1
344,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a much needed improvement over the previous film. The story is convoluted at times and the acting still isn't the best, but this film isn't filled with really dumb humor or racist robots.",1
345,I love this movie a lot there can be cring parts. I hate that they killed off Ironhide. And i don't like that sentinel prime was actually the villain because i just didn't see it coming and he was a prime so he should have been a lot wiser and not as evil,1
346,"this film was easily an Improvement from ""RotF"" and is the Closes thing this franchise gets to a Sequel that's almost as good as the first film. it has a lot of Genuine Emotion and Heart and Action to attract even the most hardcore moviegoers to it's Glory.",1
348,Tf dark of the moon is good film and has pure action i am happy for see tf dotm.,1
351,"Transformers dark of the moon fixes some mistakes of his predecessor ROFT, but it still fails at the human plot.there are so many amazing scenes, not so silly like the last one, it has a good plot, but no an Oscar winner one. Also it keeps making the same mistakes as the previous ones.But if you enjoyed the last two, you will love this one. A summer movie good as the first one.",1
353,"The story started to pick up again in this one. Good action scenes as usual and especially a feast for conspiracy theorist believers. But in the end, we all know that nobody is out of your league if you saved the world twice.",1
354,"Para mim, o melhor Transformers ate agora. a historia dele, me surpreendeu bastante. teve momentos bem chocantes. eu lembro ter ficado imoveu varias vezes durante o filme. eu adorei este filme.",1
355,"It's above average, a little bit boring in the beginning but the last hours were fun.",1
356,"Underrated movie, in my opinion. It's really entertaining, it's visually profound, and it tells a better story than the other ones (maybe on par with the first one)",1
358,"Convoluted, needless, and forgettable action(a lot of it even without a cause) led by atrocious bot designs in a dreadful plot with horrendous characters and a bloated runtime that feeds unethical toxic masculinity and sinfully depicts women as sex objects. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is not even hilariously bad. It's the worst film in existence. The fact that this sexist atrocity ranks higher at the box office than Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is disgraceful. Any male who gave this film money and liked it should be condemned to feeling eternal shame and sorrow for his misogynistic sin. Michael Bay deserves condemnation in the realm of perpetual dis-consolation.",0
359,Easily my favorite transformers movie and one of my favorite movies of all time,1
