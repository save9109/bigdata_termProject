0," Unbelievable! Exceeded all expectations! Thrilling, sad, funny, exciting all in one. This one is for old fan and new to be fan!",1
1," Transformers is a fun, action packed popcorn flick with excellent visual effects and great comedic pacing, but is flawed with a generic script that lacks a serious tone as well as certain complexities that it should",1
2," I think this was a pretty good movie, but i think they should have focused more on the transformers and less on the humans. About 70% of the movie was all about the humans, I mean, come on! Its called transformers, not people. For this I rate it a 7 and not a 9 or 10 which it could have got if showed more interesting content. I also didn't like all of the sexual content. Transformers is a kid thing, so I hate to see it turn into a PG-13 movie. Hopefully Transformers 2 won't be so bad.",1
3," From the very first speech, it was corny as hell. ""Ooh, save the world from the evil robot!"" And megatron, cybertron and all this other crap was just ridiculous. However, the film blended action and humour to make a great watch. It actually made me laugh out loud, especially the scene in the fat computer hacker's house. The action was fast and exciting, showing the US military as well as giant frickin robots engaging each other. It was kinda obvious from the start what was going on - the ""sound"" wasn't really mysterious or anything.",1
4, i put this at about a 9.5 but for this review i will give it a 10. This is a must see movie. Its very entertaining and has great actors and actresses. Its one of my favorite movies of the year,1
5, This is a fun action movie. Its nothing spacial but I should keep you entertained from start to finish. The acting wasn't bad. Shia Labouff's part was acted very well. This movie shows that he is good for more than just comedy. This does have a descent story but what truly makes this movie enjoyable is the action. Its character development was not perfect but that doesn't mean its bad. It was tolerable it was actually quite easy to bare. Transformations look quite good and safistacated. Infact they were so good that I wanted to rewatch the movie and put it in slow mo just to see those transformations. Its understandable why some people don't like this movie. IF you don't like action than you would hate it. But for those of you who are action fans and you want to see somthing get blown up this movie is a must see.,1
7, It's really flashy and the action is non-stop...trademark Bay. But...the shots are too chaotic and the similar design of the Decepticons makes it hard to make out what is going on in the film at times. Instead of resulting in a heightened sense of excitement...it merely induces a serious headache.,1
8, i guess it's cool to be a hater in '07? guess we can't all be autobots...prime would be disappointed in you guys,1
10,"It is not, you should understand, a film for those who seek the solace of art. It is, however, the most straight-up, brain-on-standby, CG-buffed explosion of out-and-out fun the summer has yet delivered. Another of cinema’s great exponents, Alfred Hitchcock, would often despair of certain cinemagoers’ predilection for plot logic. He would ignore the cry of these ‘Plausibles’ and fiddle his books with rollicking suspense. Michael Bay, too, is no friend of the Plausibles, but his trick is to deafen them with ‘Bayhem’ (def: blowing **** up at sunset). Even amongst the geek-lore of sci-fi he remains more concerned with laying waste to LA than a redoubtable internal logic. It shouldn’t startle you to hear that the plot is ludicrous: a box (varying in size from a city block to a handbag — nothing in the movie is capable of sitting still) with the power to reconfigure machines into Transformers (at one witty point a drinks dispenser sprouts mechanoid legs and a cannon that fires cans at people) has ended up on Earth. As, currently, have these opposing gangs of super-robots. First stop is a dumb kid whose great-grandfather’s glasses havethe imprint of a map of the box’s location... Oh, forget it. Listen, good robots fight bad ones and we get in the way. The end. Bay has done himself a real favour casting LaBeouf as the excitable loser about to discover his first car has a big surprise under the hood. He shares the pop-neurotic jabber of a young Woody Allen with Tom Hanks’ steady charisma, a straightforward-looking guy who still shines like a movie star. A smart, natural comedian, he levels the bluntness of this toy story with an ironic bluster. Quite apart from his car growing legs, he’s been fidgety enough about the legs of classmate Mikaela (Megan Fox). Drunkenly lapped up by Bay’s lascivious camera, she still comes with a steel core (it’s not just the cars who’ve got hidden centres): Mikaela’s a whizz with engines, not that boys can get beyond her windshield. In fact, all the girls of the movie come moulded to a geek ideal: stunning and boyishly practical. In one of the overextended subplots we get Australian beauty Rachael Taylor as an NSA computer dweeb cracking the Decepticons’ code. The cast is at its best young: the older actors, notably Jon Voight and John Turturro as governmental stooges as slow on the uptake as many a parent might be, hammily herk and jerk as if undergoing their own internal shake-up. The film is least sure when mustering global peril, testing the waters of inference with an attack on an American military base in . The first suspects are the Iranians, and along the way there’s a few spry digs at the Bush administration, but any politicising is swiftly reduced to a potty super-Secret Service known as Sector Seven who’ve got Megatron in a deep freeze inside the Hoover Dam, and the film gets on with its juvenile doctrine of daft punk. As the ’bots show up for a big showdow in humanville, soldiers spilling about like ants, a nonsense/genius tribute to old monster-movies, it’s all about the Sturm und Drang of pure action. It’s a dream-clatter of robot-on-robot war to drive Craig Charles to drugs. On old Orson’s level — “big toys attacking smaller toys” — it truly delivers. It’s a shame, then, that Michael Bay can’t help being Michael The script may have rubbery legs, but the action is rock-hard. The surprise is the lightness of touch: treat as a comedy for best results.",1
12,"Remember the first time you saw Jurassic Park? Fourteen years ago, it was unlike anything that’d come before it. Special effects had brought prehistory to life, with warmth and wit bonuses amid the scaly carnage. Fast forward to 2021. Pension for some, kids for others, robots for all. You’ll sit there with your super-sleek cyber-phone, call up an old pal and say, “Do you remember the first time we saw Transformers?” Fourteen years on, it will be remembered as 2007’s jaw-dropper. Special effects have brought your childhood to life, humour and humanity bonuses amid the metallic carnage. A marriage of bombast and brain – director Michael Bay and exec producer Steven Spielberg – only time will tell how much influence the Beard had over the Bad Boy. An LA street battle, decimation ruling supreme? Pure Bay, as his exhilarating highway chase from The Island is vamped up with office block-sized mechanoids. The family squabbles in the Witwicky home of Sam (Shia LaBeouf), where he hides aliens from his parents? Sheer ET Spielberg. It’s a dichotomy shaping the whole film; one extended vehiclenoid money shot, spliced with a human peril drily summed up by LaBeouf: “I bought a car... turned out to be an alien robot.” Plot-wise, just ride with it. Plausibility be damned. The set-up’s brief: “Before time began there was a cube… Some wanted it for good, some for evil,” guffs the opening A–Z voiceover of how the Allspark (that life-giving cube, kids) wound up on Earth. The gist? The Autobots (goodies, on their way) must stop the Decepticons (baddies, already here) before they find it. The key to where the said Allspark is was imprinted on a pair of eyeglasses belonging to Archibald Witwicky who – back in the 1800s – stumbled upon Megatron (a nasty piece of work). The specs are now on eBay, with Archie’s descendent Sam having decided to hock them to buy a car… Robots aside LaBeouf is the star, impressing in two very different double acts. First there’s his sentient car Bumblebee, sent to protect Sam from the Decepticons. It’s the sort of car that plays ‘Sexual Healing’ when its owner’s looking to pick up the marvellously bendy Mikaela (Megan Fox, the pic’s hot-panted heroine). Touching in, yep, an ET sort-of-way, man and machine build a believable bond… A bond that LaBeouf’s second sparring partner, Agent Simmons (John Turturro), is eager to break. A member of super-secret agency Sector Seven, Turturro has a ball, spouting increasingly deranged one-liners (“Criminals are hot!”). Taking itself as seriously as any film based on a toy line should, it’s only old favourite Optimus Prime who falls victim to tone, his dull do-gooder struggling next to sidekick Ironhide’s snarl. (“The parents are irritating. Can we take them out?”) For every drop of heart and hilarity, though, there’s a giant metal fist, a mid-air shape-shifting skirmish or the cheer-stoking sequence where Autobots arrive in meteors. This is the stuff of pop legend over 20 years in the making, played out by boys on their bedroom floors. This is Bay’s territory and as special effects go, the robots are as “What the…?” as the Jurassic dinos. Flawless. However – peculiarly for a man whose films invariably clock in at the bum-killing mark – you’re left wanting more. The best film Bay’s made, it’s also his second shortest. In a summer of sequels full of worlds we know, the brevity of Transformers’ opening scenes leaves little time to settle, turning sidestories such as that of hacker Maggie (Rachael Taylor) into awkward diversions with many drifting off before saying bye-bye. But such complaints are piffle in a film blessed with an extraordinary sense of fun. It’s even possible to forgive the godawful sub-Linkin Park theme seemingly tossed together on a PS2 music generator. What’s more – if you’re looking for it – there’s Spielbergian redemption at play too, a childlike outlook suggesting an extraterrestrial attack is exactly what the world needs to heal our wounds. As the Decepticons strike, the US blames Iran, North Korea… But it’s not our war, it’s something bigger. We are, as Prime tells Megatron while hanging off a crumbling building and changing from a lorry, “a young species, much to learn.” We’re primitive folk in need of a unifying event to help us forget our earthly woes. This will do. The sense of occasion is undeniable as Bay, Spielberg, Shia and peerless special effects fashion what should be the hit of the summer. The start flitters, but this is a rare film that leaves you itching for more. Roll on the sequels.",1
13,"While not better than the original series, it still remains a fun and enjoyable movie. I do agree that things need to be improved. Like megan fox""s acting, why was she in this movie. She was so boring and uninteresting. Why did bumblebee pee, just why. And megatron only being in like 30 minutes of the movie. But what I liked about the movie was that the action is great. Peter cullun as optimus is still a triumph. The humor is sometimes funny. The autobot and decepicon design are a 10 out of 10. Optimus looks badass as a semi truck with flames. Bumblebee looks cool as a camaro, and the others all got great designs. Overall, it's a movie I enjoyed.",1
15,"I had a lot of fun with this movie and it's a shame that every movie after this was horrible,not only is it cool to look at and not only does the action look great,but it's pretty funny which is shocking for a Michael Bay film however the human cast are what ways this movie down and if this was just focused on Transformers it could of been a great film. But if you want to see a Transformers film watch this film and you can probably skip the other ones.",1
16,"Excellently balanced among humanity and complex visuals, Michael Bay's Transformers is a surprisingly efficient (and truly impressive) manner to bring back our classic characters to theaters.",1
17,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Megan Fox, Shia Labeouf, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are jut amazing in this. The plot is outstanding and so much different to all the movies out there.",1
18,"It was a fun, action-packed movie. Bay is an excellent visualist, the movie is packed with jokes. The movie should have focused less on humans and more on Transformers, though. The Autobots stole the show in every scene they appeared in.",1
19,"transfomrers is live action film, it has optimus and is autobots who are live action robots they must find a cube before the murderous megatron, who has vengeance on autobots, watch transformers 2007.",1
20,"Is a decent movie of action you probaly have a great time seeing this movie, and is a good adaptation of the original show. PD:A Autobot dies...cofcofcof Jazz.",1
21,"Filme süresinden giriş yaparak devamını getirmek istiyorum. 2 saat 30 dakikalık süresiyle başta insana ""sonra mı izlesem acaba?"" diye düşündürtmüyor değil. Aksiyon filminde bu kadar süreyle ne yapacağız diye düşünebilirsiniz ki başta bende böyle düşündüm. Yılların geç kalınmışlığıyla birlikte filmi başlattım ve izlemeye koyuldum. Şunu söylemeliyim ki film gerçekten çok iyiydi. Savaş sahneleri çok iyiydi ve görseller muhteşemdi. Karakterlerin hepsi çok iyi iş başarmışlar. Normalde böyle filmlerde, amerikan askeri görmeyi falan sevmem. Hollywood'un saçmalıkları olarak görüyordum ama Hızlı ve Öfkeliden tanıdığım Tyrese Gibson yine çok iyi oyunculuğunu konuşturmuş ve az gözükmesine rağmen, filme mükemmel katkı sağlamış. Megan Fox için diyecek bir şey yok, sadece sussa 2 saat yine Megan Fox'u izleyebilirim. Harika bir detay. Her neyse daha fazla uzatmanın da anlamı yok ama arşivinizde kesinlikle bulunması gereken bir film.",1
22,"A great mix of story, action, and comedy. They started with a great story, funny characters, and great CGI for the Transformers. They held the story for so long, and in a great way. The ending was full of action, but it was hard to focus on what was happening. Overall it was amazing, and worth a watch.",1
23,"A fun, guilty pleasure, which is still the best in the series (which isn't saying much). An enjoyable flick but filled with Michael Bayisms, such as stereotyping and sexualisation.",1
24,"I'm sorry to say this(not really), but this is probably the only good Transformers movie out of all of them.It's well made and has great jokes. But the sequels suck.",1
25,"This movie is amazing, loved this movie when i was a kid and still do. This movie has great special effects, a good written story. Everything is perfect with this movie.",1
26,Its a good way to start the transformers franchise ! but the problem was that they focused on the humans instead of the transformers! also this movie was funnny and exciting.,1
27,"Transformers is in now way a great film. The characters are bland, the acting isn't great, and the story is all over the place. But this film has amazing CGI, great action sequences, great music, and an amazing villain, Megatron, played by the amazing Hugo Weaving.",1
28,"No, it is not a smart movie, or a well written one, but this movie certainly has it's goods, and one can hardly deny it is fairly entertaining.The goods were pretty obvious. Stunning visuals, brilliant editing, mind-blowing set pieces, say about mister Bay what you will, he has always had an eye for the visual. And this is an absolute plus to all his work, basically. But we can also state that Bay's previous work, with a few exception, was nonetheless fairly disappointing. Transformers went further than just the visual shebang.The movie had a good sense of humor too. It was clear that everyone knew that one can hardly take a few car robots seriously, and so no one didn't. Which is a good thing. It made the movie one hell of a lot funnier. The actor's were cool too. Shia LaBouf is a great lead role, John Turturro, John Voight, Anthony Anders and others had really cool side roles, and they made the movie worthwhile.The only downs were the ridiculousness that often crawled onto the screen, of course fault to the slightly preposterous script. Usually I cringe with issues like these, but aforementioned points somehow made the movie awfully amusing. A great watch, especially in the cinemas, but maybe somewhat less entertaining to watch on a TV. be warned",1
29,"The only transformers film from the franchise that does the characters true justice, the action are unquestionably breath taking but Michael Bay always seem to focus on the VFX rather than the screenplay.",1
32," I saw transformers in an Imax theatre, which made the special effects extra special though your neck gets tired of looking back and forth. The movie was relative to the cartoon back in the day but it wasn't completely true to it's roots in a few ways. The original Transformers came out before the internet was invented and in the movie, the alien robots said they used it to get all the information about earth. Shia Labeouf's charector was tracked down through ebay so i'm sure it's not the same plot though I don't remember what the plot was.",1
33,"Michael Bay's Blockbuster ""Transformers"" has everything lock-n-loaded for the summer year; sexy chicks, transforming CGI vehicles, and explosions!!!",1
35,"This live-action adaptation of the TV shows and the toy franchise tells the story about the battle between the autobots and the decepticons as they search for the AllSpark, a device so powerful that can turn mechanics into robots. When it lands on earth, Optimus Prime and the other autobots meet a boy named Sam Witwicky and seeks his help along with his girlfriend Mikaela to find the AllSpark and put an end to the decepticons once and for all.I saw the trailers for this movie, but I have missed my chances of seeing it in theaters. So, I waited to get it on DVD and viola! I now have the movie and I was excited when it met my expectations.Michael Bay did really well on his directing and the storyline was well-paced together. The cinematography and casting were great, even Shia Lebeouf and Megan Fox's performances were so good and they make a great screen couple. The Witwicky parents weren't given enough screen time, but I think they did pretty well with their comedic moments. The actors that voiced the autobots and the decepticons turned out to be great and they are just like the ones from the TV shows.The humor was so hilarious, and the best humor part was the pee joke which I really laughed during the movie.The action scenes were very darn good. I think that Michael Bay was a fan of action scenes from the TV show and did very well at shooting them just to make it look real.The CGI effects from the Industrial Light and Magic company was that good and it fits well for the action sequences.The music score was riveting and very cool and it gave some emotion in the whole movie.I am going to point that there aren't any negative things to say about this movie and the 57% rating is a little bit low for my expectations, so I'm going to give this pretty much a higher rating.4.5/5 stars",1
36," Pure escapism, total in-your-face intense action from beginning to end. It is a fantastic movie because it makes you feel like a child with a new toy again.",1
38," Mr. Tea, your IQ's dropping steadily because you rated this film so low! I saw this 2 times and the second time it was as action-packed, entertaining and thrilling as the first time (which by the way was amazing)! Everything you would want in a movie",1
39,"I loved this movie, it was fun, action packed, adrenaline pumping, it was a blast!!!!  If you want to see a really fun summer action movie, look no further than Transformers!!!",1
40," Full of semi-confusing action sequences, a down-to-earth lead, and surprisingly funny. Transformers is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while.",1
41," Transformers is good movie with amazing special effects and a good cast. I wish the fight between optimus prime and megatron was better thought but, overall good movie.",1
42, This is a film made by Michael Bay for Michael Bay and does nothing but please people like Michael Bay. Fans will go wild for the robots and action lovers will melt over the dazzling visuals and action scenes. If there is anything wrong with this picture is the fact that it runs a half hour too long and grows rather mindless near the end.,1
43,This is the movie that introduced me to the amazing world of Transformers. Awesome action scenes and a great sci-fi movie overall. Thank you Michael Bay!,1
44,"Wow, amazing movie, really, when I watch the trailer of Transformers I think in two things: The first: Amazing effects, with an amazing story. The second: Other old cartoon to appear in the big screen, and the good part is some of the first. The autobots and decepticons are awesome, have much details, and all this explosions, and battles are epic, the characters be good, but some irritant [yes Sam]. The story is really good, not excellent, is good, have some interesting moments. But the rest is normal, any new. Transformers is a good movie, the better of this saga.",1
45,"Nothing to expect from a blockbuster summer movie that people are ups and arms about, except some fun action sequences, with visuals, a feast for your eyes.",1
46,"Transformers is a fun explosions movie.Autobots have never been more likable and the humans for once they seem to work here.I like Sam,and Shia's portrayal of him was awesome.Everything looked amazing with the visuals and while sometimes it does get a little to noisy it still works.",1
48,"Ya ví 'Transformes' en su día ya que soy un gran aficionado a este tipo de películas, sé que son malas, pero me lo hacen pasar muy bien. Es una película que es mejor verla y disfrutar lo bien hecha que está, los enormes efectos especiales que tiene y lo bien rodada que están las escenas de acción que tiene. El guión no hay por donde cogerle ni tiene sentido ni desarrolla bien a los personajes, de los cuales hay muchos desaprovechados y la resolución de muchas situaciones es cuanto menos sospechosa. A pesar de ello, la película cumple en relativa medida que tiene que es el de montar un gran espectáculo visual.En definitiva, es una película mala pero que me encanta como todo este tipo de películas. Un 7.",1
49,"MICHEAL BAY DOES IT AGAIN!!! ... make another bad movie that is. you know your a bad director when people write songs on how bad your movies are ( see pearl Harbor) . id like too ad that im a huge fan of transformers from when i was a kid. i grew up waching the original tv show . i had very high hopes for this film . i even gave bay the benifite of the doubt . i thought he made 1 good movie with The Rock . surely the sun can smile on a dumb dogs ass twice . Alas he failed and Failed very epicly . lets start with the plot or lack there of or should i say lack of the main charicters you know the Transformers . this is there film after all not the  shilo the stuttering prick movie . the transforers dont hardly apear in there film infact i think the dog in it has more lines then they do. they seem to be there only to be brought out to beat the hell out of each other inbetween shilo's stuttering , bad jokes , and him drooling over megan fox . which really makes the case giant transforming robots are more believable then that dip stick getting a girl like that . i mean giant transforming robots i can believe , shilo getting megan ... no. i know its alot of money to make the transformers come to life and all but is it really hard just to have them stand there and talk and get some charicter devolpment? i guess for bay it is not when theres **** to blow up and bad jokes to tell. also the changing of the over all plot in the tv show the transforers come to earth to serch for energy to save there dying world in the movie its coming to find the all spark . i mean really is the first option not doable? they couldnt stick abit more to the source material? this is why 99% of any thing made from a tv show , comic or video game sucks . why bother even making it if you are just gona abandon the source ? just go make some thing els simular and call it some thing els. people like to point out the how awsome the action is and its not bad atleast what you can actaully make out what the hell is going on . bay for some reason likes to do close ups . so close infact most of the action is to chaotic to make out what the hell is going on. the only 2 good things i can say about this film . 1 the special effects are pretty and 2 using peter cullen as the voice of optimus prime . every thing els is crap . im in shock spielberg sighned off on this . i think he must have gone insane",0
50," Absolutely stunning. A real boy's movie - big boys toys, action, and sexy graphics all through it.",1
51," Transformers was about a prototype of American dream perfect family icon, in classic style of Greek mythology, wise parents, smart children, and heroic robots fighting evil robots antagonists on earth. As soon as the film begins, you notice suddenly that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the original franchise, starting from the original music tune from the cartoon is simply missing substituted by some unoriginal boring score. If something didn't made a lot of sense in the original comic book, children were always wondering, how so tiny cars were able to transform suddenly in gigantic robots , maybe by magic ? But this film is something completely insane, instead of any good element of original franchise, we see dysfunctional Jewish family with idiotic parents, retarded children, and the most amazing thing, a real loser kid engaged with a gorgeous female who in real world is only possible to meet in Hollywood, or at Hooters.",0
52," Wow, maybe I should forget about anything in a movie except explosions and giant robots... Maybe story, character, and acting are unnecessary whenever you make everything giant and explode, that is what makes a good movie. Hell, instead of transformers you should have called the movie ""Giant Robots and Explosions"" So the audience has no possibility of getting confused that there is any other redeeming qualities of this movie. Man, I have got movies all wrong... The original trilogy of Star Wars wasn't good because of the Story, characters, or plot it was because of the explosions and giant robots.",0
53," These types of movies are simply quick dollar exploitation, to make art into a form of prostitution for all the drones in the world.",0
54," I expected to see a movie about giant robots. Not a very poor John Hughes knock-off. 15 minutes of screen time for Megatron... poor. It's not as if Michael Bay is known for his great characterization, but that's what your getting in Transformers.",0
55," The kid inside of me loved this movie. But then again, I was pretty stupid when I was a kid.",0
56," Second worst movie of 2007. The only reason it is second worst is it's rip-off movie, ""Transmorphers"".",0
57,"This is the lowest form of crap you can find in a video store.I grew up in the 80s and loved the cartoons so like most people if i had seen a half decent film i would have embraced it.The CGI is good and thats it.Micheal Bay is not a comic or a writer yet he has a go at it and fails miserably.He has taken the root of most action directors insisting that a good action movie needs a bad script.Geekey guy falls for hot girl who dosent recognize him until he saves her life,this story has been told time and again.This isnt the movie transformers desereved.",0
59, Anyone who is trashing the movie is a pompous ass with a stick shoved up there. Geez why can't some people just kick back and have a good time? This was one of the best times I have ever had in a movie theater. This is what summer movies are all about!!!,1
60," All I can say is awesome, totally awesome!",1
61," This is a real action movie! This is the type of movie for anyone who loves action movies. Transformers fans, you are bound to love this cuz I know I did!",1
62," Overrated. Hired it at blockbuster...what a waste of money. I was expecting much better. There's barely any story and they overdo the action which is like 90% of the movie. Constantly has shooting, blowing up which really gets boring half way through the movie. Some of the actors/actresses were terrible. Would only appeal to those that are 'wowed' at special effects and nothing else.",0
63," This movie is sheer fun. The theater erupted everytime a new Transformer was introduced or an epic battle completed. By far, this movie has the best CGI of all time. Watched the pre-screening, now can't wait for it to arrive in theaters to see it again. INCREDIBLE!",1
64," Growing up, I loved the ""Transformers"" cartoons. So, when the theatres started showing trailers for this film, I got very excited. After all, what guy doesn't want to see a movie where robots kick each other's butts? The dialogue was a bit on the chessy side, but, come on, who goes to see a summer action flick and expects Shakespeare-level dialogue? The visual effects in this movie were amazing. Shia LaBeouf gives the best performance of his career, but, that's not saying much. The rest of the cast are absolutely perfect. I just have one thing to say about Megan Fox: Schwing!!!!!!!!!!!",1
65," This movie has it all, comedy, action some romance and it all blends well together, this movie is great!",1
66," Just like my last name, this movie is cool!",1
67, Absolutely amazing.,1
68," I give it an ace because although it is an action movie (and it had A LOT of action) there is no script, there is quite a lot of stereotyping (especially in regards to black people) and the dialogues give me the impression that I'm watching a 'who's the biggest smartass' contest and who",0
69," I'm sorry, but I will have to agree with Ben L. Micheal Bay did an absolute hack-job on this movie..needless to say I was very disappointed. So often in present day cinema it seems we have a ever increasing number of movies with billion dollar budgets for special effects and ABSOLUTELY no story...what sover. I was fortunate to have watched the original transformers animated movie. I left there as a young boy with my hair standing up and my mouth wide open...I loved it. The story, the drama....the soundtrack to that movie was also incredible and complimented the scenes to build mood, such as sadness, danger laughter and uncertainty. The transformers as a whole were given personalities which were developed in detail with MULTIPLe sub-plots which kept it like a nonstop roller coaster...never a dull moment. However. In the recent 2007 Transformers, there was way too much human screen time, which I thought was a big part of the problem, along with a non-existent sound track...which seemed like the same exact score for every scene in the movie. Too much corn ball humor(which wasn't funny to begin with) took all credibility away, coupled with the cliche' lines and Micheal Bay glorifying the military....which was thoroughly outclassed and out-gunned, but somehow always manage to save the day! I can't throw believability out of the window. This movies was about HUMANS who happened to be around transformers and nothing more. The transformers were inconsequential. This movie if done right could've been great, really...but since every movie is out to make blockbuster hits...the art of story telling has been forgotten or looked over for ticket sales....bottom line. I will say that I enjoyed the very beginning with the decepticon blackout destroying the military base in quartar...and some of the many scirmishes between Star scream and the associated autobots and devastator with Jazz etc...the sound effects were great..from the machines guns firing from devastator...otherwise everything else was forgotten...sadly...hopefully Micheal Bay will look at some glaring weaknesses from this first debacle and make adjustments in story and transformer character development for the second transformers....and lose those humans!",0
70," For all people that gave it less than 7 you guys are the most idiotic people in the world. This movie had everthing romance, comedy, action and the best cast crew you could think of. This movie even made me cry: the part when they took BumbleBee away from Sam Whitwicky. I absouletly loved ""Transformers"" best movie. Hope they make a part 2.",1
71," After watching Transformers a second time I still find nothing redeeming in it. It's a typically embarrassing Michael Bay action flick with all the stuff you've come to expect: explosions, car chases, borderline anorexic ""just one of the guys"" female lead, terrible script, worse acting, and it's just too long. This is not the fun cartoon of the 1980s. This is new-age, embarrassingly serious, violence-glorifying, military fist-pumping, emotionally vapid, humorless, glossy no-substance cinema. Avoid at all costs. Truly one of the poorest films ever created.",0
72," Ouch. That's all I can say about this failure. To be honest I didn't expect much of it to begin with, but I had no inkling as to what I was in for. The writers fail. Bay fails. Shia shows the most promise but fails. And my oh my does Megan Fox fall flat on her alien face.",0
73," Terrible writing and god awful acting while the entire audience is waiting for the fifteen minute increments of action. Sound familiar? No, it's not a porno, it's Transformers. Michael Bay is the most talentless and moronic person ever to set foot in California and should stick his head in a magic bullet.",0
74, Year life transformers. Best 80's to current time movie.,1
75, Not a very good movie.,0
77, Yeah was pretty good. Much better than I thought it would be. Certainly much better than Bayes prior stuff.,1
78, I must say this is one of the biggest blockbusters this year Nothing can be compared with this masterpiece created for fun and such excitement Michael Bay made a great job with this Exact measure of comedy action SFX effects I dont know American cinematography should be proud with this also this one of the spielberg's childs so its worth every cent Watch it u wont regret it,1
80," Aside from the boring first half of the movie and the human cast that we don't really care about, Transformers is shown exactly the way it should be. This is the definitive moment in Transformers history, and it is no doubt the most fun movie to watch in 2007. Hopefully, Bay makes TF 2better, though.",1
81," Let's hear it for Mr. Bay, his Playmate posse (Fox??? & Taylor), the ADHD kid (LaBeouf) as well as the bodies at work and minds on vacation (Gibson & Duhamel)! Buttom line: BENEATH CONTEMPT.",0
82, This is a film not to be missed. It has lots of transformin' action. Great fight scenes and special effects.,1
83," I honestly feel bad for the people who liked this movie. As a huge Transformers fan from childhood, I was willing to hope for the best with this film despite the inclusion of Michael Bay. Since when does a movie aimed squarely at kids have such sitcom-raunchy humor? I knew I hated the movie the second Bumblebee peed on John Tuturo. Secondly, when I go to see a movie called Transformers, I fully expect to see the Transformers, not a strained love story with a cameo by the Transformers. I mean, Optimus Prime shows up over an hour into the film and Megatron over two! Also, this is another sad case of changing things from the original story for no reason and, as usual, the new version just doesn't make any sense. Why make it harder on yourself as a writer? This is a film version of a fourth of July fireworks show. The only difference is the hot dogs are way more expensive.",0
85," This movie, starring Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, might be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Partially because, come on, it has Megan Fox in it. The combination of the special effects, a good, realistic plot, and great acting is one of the reasons for over $708 million in the box offices alone. Shia Labeouf plays a teenager who has just gotten his first car, which is a piece of crap. Little did he know that the car was really a highly sophisticated alien robot. The car was not alone, however, and soon the movie becomes a quintessential battle between good and evil. This intertwines the fates of Fox, and Labeouf. The battle includes multiple twists and just when you think you know how it is going to end, something happens that you didn't expect. I would definetly recommend this movie to people who enjoy action, and Megan Fox .",1
86," Ben S. has no idea what he's talking about at all. The cartoon movie is amazing and at least a hundred times better then this embarrassment. It tries so hard to be funny but isn't at all. In the cartoon, optimus prime is BA but in this one he's not cool at all. It was depressing. I hate michael bay. He ruined all my childhood memories.",0
87," Worst action movie I've seen all year. You know the movie is bad when you have Anthony Anderson in it. Top it off with Bernie Mac and Tyrese and you get a masterpiece of crap. Did these guys write the script? I swear I thought I saw Eddie Griffin made a cameo in the film, who's another overrated comedian/actor. This is not a racial thing. Jamie Foxx is one of my top favorite actors. Good thing he was smart enough to be in the film. Also, I like Michael Bay's previous works (Bad Boys, the Rock, Armageddon), but this is horrible. I think Shia is a great actor, but even he couldn't save this film. I hope not to see Marlon Waynes as the comic relief in Transformer 2.",0
88," I don't know why this movie got any bad ratings. the effects were groundbreaking, it was funny, and of course it was more than meets the eye.",1
89, In the immortal words of Bart Simpson - this movie simultaneously sucks and blows. The effects are good but the story suuuucckks!,0
90," If I could vote 11 I would. This move brought life to the Transformers to which I held so dear. I cried the precise moment Jazz died. This movie made me seriously consider Chevy and of course I already like Mountain Dew. I'll love you always Transformers movie, Michael Bay you rock! I can't wait for the high-def version so I can watch it every day for the rest of my life.",1
91," Transformers is a crisp, focussed, interesting, intense awsome action/sci-fi movie with a touch of humor. This movie is very good, the script is flawless, but the direction is amazing, director Michael bay is totally fit for this concept, and Steven Spielberg, well he sure still does know how to make a good movie. The best movie of the year by far.",1
93, Hear that? That's the sound of IQs dropping steadily all over America. Sounds a little bit like thunder.,0
95, Excellent movie. First movie this year that has lived up to its high expectations. Couldn't be more happier with the CGI.,1
96," This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but by god it's close. And while I've seen a few that are worse, I've never seen one I hated more than this abomination. Everything from the horrible robot designs to the insipid plot to the wretched directing was awful beyond reason. Michael Bay is the worst director in Hollywood, hands down, and Spielberg should be ashamed for picking him to direct this. Most wasted opportunity ever.",0
97," although a very good action film, this is another kind of mess mike bay would be in. the transformers CGI is kind of a mess and the lack of characteristic of Witwicky family. I had to say a lot of good action there but not mike bay best.",0
98, Psh.. For those of you who thought this movie sucked I'm VERY surprised! It had its action/humor In it. Megan fox IS hot As well as Shia Labeouf I thought the actors were Great! It made perfect sense there wasn't a time where you were confused!!! Shia Is such an amazing actor im IN love with his humor and his movies!!! I give transformers a 10. Cant wait for part 2 to come out!!!!,1
99," This movie, starring Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, might be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Partially because, come on, it has Megan Fox in it.

100, very nice movie...i wish trere will be Transformers 2.,1
101," It's amazing! on VFX, the Story, everything! You have to give it a shot... don't be narrow-minded.",1
103," Being a fan of the original cartoon (Generation1), I just can't hate on this movie as much as others try to influence me to. I felt it was a great adaptation of the series into film. I also enjoyed Bay's vision of what the Transformers should've been. Most of all I enjoyed the fact that I it made me a diehard fan all over again. If I had to complain about anything, was the lack of the Porsche for Jazz and Megatron and Starscream not having such a critical and deep role in the movies. The cartoons were awesome at making us emotionally attached the Autobots and decepticons. The only ones I felt that way about were Bumbole Bee and Prime. Superb effort on this flick though!",1
105, Tons of CGI Hot Chick Lame Lead Character Moronic Humor Infantile Dialog and Plot In Short: Entertainment for the Borderline Deficient!,0
106,"Special Effects 9/10, Action 9/10, Score 10/10, Cinematography 9/10, Sound Design 9/10, Film Design 9/10, Characters 7/10, Acting 7/10, Story 7/10, Humor 7/10, Pacing 6/10,Basically it depends what your looking for, if you are a teen or want a really stylised action film you will probably love it, if you are an adult and want a deep sci-fi story you will probably hate it. The best scenes are 10/10 the worst scenes are 4/10, under no circumstances should you believe anyone that gives this film a score in the red, there are several films I absolutely hate but I rate them fairly for its audience. People that are giving this lower than 6 seem to be very bitter people in general. Not only that but they probably believe that District 9 has a very good story when infact its just a bunch of semi-suggestive anti apartheid images superimposed over some terrible jokes.",1
107,"This film is **** **** Nothing at all good was used from the original Transformers, basically someone got the liecnse and created a half arsed peice of **** just to make money. The plot is about a big cube, there are no transformers untill half way in, and then they have ****e ones, even then they don't **** act anyhting like the characters should, they hardly **** talk, the kid who stars in this is a little piece of piss i saw in a ****ty kids program when i was younger, he is awefull, i don't know why but i look at him and his stupid ass smug face and i can imagine he just stinks of farts. I hope he dies. The 80s animated film is over 9000 times better.",0
108,I do not understand why people like this piece of **** It's almost pure bull****. But the second one took care of that. This moive is so goddamn insulting. We were supposed to care about that robot? What the **** Mr. Bay? **** you up your stupid ****ing AIDS-ridden ass. I just ****ing hate you. Stop making movies.,0
113,It's pretty bad. Far too convoluted and messy for something with such a simple plot at heart. It's shot interestingly until you realize that you can't make heads or tails of anything you see on screen other than Megan Fox's cleavage.,0
114, If you are looking for a real simple story line amazingly executed. Here you go... The computer generated imagery is phenominal.,1
115, Awesome! Never thought it could be made into film. Makes 40-ish adults like me drool like a pockmarked kid. The viewers applauded after the screening.,1
116,I can't believe the comments! This is the reason a no-talent like Michael Bay still has a job. We wanted to see The Transformers..not a dorks journey towards adolescent puberty. CGI was the only thing worth watching.,0
117," This had the perfect mix of theme, feel, and dialogue of the oldschool show, and the action, pace, humor, and effects of todays big-budget movies. For me this movie was perfect in what it was; a movie about giant robots coming to earth and dealing with humans while searching for the key to possibly rebuilding their home. Oh, and blowing a whole lot of stuff up.",1
118, A truly epic movie to be seen! One of the best movies of the year alongside the 300!,1
119," A great flick for all, with good humor, a clear line between good guys and bad guys, awesome action sequences, and a feel good essence.",1
121," seriously - why do some of you rate this so low? 0, 3, 4? that's ridiculous. i wish i could meet some of you in the street so i could f***in bury you into the ground instead of you bad-mouthing this movie. maybe it's the little kid in me trying to defend what memories i cherish about this franchise, but for you people to say it's deserving of such a low score is stupid. some comments from users: ""Since when is Optimus a Peterbuilt?"" ""This film is an Incredibly juvenile piece of garbage."" ""..a very, very, very bad movie.""he ALWAYS has those stupid F**king 1 liners.. For example in this film ""You shoot, i'll drive""."" these are amongst a few. think about what you just wrote - one liners? well, let's see: you are a human trying to communicate with a robot from another world while in the middle of a gunfight. did you expect to hear a complete dissertation explaining what what the alien should do? or should she just drive and assume that the robot would know what she had in mind? i know it may have sounded kinda cheesy, but be a little more understanding to the situation. next - ""juvenile piece of garbage?"" whoever said this should be shot in the head. no SH*T. key word: juvenile. did you think the target demographic of this film would be the same as that of say The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Letter from Iwo Jima, Pretty Woman, or Eternal Sunshine? the point i'm trying to make is OBVIOUSLY Transformers was made with intent to draw in people who gave a damn about the series 20 years ago up until today, NOT for older people looking for real-life scenarios. take it as it is - a movie about robots in disguise. if your brain limits your acceptance of a creative idea such as robots changing into cars, then sorry - you're already off on the wrong foot. quote ""bad acting...no plot"" as i see so many people criticize Bay for his work, i wonder what kind of movie you people were expecting. no plot? good robots try to defend bad robots from taking over earth, and in doing so inadvertently involve a boy going through adolescent stages. COME ON WTF! you don't see the story? if you do a little bit of research, you'll also notice that Spike, in the original cartoon series, was also involved in a romantic affair so for you who disapprove of the love concept in the movie, this may have been a reason to include it. among other whines from users is product placement. seriously, if you were so busy looking for logos throughout the movie, you probably didn't want to see it to begin with and wanted to just pass time. do us all a favor and just shut your trap, keep your dumb comments to yourself, and just move along. so you saw ""GMC"" or ""Pontiac."" big deal, grow up. did it bother you that much that it ruined the movie? cry me a river. lastly for people complaining about what vehicles were used, i somewhat agree (ex. bumblebee not a bug), but you have to keep in mind that they were trying to blend in with times. honestly, i'm glad bumlebee wasn't a beetle because that whole car chase with him and barricade would have been weird (beetle vs mustang?). as for the others, optimus was a truck, jazz was a sportscar, (i guess, if you consider a solstice sporty?) and starscream was a plane. only possible gripe i can think of for this movie was megatron shouldn't be a plane and jazz should have been a better car. maybe my own comments on others may seem harsh, and for that i apologize, but i refuse to sit there and let a few bad user reports hinder other moviegoers from seeing this film, or let the rating drop considerably. everything about this flick deserves praise, regardless of your previous bias towards Bay. bottom line: no way should this movie be rated lower than a 7 (green = good on this site?). if you do, i'd like to know what kind of movies you DO approve of. constructive criticism should always be accepted, but saying a movie is completely worthless and not saying why doesn't do anything to help",1
122," If your hoping to see a thought provoking, soul stirring film...stay home. If you want to see a great summer blockbuster...then go see this movie. I am an old school transformer fan who was terrified of being let down. I was not.",1
123," It loses one point from me due to some of the lame humor (most notably the ""urination"" jokes). Regardless, this is the ultimate summer action flick, a slam-bang-crash parade of ""WOW"" moments that made me feel like a kid again. The CGI work is so convincing, I forgot it was CGI at all. It's the most fun I've had at the movies in a long, long time.",1
125," This movie was amazing. The intensity in which Bay approached this film came through on the big screen. I find some of the negative comments on the internet about this film hilarious. Many people came out of this film saying none of the characters had any progression and that it was a typical Michael Bay film. First of all, this is a movie about gigantic robots that turn into cars and smash/shoot/destroy everything around them -- where is the necessity for character progression? In addition, if this were anything less than a typical Bay film, I would've been disappointed. This movie was an action packed thrill ride that never disappointed. Shia and Megan's chemistry on set was amazing. Bay did a great job of addressing several different characters while managing to get across the storyline. Had this movie been any shorter, we would've been disappointed that he left things out. This movie lived up to every childhood expectation I ever had and I was pleased with the film as a whole.",1
126," Not as bad as reviewed by the pros. It was very humorous (on purpose) throughout, and the storyline keeps with the fun of the original series. While the battle sequences are deadly serious, the characters are all part of the fun storyline and no one takes themselves too seriously in this movie. I would recommend for fun, sit-back-and-enjoy-the-fireworks summer fare. Huge plus if you are old enough to remember the original series, as the characters are all fleshed out perfectly. Relax everyone...the movie wasn't written to earn an Oscar. It's just fun and very cool.",1
127, It's big. It's loud. It's fun. Whats not to like?,1
128," Awsome movie, only complaint: TOO MANY HUMANS!! not enough focus on the Transformers and their inter personal stories. Hopefully they'll fix that in 2",1
129, Another action film that thinks that fast paced editing makes for clever direction. When the plot is as wafer thin as this it hardly seems worth the while to even bother to take notice of the amphetamine fuelled action. Kinda boring.,0
130," I'm beginning to think that people have actually no opinions on this website and just try and go along with what critics say so they think they're right. form your own opinion! this movie was great. better than the more recent spiderman sequel which was one of my least favorite movies of the summer. And thank you, megan fox. i love you!",1
132," Oh. My. God. Transformers is the biggest and 2nd best movie Michael Bay has ever done (I'm partial to Armageddon). The screen is filled with awe-inspiring visuals and there is no lack of intense action to be had. Surprisingly, Transformers isn't just a 2 and a half hour action scene (unlike Live Free or Die hard). The acting and script are surprisingly solid, especially Labeouf's entertaining performance as Sam Witwicky. If there's anything not to like about the film, it's the occasionally balance issue. There are plenty of epic sequences in the film and plenty of humorous ones too (it's a very funny movie), but sometimes the scenes can intertwine, leading to some annoyances. It's kind of hard to find an epic feeling as Sam and his new girlfriend Mikaela (played by the stunning Megan Fox) marveling at the the sighting of Bumblebee in his robotic form when Sam is standing around with a shirt but not boxers. Still, it's a fantastic movie and should not be missed.",1
133," Transformations - AWESOME!! Everything else about this move - awesomely bad. The human characters and story line are nothing more than filler between Transformer battles, and believe it or not, the Transformer battles are few and far between. The attempts at comedy and romance are absolutely abysmal and the script as a whole may set a benchmark for all time worst . In fact, I am not at all convinced there even was a script. Of course you signed up for a movie about giant transforming robots so you may not care about script or story or characters, or anything other than CGI robots - and I was with you on that - unfortunately that eliminates about 90% of the movie because it is mostly filler.",0
134," The CGI was flawless and I wanted to like this movie but it tried painfully hard to be funny and completely failed. Every movie trick in the book was thrown out. The hot 22yo Australian girl who is smarter than the entire US government and military put together ETC ETC ETC ETC ETC. Movies like Aliens were capable of being a kick ass action movie but not insulting the viewers with every mindless movie cliche and painfully mindless pop culture ""funny"" reference. Great job on the CGI and bringing this to life but maybe if the writers/directors didn't treat us like we were 8, it might have been anywhere near decent.",0
135," Garbage. Another piece of crap from Bay. There's bad acting, bad action ""sequences"" (a few missiles are fired and that's it) and no plot. What'd you expect?",0
136, I haven't been that excited wathcing a movie in years. The film is amazing. This is what summer movies are all about!!!!!!,1
137, Great sound! Great voice work for the autobots! As for everything else... oh god... this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.,0
138," I've seen it in Italy. It's so funny! Shia Le Beuf is a Dustin Hoffman type guy, perfectly in part. Cars, Mega robot, hot brainy chicks, jokes, fun dialogues: there's all you can expect from a blockbuster. After three boring sequels, finally the real summer hit. Marco",1
140," Perfect staging with amazing action driven by human drama that is delivered via a solid cast. Humor action special FX, and a perfect rendition of the Transformers to film. The best action movie I've ever seen.",1
141," Worth every penny, and I'm going back tomorrow to see it again!",1
144," Amazing Movie, everyone in the theater cheered through the whole movie, they cheered when optimus prime appeared, they cheered when megatron came alive, and they cheered wildly at the end",1
145," Wow! ...stupendous entertainment for the hot , hot summer break. I waited through 5 power outtages at my local imax to see this thing and it was worth the $12.00 ticket!",1
146," This movie was unbelieveable! It was the best movie I've seen all year. It has great humour and so much action, but best ofd all, it has good acting! Special Effects were stunning and this is definatly a film you must got to see if you 10 or older. Humour is a bit crude for anyone under 10, violence is a bit much for anyone under 10. 9.8/10",1
147,Saw the sneak preview last night and it was amazing. i was blown away from the beginning to the end. the whole crowd was into it and clapping the whole way through. great experience definitely go see.,1
148, looks great!,1
149," Took my 11 and 8 yr old boys to it with my wife. We all loved it, boys said it was the best movie they'd ever seen. My wife and I were surprised - we really liked it too. The actors seemed to be having a really good time making this movie and there were some heartwarming moments, some good comedy, and most of all, non-stop action with some of the coolest CGI I've ever seen. I felt like I'd witnessed the next level of movie craft similarly to how I felt when I saw the Matrix for the first time.",1
152, I find it funny that the critics of publications such as The New York Times and The Onion can't seem to understand that the movie is targeted towards kids and teenage males. Either they were never fond of giant robots or they just forgot how to be a kid. A great movie all around. The cgi effects are worth the price of admission.,1
153," I thought it was awesome. The special effects were amazing. I grew up on the original transformers, so I thought it was ingenious how quickly and smoothly they transformed. I didn't like the sexual humor, which made me give it a 9 instead of a 10.",1
154, It's a Michael Bay movie.....about fighting robots. Anybody who whines about it not having a plot went to see the wrong movie. Don't expect a compelling storyline or major character development. This isn't an art house flick. It's giant robots destroying each other and everything in their wake. And it totally delivers.,1
155," LOVED it. I'm a fan grew up on the cartoon and toys but that doesn't change the fact that it was a fantastic movie. and i know someone will say ya ""FANtastic"" It had that absolute best CGI that is possible out there. it pushed ILM's computers etc to their absolute limits, nothing out there can even come close. HUGE explosions. great car chases ala normal Michael bay. it was funny, more then I expected. I personally think it's one of my new favourite movies. If your a fan you will LOVE IT! if your not a fan you will love it. you owe it to yourself to at least check it out.",1
156," It's really quite simple. If you grew up with the TRANSFORMERS, you are going to LOVE this movie. If you didn't you probably should go see something else. I loved it. ""What this movie needs, though, is more Soundwave!""",1
158," downright awesome. definitely the best movie of the summer, at least so far. Transformers featured some of the most amazing CGI work i have ever seen, and every scene featuring the transformers looked incredible. there were a few low spots, but nothing terribly bad. I've never been a big fan of Shia Lebouf's movies, but in Transformers it seems like he's evolving from another faceless disney star into a more mature and interesting actor. although, for a 2.5 hour movie, there could have been a little more plot/character development from the movie, especially when it came to the Decepticons. they were pretty much just randomly introduced about 3/4 of the way through the movie, and then the big fight began. still, i would definitely go see it again, and cannot wait for the DVD. 9.0 out of 10.",1
159, My Favorite summer movie yet. Great fun. Great action. Michael Bay is slowly redeming himself in my opinion. The Island was good too... oh wait. That was the first movie he did away from Bruckheimer. and now Transformers with spielberg. Hmmm...makes you think a bit don't it?,1
160, the best movie i ever saw,1
161, great,1
162," I loved the action scenes, but as a fan of the series I would have liked to see more relationship between Starscream and Megatron.",1
163," Anyone who give this movie less than a 6 is simply crazy. The plot was simple, easy to follow, and beyond a few minor annoyances entertaining to watch. The acting, again, other than a few odd sequences was also pretty damn good. The action, was borderline excessive, but it was also incredibly fun to experience, because in this movie it is definitely more of an experience than simply watching the film. In the end, this is one of the best action movies of the past 7 years and it is definitely worthy of the phrase ""summer blockbuster"", better than X-Men3 and Superman Returns by leaps and bounds. The whole GM thing is pretty damn ridiculous, meaning it is a ridiculous thing to be upset about. They are called Autobots, they transform into cars, no reason why we need 10 different company logo, just so some internet nerd won't have a conniption. Its called TRANSFORMERS, not William Shakespeare's Transformers, so go into it expecting a big, over the top loud, hell of a good time.",1
164," So much for movie critics huh? I believe that M. Knight Shamalan (however you spell his name) was right to kill a critic on his movie. Wow I wonder if these critics saw the same movie i saw. I have to say that it was it did not leave me wanting. So what they did not give you a detailed background on each and every character. Since when do we go to a movie for a history channel special. Easy plot, good action, funny. I give this movie a 10 yes thats right a 10.",1
165," I think that people trashing this film are missing the point a bit. A movie based on a collection of toys from the eighties is never going to produce a screenplay that will rival the Godfather. It is meant to be a bit of mindless fun and that is exactly what it is. If you let go a little bit and stop expecting it to be a masterpiece and instead treat it as entertainment you will enjoy it. The special effects are absolutely incredible and worth the ticket alone, there are also some surprisingly good moments of humour which dare i say i actually less predicatable than the tripe produced by the highly over rated simpsons movie. Transformers is meant to be simple fun and it is - as long as that is all you want it won't disappointed.",1
167," Utter, utter bilge. I wasn't expecting much, just a few laughs, some impressive effects and exciting action, but it failed to provide any of these. The script is tedious, witless and utterly devoid of charm. The Transformers change from car to robot in the blink of an eye, a total cop out that negates any clever mechanical movement. And the action is unforgivably tedious. Worst of all, it's far, far too long - this is simply a 2hr 30min commercial for American muscle cars and the US military. Massively disappointing.",0
169," 2 1/2 hours of pure Hollywood crap. As a matter of fact, I don't think I ever enjoyed a Micheal Mann movie. Just because it was packed full of ridiculous comic relief and backlot explosions makes it a blockbuster hit? I guess so. This is definitely a movie for the masses.",0
170, It's just fun! seriously.,1
171," This is one of the coolest movies ever. Period. This SUPPOSED TO BE AN ACTION MOVIE and is one of the most bad ass ever made. Whoever says it isn't ,doesn't like action, and shouldn't comment on it at all.",1
172," Loved this movie, can't wait for the DVD. In fact I have it pre-ordered already",1
174," I saw this movie 2 day ago (I'm living in Korea so it comes out sooner) and I thought it was pretty decent. As long as you are expecting SUPER corny lines and an almost 3 hour long flick, I think you'll enjoy the film. There were also plenty of good one liners along with a great job by the frantic Shia LeBeouf. Also, not to forget the most important part, the visual effects were pretty damn amazing.",1
175," Good fun, with only a couple of cringe-worthy sappy moments. The only major downside was the product placement, which was very much in your face. The Panasonic SD card and the GM cars being the standout examples. SPOILER: Golden moment - the All Spark hits a drink vending machine and turns it into a Decepticon that launches cans of soft drink from its weapon. Priceless.",1
176," ""Michael Bay in good movie shock!"" I've dreamed of a this movie becoming a reality for 22 years. I'm still reeling from it coming from one of cinemas worst directors!",1
177," No you will not receive any insights into the human condition or the universe watching Transformers, a movie about a toy franchise. What you do get is a profoundly entertaining summer popcorn movie, a cheesy and thoroughly preposterous smashup that also manages to be Michael Bay's first genuinely satisfying movie. And the special effects are just ludicrous to behold.",1
178, I pretty much agree with everyone who gave this movie a 7. The people that were upset about the plot and basic storyline need to realize thats not the point of the movie. its a summer action flick. and i had fun (unlike watching spiderman 3).,1
179," The only thing that I didn't liked was the action sequences, they lacked of detail and the whole thing was actually a big mess by the end. But in general it's a fun movie and to give it a comical approach it's what saves it from disaster.",1
180," Terrible movie. Transformers aren't old school. So many cheesy slo-mo ""moments"". I went into this thinking it was going to suck, but at least I'll get to see some cool robot fight scenes onscreen. No, not even that. The director went for that stupid new style of shaky-cam for the fight scenes. With most of the robots being solid gray, it was hard enough to tell what was going on in the fight scenes without the shaky-cam crap. Just a bad, bad movie. God it was bad.",0
181," It irritates me that people are so anxious to trash this movie because of the fact that Michael Bay directed it. It wasn't even cool to diss Michael Bay until South Park, and now every one loves to hate him because of the South Park precedent. Everyone should face the fact that mindlessly regurgitating opinions from South Park is the kind of mindlessness that South Park lampoons in every episode. I went to the movie not expecting much but finding that the movie actually had a soul that transcended being a built-to-order movie that would only please nerd devotees and actually became a film that was enjoyable because it played both to nostalgia (having grown up with transformers myself) and to enjoyability/ having a soul. Just because it is cool to trash a director doesn't mean that you can't at least watch the movie first before you get your opinions decided for you.",1
182," The best Michael Bay film yet. Exciting, great special effects and great touches of humor. We need more of these movies, a film I can takes my kids to see that is both for kids and adults. The box office receipts speak for themselves. The public loves it, critics hate it. Star Wars had the same problem in 1976.",1
183," I had low expectations entering this movie, and Michael Bay somehow managed to fall below them. Horrible directing, horrible story. Full of every cliche from the action movie canon. The special effects were not that impressive. And the Autobots were a bunch of goofballs.",0
184," As with all movies based on television shows or comics, it",0
185," This movie is the GREATEST movie of all time! I cannot possibly watch a movie that lacks transformers of any sort after watching this MASTERPEICE! If you hated Transformers, this movie will convert you to a Transfan and then you will be immersed into the purified awesomeness of this magnificent artwork that TOTALLY craps all over Star Wars, Harry Potter and LOTR and any other movie ever made and then kicks them in the family jewels so bloody hard that they will be vomiting them out! You MUST watch this movie! At least a million times in the cinema before buying the DVD!",1
186, First of all that film was AMAZING! but secondly can anyone tell me what song is being played when the camaro (bumblebee) drives off and comes back as the new camaro? i would be very grateful as it has been bugging me ever since i saw the movie! lol,1
187," I was expecting this to live up to my memories of the original franchise. It fell way short. The effects were amped up in overdrive, but that didn't mask the lack of intelligence or soul. Big dud.",0
188, Giving an '80' score to Anthony Lane's New Yorker review suggests Metacritic's sense of irony may be as rusty as old scrap metal.,1
189," A flawed, but very enjoyable movie.",1
190," Lack of Imagination, stupid plot...I wasn't expecting nothing special though..those American franchises (Spiderman, 4fantastics, sth..man etc.) movies are all crap and I think people,at least in my country, is realizing of that.",0
191, Megan Fox and Shia Labeouf need to get married. The action was ridiculous and Megan Fox was also breathtakingly amazing.,1
193, If you know there is some cheese factor carried over from trhe cartoon you will enjoy this great action movie.,1
194, This movie was amazing. Bay was made for this kind of movie and it felt like watching the first episode of the show if it was remade. It is also extremely well done visually.,1
195," This movie was amazing. I've seen it 5 times and it has been just as good every time. The plot was a little loose but the effects were utterly amazing. Also, the added humor and wit of Shia Labouf was unexpected but made the movie multi-dimensional. Can't wait for the sequel!",1
197, Fantastic! This is what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be. Awesome Action. The CGI is seamless and real. The thing that suprised me the most was how funny the movie was. Michael Bay nailed the tone that a movie based on a cartoon and toy should be. Tongue and cheek and silly while delivering jaw dropping action scenes. Well done. Plus Optimus Prime is the coolest character ever!,1
198," Transformers; A- I was really surprised. I didn't expect this movie to be as funny as it was. It's got such a great sense of humor, the action scenes are incredible, the effects are amazing, the characters are likable..... Steve Jablonsky provides a really cool musical score, too. It's overall a really fun movie and a real crowd-pleaser, even though you have to tolerate the occasionally (let's face it,) nerdy subject matter. I just really, REALLY, wish directors these days would please KEEP THEIR MOVIES UNDER 2 HOURS!!!!!!!!! It's getting pretty ridiculous now. Some editing to shorten the movie a bit and it would have been perfect. Easily director Michael Bay's 2nd best film (behind the excellent The Island.)",1
199," 7 for the average movie goer. 9 for most kids and boys. 4 for your more sophisticated movie reviewer. This is a thrill ride more than a movie. Great CGI and action. Some good acting mixed with some cheesy Independence Day-like nutty characters. Shia's character got annoying after a while with his fast talk and super hip-not so cool kid-being cool. These are the kids that run high schools, they aren't the ones hiding in the background!! Megan Fox is beautiful but doesn't do a whole lot other than being an object of super tanned lust. Michael Bay needs to lay off the slow motion, with military horn music...every movie he does this-knock it off, it's cheese. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese are the only two that keep this movie somewhat realistic, they did a good job. Rachael Taylor does an ok job until things get silly with her character. The transformers themselves are cool and the new looks are better than the look from the 80'sl. The decepticons to me were much better looking. The CGI is amazing. Optimus Prime's voice is as cool as ever. The fights are full of action. Overall Michael Bay proves to me that he still can't create real humans, but is great at creating simple macho action. Good movie but forgettable characters except for the transformers themselves.",1
200," Very flashy movie - attractive cast, and brilliant cgi animations. However, the attempt at establishing settings for the story and the romance plot is weak at best. There is no character development: it's hard to symphathise with Autobot's or the human's cause. The robots' personality doesn't stand out at all. And the fight scene in the end is too chaotic. Conclusion: superficially entertaining.",1
201," This movie was great. Action packed and everything you'd want. Also, the acting was much better than in most action movies. Exciting and fun, and Shia Labeouf was great!",1
202, Let me start by saying the only thing that gave this a 2 is Peter Cullen came back as Optimus Prime and the last 30 minutes which was good but not great and the flawless CGI. Why is Megatron a jet/spaceship? Why isn't Jazz a porsche or Bumblebee a vw bug? Where is Soundwave? How were they supposed to get back to Cybertron? All spark?! How creative! I curse Bay for making this one big stupid commercial for GM and their pathetically ugly cars & trucks. Stephen Spielberg should have been in the driver's seat because at least he would have put more heart into it. Thank you Michael Bay for turning something I love into one big 2 hour and 23 minute joke!,0
203," For a movie about giant transforming robots they sure could have given them some more screen time. Most of the fights you hardly even see because the focus is on the human characters. And that is where the movie goes wrong. When you do get to see two or more of the alien behemoths dueling to the death the fun is over before it even begins. The Transformers are supposed to be the starts, not the supporting cast. The movie should have started at the last hour and gone on from there.",1
204, Optimus Prime freakin kicks a$$!!!,1
206, Great entertainment! Good mix of action and humor. Hope we see a lot more of Megan Fox!!,1
207, For those critic who were not impressed...Did any of you watch the original TV series...They were robots with personality and Bay stuck to what us 11 year old at hearts remember. Hearing Optimus Prime speak on the big screen brought me back to my childhood...Bay finally brought the movie I have always wanted to the big screen...And everyone in the packed theater...from the applause...loved it as well...thanks Micheal Bay.,1
208, How on earth is Anthony Lane's New Yorker review an 8/10? If you read it properly you might realize that it is dripping with irony and is probably a 3/10.,0
209," Fantastic action movie....great effects, good enough story and great portrayals. Go see it!",1
210," Amazing flock, loved almost every second of it. Can't wait for the sequel.",1
211," Awesome movie, dialogue could've probably been a little better and I thought the humor was too involved in the movie (although it was good humor, not Evan Almighty esque for sure), but the special effects and acting was phenomenal, which more than makes up for all of that.",1
212," The best movie I've seen in a long time! Shia LaBeuf brings charm and skill to the role. The movie has A LOT of laughs. The action/special effects are breathtaking. As far as entertainment goes, it was a masterpiece. Bay gets criticized for mediocre films like Pearl Harbor, but with the help of Speilberg, he has truly redeemed himself with this one. It's the perfect summer movie, and I recommend it to EVERYONE.",1
214," This film actually brought a tear to my eye! It inspired me that a cartoon I watched while growing up could be transformed into something LIFELIKE! To hear the transformation sound, to watch robots seemingly defy laws of physics, to feel them take on human aspects, maybe more human than human, was amazing. Best film of the year, PERIOD! All films should be judged by what they intended to deliver. If animation at its finest, fleshed out (pun intended) with a believable plot is what you want to see, go see this movie!",1
216," This movie is all about the action...and boy does it come in spades...the story is a filler, but if you came for the store, your dumb. This movie fulfills in the action department, and that's good enough for me.",1
217," I would say the best movie of the year after the movie my wife was like ""spider man who"" and yeah that's what is all about, all the old heads and stupid people that waste their time just to talk crap about the movie are f&^%$^) dumb because they never had a childhood, so I will say to all those old people to stay in your wheelchairs and keep watching discovery channel because that's all they do.",1
218, I loved it. There were a couple of cheesy lines but overall the effects were stunning. This movie is what a movie should be: entertaining.,1
219," I think its funny that these some so called critics of whatever professional level they claim to hail from, have picked this movie apart and snubbed it. Its obviously not a movie with some sort of intricate plot or character depth (in my opinion, the characters were very well done). Its about theatrical enjoyment, sitting back and having a good time. Why do these critics need to have so much more to make a movie work. In real life there isn't much backdrop to people, when you meet someone, the persons life story isn't unfolded in front of you. Give me a break. All in all the movie was a success. I am proud that Bay was able to bring the Transformers to life and bring their battle to the big screen. The CGI was flawless, the action was over the top and Shia and Megan rocked . Thank you Michael Bay for this movie, I hope to see a sequel.",1
220," ""It's better than Armageddon!"" Michael Bay spoofed himself with this line straight outta the movie, but he was right. This was definitely better than Armageddon, it is his best work actually. I'm not a Bay fan, but I am a huge Transformer's fan, so instead of being disappointed like I was expecting to be, I was actually satisfied and impressed! Great job Michael. This movie is not supposed to make you think; it's not one of those movies which you have discussions over afterward. It is, however, what summertime is supposed to be all about. Welcome back summer blockbuster, finally a movie that delivers.",1
221," The action sequences are mind-blowing and the Transformers themselves are a blast to watch. If you expect anything else, don't see it. But I loved it. I saw the first showing on the 2nd with the theater full and it was extremely fun. For being exactly what I wanted, I give it an 8, with a couple points off for unnecessary humor (although most of it was funny) and some disorienting action scenes. Sometimes it was hard to tell exactly who was fighting who in individual cuts. But, again, if you think you might like it, you should probably give it a chance and go see it.",1
222," The critics can nitpick all they want, I pay admission to be entertained for a couple hours, and entertained I was with this film. Fantastic special F/X, strong connection to the old cartoons and a huge budget made this movie worth the price of admission. I hope they'll start working on part 2 right away!!",1
223, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It packed everything one could expect into a high action movie and loads of comedy as well.,1
224, This film is an Incredibly juvenile piece of garbage.,0
225, This is the Micheal Bay's greatest movie ever.,1
226," Most entertaining movie of the summer bar none. Sure, in ten years I'll probably slip the DVD of Ratatouille in instead of this one, but I haven't had that much fun at a movie in a long, long time.",1
227, Surprisingly Good!,1
228," This movie had more plot holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Given the genre and subject matter, some leeway is acceptable, but some of it was just ridiculous. Tow trucks with the wires to hot wire it pre-exposed for no good reason, robots who will do anything to save humanity and not harm anyone haphazardly damage and destroy buildings that undoubtedly have people being crushed in them, small kids who go ""Wow"" at the robots instead of crying in a fetal position like any kid would...just bonkers. Great CGI, great action, funny moments, but absolutely and completely ridiculous where it didn't need to be.",0
229," First off, only those who are fans of Transformers will probably find this movie worth watching. So if you are, it's a MUST see! Michael Bay spared no expense in the visual and audio departments, making you giddy everytime you see and hear any transformation. Shia LaBeouf proves himself a capable actor, even if he is a little bumbling (a la Ben Stiller). Overall though, a great movie for Transformer fans, and a must see.",1
230," The movie was INCREDIBLE! Over the top action scenes with BIG GIANT ROBOTS, who cares about the story! As simple as the story was, it reflected the cheesiness of the original cartoons story lines so in that sense it didn't bother me at all. It had some busy action shots that could've been cleaner, but that's Bays style. And to me for every 5 busy shots he also had 1 that was REALLY GOOD and well worth it. The humor was great and Shia LaBeouf did a great job as an actor! Perfect role for him. They really pushed the bar with the visual effects on this one...CG effects were seem-less with the live action. Just WOW! The humor in the film and all the little hint of reference to other 80's cartoons was great. Did anyone noiced the ""GI Joe"" planes at the beginning? Girl with a ""My Little Pony"" And of course all the classic one liners from Optimus Prime, they almost seem they were taken out directly from the cartoon itself! So that to me, is why I mostly enjoyed it. This movie brought out the kid in me, something a few have done before!! As complete fan of growing up with the cartoons (GEN 1) I think they nailed it from the basic cheesy story line and humor to the personalities of each robot. I would have to give it a 9 (take off one point because Bay didn't use Starscream as much). Hopefully, there would be more of him in the sequel.",1
231, Everything I expected. Definetely met my expectations for a great summer popcorn movie with some spectacular special effects. Can't wait for the sequel.,1
232, This movie was amazing. I have not seen a movie with such epic proportions in a long time! Well done Michael Bay and Spielberg! I am definately watching this again and on iMAX as well as purchasing this on HD-DVD or BluRat.,1
233, movie was perfect til the transformers were revealed. there character left a lot to be desired and they're dialoge was often painful. lots of exciting action though. i mostly enjoyed,1
234," I grew up watching transformers as a child, and when I saw the movie, it blew me away. The story line, the graphics, the humor, and the quality was more than I could have emagined. If you like sci-fi movies, and cool tech toys, you will love this movie. After reading critic reviews, then seeing the movie, I was left wondering if the critics, saw the same movie I did. It seems to me that most the reviews were from people with no emagination, or perhaps they never had a childhood. The bottom line is this movie kicks some serious metal booty. Thank you Michael Bay for making this movie awesome.",1
235, this is the best movie i've seen in awhile i'm talking star wars status. and to have the original voice of prime was icing on the cake. obviously some of those dumb newspaper old farts weren't transformer fans. every person i've talked to loved it young and old. i can't wait till it comes on blu-ray.,1
236," It's a great Michael Bay film. not real plot to wrap you mind around , but just beautiful to look at. The plot was simple enough not to make my head hurt",1
237," Austin Chronicle Marrit Ingman (about The Island) ""If you like ""Maxim,"" you will love The Island. It is glossy. It is expensive. It has lots of slick ads for Aquafina and Cadillac."" ... Transformers, same Sh*t, different channel...Michael Bay you are a one trick pony. I walked out of the theater praying the Decepticons had win.",0
239," This movie kept my attention for the whole two and a half hours. I had Goosbumps on my arms throught the entire movie, it was that good. This is hands down the movie of the year.",1
240," A die hard Soundwave fan going into the theater, fully prepared to be disappointed, came out of the theater impressed. Not a fan of the new look but you get used to it. The humor is great, the action is top notch. I just wish there was less product placement. C'mon, Nokia, Mountain Dew, Xbox, Cadillac transformers? Not to mention Panasonic, GMC, and the countless cars (Porsche/H2) but that was inevitable. A little too much involvement with the humans but I suppose it was fine for a intro to the Transformers, in the next one they can concentrate more on giant robots destroying each other.",1
241," Terrible movie, even when I went in just wanting nothing but action. I get nothing but action, however...its filmed so badly that I can't even enjoy it. Shakey camera zooming in and out nonstop while filming missles flying everywhere and soldiers screaming while shooting at things we can't see. As far as I could tell, the Decepticons (bad guys) won every fight yet the good guys came out on top somehow. Its still a mystery to me...",0
242, the movie is soooo cool 10/10,1
243," Hilariously awful, sub-Ed Wood trash. I started laughing sometime during the opening narration and hardly stopped until the end. Somehow contains even more cliches than Armageddon. The funniest movie so far this year. Terrible, terrible, terrible, but not offensively bad (not on the badness level of, say, Star Wars Episode I). At least John Turturro looked like he was having fun and getting a paycheck for it - he must have been the only one who read the script in advance.",0
244," Action, suspense, humor and the greatest CGI I've ever seen! Perfect summer movie",1
245," Michael Bay's career topped out at ""The Rock."" This is one big P.O.S. with underdeveloped characters with no emotional involvement, unnecessarily stylized shots and one dumbed down script. Lowest common denominator shilling is at its peak. You might be mentally retarded to like this movie much. It deserves a ""2"" but I had to rate ""0"" for the over-exuberant people.",0
246," People need to remember the plot of this movie is based on a cartoon, so don't expect huge things from the plot. I got exactly what expected lots of eye candy, and as a bonus Megan Fox, wow. Optimus Prime Is one of the best hero's ever created, the orginal vioce was great. See it and make you own judgement. But if you were a kid when this was on TV, I am sure you will enjoy it, just like I did.",1
247," I'm not sure why so many people are hating on this movie. Were you expecting a really deep plot? Or ""Oscar"" caliber acting? It's the kid from 'Even Stevens' and some no-name, half-dressed actress. I grew up a huge Transformers fan, and I still liked it. Go in expecting a good action movie and you will be more than satisfied. The frenetic camera in the action scenes only adds to the adrenalin and immersion. The Transformers themselves were done way better than I was expecting. Only bad things I can say were already said -- the Decepticons were sort of anonymous, and there was WAY too much ""GM Loving"" for me.",1
248," It's like Triumph of the Will- but for adolescent idiots of all ages, instead of nazis...",0
249," As a long time Transformers fan, I've always awaited and dreaded the moment they'd try a live action movie...up to now, I don't think such a thing would have been possible...but they SO pulled it off. The characters were amazing and the action was spectacular. I only wish Spider-Man 3 had been those two things.",1
251," It feels like I am in the Invasion of the Body Snatchers....what is wrong with everyone? This is one of the worst films in history. This is Battlefield Earth bad, this is worse than Bad Boys 2. Seriously, did I walk into a different movie? What is it that you people love? The acting, the nonsense plot, the horrid action sequences, the wholly illogical ideas, the complete lack of regard of the original Transformers? The animated movie was much better.",0
252," Pure fun. As soon as I heard Peter Cullen's voice over to open the movie, I was 10 years old again. It is a Michael Bay movie, so sure there are some plot holes, cheesy lines, etc. But this was a great big screen summer blockbuster.",1
253," Michael Bay is the greatest action movie director pure and simple. I was very afraid to see this movie. Transformers was something special to my childhood and I couldn't see anything pertinent from taking this movie seriously. Bay does not take this seriously but doesn't overly go campy on us either. It's vivid, fun and makes you feel like a child again. That's what summer blockbusters should be about. The effects were realistic. CGi never looked so real.",1
254, AWESOME. funny and action packed.,1
255," Autobots, transform and roll out! Another movie review, ha, this is almost becoming a habit. Anyway, when it get's right down to it, the special effects are probably the best part of this. You almost believe in these giant transforming robots, fighting for the ""all spark"". It starts off in a military base when a helicopter, whose tag indicates it should have been shot down, lands. It ends up being a decepticon. It ransforms, trashes the place, then attempts to hack into the computers to get all available information, in hopes of finding a certain article. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is in school giving a report about his great grandfather and his excursion to the arctic circle, while trying to sell items in the process. When he leaves school, his dad takes him to buy his first car. They find an old yellow camaro with racing stripes, but Sam's dad refuses to buy because of the price. The car (Bumblebee) has different plans, and damages every car in the lot, so the price is lowered. It drives off in the night, and Sam thinks it's been stolen. So he follows it and see's it transform, and sees it was driving itself. Later, Sam meets a girl who pretty much hates him, but she took his offer for a ride home. Bumblebee follows Sam, so to escape, he goes under a bridge full of cars. This is where he meets Barricade, a decepticon who tracked him down by his ebay username. Running from Barricade, he runs into the girl (sorry, I forget her name) he met the other day. They get into bumblebee, and he get's them to a safe place, where he and Barricade duke it out. Leaving the fight, the girl comments on how crappy the camaro looks, so bumblebee dumps them off, scans a new camaro, and changes his look accordingly. Bumblebee then drives him to a rendesvous, where they meet the other autobots. Rachet, the medic, Ironhide, weapons specialist, Jzz, and of course, the big guy, Optimus Prime, autobot leader. Fun Fact: Optimus has the same voice actor in the movie that he had in the original cartoon series. Hence, the hunt for info on, and the all spark itself, begins. There is quite a bit of story here, and not a super high amount of action, but it's worth it in the end. There was a lot I left out here, and quite a bit after all this, but I don't want to give too much away. Breakdown, amazing special effects, good acting, and the fights, while somewhat scarce, are extremely entertaing and keep your adrenaline pumping. I reccomend this to anyone looking for a cool movie about giant robots, or anyone who remembers and loves the old show. For them, it will be ""nostalgiariffic"".",1
257," This wasn't a bad movie at all when you compare it to crap like Fantastic Four and Pirates of The Carribean 3. I enjoyed Micheal Bay's humor, and the actors and they're involvement with the robots. The action scenes were too much in some areas, but that's the kind of director Bay is anyway. I give this a 10 because it's the best hollywood blockbuster out of all the recent one's so far, like the ones mentioned above!",1
258, Another mindless piece of Hollywood garbage that trades on some rose colored nostalgia for the dubious 1980s. Give me a break.,0
259," It was pretty good, didn't really have any expectations. Never watched Transformers as a kid, but still good action.",1
260,"Don't know what to say about this movie. there are soo many things wrong with it. i hated the GM ad factor and the direction. i love transformers but i cannot even bring myself to give it a two. i gave it a 1 for the CGI (thanks to mr. farar) and shia, but as far as michael bay movies in the future, ill never see another one. see live free or die hard instead. transformers was a HUGE dissapointment. Trust me.",0
261, i thought this movie was great! i really don't get the negative reviews. it's transformers and it was everything i wanted from a transformers movie to be. if you were ever a transformers fan or if you just love mecha designs...you're gonna love this movie.,1
262, Overall the movie was entertaining. I have to say that this movie had it's highs and lows but overall it was well made. The action scenes were absolutely amazing the transformation from robot to machine was right on. I have to say that overall it was worth the money spent.,1
263, Absolutely amazing. A must see.,1
264," Movie could have been so much better. I give this movie a 9 because it doesn't give you time to think. Jumps from scene to scene with no explanation (a Comero just appears out of nowhere diving itself around and theres no explanation of how it became an alien robot or when it became a robot, if it feels, does it have emotion, is it human like etc). It's like Boom a Camero, Boom now it's a robot, Boom now there's other robots, Boom robots are fighting each other, Boom the End. Too fast with no explanation. The movie starts off about a boy and his car, but quickly changes to a movie about alien robots (whom all have names, very corny) searching for ""the allspark"", to an all out robot war between good and evil (cartoon-like). The movie should have been about the kid and his alien robot car only!!! And a sequal could have introduced other transformers etc.",1
265," A dumb action movie. However, the plot and dialogue was so dumb I laughed most of the way through the movie.",0
267," Way to go NICK H! You nailed it perfectly with your short review. I'm 32 years old -- I should have LOVED this movie. I grew up with Transformers and was awaiting this greatly. What an absolute disappointment. The effects were good but there was so much wrong with the movie I couldn't help but hating it. It is full of young actors in their mid-20's trying to come across as Grade 11 students ala Beverly-Hills-90210 but worse! They're totally annoying. The lead character is so high-strung he's exhausting to watch. The blonde ""hacker"" gal has the absolute worst fake accent I've heard in decades. And the gorgeous raven-haired lead gal's acting is TERRIBLE! In her defence though, it isn't entirely her fault -- the movie pits her in numerous poor facial closeups at wrong times and so-called dramatic moments (eg. a loving touch of fingers with the lead guy during one action sequence while they're laying on the ground - aaarrggh! It was worse than when the rock man on Fantastic 4 coudln't pick up the engagement ring on the bridge). I want to know how Megatron, having been incased in ice for several millenium, suddenly wakes up knowing the english language. At least the Autobots blame it on listening in on Internet. I want to know what Michael Bay's obsession is with shooting dramatic scenes with sunsets in the background? Once or twice if fine but come on! He must do it ten times in the movie. Every time the military climbs into aircrafts - sunsets and sunrises. How cliche. By the way, I counted two instances of re-used footage in the film. The same desert explosion was used twice and the same footage of the helicopter Decepticon was used twice. Not a big deal but I hate this. I hate directors who think the audience are morons. The last time I saw footage used twice so blatantly like this was in an 80s porn flick. Come on Bay!",0
269, I thought the movie was great and the transformers did not change in the blink of an eye. It was better than harry potter which had so many things missing. Anybody that gave it a 1 needs to watch it again.,1
270, This is a great action-packed thriller that will make you want to see it again,1
271, Worse than bad. Terrible movie.,0
272, Awesome,1
273, Is this a movie or a f%&kin video game???,0
274," It's a decent, action-packed movie. The CG is incredible. The transformations themselves are clever and satisfying to watch. Beyond that, the battles are well choreographed and explosive, and the human bits are not nearly as groan-worthy as they could be. So, as action-packed as the whole thing is, I'm surprised myself that my one major complaint is that the movie draaaaags. It's certainly at least 20 minutes too long.",1
275," I loved this movie! It is now one of my favorite movies of all time. While I'm not a huge Transformers fan, I still enjoyed the original animated movie when I was young (it came out in 1985, year I was born) and loved the references from the original. See it!",1
276," I'm a girl, and I love this movie! Even my 3 year old loves it! It's action packed and funny...since my favorite movies are comedy's and my husband's favorites are action-packed, this was great for both of us! Great acting and great story line...really great comeback for Transformers!",1
277," A great movie! Full of action and comedy. People with all the low grades are foolish enough not to remember this is just a remade cartoon. Get a grip on yourselves. Its just supposed to be some mindless entertainment. If you want to watch Casablanca, go for it. If you want an entertaining movie with action from beginning to end, this is for you!",1
278," Pure popcorn fun. Mindless action, with some of the most mind-blowing CGI special effects ever done on screen. Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed, and non-fans will simply be wowed by the whole thing. Sure, there isn't much story here, and the acting is questionable in some parts, but if you're looking for a fun, action packed film that you can watch with the kids - this is it. The season of blockbusters on DVD begins with a huge bang, and what better way to start it off than with a movie like this. A must-see film even for those who don't know an Autobot from a garage door opener!",1
279," Remember, not every movie has to be reviewed as if it was going up against Citizen Kane. Yes, some of the acting was so-so....yes, some of the human story lines were unnecessary or on the lame side, but this movie was supposed to be about visual effects and that's what it was...though I wish more diff transformers had been included. My other issue was that the transformations were about as complex as solving a Rubik's Cube. Less CGI frames and more robots please.",1
280, Great entertainment! Doesn't try to be anything more than entertainment. If you don't like this movie your taking it too seriously. Switch off your brain and enjoy.,1
281," Whatever...if the critics can do a better job then let them start making the movie, First time me child never moved or said a word while waching a movie !! Awesome !!",1
282, Uninterruptedly awful. A 2+ hour commercial for the army. A huge disappointment.,0
284," Transformers is a well made, varied film that does well to appeal to the targeted audience and lives up to its hype. The cast play their roles well and the acting is fairly decent, the CGI included is up there with the best of CGI films and the Transformer battles are memorable and add to the plot. The rare stabs at comedy do not go unnoticed and there are memorable scenes and moments which will live in the memory of hard-core fans. Whilst the plot and directing was good, I would agree there was an over-reliance on human script and not enough dedicated to the Transformers themselves and no background supplied to the characters, the film often focusing on the love attraction between the main characters. The film remains true to its roots and with a strong ending and memorable set pieces this film should be a front runner for Film of the Year especially picking up at OSCAR in the special effects department. Certainly recommended on DVD on its release.",1
285," A most awaited movie that satisfied my inner child. I grew up watching transformers and I was not disappointed with anything from cast and crew to it's wonderful Dir. Micheal Bay. I just hope the decide to make a part 2. My kids loved it as well and there 16 and 18yrs. old. Thank-you very much for your time. Cordially, Kathy",1
286, i hate this film,1
288, My 4 year-old sister can write better dialogues.,0
289," I played with them as a kid; they toyed with me as an adult. This movie is so Michael Bay it makes me want to melt the other couple of DVDs of his flicks I own and donate the plastic to Hasbro. Obligatory rotating-camera-as-stars-stop-and-stare-vacuously shot that is his corny, hackneyed signature? Check. I actually wanted to like this for what it is, and perhaps I would have if I was 10 years old. The few merits were overshadowed by the extra-long running time for this kind of movie, which short-circuited the entertainment factor. The dizzying action seemed to just blend together like a washing machine stuck on spin cycle. Do not think I'm a snobby elitist either, I actually enjoyed the Fantastic Four movies for the silly entertainment they provided. This just took itself seriously when it shouldn't have and tried to be funny when it was not. The best parts were Bernie Mac, the credits and yes, some of the action. I'm surprised how kind so many of the critics were.",0
290," this was a great movie. i went to see it not realizing how funny it would be ,as well as the action and was pleased.i bought it when it came out and my kids loved watching it as well. they are 5 and 3.i cant get my wife to watch it yet because she is not in to these kind of movies but i know she will enjoy it. shia is great i used to watch him all the time on even stevens and am glad to see how well he is doing.",1
294, The story is more for teenagers but the SF X and action is great for anyone with a per chant for same.,1
295," A fantastic, big-budget eye popping masterpiece destined to win over audiences is gigantic ways. See it to believe it.",1
296," If it's true that there's an 8-year-old boy inside every man, ""Transformers"" is just the ticket to bring the kid out. Big, loud and full of testosterone-fueled car fantasies, Michael Bay's action hits a new peak for CGI work, showcasing spectacular chases and animated transformation sequences seamlessly blended into live-action surroundings. There's no longer any question whether special effects can be made more realistic: The issue is whether disposable actors can be trained to play better with bluescreens. Paramount/DreamWorks' summer tentpole is certain to do gangbusters biz, while the sequel-screaming ending and the usual spinoffs should send ancillary through the roof. Toy giant Hasbro will see its coffers full to overflowing after the July 4 release, perfectly timed for a consumer run on already popular Transformers figures, comic books, videogames and cartoons. ""Transformers"" is the apotheosis of product placement, using tried-and-true formulas in the story department as a showcase for the toys (already featured in the 1986 toon ""The Transformers: The Movie""). Best of all for anyone who put coin into the production, pic builds off multiple generations of fans, from the kids obsessed with the robots at their launch in 1984 to those collecting the latest incarnations today. Adult dweebs still enthralled by the figurines' facile mythology have flooded the Web with complaints that the franchise has been tampered with to form a (relatively) cohesive plot, but most viewers either won't notice or won't care. At the center of the tale is Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), an average 11th grader psyched about getting his first car -- a mysterious, beat-up yellow Camaro that lot owner Bobby Bolivia (Bernie Mac, in a brief role) has never seen before. Sam's attempts to impress cool girl Mikaela (Megan Fox) are falling flat, and the car's habit of playing the right song (""Sexual Feeling,"" ""Baby Come Back"") at the right moment only increases the initial tension. The machine really freaks Sam out when it drives away at night and transforms into a giant robot that communicates via light beam with a UFO. Meanwhile, U.S. soldiers in Qatar have been attacked by a helicopter that transforms itself into one nasty robot, destroying everything in its path while an offshoot downloads top-secret files from the computers. Secretary of Defense John Keller (Jon Voight, doing a Southern version of Donald Rumsfeld) calls an emergency conference to analyze the data (""This is way too smart for the Iranians""), but one of the small robots has already hacked into Air Force One's computer. The evil robots are after Sam -- or rather, a discovery made by Sam's ancestor, an Arctic explorer. Thanks to introductory narration by good Transformer Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), auds know what's going on before Sam does: The planet Cybertron was ravaged by a civil war between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons. In their search for an all-powerful cube called the Allspark, both sides learn that super-evil Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) crashed in the Arctic a millennia ago, and with him the Allspark. Sam's great-great-grandfather's cracked glasses hold the key to its location. It's all very easy to follow. Sam's car is one of the good guys, Bumblebee. He and his fellow Autobots bond (not literally, though that could be for the sequel) with the teenager, who pledges to help them out, fighting not only the Decepticons but also the uptight feds led by Agent Simmons (John Turturro). Scripters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, together with John Rogers, had to keep the basic Transformers stories intact while placing them in a human environment, turning to plot elements from a number of successful pics including ""King Kong,"" ""War Games"" and ""The Love Bug."" Pic also follows the early Steven Spielberg formula (he's on board as an exec producer): Take a likeable young Joe with an ordinary upper-middle-class family and have him champion some aliens. More than any of Bay's earlier blockbusters, including ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armageddon,"" ""Transformers"" has an oddly Reagan-era feel, at times resembling an Air Force recruitment commercial. Soldiers, led by Capt. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson), are as much heroes as Sam, fighting to rid the world not only of authoritarian regimes -- there's frequent speculation that Russia or China is involved, proving the Cold War hasn't ended -- but also secret government programs. Ethnic stereotypes abound, and there's a none-too-subtle jab at the Spanish-as-an-equal-language lobby. ""Freedom is the right of all sentient human beings,"" intones Optimus, sounding more appropriately President Bush circa 2007. LaBeouf is pleasantly sympathetic, but this is hardly the role to test his acting chops -- or, for that matter, anyone else's. Fox is little more than eye candy, while Bay has put together a nicely multiracial cast to broaden the pic's appeal. Among the thesps, Turturro is so over-the-top that he provides a welcome acknowledgment of the pic's cartoon origins. But everyone involved knows the actors are mere props for Industrial Light & Magic's CGI team, which has put together an impressive show of the latest tech advances -- not only transforming cars and helicopters into enormous robots within a few thoroughly believable seconds, but also setting them in real spaces and having them interact with real objects. The premise for these fights hasn't moved beyond 1925's ""The Lost World,"" but the digital animation has never been better. No wonder Bay needed a team of editors, who succeed in making the fight sequences exciting spectacles, though toward the end they all tend to become just a mess of flying wreckage and random explosions -- the outcome is always predictable, if the movements themselves remain unexpected. Sound is cranked up to mega-decibels; if the action doesn't generate stomach tremors, the bass lines will. Overly grand music used halfway through, during Bumblebee's subjugation scene, seems to confuse it with the pic's climax.",1
297," A astonishing breath of fresh air. A visual delight and a action packed masterpiece. It undeniably scores in every way and scores the entertainment factor big time. So well made, so exciting, and so phenomenal that I want to see it again and again.",1
298," This movie is a fiesta full of actions and great CGI's action throughout the whole movie. Micheal Bay and Steven Spielberg has created, hands down, the best movie of the year, or maybe for last how many years since The Return Of The King. I'll give it an A+.",1
299," I took my 9 year old son to this and we had a blast. Some of the best action sequences and CGI work I've seen in some time. I was fine watching plot-lite as I assumed the film was aimed at my son and not me. I just enjoyed it for what it was. If you're looking for a fun summer action flick, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1
300," Come on, it's meant to be fun. Anyone who grew up in the transformers era will appreciate this movie for what it is, imagination.",1
301," Although my comments come too late; I have this to say. If you you come/came to see this movie for any other reason than to see vehicles turn into robots and fight and blow things up, you did it for the wrong reason. Yes it's cheesy, yes the love story is lame and standard in every movie, and yes even the robots themselves have some flaws (why do they blink? - and seen in a ""real-world"" setting I begin to wonder how they transform non-metallic parts such as tires and glass and seat cushions) but all that is irrelevant. Robots come to Earth, they fight, things blow up, robots ""die"", people die. Most importantly though, they look great doing it. This is a fun movie. It has no other purpose. Enjoy it for what it's worth.",1
302," As far as movies about alien robots that can disguise themselves on earth in the battle of good vs. evil go... this is a great film. It's not the kind of film where you should look for or expect any sort of amazing script writing or in-depth story-line. What you should expect however is some fantastic action sequences, a little romance, some excellent CGI and oddly enough, some genuinely funny comedy. I had my doubts as I haven't always been too impressed with Bay's work not to mention Transformers were just one of the obsessions I had as a child so this movie had a lot to live up to to keep me happy but it hasn't failed. If you think this movie might be your style it probably will be and if you're not sure then it just might.",1
303," WARNING SPOILERS: Probably the most entertaining movie i have seen in years. Its not meant to be deep or profound.. it is meant to be Transformers and that is what it is, the storyline is very well written tying in themes, locations and characters from the cartoon in to the movie in a brilliant way. A few changes have been made, but this is a movie and over all it does exactly what it set out to accomplish. The light relief is also very well done, the humour which in too many films these days does not come off well comes off very well in this movie. Right from the start (where Sam Witwicky makes the brain damage comment about grid iron players,very true) through to the end, the humour kept me entertained and the action kept me on the edge of my seat. The graphics were stunning and most of the fight scenes were superb, particularly the fight scene between Optimus Prime and Bone Crusher. I thought Optimus Prime possibly could have kicked a bit more arse, but i won't put that against the movie as it was so well done. One thing that was noted is that the only Autobot that died was jazz, once again its the token black guy that dies in the end lol. I wonder if that was on purpose or just co-incidence. Anyway top movie, i haven't seen a movie as good or left a cinema feeling i got my money worth in a very long time. Well done the cast and crew. :)",1
304, Best remake of any animated series ever done. The concept of the characters is the same as they keep their personality. Really funny. Transformations awesome! Best movie of the year!!!!,1
305," Way over hyped. CGI was good, but that's not what I go to the movies for. I go for characters and plot, not mindless action. So for my criteria, this movie gets a 1.",0
307, Superb from the opening scene to the closing credits. Cannot wait for this to come out on HD. Must go to a digital theater to see this in all its glory. Finally a summer blockbuster that is worth seeing twice.,1
308," If you liked Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, you will like this. I think that just about says it all. I mean just look at most of the higher user ratings: ""Funny"". Yeah, that's what I want out of my giant robot action movies.",0
309," I enjoyed the movie very much, actually watched it 3 times altogether. The impeccable CGI itself should at least earn this movie a 6, putting aside other factors.",1
311," Oh man. I love mindless stuff, but this movie is painful. It makes live free or die hard look like Citizen Kane. Honestly, I have LOW standards for CGI action flicks, but this movie is complete and utter crap. I wanted to like it and I can usually laugh at a bad script, but for the love of everything...I can't believe the ""script."" I can't believe they threw so much money into this movie and decided on this script. I find the constant advertising and product placement amusing...at one point they shamelessly zoom in on a panasonic Secure digital card. I'm writing this review to save the few souls who think they can watch just about anything mindless...cause trust me people this movie is an exception.",0
312," Enjoy the action, but be ready to laugh at just about everything else.",1
313," If I'm going to see a movie about giant fighting robots, is it too much to ask that the robot fighting scenes be cool? Even a little bit? It's a summer flick -- I'll give you the crap story, the bad acting, the ridiculous lack of logic. Really. Just give me a few minutes of really cool robot fighting. Sadly, for all the frenetic camera-work, oodles of CGI and loudy, bangy sound effects, Transformers couldn't deliver even that much.",0
314," First, for those that don't know the idea about most cartoons in the 80's was this, ""Make animated shows to sell the toys."" This is the idea that sparked the show and the whole transformers saga. So, since the animated show was really one giant advertisement, wouldn't it be a little more interesting to have small advertising jokes in the movie? hmm...I wonder....",1
315," The ""Starship Troopers"" for the next generation. Great special effects. Terrible acting (except for eye candy from the terribly hot new costar). Absolutely no plot. If you're over 25 you will want to vomit when you watch this movie.",0
316," The perfect summer movie. It was funny, things blew up, and it was pure entertainment. Some may think that they might be walking into a deep story with a lot of character development. If you are one of them, move along. This movie is for people who like to have fun at movies.",1
317," This one beat my expectations, which were pretty low. How much can you expect from a movie, based on a cartoon, based on a toy? As a kid I loved playing with these freakin' bots. My parents still have some stored in their attic. Someday I will make a mint selling em on ebay. Back to the movie. Very loud and chaotic. The robots looked great. Fantastic CGI. Not much character development goin on, and the love story is lame, but overall, me likey!",1
318," It was a fun movie. don't go into this movie expecting a spielberg masterpiece, because thats not what this movie is trying to accomplish at all. this movie is all about being loud and exciting, not serious and 'realistic'. the movie lacks any serious form of emotion, which makes a majority of the plot feel somewhat dry and lifeless, but if you can get your brain past that, it's solid entertainment. this is a fun movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously.",1
319, This movie was super fun and just what the doctor ordered for the summer. It had a few quirks including not using the 80's theme song but it was great watching the robots come to life!,1
320, Movie was absolutely FANTASTIC. The best movie I've seen in a LOOOONG time. They executed the live action with the CG PERFECTLY and funny without making it too corny. great movie!,1
321, Awesome,1
322," Extremely entertaining movie. To hell with all those who rate it by its plot or commercialized quality..these idiots would probably like it if it were dubbed in French! Go watch it, worth the price if you seek entertainment on many levels.",1
323," It has a light scrip, looks like a human kind history with robots not like a transformers history with humans. Among of characters has no time for exp laing relationships. And you could think even, that Optimus learned to be a heroic creature just because he saw that boy close to give his live.!?. The hot-girl, yes hot but she gets to much attention on her. But has a good part in the funny times. One of the goals in this first movie.",1
324," So tell me, why does everyone who gives this film a great review also mention ways in which it fails? So many comments by reviewers say things like ""don't expect a masterpiece"" and ""to hell with those who rate it by plot."" To admit that this film is neither a masterpiece nor a movie with plot is to admit it is a bad film. Period. You can say you enjoyed it, yes, but saying ""it was AWESOME LOL except for this, this and this"" calls into question the integrity of your judgment on the matter.",0
325," My assessment can best be explained by a partial quote from the movie Team America: ""Girl, I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the point, when he made""... Transformers. Save yourself some money and rent the cartoon movie from the late 80's. This modern day flick was just another Michael Bay crapfest.",0
326," This movie was AWSOME, from the visual effects to the hot chicks.",1
327, The only people that wont enjoy this are people who think gone with the wind is the best film ever. Nuff Said.,1
330, This movie was amazingly entertaining. But there are some things I think should have been done differently... They over did it with all the humor and introducing the HUGE cast. There were not enough battles between the Autobots and Decepticons. The battles were to brief and some of the transformers died WAY to quickly. Most of the Decepticons didn't show up until the very end. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the movie I just think that they should have showed less human introduction and more of the transformers! I heard Michael Bay has signed on to make this a trilogy so definitely looking forward to the next movie.,1
331," OK, I understand this is supposed to be a summer action movie about giant robots battling it out, but come on... this is the BEST Hollywood could do with the Transformers license? How bad was this? First, when you're making a movie about giant robots fighting, DO NOT zoom the camera all the way in, so the only part of the robot I can see is a few whirring cogs and wire bundles. Second, if you're going to start off the movie portraying the government and military as serious and in control, DO NOT introduce a secret government group guarding 'the biggest discovery ever"" as having the competence of the Keystone Cops. Third, I don't really think giant robots are going to care about whether the Shia LeBouf's parents discover them trampling the grass while they are trying to save the world... much less drag the scene out for 10 minutes. I give this film a 2 because, for the first 15 minutes or so, I was genuinely entertained. The movie felt like it was going to be great, it had a good vibe and pace to it. Then the idiotic humor, witty teenage banter, terrible cinematography, and complete disregard for physics started to get worse... and worse... and worse.",0
332," I can't wait for years from now when people look back on this film like Batman Forever and realize just how awful it is. The cheesy cartoon from the 80s was more well thought out and had less plot problems than this god-awful film. Not enough robots, not enough good.",0
333, Utterly meh. What's all the fuss over? It was way over the top and not very enjoyable at all.,0
334," Anyone who proclaims this movie to be either really great or really awful is full of it. The action was NOT that confusing. I wasn't crazy about a lot of the character designs (espcially their insect-like faces), but this was still some of the best CG I've ever seen. A lot of the dialog was terrible, but the actors managed to do OK with it for the most part. There's pretty much no way a movie about Transformers could NOT devolve into total ridiculousness, but at least this kept things fun and well-paced. I don't feel like I wasted my money, but I don't feel like I need to see it again anytime soon. I am, actually, looking forward to a sequel. If you're not too uptight to enjoy a silly summer movie with some mostly forgivable flaws, you'll have fun watching Transformers.",1
335," I was extremely entertained from the second I heard the narrator do a voice-over about Cybertron's history, right down to Optimus's voice-over speech at the end of the movie. The CGI is impressive, the Autobots and Decepticons looked real and convincing. Shia LaBeouf was a good choice for the role, but Megan Fox was only tolerable. She isn't a talented or competent actress, just eye candy for the guys. I was hardly 'moved' when she slammed her hands against the steering and leaned her forehead against it (as though) in defeat. What crap! Bumblebee's performance as 'tortured prisoner' was better than hers. This movie was not violent, no blood and gore that could frighten and disgust me. I wasn't turned off, not even when Scorponok speared G.I Joe, First Sergeant Donnelly (I think...). Peter Cullen's voice was a trip down memory lane for me. So pleasant to hear. I was broken up that Jazz had to die *sniff* Heart-pounding (RE:Bumblebee's showdown with Barricade), earsplitting bass and stereophonics that left my ears ringing long after I left the theater, and injected comedy (the Autobots as they try to hide around Sam's house. Just thinking about it cracks me up!) I will always love this movie, no matter how many times I've seen it. And I've seen it 4 times at the cinemas.",1
338," One word: awesome! And, a few more words: I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen the whole time. Wow!",1
339," If you went ape over the trailers, you won't be disappointed. Transformers delivers all the action, stunning visuals and a quick paced plot that manages to gloss over most of the clunky parts. Where was the lead in for the sequel? See this on the giant screen, if you can.",1
340," Every CGI flick you've seen before Transformers just aged ten years. This movie is beautiful. It's seamless blend of endlessly complex CGI and ""real life capture"" are pulled off so convincingly, you hardly notice the line between reality and fantasy.",1
341, It is not a 10 if your a fan since the 80's (the ol' bots dont act like the o.g.'s at all) but yet you still will enjoy it even though....trust me i give it a 7.5 as a fan so just think what non fans will give it (from my exp. its got a 8-10 from them) so go see it!!,1
344," Loved it, definite blockbuster hit of the summer! Michael Bay is a great director, he cant make a bad movie. Cant wait for his next one. BUT THIS IS A MUST SEE. GO SEE IT NOW!",1
345,"Craaaapy!!! the robots where kind of cool, everything else sucked. the action was jerky so you couldnt figure out what was happening, horrible director. it was like badboys 2 slash armageddon with robots. im sorry i love transformers but this movie is a waste of 2hrs should have just rented short circuit !!! johnyy 5 alive!!",0
346, The best movie my 7-year old inner child will ever seen. True definition of a summer blockbuster.,1
348," As an 80's child now grown, I have to say I loved this movie!! I watched it with my 9 yr old son who agrees that this movie was this summer's MUST SEE! It stays true enough to the 80's cartoon yet updates for the HD generation to satisfy both well. Using the original voice for Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) along with great acting by Shia LaBeouf keep this film from being purely eye candy. Bravo Michael Bay!",1
349," Very good, i enjoyed it from beginning to end. One of the things I thought was really cool about it was that it reminded me of the original cartoon while I was watching it, but it still managed to refresh the original concept. I had a lot of fun.",1
350, Some great action sequences. The movie breaks down a little midway through. Overall ok.,1
351," AWESOME CGI! Best action film of the year so far, tops 300 by one notch.",1
352, Action packed fun movie! Very entertaining.,1
354," Haha. Why all the good reviews? This movie had so much potential man. As much as I do hate Michael Bay, that probably being the reason I disliked this movie so much. Was he ALWAYS has those stupid F**king 1 liners.. For example in this film ""You shoot, i'll drive"". Once you see the film, you'll understand what I mean. How in the world would a Semi-Truck hold a Robot the size that they were? They tried to make the movie more funny than serious sci-fi. Again good job Michael Bay, for doing something incorrect. Stop directing. You haven't made a good movie since the original Bad Boys.",0
355," I left the theater after about 45 minutes. I don't think I've ever done that. The movie was so bad I decided I'd rather be anywhere else than watch another minute. Sorry, but I suspect most of these reviews were written by Michael Bay himself. Because this is a very, very, very bad movie.",0
356, I was a film minor. Battleship Potemkin is my favorite film. I hate Michael Bay. This was one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever experienced. I suggest you see it.,1
357, Good CGI robots and lots of humor make for good popcorn fun. Too bad they almost ruin it with the all too serious ending.,1
358, Terrible. Action sequences had a terrible tracking time. There were moments that I got lost and couldn't tell who was fighting who. Since when is Optimus a Peterbuilt? This is what happens when they trust the IP to such a director. This is what happens when corporate interests corrode and hinder creativity.,0
359, I'd have given it a 10 except for Optimus's cheesy lines. It's the first movie since The Matrix that I didn't feel ripped off by paying the full price to watch. The action and effects were simply breathtaking. The humor was perfect.,1
360, great,1
361," Could have been so much, turned out to be so little. How is it possible to fuck up giant robots smashing stuff? Ask Mr. Bay, he seems to have figured it out. Overall, a perfect night at the movies, if you're hoping for a pounding headache and a lingering feeling of emptiness.",0
362," Great movie. Cheezy as anything, but had a blast.",1
363," Simply the best blockbuster this year. I loved transformers as a kid, so i kinda expected this to suck. however it was AMAZING!",1
364," Amazing Movie. I've seen it twice and still can't stop talking about it. Anyone who votes red or yellow is either a bay-hater or transformers-hater. The movie wasn't long enough to develop some characters. but everything else was perfect, even Prime having a mouth was awesome. Can't wait for blu-ray.",1
365," Very poorly done movie. Terrible pacing, not enough Transformers. They simply didn't get enough screentime or lines. The humans were in it far to often and killed the movie for me.",0
369," I came into the movie with great anticipation and got my moneys worth. I was impressed with LaBeouf's performance. I thought the ""Even Stevens"" co-star would basically blow the role to hell, but to my surprise, he did an amazing mature job. The only down side to the movie is there was no Transformer theme song and almost all of the names of the Decepticons and the Autobots were no where near any of the actual names. I mean ""Bumblebee"" and ""Jazz?"" Come on Michael Bay.",1
370," So bad, I had to rate it zero twice! To Adam, although Shia may have had chemistry on the set, it is how their chemistry shows on the screen that matters! The way Bay directed those scenes with unnecessary use of slo-motion and having tender moments inappropriately placed in the middle of action sequences, there seemed to be no real chemistry between the two teens that was not obvious manipulated. The characters were too shallow to begin with so chemistry did not seem to enter the equation in my opinion. The character that had the most personality was Soundscreen (sp?) and he seemed to have a gremlin/Johnny 5/Scrat mix in him. This was a POS and those who liked it are a product of the conditioning that hacks like Bay have caused the general population to accept style over substance. Was it fun, a little - because of the audience enjoying the ride with the other patrons, but I do not imagine it translating well to the little screen and I dread going to see it again because it was painful to see some of the awkward scenes the first time.",0
371," I am amazed by this film. It is, by far, the best film of the year. Don't pay attention to those negative reviews. Sure the dialogue may be a little cliched, but this isn't supposed to be a drama with complex words spoken throughout. This is an ACTION movie and it should be reviewed like one. The special effects are out of this world, the action scenes are so intense that I just sat in the theatre biting my straw. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys lots of action. I usually don't like Michael Bay, but he has outdone himself here. There is no better movie out there right now, not a single one.",1
373, Shia is great!!! In 'transformers 2' there needs to be MORE kissing and less action!!!!,1
374," A good popcorn movie. It's full of action, action, more action and yes, a little bit of cheese. But, take it for what it is: 2.5 hours of fun, nothing more. Fanboys: chill out.",1
375," This is like watching the commercials during the Superbowl, except less clever. Director Bay is so obnoxiously cynical it makes you cringe. The CGI is cool but you never can really tell what is going on so you don't really care. The female lead love interest is possibly the most superficial example of such a character ever... Bay doesn't care if you like her or care about her character, she is just a predictable prop, that is all she is suppossed to be. I feel sorry the actress. I find it hard that people would want to watch this complete movie a second",0
376, michael bay's transformers is the equivalent of limp bizkit covering a beatles' song.,0
377," this was not a good movie. michael bay does not know how to keep the camera steady enough so you can see what transformer is fighting which other transformer...and the script was terrible, and oh man what a bad movie.",0
378," Awesome action but...horrible script. A number of scenes could have be cut completely...and some scenes cut in half...seemed like they were not sure how to end it. during the action scenes I kept waiting for them to pull out on the action...too much going on, to close, to fast you can't tell who is who or what is happening. Megan Fox was in the movie purely to look hot...thats it...no point to her character...didn't help the plot or move it along. all in all still a fun movie to watch just had so much more potential.",1
379," Seriously, I didnt know what to expect going into this movie. i thought, well it could be okay. but by the end, I said, and to quote ""this is the best movie ever."" just my opinion, but it had everything I wanted to see, hot girls, cool humor, and the coolest action sequences that ive ever seen. It builds up perfectly too, the beginning was mellow, with the little bastard hacking air force one and baricade and bumblebee throwing down, but once all the Decepticons came on scene, this led to the biggest clash of metal and steel I have ever scene the full on meele the insued in the city was absolutely jaw dropping. this movie is amazing and as soon as it hits stores, im buying like ten copies..... yeah, it was that good.",1
380," I went in expecting a very average movie, but it really came out great. Basically, it was everything it needed to be. If you can get over yourself enough to enjoy the concept, then you'll be fine with the cheesy plot and silly physics. The shaky action cam was annoying, but not bad enough to ruin the action. If you want horrible action, watch that piece of crap Bourne Supremacy; this was much better. Also, there is a ton of product placement. It's not what you think. Not just cars or toys, it was everything, and it was everywhere. Anyways, very very fun summer movie.",1
381," This movie was a whole lot of fun! I don't know what all the harsh reviews are about, maybe people were expecting Spiderman and got Spiderman 3. The movie is not going to win best picture but man did it kick some major butt! As an avid watcher of Transformers as a kid I was not disappointed at all. There are some great laughs and and tons of action and special effects. Shia LaBeouf did very well with the dialogue even though it was excessively goofy at times. But if your looking to see a fun action movie this summer, go see Transformers!",1
382,"Loud, silly plotless and only for those that are 10yrs old or feel like a 10 yr old. The only thing saving this film is the CGI transformations of cars and planes into robots. However at two hours 20 minutes plus it can serve as a good baby sitter and probably the reason Mothers like it.",0
383," These kind of movies crack me up. They are so obvious in their intentions to traffic in the gut emotions of an audience not used to thinking very critically about what they are watching. This film, like most of Michael Bay's films, is a gussied up military recruitment ad, the kind where all of the soldiers in it are muscled and oily, and where they do a lot of walking toward the camera in emphatic slow motion. There are girls in the film (two of them, to be exact), but they're basically just guys with breasts and nice legs. The government is to be feared and distrusted, because they keep secrets from the American people (like the fact that the Hoover Dam was really built as a facade to hide alien robots and their belongings), while the military is heroic and manly. To make itself feel relevant, the film even throws in some action scenes set in the Middle East. It was refreshing, though, that for once all of the chest-thumping is not reserved solely for the United States, but rather for the human race in general. The message in ""Transformers,"" other than that geeky teenagers have the stuff soldiers are made of, is that the human race isn't so bad after all, even if we have a lot to learn.",1
384, Best film ever. I loved every minute of it.,1
386," Its a pretty good movie,good action,good script,but the only problem is that Michael Bay cant hold the camera very well when the transformers transform and when they fight. Over all the movie was pretty good.",1
387," Great sounds, great visuals, great product placement, great explosions, great ending (plenty of room for great sequels), what's not to like?",1
388, It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Exept for the part where the blond girl disappears,1
389," So much potential, but an awful, awful movie. Why???",0
390, Fun and exiting to see a fresh look on old favorites. A definate guy movie all the way.,1
392," ""So much potential and yet bad movie ... bla bla bla"" Honestly people don't rush with judging only cause you watched this movie on a PC, bad quality cause torrents didn't have anything better than 700 MB. None of you would call it bad if u saw it in Cinema, with all the effects exposed! So please shut the hell up and use the brain. Good movie from storyline not so great for a movie, it could turn out to Disney-like movie but thanks God it didn't, Good movie, and its strength is purely in the SOUND and VISUAL EFFECTS. Please don't watch it on 17' pc screen ... or at least don't comment after that.",1
393," Epileptic camera and hyperactive editing, so-so actors, a very poorly written story, and the most stupid jokes about... robot urine?! Give me a break. The visual effects are awesome, but a few decent action scenes can't turn this mess into a good movie.",0
395," Who knew that a Sci-Fi could be as funny as Transformers. I loved everything about it. I meen come on now, how could you not give this at least an 8. With the right equipment this is the best one since start wars 3 came out.",1
396," Supremely overrated,all my friends think its gods gift to earth and get mad when i try to tell them that its average at best, I liked transformers growing up but this movie isn't good! Transformers 2 looks better but i don't know if ill be attending.",0
397," This is truly an amazing movie and it has everything that it takes to make a winning movie, when i watch this i don't even think of it as a movie, it unlike anything I've seen and the actors are amazing, when I hear someone say it wasn't like the transformers i grew up with, there right, it's better it takes transformers to the new age, and any fan boy who watches this and says its not like the series, prolly lives at home with there mom and got scared when they watched this movie.",1
398," This movie is terrible on so many levels. The attempts at story are painful bouts of product placement, and the Director would have been off making an hour long FX shot and casting off all attempts at cinematic storytelling. Much like an adult movie, the only thing worth watching is the action.",0
399," Horrible plot, horrible and annoying characters and very few average action scenes.",0
400," An overlong, idea-void mess of a movie. It's just action scene after mind-numbing action scene of huge, clunky, metallic CGI-robots fighting and blowing each other up and blowing up big buildings, and then more robots fight each other and the screen is filled top to bottom with fires and explosions and loud noises. If this sounds like a fun time to you, enjoy. If this all sounds dull and stupid and mind-numbing and unnecessary, you are correct.",0
401, Sure the story might not have been great but how can you look past the action and outstanding CGI.,1
402," This movie is easily the best movie of the year if not best movie ever. I was sucked into the movie by the speedy movements and the loud noises. Beautiful Megan Fox put Transformers to the top of my ""favorite movies ever"" list.",1
403," Saw it at a sneak preview a week ago. As with all movies these days the trailers looked great, but the actual movie disappoints. Well, this is one movie that didn't. Might be the coolest movie I've ever seen in a theater. The perfect summer movie!",1
406," This movie is fantastic! it has a few flaws, but visually it's amazing.",1
407, Oh My. J Arr's review almost made this whole movie worth it. My goodness man. I laughed my ass off at your review. You rock dude. I can't believe you're passionately defending this movie. You're a bush vote for sure.,0
408," I really enjoyed this movie. It's probably one of the most memorable films I've seen in quite a while. I typically have a fairly short attention span, and I personally didn't think of the plot as mindless filler between shiny things fighting. The visuals were raw, gritty, and quite stunning. The only bad thing I have to say about the movie, is that it eventually ended and I couldn't watch it anymore. You can't go to a movie like this expecting to have a philosophical and intellectually enlightening revelation. It is what one would expect in a movie about transformers. I found myself watching the film with quite the shit-eating grin on my face for the majority of it. Of course, I grew up in the 80's playing with transformers myself. Conclusively, I feel this movie was worth the cost of the $10.50 admission ticket, and I would see it again. I'm looking forward to the DVD already.",1
409, I,0
410," Beautiful It really felt like you were there with these amazing giant robots, the action sequences are usually from the point of view of the humans and it gets reallt intense the only thing that brought this movie down a bit for me was the scene where they're looking for the glasses - a little too long but i just edited that part out in my head I got a little misty eyed remembering fond memories from my childhood overall well worth 10$ and a great diversion from stresses of daily life.",1
411," awesome movie. anyone who says the CGI was poorly done is either blind or some kind of special fx whiz and you're the latter, make us a movie then. otherwise shut up and like others have said before, don't expect a masterpiece - just a fun time",1
412," Transformers has all the makings of a great movie: humor, action, throwbacks to the original cartoon and movie, babes, killer robots, and a story. The people who give this a bad rating are the people who didn't get exactly what they wanted in every way. This movie was just plain fun and that is all the movie needed to ever be. I grew up with the transformers and i could not be happier with the movie. Nit picking has given this movie undue low ratings.",1
413," I've had an internal feud with anything ""Transformers"" so I naturally had very low expectations for this movie.Needless to say i went to see the movie, and loved it. The best special effects I've seen. They do an incredible job of making the movie enjoyable for hardcore fans,and people like me that don't know anything about Transformers. Watch this movie for what it is, a special effects action-comedy movie based on a kids cartoon. Also keep in mind that this is the first movie in a trilogy, so don't get mad if you feel it left out some stuff it should have had. Like the first Pirates movie, this one introduces the main characters, and they will build on the series from that. Overall a great movie, i'm headin' out to see it again right now.",1
414," Giant robots maiming each other, nothing more needs to be said.",1
415," This movie was wonderful. I've been a fan of the series since i was a child and seeing all the characters in vivid cgi was amazing! Whats better is the personality of the franchise has been kept along with some of the sound effects which, like the very design of the transformers themselves, gives them identity. I would have liked to see more European cars (jazz should be a Porsche for example) but the movie is funny, scary, exciting, worrying and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.",1
416," I thought maybe this would be a film that was a bad Transformers film but still a good film-film. Sadly I was let down. This is just a bad film. I've been a hardcore TF fan since I was a kid, and to those of you who are like ""I'm not a transformers fan but this film will please both newcomers and hardcore fans alike,"" please -- stop telling me how I should feel about this film. I already know -- I hated it. And where do you get off pretending to know what will please hardcore fans when you are not one yourself? Just stop.",0
417," I was absolutely blown away by this movie. The special effects, storyline, and sound were incredible. This is definitely one of my favorites of all time and I highly recommend seeing this movie.",1
418," Where do I start? The only movie I've ever walked out of, EVER. And I've sat through Bio Dome & Anaconda while scores of people around me walked out. It didn't even matter whether I was a fan of the 80's cartoon (which I was), this was perhaps the worst written movie I've ever seen. Best highlight? When the grunt soldier dials his direct line to the pentagon (apparently all military personnel get a direct phone number to the Pentagon) and a (haha) stereotypical Indian guy answers and starts asking him for his credit card info. Or maybe when the Autobot sends up a blatant ripoff ""Bat Signal"" light into the sky to call down the other Transformers. Or maybe when G.W. Bush on Airforce One asks the stewardess to bring him some Ringdings, she goes down to the kitchen to get some, unwraps it, drops it on the floor by accident, then picks it up & starts eating it (?!?!). What did I learn from this? Well, (1), if you believe your car is stalking you, don't stay inside nice & safe where you already are, be sure to run outside and hop on your mom's bicycle so it can chase you. (2) high school girls run around with the halfnaked body of a Victoria's Secret model, eating exclusively nothing but Burger King & fixing cars, and (3), the (2nd) smartest internet hacker America has is (once again) a hot 'high school' girl who is 6x as smart as any college-trained pentagon official, is granted top-level military access, & figures everything out in an instant. Did I mention that she (thankfully) happens to live next door to the Pentagon, as does her best friend, the U.S's greatest hacker, the (hahaha) stereotypically overweight jolly African American guy? This is far far beyond check your intellect at the door popcorn movie; this is the stupidest commercial for EBay & GM (oops, I meant movie) that I've ever seen. This is the Billy Madison ""everyone in this room is now dumber"" speech in real life. If you fancy yourself to have a brain level above that of a 13 year-old boy, do yourself the biggest favor ever & skip this. If you enjoyed MENSA-level blockbusters such as Resident Evil 2, empty your wallet and come right in and have a seat. Enjoy some 'SHAKEY-CAM"" action! And I though I hated, no, loathed Michael Bay before... if this guy lands another movie, EVER, he & the producer should be thrown in Gitmo. I had a free voucher from the theater for this movie, and I still feel ripped off. I only give it a 1 for the CGI, which was actually no better than anything else the last few years. The only people enjoying themselves we're the two 15 year-old girls behind me giggling at every Shia LeBouf scene, especially the one where the robot rips off his pants (that's right).",0
419," Great photography, amazing special effect. The robots look so real even in the fights scene in the city. This movie is Bad Boy meets with War of the Worlds. Great entertainment, worth going to watch at the movie theater.",1
420,I don't know why critics reviewed this as a 60 out of 100 when this was easily the most entertaining film of 2007 by far. The special effects were amazing and the whole movie was action packed. The transformers looked so real. A lot better than all these shitty movies coming out now such as spider man 3,1
421," OK, so we're not looking at this film as a written masterpiece... rather this was a mind-blowing experience. I still have no clue what the story was about, but my head is still ringing from the sound effects. The sfx in this movie are through the roof! It was so loud that my chair was vibrating for half of the movie. Towards the end I could care less about who was going to win or even how it was going to end. I was going blind from the explosions and deaf from the bass in this movie. And how hot was Megan Fox? I can;t wait to see her in another movie.",1
422," wtf is wrong with you all???? its not perfect but its pretty freakin good!!! it sent chills down my back when they asked the pilot to reveal himself, which he did by disappearing and turning into a deceptacon!!! it may be a little long, sure but it sure as hell isnt boring. great film, highly recommended",1
423," I'm surprised most people adore this garbage. It's just another Bay film. The robots were just silly for 70% of the time and when they weren't silly the human characters were. In fact, the human characters were less believable than the robots. Overall, just an exhausting flick with too many explosions and absolutely no depth.",0
424, I'm sorry but if you grew up watching Transformers like I did when you were younger then this film is absolutely fantastic. This film wasn't made for it's in-depth story and Oscar winning acting. Its all about the Transformers and to be honest they could not have been created any better. Lighten up (or your car may change),1
426," isnt this suppose to be TRANSFORMERS????? well more than half this film was about stuipid teen agers hormons...I mean, who honesty didnt think the two boy and girl couple were not going to get together......The fights were terrible...they looked absoluting beautiful (the transformers, that is) but the huge ending fight was over in like 2 mins TOPS! and it was like a 2 hit fight....like what the hell? isnt Spelberg attached to this film? you know the one who brought us Indania Jones and E.T.......can anyone say that they actually gave to F's for the humans? isnt that Spelbergs big thing? every time i hear him talk about films its always about 'the charaters! I dont care aboutr the effects, I love the charaters' (which should be true) but this film was NO example of that. I guess i can say I felt terrible for the transformer's themselves sense they were being carryed through this disrepectful 'summer time' movie.....However, Not even Micheal Bay can ruin this franchise, but he sure put a baaaaaaad taste in my mouth for whats to come for our robot friends.",0
427," -Opinion: this is what each individual has, so why attack them, insult them, or even threaten to beat people up? -As for my opinion, I didn't enjoy the movie. I went in wanting to really like because 1) the trailers looked great 2) Steven Spielberg was executive producer 3) I've seen some of the older episodes of the show and the old movie. -Let me say that I don't have any bias against Micheal Bay and I don't watch South Park. -I didn't like it because it was just too stupid and silly, breaking away from any main plot-thread which should keep me engaged. It ventured off course too often just to get in a pointless joke. For example, when the squad of soldiers fight Scorpinok, and that one soldier tries to talk directly to the Pentagon only to be met with some tech support guy in India. Totally pointless! Some people laughed, but that just ruins the flow and sincerity of the movie. Was there any conceivable reason to break the action, suspense, and gravity of a life-and-death situation to get one joke in? It's like while penning the script the writers included whatever they thought was funny. Some jokes were way too immature, like the mom asking Spike if he's masturbating in his room (which isn",0
428, None of the original Transformers characters were there,0
429,"Ah, my kind of stupid. You know what, I love dumb movies. As long as I care about the characters, i'll have a great time. Well, this is one of those movies that defines this. This movie is way too friggin cool!! Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg deliver a heart-pounding, explosive blast of a time!! Filled with action, explosions, epic robots, and the hottest girl to walk on the earth, Transformers is an incredibly awesome blast that you have to watch.",1
431,"Posted on 3/20/11 02:35 PMI know a number of you are going to disagree with my rating for this film, but you know what? Screw it, I loved this movie. Yes, Transformers has Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox acting front and center with a storyline that isn't as interesting as it tries to be, but remind me, whats the title of the film? Transformers. So, who are the true stars of this movie? THE TRANSFORMERS! We didn't watch this movie to see the character developments of Sam Witwicky and Mikaela, we watched it to let our brains off the hook and watch huge CGI autobots fight it out with huge CGI Decepticons, and in that department, the film succeeds, and even surpassess expectations. Huge battles taking place in the desert, on the highway, right in the centre of town, Michael Bay is not afraid to show off the CG-eye candy with (what else?) explosions and big destructions. As for the human side of things, you know Sam and Mikaela are going to get together before long in the film because, well, they're the films leads, but its not too terrible seeing them on their journey to becoming together. Jon Tuturro and Sams parents are funnier than they have any right to be, and Sams mom definately shines in the comedy (or awkwardness, depending on your viewing) when she asks Sam if he's been, ahem, ""partaking in bedroom exercises"" Yeah, we all know this film isn't perfect, one such scene is when Sam manages to outrun Megatron, a decepticon who could simply take a few steps forward and catch up to Sam, but doesnt seem to manage to. Also, quite a bit (okay, a LOT) of the dialogue is bad and cringe-worthy. Also, the film may be Transformers, but quite a bit of the film is centred on Sam and Mikaela, so don't go in expecting wall to wall Optimus and Bumblebee and Starscream. In the same year we got trilogy dissapointments such as Spiderman 3, Shrek the Turd and POTC: At Worlds End, its great to have the Transformers there to pick up our year. Just a shame we got Revenge of the Fallen though...",1
433,"I do enjoy this movie. The action is sleek, and the voice actors are top notch, with great special effects. There are several nodds to the series, which is fun for the older fan. It does suffer from being a big action flick, but this is giant robots fighting, so that is pretty much the territory. The Autobot's shine in the film, and that is just the way I like it. Yes, it isn't the most artistic film out there by a long shot, but it is enjoyable!",1
434,"Great Movie! but the first one rocked . that's it. oh, found a transporter in france :)fun to watch: http://www.lookeen.net/de/352/allgemein/deutsch-e-postbrief-lookeen-stellt-sich-der-herausforderung/",1
435,very good popcorn-action-cinema. For fans of the Transformer-series very satisfying.,1
437,"Sure, Transformers is flawed, with a long length and some laughable scenes, but the action, good directing, a script that works, and overall fun humor and entertainment, Transformers is a slightly above average Blockbusters that makes Transformers work in the Hollywood world.",1
438,"First off i rate movies more by the entertainment value not the fancy specifics that make some film ""GREAT"". Well this movie is my Favorite novie of all time. It has intense action, a very interesting story, Awesome and bad ass characters, and some awesome special effects. The story is simple yet highly entertaining. Two kinds of alien robots (the Autobots and the Decepticons) are searching for a power artifact from cybertron called the All-Spark. While the Autobots plan to use the cube( the All Spark) to rebuild their home the decepticons want to use use the cube for evil. Both groups track the cube to Earth. That is the introduction in less awesome words by Optimus Prime leader of the Autobots. Chaos ensues in the next scene as Major Lennox and his team is introduced during an attack on their base in Quatar by a Decepticon. The next character introduced is Sam Witwicky, a teenager hell bent on selling his great grandfathers trinkets used in an expedition to the arctic circle which plays key to the story so he can buy a car. That car turns out to be the Autobot Bumble Bee. And of course Chaos ensues afer that as well. Thats all ill say on the story. The acting is really good if your interested in that,  but the special effects also help make a real unique experience. By far the best movie ever!!!( or for me at least)",1
439,"Pure escapism, total in-your-face intense action from beginning to end. It is a fantastic movie because it makes you feel like a child with a new toy again.",1
440,"Great Movie!!! Very Action packed. It's wasn't the same Transformers that I grew up on. It's very action packed and if you don't like action movies,then you will not like this one. If you don't know what the transformers were about you may not understand the movie. Go with the flow,good movie,great story line, lots of action.",1
441,"It gets a 1 because I have an irrational soft spot for Bumblebee. Everything else is loud noise, explosions, plot holes and exposition that sometimes involves giant robots.",0
442,"Although i would've prefered the Transformers to look more like their original counterparts(especially Megatron in Robot form & Optimus Prime in Vehicle form),& to have the original megatrons voice to add to Peter Cullens Optimus Prime,this is a massively entertaining movie! In terms of story,humour,characters,special effects & action.Thhis movie is definately up there with my other favorates.I dont get the Micheal Bay hating though.He makes great action movies,end of.",1
443,The superb special effects mask what is a shallow storyline but the movie is still worth watching for anybody that has even a feint interest in action movies.,1
445,Typical Michael Bay movie with great Mech fights,1
447,"This movie really caught me off guard, I wasn't expecting the spectacle that is Transformers. From the moment Optimus Prime and the Autobots entered the picture I was truly enamored. Not only does this movie satisfy the action side of me that likes to see things go BOOM, it also has a healthy blend of humor and a good amount of awesome Sci-FI themes as well. The main human protagonists are fairly enjoyable to watch, but I did feel like they had a bit too much screen time, I mean I did come to see a movie called Transformers right? other than that minor complaint I really enjoyed myself, sure the plot was really simple and character development was at a minimum but the sight of those robot on the screen was just mesmerizing. I had never been so convinced by CGI up until that point. Transformers may not be the most faithful adaption to the 80s cartoon show but there is a certain charm to it that just brings out that nostalgic feeling you had when you played with the toys as a kid. This movie is most certainly worth checking out!",1
448,"Things go boom.  Seriously, who expects Dostoyevsky from a Transformers movie?  Pure mindless, action entertainment, if that's what you're looking for in a shiny high graphics package then hey... this is it.  I enjoyed it for that simple pleasure.",1
449,"When Decepticons arose to power, I really hoped they at least wouldresist good to the ""good guys"", but they just had so many flaws andwere so easily destroyed even by humans, well let's put aside theseinconsistencies with reality, the film main audience are naiveteenagers, only they can't get annoyed by film's apartness fromreality. And also implementing a political undertone in the beginningof the film, it doesn't add courageousness when you just repeat""official stance"" on specific matter, would have been much insightful if it was in contrary to the state's stance or even better don't add such a controversial topic as Iran's nuclear program because it's not the only country to have it and I'm pretty much sure no one ever asks or investigates their motives for doing so and it can be said with no doubt, they wouldn't come up with this for no reason or just because they're evil. So minus for adding political propaganda, even if there's a little of it.",1
450,"It was a good movie. With a cool cast and amazing special effects for 2007 It couldn't be terrible. It was actually a brake from one of Michael Bay's outlandish, boring, and incredibly long empty plotlines with only special effects to its name. But this one carrying out 3 stars and a 61 for metascore it's for sure one of his greater films. Maybe even his best(other than The Rock). It was a uniquely sculpted look at the old and loved T.V. series and action figure fad that I loved so much earlier in my life. I thought it was a fine movie and will be remembered by many in the future.",1
452,"I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie when I watched it for the first time but then it grew on me. Michael Bay has had a bumpy track record, sure, but this movie is remarkable even by every other director's standards. The visuals of course, are simply amazing, the acting is solid and the humor hits the mark. It felt often as though they were trying too hard to make this movie a cash grab, however it's still well done.",1
453,"Since seeing Transformers Dark of the Moon, people have asked me to do a review on the other two films so ill start with the first. definitely one of the best action movies made, the effects are spectacular and breathtaking to look at, and with Peter Cullen back as Optimus Prime (the original voice of Prime) It just makes this action film all the better. Many people I know have complained about how, in the final, I dont know, 45 minutes with the whole city fight, everyone was complaining about how, like, ""I can't tell who's who,"" ""Who am I rooting for."" I hear those complaints all the time about this film, and to me, I really didn't have a problem with it, after sitting through 2 hours of this I was pretty used to what each Autobot and Decepticon looked like. For instance, for the Autobots, i could tell it was prime because, everyone knows he's a Semi, but I also knew it was him from the voice and his colors, or say for the decepticons, I knew it was Starscream because of how he is a jet and has jet wings on his back, or Blackout, because he had helicopter propellers on his back, so I didn't have trouble with it. Another complaint I hear with this movie is that, the human scenes and characters are stupid and nobody watches a Transformers movie to watch the humans, personally I didn't mind them. I thought Shia Laboeuf was good, and Anthony Daniels, they were all great funny characters. All I have really left to say is that, the only problem I have with this movie is the police droid Barricade, You see him clearly in the city fight, but he vanishes after they show him driving into the city, and there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, so I have no clue what happened to him, and he isn't in the second film either, he makes a brief cameo in Dark of the Moon, but then he vanishes again just after his leg is shot off. With Starscream they give an explanation that he flew off into space, they even show that in the credits. But overall this is my 5th favorite movie ever",1
454,"Transformers almost feels like an entirely new genre of film. Surprisingly, these robots in disguise actually have personalities, and you want to care for these characters.",1
455,Great visuals and actions with bullets and missiles flying by. This movie is like a complete military showdown. But there should be more actions where the Autobots fight the Deception.,1
458,"There is one thing that Michael Bay likes to do, and its his overwhelming need of dramatising every single thing in front of you, whether its a few soldiers pacing across an airfield, cue epic music, a few people climbing out of a car, cue epic music, this happens over and over again in Transformers, the loud, big-budgeted sci-fi film that is fun, silly and full of massive robots that can only be admired, but the film also brings an over-bearing human element that can way the film down. Bay certainly has an eye for the spectacular and epic, with Transformers being no different, we open with a brief introduction from a booming robotic voice telling us about the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, an ancient alien race from the planet Cybertron who bring their battle to earth in search of the AllSpark, a powerful cube holding vast amounts of energy capable of massive amounts of power and of course, destruction.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the unlucky human caught in the midst of this war, as his grandfather made the discovery of these robots many years before, Sam now hold a pivotal piece to the puzzle which is needed by the Transformers. But this young teen has his own troubles, something we are seemingly forced to care about, a teen drama involving Sam getting the girl, in this case, a beautiful girl called Michaela (Megan Fox), who doesn't have to do very much onscreen except move her body to certain angles so as she can be filmed in certain ways, its wasteful but I suppose necessary, because every film needs the good looking girl, right? This drama along with an over-arching military thread of a story certainly leaves very little room for the Transformers, who become a side note, even though the film is almost 150 mins long. But in terms of spectacle, it doesn't get much bigger than this, the way these robots transforms from vehicle to natural form looks amazing as these aliens tear each other apart in the air and on the ground, special effects don't get much better than these, as the realism of these machines unmatched.There are certainly many things to like about 'Transformers', we have spectacular set-pieces and some heavy lifting robots there to entertain us, but these robots also feel very underused, while the human element starts off light-hearted but becomes serious which in turn is just ludicrous. Even though there is comic relief to be found in John Turturro as a dedicated agent and a small role for the late great Bernie Mac, Transformers has an unlikeable and far too talkative lead in Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky, more focus should definitely been put on the aliens.",1
460,"I hadn't seen this movie in a while and I forgot just how much I enjoyed it. I thought the action sequences were incredible and if nothing else, these make the movie worth watching. However, I also thought the cast was great. Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, and many others make up a deep and talented supporting cast and while Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox both take a lot of heat for various reasons, I thought both of them were fantastic in this film. I also enjoyed how the plots developed. You have varying aspects of the entire story developing separately and with different styles but they merge in the end seamlessly. There were also plenty of funny moments that get some laughs. Most of them of by way of comedic relief characters in the decepticons but a lot of the dialogue was also humorous. Overall, this movie is definitely one of my favorite comic/superhero movies.",1
462,"Now here is a decent action movie. It's not great, but it's definitely not bad. It's kind of what you would expect from Michael Bay, nothing more, nothing less. It doesn't have a great cast, but who cares? Go rent it and have fun!",1
463,"This film was nearly unbearable. The special effects are well done, albeit excessive. I thought the action sequences were lackluster (and those were the main event). Unsurprisingly, I found myself yearning for something greater by the end, but I became cynical about the sequels.",0
464,"This is a giant mess of a movie. Even the action sequences are unable to redeem it. From the very first shot, you will be left in a state of confusion that is never resolved. The plot is all over the place and the piss poor editing is nauseous.",0
466,Perhaps the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie. The transformations are amazing not to mention super-awesome. The CGI fits in seamlessly with the live action and it's easy to forget how logistically difficult a lot of it would have been to film.,1
467,"Good action, a pretty good story, hot girls, and giant transforming machines are what Transformers offers, and delivers superbly.  I had the pleasure of seeing this for the first time in a drive-in theatre on a mild summer night.  Everybody, and I mean everybody, had their vehicles open and the sound pouring out, and it made for an excellent experience.",1
468,Michael Bay has finally made a good film. The story was rock solid with visuals that were excellent. Even though I don't care for Megan Fox as an actress she didn't do a horrible job. I think everyone would enjoy this film.,1
471,"""Transformers"" is an entertaining explosive summer movie directed by Michael Bay. Like all Bay movies, the script is pretty weak but the action is exhilarating. However, ""Transformers"" has a pretty good plot combined with excellent CGI, making this Bay movie a recommended summer blockbuster.",1
473,"Well with Age of Extinction right around the corner I figured there was no better time to look at the movie that started it all. The plot is actually better than you'd expect in a giant robots fighting movie, with the Autobots trying to find the Allspark before the Decepticons who all have really cool names (my profile is named after Starscream so I guess I'm kind of biased) The acting's not bad either all though it's funny to watch now since we all know what became of Shia LaBouef. But of course the action's all that matters and while I feel that this is the weakest of the trilogy in terms of action, watching two robots fight it out in the middle of a crowded city never gets old. However by far the most important aspect of this movie is that it introduced a generation of new fans to one of the greatest sci-fi sagas ever told, which is certainly something to be proud of.",1
476,"I don't know why people hate this film because there is no ""philosophical messages""; just light and noise. And? The TV series were just like this. Michael Bay just did what he had to do: resurrect Transformers, with spectacular visual effects and amazing action. I'm Spanish, so I say... Viva Transformers y un aplauso para Michael Bay.",1
479,"I never really expect this movie to be anything, since I never imagined that a live action version would work at all. BUT, I hate to say it, Michael Bay didn't do a bad job with this movie (I feel so dirty right now!) This movie acts as a great introduction to the transformers and does a decent job making them believable and reintroducing them to this generation while still showing respect to its fans (not as much as they could have, but enough.) Overall: A fun movie that did its job and reawakened my love of the Transformers franchise.",1
480,"This is not a good movie at all. The story is extremely dull and it's pretty much about big explosions and special effects, but I'm sure you already knew that. I'm also pretty sure that the characters were intentionally designed for you to hate all of them by the writers. So to summarize this awful movie in short, terrible story and characters. Absolutely nothing but special effects.",0
482,"The only good movie in the series.  Unlike it's sequels the action is very impressive, instead of annoying, the humor works, instead of giving headaches, and the scenes with human characters are actually passable.  The story needs some work, and it can at times be kind of stupid, but it's nowhere near the shear mental handicappedness of its sequels screenplays.  It's not anywhere near perfect, but it shows that the franchise had potential and could be entertaining at one point.  Why did revenge of the fallen have to be such a huge disappointment?  Did they even try to make a decent sequel?  I don't think so.",1
483,"Transformers is a great Science- Fiction/ Action movie because it kept me entertained the entire time and it never lost my interest once. Plus the acting, special effects, action scenes, dialogue, humor, and the awesome climax all combined make one heck of an action movie. P.S., Even though it's 144 minutes long, it doesn't matter because you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time.",1
484,this movie is surprisingly good  i don't normally like movies with massive technology and massive production but this movie took me by surprise  with it's great story  original idea  great performance by Shia LaBeouf and i loved the transformations in this movie and the comedy was actually pretty good.,1
485,"This movie has got really good effects. Also it doesn't gets you bored. There is some funny part, some dramatic parts. This movie is full of action. If you want to watch a movie which do you want to impress you then you should watch this movie.",1
486,"I think out of all of Michael Bay's movies this one was surprisingly his best. This was a fun action-packed thrill ride. Bay does tend to (at times) throws in some stupid humorous scenes that distracts the story. Like the scene when Sam's parents barge into his room. That scene was completely unrelevant. Plus Sam's ""mom"" is just so freakin weird. But thank God he doesn't do as much as his other films. Overall, this was an enjoyable action thriller that re-defines Hasbro's classic.",1
488,"A solid start to a shaky trilogy, the action was mind-blowing and the acting wasn't bad either. The last battle between Optimus and Megatron topped off a strong movie",1
490,"I don't like long multiple plug for products in movie it is shameful Bay needs to learn commercials are for tv not movies. Cliche after cliche is annoying nerd gets hot girl,government incompetent until the end etc. Micheal 'the butcher' Bay does it again. But is was entertainment non the less.",0
492,"This is how Michael Bay make horrible movies into good, explosive, and entertaining summer movies. The fans of the classic Transformers franchise or the old-school Michael Bay movies won't be disappointed watching this.",1
493,"Like any typical Michael Bay film, the action and explosions come in the masses, but the story seems to have forgotten to be believable. But, did you see Transformers for a tightly plotted story, or to have a deluxe popcorn movie? That's what I thought.",1
494,"It's a film about explosions, but rest assured, you can look past the dizzying plot and unlikable characters to see that it's just a film about really awesome robots fighting each other.",1
495,"man I loved this movie so much when I was little and I don't blame my little self, this movie was one hell of a ride when it got to the action! the action was amazing I just couldn't turn away! but the only downside was Micheal bay putting in a love story, I'm tired of seeing love stories in movies.",1
496,"Transformers is visually stunning and has thrilling action sequences, but offers very little depth, extremely poor character development, and is mostly brainless.",1
497,"What's this? Michael Bay actually making a good film? 'Tis true, ""Transformers"" is actually a pretty good film. Sure, it's characters aren't amazing, and it's a little too long, but ""Transformers"" is one of the few movies that actually ends up being a great time, even if it's only great for its visuals and action. But man, the action scenes are fantastic. It's not cinematic brilliance, but Michael Bay has crafted a nice film in ""Transformers"" and it's definitely worth one watch.",1
498,"The film that destroyed almost every shred of faith I ever had in ""blockbuster"" movies. How Michael Bay can make a fight between two giant CGI robots one of the most boring things I've ever witnessed, I will never know...and for this reason, I'm forced to categorise this as an ""art film"" ('cause Lord knows, I certainly didn't ""understand"" it)!",0
499,"Good start to the franchise, could have been better had Bay focused on the Transformers and less on the underdeveloped human characters. Its a good technical achievementm the special effects still hold up well when Bay assaults your eyes and brains with his usual ""Bay-isms""",1
501,"Demolition success of Michael Bay, the effects are great and amazing fights. No doubt the work that I create this amazing movie.The only bad thing was the footage, because I found something bad. But otherwise, this perfect.",1
503,"Aliens make Earth their final battleground. As the forces of evil seek the key to ultimate power, Earth's last chance for survival rest in the hands of young Sam Witwicky.",1
504,"I'm not a huge fan of Michael Bay but this movie is just wow!The movie have one of the best visual i have ever seen,and there is a lot of action.The only bad point is in the fights scene because the camera is always moving and we can see a single thing.",1
506,"Technically speaking fellows and ..girls My REAL rating for this movie is a 8.5/10. I just rounded this number and it goes to a 9 , to be fair. Too bad metacritic doesn't allow you to give a rating like a ""8.5"" DUE TO THE FACT THERE IS A DECIMAL. But anyway, now that you know my real score, Transformers, is one of the BEST CGI FLICKS I HAVE EVER SEEN. And many reviews hold this line. Looks like Michael Bay has spitted out his inner self with this film, lots of behemoth bots smashing things up and the robots are just plain cool looking when transforming into earth's everyday machines. I am so glad I got this movie on Blu-Ray ( got the blu-ray player on black friday (2014). Hopefully, I'll see the movie in 3D or 4K one day. Transformers is a definite fun summer blockbuster movie and something new and fresh to see on the screen. Transformers have transformed people into fans and this will satisfy in the amazing CGI action route for pratically EVERYONE.",1
507,"After watching Transformers, I must pay homage to director Michael Bay for sharing his recreational interests with the rest of the world. Until this moment, I knew little about his fierce fervour towards the field of alchemy. But now I perceive him as a perfectionist. He has somehow turned human excrement into film.Transformers is a 2 and 1/2 hour long video game that the audience isn't allowed to play. On the IMDB trivia page it says 'The most amazing thing about Transformers is that they set the release date without a completed script'. I beg to differ. The most amazing thing about Transformers is that they finished filming without a completed script. Transformers is contrived, convoluted and incoherent on so many levels that most would call it unworthy of serious examination. Transformers isn't only critic-proof, it resists serious criticism. You might as well analyse a beach ball. The immoderate overload of CGI, ugly set-pieces and mind numbing action made it impossible for me to shut my eyes and dream of a better movie. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. Apparently Michael Bay was inspired by David Cronenberg's 1996 film Crash. And now that I think about it, I can see the mild resemblance. Both movies are like watching automobile accidents. Only one was intended to be. Add it all up, and what you've got here is a waste of good electricity. I'm not talking about the electricity between the actors. I'm talking about the current to the projector.",0
508,Transformers (2007) is an awsome movie. The CGI effects are so great that they look real. The action is amazing. The transformers are great. I recement this movie to people who loves giant robots and much action (There are small action scenes in the first half and a big battle in the end).,1
512,"I guess this one's good.  Entertaining in a very Michael Bay-ish way, but still fairly solid in its own right.  The action was good, the effects were great, and the humor wasn't all too bad either.",1
513,"Muy bien hecha, la historia, los efectos y las secuencias de acción son entretenidas y muy bien elaboradas (la mejor de todas) Es triste como la primera parte de esta saga es lo mejor que hicieron en tantos años, pues a pesar de contar con efectos de sobra y chistes a veces tontos, la historia tiene sentido.",1
514,"Tra tutti i film live action basati su una serie animata,su un fumetto oppure su dei super eroi in particolare,Transformers rimarrà per me uno dei migliori mai creati,una saga che inizia bene e continua ancora meglio,infatti il quarto capitolo è per ora il migliore della quadrilogia,a mio parere.",1

516,"Yes, this is one of my most favourite films! Even though i'm not really a fan of G1 Transformers. I love this film so much! The only problem is that it has less action than it's sequels",1
517,Transformers is a movie filled with solid characters and fantastic CGI and fight scenes. The running time could've been shortened but overall a great movie. Peter Cullen did an amazing job at voicing Optimus Prime as well! 8/10 (great),1
519,"Although, essentially, far from the quality of the original anime series, Bay's first installment of his commercially successful yet critically hammered money-magnet series was quite good. It offered a new perspective on animation and it certainly elevated the technique. The plot was actually quite good, lacking any major holes or inconsistencies and you could certainly enjoy the full length of the movie without actually wanting it to stop. The actions scenes, so characteristic for Bay and his work, actually had a measure and the movie gave you just the right dose of such scenes not to bore you or laugh you to death. The Transformers were crafted in a very interesting way, adding dynamics to the somewhat too robotic interpretation we've seen in the animated series. The only thing you couldn't actually ignore were Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf. Megan is a really, really bad actress... I don't have anything else to add. Shia has, in some of his more recent roles, shown a certain amount of skill, but his role in the Transformers series wasn't all that good. You just couldn't get past the irritating teenager act and he never actually tried to elevate that, despite certain possibilities. On the other hand, Turturro was a definite scene-stealer, but even Bay can't eliminate the quality of John Turturro. All in all, the first Transformers film was a well-realized project that actually gave us high hopes which were, sadly, annulled throughout the years. Something worth watching, certainly, even for those who aren't Transformers fans, but still, note that you shouldn't expect more than a better-than-average action movie with giant robots transforming into all kinds off stuff.",1
520,"You can't go into this movie expecting THAT much, but for action it delivered the goods like no other movie in 2008. Sure, Bay has no shame, and he uses every cliche in the book, but it's still a fun ride, and Shia LeBeouf adds some weight to the mayhem. If nothing else, rent it for Megan Fox, man...seriously...",1
521,"Of all the films that Michael Bay has directed, this and 'The Rock' (1996) are some of his cleanest ones. However, I think that if 'The Rock' didn't exist, this film would be a 9 or even a 10. But it gets an average 7 and here's why. 'Transformers' follows the story of a young, high school boy named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) who gets caught in an incident when a group of autobots want his grandfather's glasses that contain some secret piece of information. The lead autobot is Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) who wants Sam's help to retrieve theses glasses and keep it away from the evil Decepiticons. Sam has a car that is also a transformer who is called ""Bumblebee"", and can only communicate with Sam via radio stations. Megan Fox plays Mikaela, Sam's love interest, who sticks around because the screenplay says so. While convincing acting can be tough to come from Fox, these two actors do have very good chemistry together and they seem convincing as a couple. Why she sticks around during all this robot rumble though can be a little hard to believe. The film's biggest weakness however, is the comedy. We've seen elements of comedy in past action movies, but they were always subtle and the director's of those films didn't rely on funny one-liners or ironic incidents to keep their movies at an entertaining pace. Another weakness is the run-time, while 'Transformers' isn't the most difficult movie to sit through with all the robot destruction and explosive action, the run time can make it feel like you're sitting through an extended edition of 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003). The film goes on for half an hour too long, and you know it's a problem when you stop caring for the characters after having seen what they've gone through in the first two hours. Michael Bay is a very ambitious director, famous for not being so respected with film critics and typical movie-goers, but here, he has demonstrated that maybe he can direct an action film, a ""Transformers"" film at that. I never grew up with the Hasbro Transformers toys as a child, I was more of a Lego kid. Maybe my opinion on this film may not count, but, you either judge this as a film based on toys, or you judge it as an action film in general...I think action fans will get what they deserve, but overall, there has been better.",1
522,"This movie might espouse some jarring Michael Bay oversexualisation and explosions, but there is no doubt that this film is a great, and the only good Bayformers film. Endearing nods to the cartoon, epic soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky, interesting story, good acting, amazing action and CGI, and a perfect amount of human-Transformer interaction. Bay hit it out of the park. I just wish the other 4 films had been made with love and care like this one.",1
523,"61? 6.9? Are you serious? I will say again, as I've said in previous reviews I can't stand that this site has credibility when it rates something like Transformers, the original movie that spawned the most brilliant CGI and action that we've seen in our lifetime, a 6.5/10. Not to mention the huge budget it provided for the next, whatever, 8 they've made since then, that probably have higher ratings on this site. But I guess I'm here to try to swing the pendulum. Michael Bay forged the future of movies and action movies but nobody wants to give the movie the credit it deserves. Not to mention, this franchise is the 11th highest grossing of all-time. By fact, and by way of cause-effect, that couldn't have happened without a good starting movie.",1
524,"Сценарий слаб, но эффекты спустя 10 лет до сих пор смотрятся потрясающе. Всё таки - это лучший фильм в серии, чем дальше, тем хуже. Итог: Поклонникам боевиков рекомендую к просмотру.",1
526,"This movie is pretty amazing. By far, one of the best of Michael Bay's career. Its a pretty good adaptation that stayed true to the cartoon. Had good acting, groundbreaking CGI, plenty of entertaining action. This is one of the movies that the military would very much be involved and they are incorporated into this movie well. Of course, this movie had some Michael Bay-isms and some of them worked well in the movie like the explosions. But of course, we had the others that were unneeded but still, very easy to overlook because of how great the rest of the film was. Loved it when I first saw it and I still love it now.",1
527,Transformers is a fun action popcorn flick with plenty of entertainment value and likable characters and survives the poor script and stereotypical humour,1
528,"When it comes to Transformers, I have no ax to grind, pro or con. For me, it's just another loud, plot-deficient summer motion picture. In this case, nostalgia doesn't grip me - I'm too old to have played with the gadgets or watched the cartoon. I'm sure many fanboys (and girls) will be delighted by what Michael Bay has done to update the Transformers mythos (basically, that means incorporating A-level special effects and blowing lots of things up). On the other hand, those with no particular emotional attachment to the toys and their multimedia offshoots may dislike this movie as much as I did. Thus far, the summer of 2007 has been full of very loud, very unsatisfying action movies. Transformers tops them all - it's louder, flashier, and more hollow than anything else out there. At 135 minutes, it drags - sometimes painfully so. The movie is top-heavy with exposition, and the only decent action scenes occur in the final 25 minutes. Despite an epileptic camera, those sequences are impressive from a special effects point-of-view, but they aren't exciting. That's because the characters are so poorly developed and the Transformers so singularly uninteresting that the question of who wins or loses doesn't matter. All the effort behind Transformers went into making the robots look cool; nothing went into developing a compelling storyline. Even the headline bout between Optimus Prime and Megatron is pedestrian - two big metallic monsters slugging it out while the camera spins around them as if out of control. It's kind of reminiscent of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots going at it. If the dialogue is anything to go by, Bay has a sense of humor. Not only does he take a moment to poke fun at one of his earlier hit movies, but he allows so many howlingly bad lines to be spoken that the level of self-parody has to be intentional. Transformers is a jumble of the good, the bad, and the ugly, with the latter two categories outweighing the former. The film has a lot of nice touches (such as the opening attack in Qatar, where there is a sense of danger, and the John Hughes-inspired introduction of Sam), but the meat of the story is plodding, recycled sci-fi drivel. That, I suppose, is what happens when a major motion picture is based on a 20-plus year old toy phenomenon. Transformers is so belabored that it makes Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End seem like a masterpiece of pacing. It makes that ""classic"" midsummer alien invasion movie, Independence Day, seem like a template for inventive plotting and solid character development. Even by Michael Bay standards, this movie is vapid. Yes, there are plenty of explosions, but those are a dime-a-dozen these days; even Discovery Channel's Mythbusters has them. Transformers isn't clean, big-budget fun; it's clean, big-budget tedium. For Transformers fans, I suppose this is a dream motion picture. For everyone else, it's a nightmare.",0
529,"Transformers is a full action packed, funny and thrilling movie but in some aspects like the story and screenplay are pretty messy. But in general is a BADASS MOVIE.",1
530,This is the best movie ever it has lot of action and its just very very great. Transformers are all epic and thei battle is really great made. Sequels arent as good as this one but they are good too.,1
531,"Transformers is not the smartest movie out there, but it is a ton of fun. Michael Bay managed to create a mediocre adaptation of the Transformers animated series and probably his best film to date. It does have poor character development and acting performances, but the action sequences were so intriguing, that we almost forget the fact that they have these flaws. We expected a spine-chilling, robot-rumbling film and thats what we got. Rating: 7/10 A+ = 10A = 9A- = 8B+ = 7B = 6B- = 5C+ = 4C = 3C- = 2.5D+ = 2D = 1.5D- = 1F = 0",1

535,"Transformers is a perfectly functional blockbuster. It's shot and acted well, and has some thrilling action bolstered by incredible visual effects. It's light and fluffy entertainment done mostly right. There's not much beneath the surface, and some needless toilet humor pops up here and there, but all things considered, it's a mostly good time if you're looking to waste a few hours.",1
536,Action packed sci-fi movie with some dad/mom jokes thrown in to keep it light now and again.,1
537,"It's usual Michael Bay stuff - close-ups of hot chicks, top-notch special effects, and slow motion in front of american flags or helicopters with dusk or dawn in the background. The action is fun to watch and that's all you really need to know.",1
538,"Pros: -Really good action scenes.-The actors are doing a pretty solid job.-The human characters, while a bit generic, are likable enough.-Decent score.Cons:-The human characters, while likable enough, are still kinda generic. I honestly wasn’t expecting them to be super deep since this is Michael Bay, who is notorious for making style over substance films, but that still doesn’t excuse it. -Not all of the attempts at humor land.-Certain things in the ending, such as the Allspark killing Megatron and Bumblebee getting his voice back out of nowhere, could have been explained better.Final verdict: Transformers 1 is a pretty decent sci-fi action thriller that is easily still the second best Transformers movie (based on what I have heard, I have not seen any of the other Transformers movies aside from Bumblebee) and I would say that if you are interested it is worth checking out. However if you want a REALLY good Transformers movie, I’d still say go watch Bumblebee before this.",1
539,"I love this movie so much i don't know why people hate this movie and all the movies in the trilogy. I can agree some of the parts can get a little weird, it has awesome CGI.

From terrible characters to dialogue sounding like a 12-year-old write, this movie doesn't and will never hold up for the years to come.  I hate this movie and the entire series as a whole and it was painful to watch this entire series be around as long as it was under Michael Bay.",0
547,"It wasn't perfect, but at least it was decent and very entertaining. Cgi, realistic design of the robots, and the action were just outstanding. Some people are complaining about charactar development in this film, but unlike the other bay movies, at least it has. And plot was also okay though.(all the scenes have make sense)Overall, Bay made decent film as the blockbuster 'popcorn' movie. And people loved it when this movie came out. People rated it 85% in Rotten tomatoes.",1
548,"It’s a story about fighting for peace. He didn’t realize that the car was a robot, who came from the other planet to find the rare box. Sam Witwicky got the car and he began to know that the car was a robot, Bumblebee. The robot explains to him that he comes to the earth with his teammates the rare box. The boy was exciting at that time and suddenly, he began to feel good because he knew that the robot is good and help to save the world. After that, they collaborated together to overcome the evil and tried to find those box. They were trying to escape every obstacle and saved the people's life from the bad things. Finally, they found the rare box and help the world to live with peace. Sometimes this story is hard to follow because it’s a kind of Sci-fi action movie. Some scenes I understand, but some scenes not. One thing I felt happy with this movie is, it’s predictable because I knew much about the action movies which are always happy at the end. Obviously, I love this movie because of its realistic, technology, and scientific. I will spend my time to watch another part of the movies very soon!!!",1
549,A classic giant robot flick with explosions and the ushering of the Michael Bay kind of movies.,1

551,Michael Bay's first Transformers movie is truly fun. It might not be perfect but it still boasts tons of exciting action that will entertain both kids and adults. The cast is solid and the CG1 is undeniably great. I just wish the sequels were like the original 2007 Transformers movie,1

553,"This movie is one of Bay's best. Even though the story isn't that great and the characters needed more development, kickass Transformers action and awesome Transformer characters make this movie worth while.",1
554,"Being a huge fan of the 1986 film, I felt obligated to see this new movie. I regret going to that theater. Somehow we all bought into the hype for it, despite the director's apparent fetishes. Michael Bay, the man who practically copyrighted explosions, gives us 3 hours of product placement, vaguely relevant references and rampant perversion. I looked at it in 2007 like a sub-par movie, now I look at it with disgust.",0
555,"ok, so when i was in year 7 my science teacher got some oreos and explained how the tectonic plates work i was pretty fun. untill i shat my pants in front of the whole class.",1
