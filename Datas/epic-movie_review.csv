0,"Worst ""comedy"" I think I have ever seen. The only reason I give it a single point was that some of the jokes were almost worth a chuckle. Almost. But everything else about this piece of crap just stinks.",0
1,"Seltzerberg are the worse directors ever. As bad as they are, at least Ed Wood films have camp value and Uwe Boll made Rampage.Seltzerberg, Epic Movie including, has no redeeming value whatsoever. Words can't describe the horrible abomination that is Epic Movie.",0
2,"Scary Movie is way better. this movie sucks. if people like it, thats fine with me.",0
3,"A poor excuse for a parody, heck it's even a poor excuse for a movie, it's just so stupid, I hated every second of it, even if your a fan of the writers you'll hate this movie.",0
4,Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer don't know a lot about directing movies. Its more like a Moronic Movie than an Epic Movie because they make morons out of too many actors from too many good movies. Especially Kal Penn and Crispin Glover.,0
5,The makes of Epic Movie managed to put in a ridiculous number of movie references. Too bad no one told them that wasn't enough. This movie just isn't funny.,0
6,"A mindless film made by two directors without talent, with lame gags, unfunny stereotypes of homosexuals and expensive sets. Friedberg and Seltzer must sell hot dogs instead direct any film.",0
7,I think most people will agree with me when I say that Epic Movie.......is an Epic Fail. It may not be as bad as Disaster Movie but that doesn't stop it from being totally unfunny and cringingly bad.,0
8,"Hey look Entertainment Weekly gave this movie a good score! How about that?! Anyways, this movie is just 'Disaster Movie' except they got the title wrong this time.",0
9,"Pointless, crass, and not even funny in a vulgar way. Someone should unleash the hounds of hell to hunt down the people who make these films, they're representative of everything that blows in America. There are boatloads of movies that are decent, so why shell out your bread on this kind of empty-headed crap?",0
11, One funny part: When Crispin Glover danced to Fergalicious. Juss fast forward to that and consider yourself lucky.,0
12," The only worse movie than this is, meet the Spartans.",0
13, Painfully unfunny one of the worst movies i have ever watched. people who like this shit have no taste.,0
14,"Gross, and weirdly under-produced for the budget it had, Epic Movie truly feels like an overly-long 2007 era YouTube video. It's just so humorless and cobbled together that it barely stands up as a movie. It's just a long list of bland references and disgusting, poorly delivered ""jokes"" that just grate on the viewer without end. This movie is so horribly paced that even though its under an hour and a half that it feels like three hours. It gets one point from me because it got exactly one snort of laughter from me.",0
15,"Not Epic In The SlightestEpic Movie is a poor excuse of a comedy with painfully bad jokes, The parodies feel forced and awkward, And the acting is awful.",0
16,"What saves this from being a 2 or lower for me is that I like the main structure of the story. I would like to see a Narnia parody and a Wonka parody.But the references, toilet humor, and other distractions come in and ruin the experience.",0
17,Awful picture!! The directors of this movie are absolutely stupid. One of the worst films ever made. Never ever try to watch it. You will waste your money and your free time!! An epic fail!,0
19," Loads of low reviews, these people don't know what an AKA Scary movie but with epic porportions is. This is more entertaining, funny, and overall amazing than any of the scary movies.",1
20,MOST GREATEST PEICE OF ART I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! :)  GREAT STORY! GREAT ACTORS! GREAT SCREENPLAY!!! YOU CAN REALLY RELATE TO THE CHARACTERS!!! GREAT EVERYTHING. I GIVE IT A 10 AND THAT RARELY EVER DO THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :),1
21, Excellent movie. The setting is marvellous. Story is great.,1
22," Hilarious entertainment that mangaged to be worth 10 dollers for once. The spoofs were brilliant, and I was dying of laughter by the end. My stomach still hurts.",1
23," How can people not like this movie? It was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and it did what it was meant to do: spoof epic movies and be funny. My whole theater was laughing through the whole movie, and we all clapped at the end (and not because we were glad it was over). I loved it!",1
24, This movie was so hilarious that I couldn't stop laughing. They did excellent on there screenplay and did a fine job on there acting as well. This movie was probably the funniest movie I've ever watched in my entire life. 5 days later and I'm still laughing. Ha Ha Ha!,1
25, This movie is great but the a lot of people have no sence of humor and think it is stupid.,1
26," I don't know why everyone hates this movie so much! It was an ok movie with some funny stuff in it, but it wasn't terrible!",1
27, There are so many bad reviews of this film that it's unbelievable! this sort of film if not meant to have a clever storyline with plot twists and built up characters. It is just simple daft commedy and I loved it! There is nothing more frustrating than seeing a film that you don't quite get or makes you feel rubbish by the end of it. This film is a gag a minute and as long as you're up for mindless violence and constant stupid humour (which I so am!) you'll love it too. People need to stop over thinking this film. It's daft! It's FAB!!!,1
28," Very amusing, in some parts childish but ties in well known charecters much better than previous 'movie' titles",1
29," People actually think this s**t is FUNNY ?!?!?! How do you work that? The plot is thinner than water-based tomato soup, the lines are written with nothing on the brain but vulgarity and lame pop-culture references, the ""parodies"" are not, in fact, parodies at all, merely a bunch of nobody actors playing dress-up, and two minutes cannot go by without someone getting beaten up/ killed, splattered with excretement of some kind, sexually violated/exposed, insulted, or madly burst into breakdancing and rapping. This movie is nothing but hostile and offensive, and should have been rated R. F**K YOU JASON FRIEDBURG AND AARON SELTZER!!! Do us all a favor and stop making this s**t!!!",0
30, This movie is so funny! Laughs from beginning to end! A+++ Would see again!,1
31," This movie was so bad I walked out during the previews. I agree with the San Francisco paper; only a complete idiot could think Epic Movie is remotely funny. But yet, people give it a 10 while they say things like ""It was an ok movie with some funny stuff in it, but it wasn't terrible!"" That sentence doesn't even make any sense! And some how ""It was ok"" warrants a 10?",0
32, I have too say that this is the funnyest moovie i ever scene in my intire life. Who says I have to bee dum to luv this grate fillum. I isnt an i tinked it was grate. Grate comidy 100% out of 10,0
33," If you think that this movie is funny, if you thought it was hilarious, if you so much as considered seeing it again, you are a retarded, childish nincompoop. Yes, I did just use the word nincompoop. That's 'cause I mean it. It seems like the people who produced this movie just stopped trying to make it be even halfway good. It's a steaming pile of human excrement, but considering the ironic box-office turnout, it's a gold-plated one.",0
34, There are just no words to describe how awful and senseless this movie really is! Whoever actually went through the making of this film should have their eyes gouged out!,0
35," Absolute rubbish, painfully contrived, and humorless.",0
36, Worst movie ever; it seems like something some college students made for MySpace.,0
37," This is one of those movies where the protocol is obvious. Anyone who saw it and has any brains or any real sense of humor will find this movie to be insanely bad comedy. Then on the other side of the coin if you watched the movie and are dumb as a rock, or have a sense of humor that laughed everytime someone got hit in this movie, then you'll love it.",0
38," Awful movie. Only funny moment was Silas hitting himself madly and Jack Swallows thin kwas quite funny. honestly, crispin glove rneeds to do better films other wise his nice career would be destroyed too.",0
39," Being a 14 year pld girl, who loves a good parody film, I went along to this. Terrible. Not one funny line, worst movie I have ever seen.",0
40," Absolutely terrible. This movie is vulgar and very inappropriate. I got it at Blockbuster and thought it would be a crack up like Napolean Dynomite, but instead it was an inappropriate, once again, vulgar movie. And you wonder where these 10, 11, 12, 13 etc. year olds are getting their vulgar stuff from. What kind of looney would make such a movie?!",0
41, Found it funny when I was 13. Not ever since.,0
42," It's as funny as watching your house burn down. The spoofs are as spoof-like as Hitler and Ghandi. The jokes rely on potty humour. The acting relies on potty humor. The stupidness of the jokes that made Airplane!, Hot Shots! and the Naked Gun so brilliant is taken so overboard, that they are not even stupid anymore but a cry for help from 2 of the 6 writers of scary movie that asks: ""SOMEONE PLEASE TELL US WHAT A GOOD JOKE FOR THIS SCENE WILL BE? OK WE""LL JUST THROW IN SOMEONE GETTING RUN OVER"" As you can tell, I didn't like Epic Movie that much.",0
43," There was no plot, no meaning, no movie really. But if you saw at least 5 of the 200 movies it makes fun of, you will find yourslef laughing pretty hard. I had seen basically every movie it made fun of, except maybe Nacho Libre...and I laughed very hard. It all comes down to how many movies you have seen that it makes fun of.",1
44, Wow! This movie is just as bad as Date Movie. I hope no one is actually going to see this. The only good part was the Borat person.,0
45, Absolutely terrible. Unfunny except for a couple decent scenes. This kind a trash should go straight to video.,0
46," This was the very worst movie I have ever seen. Besides it's poor effort to make a joke, the flow of the movie was so bad that you could nap during the awkward moments and empty scenes.",0
47," This movie is garbage, It really thought it was stupid that they made fun of Borat, cause borat is alrdy a joke, It kind sucks that this movie is gonna sell alot, Good OL usa for ya",0
48,"The movie was kinda stupid and corny, it had its funny moments but it was still kinda dumb.",0
49,"How could anyone go into this movie expecting some ""good stuff""? did you see the trailer? honestly, they won't stop making s*** til people stop going to see this crap.",0
50," Don't waste your time... Burn the money, it's funnier and clever.",0
51," The only reason it got a 1 from me was because it did, on occasion, make me laugh. The movie itself was a full hour and a half of stupid gags and an awful plot. The people meant to mock Hollywood stars did have some qualities of the original acctors, but were often poor representations of the original. The movie was boring and stupid for the most part.",0
52," This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Craftsmanship was awful. Jokes lame. Should of been a 10 minute skit at most. The writers and directors must have pictures of somebody and a goat to of had this crap made. Ishtar has some seriuos competition. I will never see a movie that Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer and Paul Schiff are involved in. I'm surprised they even put their names on it. I'm pissed, feel insulted and want my money back. You guys owe me $28.50 and 86 minutes of my life. Anybody who rates this above a ""0"" must be related to the fruit cakes who made this garbage. Do not see this movie!",0
53, This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I dont know how you people think it's bad. If you have seen half of the movies it makes fun of its hilarious,1
54," Dude. Worst. Movie. Ever. That I ever seen. Ever. Lazy and silly to the point of brain-melting confusion. It haunts my dreams that movies like this can be green-lighted these days or that this opened at number 1! What's wrong with you, America!? Shame on you for liking this! Or even being duped by the ads into thinking that you would like this! Laziness makes this sad!",0
55," Finding out that I had terminal cancer wasn't nearly as terrible as this ""film"".",0
56," Utter s***e, only watched cuz one of my mates thought it'd be 'well funneh'. Gets 1 cos the guy who plays Jack Sparrow actually looks/sounds like him. Other than that, it'd be funnier to burn your money. Seriously :)",0
57," The worst film I have ever seen. The entire film is a crude, braindead, unfunny, childish parody that may as well have been dreamed up by a five year old.",0
58," Le parti veramente divertenti sono poche, e io mi aspettavo un film meno volgare.",0
60," Definitely a piece of sh.t, impressions were terrible and there were no great jokes. Parody films are getting worse and worse.",0
61," I'm a big fan of spoofs, and even though I had heard this movie was bad I still wanted to see for myself, hoping it was stupid enough to make me laugh. Yes, it was stupid, but in the worst way possible. All of the spoofs boasted in the commercials lasted for maybe 30 seconds. The acting was horrible. I feel like they had a lot of good material from recent movies to work with, but they failed miserably.",0
62, Worst film I have ever seen. It's so disgustingly unfunny I don't see how anyone can think it is worthy of 1 penny to see it.,0
63, I can't believe someone with a brain produced this. i wish that i had never seen it.,0
64," They put so much effort into duplicating the costumes and locations of the movies they're imitating, but they forgot to make it entertaining. ""Epic movie"" is not funny; in fact it becomes very irritating very quickly. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
65, The only funny thing about this movie is the terrible reviews it received.,0
67, This movie is totally epic because it is so bad.,0
68," I will be honest this is only good if you watch it for the first time and are in a good mood or if you are really bored. However, there are some extremely funny moments in this film that are hard not to laugh at.",1
69," This movie sucked. I liked the Scary Movies (even the 4th one gave me a few laughs), Date Movie was a real let down but this is just horrible. Only two mildly funny bits- the Cribs ripoff (complete with flatscreens in the toilet bowl) and the bit where Kanye West popped up and said the White Bitch didn't care about black people. After that, nothing. Just a whole bunch of unfunny jokes and cringe worthy musical numbers. Were these guys trying to make a comedy or a musical? It's like they saw Idlewild and thought the idea of a 'hip-hop musical' was good, so all of a sudden everyone in the film starts breakdancing for no reason, scratch decks materialise out of thin air and everyone starts rapping. And this happens every five minutes. It's pathetic and definitely not funny. Some advice for Mr '2 of the 6 writer of Scary Movie'- cut out all the dumbass 'whiteys trying to be black' musical numbers. Instead, focus on writing some decent jokes, link them together with a serviceable story and your next film may be almost watchable.",0
70, As American,0
71," Well I was looking for a mindless, funny, spoof that pokes fun at other films...It was a hard week. I was not disappointed! Some of it was actually funny. I was surprised at the Sasha look alike he had me fooled as Borat... I think that guy was the highlight for me.",1
72, Possibly the worst movie we ever saw. And I did not have high expectations for this movie. It made date movie seem like a masterpeice.,0
73, I like comedies but there wasn't even a funny scene in the whole movie. I couldn't wait for this to end.,0
74," Without a doubt, hands-down, the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life.",0
75, Painful to watch.,0
76," I'm a 28 year old guy who enjoys a good laugh every now and then. Unfortunately this movie didn't give it to me. I've seen a lot of movies in theaters, and this is the ONLY movie I've ever walked out on halfway through. It's that bad.",0
77," Even going in with the lowest of expectations, I was disappointed. Everything was forced and nothing was funny.",0
79," Their next movie should be called stupid movie, and it should make fun of their last four flops.",0
80," Dumb, dumb, dumb!!! I made it through the whole movie, but that was because I had my I Pod and took a nap. My son, who's 14, throught it somewhat funny but said all the good parts were in the tv ads.",0
81," One word to sum it up: Atrocious P.S.- I got a refund because the employees at the venue agreed with me that this was the worst movie since ""Fudgepackersonice""",0
82," ""Date Movie"" was funnier than this turd. Awful acting and the immeasurable talents of Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard go entriely to waste. I was expecting this movie to be stupid-funny. Instead it was stupid-stupid.",0
83," God this movie is so funny! ""I'm Harry Potter! Aren't you a little old for still going to this school? Non sense! I'm fourteen!"" ""This message will not self-destruct in 1 second!""",1
85,"This movie was garbage. How can you expect it to be somewhat decent after date moive, and the last two scary movies. They need to go back to the original writers and director and make a good, funny comedy that will make me crack up. Im not saying toilet humor and all the crap in Epic Movie is bad, but make it funny and make me laugh like you did with the first two scarry movies please!",0
86," No good. The parodies were off mark an they weren't funny. Maybe if you are a ten year old who enjoys fart jokes you'll enjoy this. For everyone else who has taste, this is rubbish. It's not a good sign when the movie looks as bad as Scary movie 4, and that was a piece of crapola as well.",0
87, What people don't know is that these are actually 2 of the original writers of the first 2 scary movies. Not the 3 and 4th. So when you say that bring back the original writers... that's these guys... give Zucker a little more credit...he did make Airplane. But these guys are taking so much potential...and totally throwing it down the crapper. It's a shame to good comedic writers who want to parody pop culture. If your going to do it... please... do it well...,0
88," Epic Movie is about on the same level as a 12 year old's sense of humor. The sad part is that there are some very talented writers and young filmmakers out there, and these morons in Hollywood gave a green light to this garbage. As for those who found this film funny, there is a term for their condition: ""intellectual midget"".",0
89," My god. Looking at all these negative reviews makes me sick. This movie was funny, imaginative and completely worth a large popcorn.",1
90," There should be some sort of legally dispensed punishment for making crap like this. The filmmakers made it so painfully clear that they don't think audiences are smart enough to discern good from bad, comedy from sludge that the whole film comes off like they are mocking people for having paid to see it. If a movie like this gets made it's not because they think we are that stupid, it's because we are. Have we not come out in droves to see each and every progressively worthless piece of poop talent-challenged retards like the Wayan's brothers leave in steaming piles on the Cinerama Dome screen? This film is a punitive measure taken against the viewing public for getting so stupid that they can't tell when they're intelligence is being insulted. The movie studios have been talking down to us for years. And judging by the box office for this hateful garbage, they will continue to do so. It's like we're a society of rape victims who keep coming back for more because somehow we think that we don't deserve better. I watched this one for free and I have never felt so cheated by a film in my entire life. I really should have known better. I guess I had it coming.",0
91, I didn't even see this movie and I still feel less intelligent for acknowledging its very existance. Anyone above the age of 6 is capable of making this film yet these a$$holes are now rich.,0
92," This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. What fell on these guys' heads when they were thinking up movies? This movie is vomit inducingly unfunny, unoriginal, and just plain awful. Period.",0
93, I felt my IQ dropping just watching it. Horrible movie.,0
94," Lauren -- When did they start letting retards use the interweb? Even ""daft"" ones like you? This movie is not daft and it is not fab. Epic movie is the kind of BM that wakes you up in the middle of the night before an important meeting early the next day: It is unplanned for crap that ruins everything that follows. Horrible, horrible movie.",0
96, I am a person who usually likes most movies he sees. I have only not liked 2 movies...this movie and rollerball. this movie was such a piece of trash I get flustered trying to think of a way to describe how bad it was,0
97," Mildly amusing, intentionally stupid movie. Very occasionally a clever bit. I don't think it was nearly as bad as most people seem to. I was lightly entertained, which is all it set out to do. Jayma Mays is actually quite funny and has good comic timing.",1
98, This should,0
99,"In an attempt to do a Scary movie rip off, Epic movie fails at everything. Quite a horrible movie, and a torture to watch. Word from the wise, stay away from this movie.",0
100," Agreeing with the 4 people below me by this being one of the worst movie ever made. I mean i thought date movie was atrocious so they have to make another one c'mon. This movie is mostly 4 kids that still think saying poop , and bitch is funny. I gave this film a 1 because i had a minor laugh at the very end of the film and thats about it.",0
101," Alright, I'm never someone who does this. I have never given a movie a 0 and always try to find something I like about every movie I see. I love the spoof genre and thought the Scary Movie's, Not Another Teen Movie, etc. etc. etc. were great. Epic Movie, though....I just can not believe it. The writing is so horrible, the jokes so desperately unfunny, the characters so annoying....I was just in shock when the credits rolled. This is, I think, the worst movie I have ever, EVER, seen in my entire life. In all honesty, this movie was so bad it was painful. I can not believe that anyone in their right minds thought this was funny. Kal Penn should be ashamed of himself....",0
102," Horrible movie!!! I just sat there the entire time going ""oh lord here we go"". I didn't even laugh once, because it was predictable stupidity, and alot of it made no sense. I wish they would focus on making dumb movies like this, actually funny, so we could all laugh.",0
103," This movie was not made to entertain. It was made to remind you that parodies nowadays are filled with jokes nobody can handle. A few good laughs are in it, but are not enough to save this film from being a total bomb.",0
104," I laughed once. It wasn't even a full laugh. I went to the theater with my friends to see it (who are admittedly younger than me), and it took several minutes after a scene for me to completely fathom the fact that they were laughing at it. It's not that the people who give the movie bad reviews don't have a good sense of humor; it's that the Scary Movie directors have lost their sense of humor, and those who liked it have a pitifully immature ense of humor. I have a very childish sense of humor, and I get hyper and laugh very easily, but scarfing down sugar during this movie was not enough to get more than a chuckle out of me. That so many other people were laughing is a bad sign for American society.",0
105," Awful, not funny, and why did they call it ""Epic Movie"" it's almost all a really bad Narnia remake. I would have gave it a 2 if it's title was ""A Very Bad Narnia remake/parody that had a mild success due to 11 year olds finding it funny, but really it's not"".",0
106," Quite obviously other critics despite the odd few have a sense of humor, although Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer may not have a complete grasp on what you should and shouldn't spoof, this film still grabs epic films by the nec and chokes the life out of them metaphorically. they should have lost the Borat spoof as there is not another man in the world that can impersonate Borat and spoof him at the same time. All in all a very funny film. Jack Swallows is the best character there.",1
107, I had the worst time sitting in the cinema during this movie as it was so boring and unfunny. I couldn't believe I wasted my money to watch this piece of worthless crap,0
108," I really dun get it, why do they keep making these movies, is there anyone in the world that finds them the least bit funny??? Everyone liked scary movie because as crazy as it was it had a some sort of plotline and horror movies are easy to make fun of, but date movie, this, super hero movie, what the fuck?",0
109, Homeade Youtube videos are funnier than this bull. How can a person over 12 with a fully functioning mind mind find this crap funny.,0
110," My general agenda is that there is something lovable in exceptionally bad movies. Maybe it's the fact that you can rave about them to your buddies and that doing so makes you look like a snob critic that knows a lot about movies and what makes them bad. On the other hand, it might be the comforting thought of knowing that the next movie you watch probably can't sink lower anymore. The saddest thing in this movie is, that it can't even accomplish those goals. It's been a while since I watched it and I can't remember a single line from it. This movie is just so utter waste of time that I didn't even bother to file it under the ""hilariously bad movies"" folder in my mind. Doing that much would've been a definitive waste of brain capacity. All the review I'm going to give is this: Don't watch this. You can find better things to do with your time, go cure cancer or something.",0
111, This is ten times worse than straight to DVD quality but yet this was shown in cinemas across the world.,0
112, Epic fail. I've never even seen the movie -- this grade is from watching the trailers.,0
113," I came to the movie expecting more of the same from the Scary Movies. This means that I didn't dis-like this film for it's stupidity, terrible story & kind-of-lame jokes. That is expected & makes these movies fun to watch. The problem is IT WASN""T FUNNY!?! I mean, one or 2 scenes gave me a chuckle, which saves this review from a zero. I paid 2 dollars to see this movie & it was worth that, but not worth 3 hours of my time...",0
114, Honestly Ii try to find the best in movies such as these. but this movie was just so bad you wanted to scream at the writers for messing up so many possibly funny situations. These people made scary movie? An embarrassment to comedy.,0
115, This movie is horrible. It claims to be a comedy but there isn't much funny about it. After I rented it I felt like I should ask Blockbuster to refund my money.,0
116," This is a travesty. A terrible, terrible, movie that is completely devoid of laughs, characters, and a brain. I loathed this movie. why did I loathe this movie? Because I don't think random celebrity cameos, poop jokes, and the word 'bitch' are funny. Apparently, the people that liked the movie do. Sucks for them.",0
117," 'll say one nice thing about Epic Movie: it tries really hard to be funny, and I give it credit for trying. In every other way, though, the movie is unfunny to a whole new level. I beifly considered laughing once or twice, but never ended up doing so while watching. The movie attempts to spoof everything it can legally, which brings up the questions of how it could possibly have any quality plot or humor. Guess what, it doesn't. Seriously, when it's your job to write comedies and you find yourself spoofing a spoof within a spoof of a spoof, you need to reconsider your career choices. I am referring to the Pirates of the Carribian-style ""Lazy Pirate Sunday"" about halfway through the film, which is also the point I stopped watching. Life is too short. All copies of this movie need to be destroyed, and the creators should be burned at the stake. Anyone who gives this movie a good review needs to find their way back to the Insane Assylum.",0
118, Top 10 worst movie ever.only one good scene and that was with Carmen Electra. Flat out not funny except for that 1 scene.,0
119," So bad that our whole family voted to leave the movie in the middle - 2 adults and 3 teenagers. Stupid, gross, and creepy wiithout being funny. We got our money back. Worst movie I've ever seen half of.",0
120," Okay, just please, stop making these movies. The only reason I go is because all my friends wanted me to, and I actully found this one to be worse than ""Date Movie"" It had a few funny parts, but anybody could have come up with them, the funny moments are not smart, or well thought out. It might be OK if your 12-14, but anybody else will find this very bad.",0
122," Go see this move if you are A) 12 years old B) Enjoy repetitive, tedious fart jokes that required absolutely no thought to conjure. Otherwise, do something more worthwhile with your money, like burning it.",0
123," This movie was extremely bad! Scary movie 3 and 4 were better. Don't watch this piece of crap! You'll be wasting your money! I went in expecting some good stuff, but after it ended I was so pissed!!!",0
124, A PG-13 movie that tries to parody R rated movies like Borat and Snakes on a Plane. Swaps out anything funny for fart jokes. What is there to say?,0
125," It was a very bad movie. A vary, vary bad one. Despite the fact that I was really tired, when I watched it and don't remember much of it, there is still some vague feeling of emptiness inside of me. The movie drains creative energy out of you. It actuallly makes you dumber. Unless you are into this sort of thing, AVOID at all cost.",0
126," This movie required less thought and attention than any children's movie ever. It is sad that this company can release such boring, painful movies and still come away with millions of dollars in revenue. I did laugh once in a while, but the jokes were never based on the plot (because there isn't one).... do not see this movie please. See something that wasn't written in 15 minutes by a wannabe-hip old guy.",0
127," This movie can be summed up in six words: for the love of God, why? Why have the standards of American comedy fallen so low that we have to get our laughs from 86 endless minutes of mindless, tasteless jokes? Is the average American really so stupid to be entertained by this? First off, the movie is hardly a spoof of epic movies. While there are one or two jokes in there that nudge the ribs of some movies (Superman, Snakes on a Plane), it seems that the writers just decided to throw a poop joke arsenal on us and see how many pop culture icons they could toss in there along the way (remind anyone of Date Movie?). Next, the plot is like a meat grinder for your mind. The tasteless jokes, not only because they're endlessly pounded into your poor eardrums, are delivered with such mindnumbing obliviousness to their own stupidity that they just bore a drill into your brain. And, finally, the whole looked like it was filmed in someone's backyard. The final battle really did look like a backyard, while the rest of the movie may have been the same yard with a plywood set around it. And, what about the part at the end, when time was supposedly stopped, yet everyone's clothes kept blowing in the wind? Although, I can't be too cruel on that point, because that part actually made me laugh. In short, this movie is mindless, and so unbelievably stupid that I'm going to organize a mass burning once it comes out on DVD. And the only reason I did not give this a zero was because Paris Hilton got crushed by a falling plane passenger. I don't care how fake it was, it still gave me a very satisfied feeling.",0
128," Hands-down, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Yes, it's even worse than ""Date Movie"", and it's not one of those so-bad-it's-funny movies. No, ""Epic Movie"" is just bad. It not only deserves an ""R"" rating for lewd, overtly sexual humor, but an ""R"" rating just to keep the filmmakers from making any additional money from this monstrosity.",0
129," Absolutely awful. The worst film that I have ever seen, the jokes have no real depth, they are just constant, monotonous toilet jokes and black people jokes. They imitate other films' characters well enough, however they make no effort to poke fun at them, instead it is simply""yes, here I am, Jack Swallow, aren't I funy"". People who find this film worth a laugh are ignoramuses who have the most simplistic view of humor. Get out of MacDonlds and get an education.",0
130, Disgusting!,0
131," The ""___"" Movie franchise has progressively declined since it started. Now, with Epic Movie, it doesn't so much make fun of, satirize, or spoof any movies or pop culture as much as it does just state what there is about and in them. It was definitely not witty, hardly funny at all, and depressingly stupid. And overall, not entertaining. I'm giving it a one, because I did laugh once at the part where everyone was frozen in time because one of the guys moved a bit.",0
132," The utter depravation of wit, relevance or anything representing the 20,000,000 dollars put into this supposed comedy is sure to ruin any weekend movie excursion. Avoid at all costs.",0
133," I wish I could give it lower than a zero, but oh well. Now I was looking forward to this movie, I thought, ""wow, I was hoping someone would make a smart parody on all my favorite movies as long as it doesn't tick me off!"". That's what it looked like, then I saw the movie, it made me EMBARASSED to even be in the theatre, sure one of my friends and I laughed once or twice but when the Beaver and Goatguy started Frenching I felt sick. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Go see something worthy of your attention like watching paint dry, that'd be loads better and more entertaining than that so called Epic Movie.",0
134, Possibly one of the worst comedy/anything ever made. Not even a movie.,0
135, The movie was really funny. Cant figure out the bad reviews. You can at least watch once.,1
136," Even though the old critical saw about parody being the lowest form of humor is absolutely untrue, the visible stench rays emanating from this epic commode-clogger are noxious enough to make anybody forget just how good such varied examples of the genre as The Court Jester, Blazing Saddles, Airplane!, Shaun of the Dead and many others actually are. This is the work of the miscreants who inflicted Date Movie on the world last year, but that one at least deserved to be cut a little slack because Alyson Hannigan was so genuinely charming in it, and because at least it was disciplined and focused enough to target a specific movie genre: the most popular and profitable romantic comedies and ""chick flicks"" of the last twenty years. If Epic Movie had centered on GENUINE movie epics such as Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Doctor Zhivago and Gladiator, I might have at least tossed it some grudging respect, but the moviemakers simply offer up instant replays of many of last year's box office hits and also-rans (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Chronicles of Narnia, and the Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises take center stage, but in whose alternate universe can Nacho Libre, Borat and Click be considered epics in any way, shape or form?) On second thought, even if you wanted to stretch semantics farther than the Guinness record holder for the longest rubber band, writer-directors Jason Friedburg and Aaron Seltzer deserve censure not only for the Cousteau-like depths of stupidity, meanness and pure ugliness they repeatedly demonstrate or for their absolute incompetence at staging jokes (or what they consider to be jokes) but also for the utter laziness and cynicism with which they serve them up, as though they didn't have to even TRY to do better. (And sadly, since this was a mild box office hit, they were probably right.) The result is such a depressing, abysmal black hole that the very few exceptions (Darrell Hammond's letter-perfect impersonation of Johnny Depp's Jack Swallows--er, Sparrow; the sheer professionalism that comic actors Jennifer Coolidge and Tony Cox always bring to their work, even if they really need to fire their agents) register not so much as bright spots than merely as less dim ones. Worst performance of all--and Epic Movie's worst crime--is given by Jayma Mays, a very cute actress who completely stole my heart a couple of years ago as a beleaguered hotel employee in Wes Craven's Red Eye. Here, as one of four ethnically disparate siblings who discover some Wonka-like Golden Tickets to desperately contrived adventure, Mays is thoroughly amateurish, even seeming to forget her lines at times. Perhaps Mays needed to ingest huge quantities of drugs to get through the making of this garbage, but not nearly as much as we moviegoers need to shoot, snort or gulp to get through the experience of WATCHING it!",0
137, groan inducing and excruciatingly awful. merely referencing a movie does not make the scene funny. if you like this movie you are an idiot.,0
138," The only joke that i kinda laughed at and still think is kinda clever is the joke about Willy wanting the young girl to polish his knob...and so she cleans his door knob. Mainly because its kind of a complete throw away joke that you may not catch on to because you are so amazed that people could actually create this terrible piece of trash....to tel you the truth I only could set through about 30 some mins without shutting it off. This was so terrible I can't believe that someone with a brain wrote this and then had the MONEY$$ to be able to create this terrible, terrible skit movie....I mean....The Samuel Jackson bit has been done to DEATH (best by Dave Chapelle) and other terrible bodily fluid jokes are way back in the 90's (which is even worse then using something form the 80's!)",0
139," It comes as no surprise to me that the hacks behind this film have more online petitions against them than Uwe Boll. There are literally sites that want them to just die. Epic Movie is absolutely horrendous in every way, and only serves as a sadistic torture device (Hm, imagine a horror film in which victims are tortured with this film). Epic Movie is so awful, it's almost as bad as Disaster Movie, but not quite. More like epic piece of shit! Friedberg and Seltzer must be stopped!",0
140,"Atrocious. Just atrocious. Doesn't the fact that the directors got nominated for 5 Razzies over their careers (including one for Worst Screenplay for ""Epic Movie"") indicate how bad this is? Gosh... I don't even know why I watched this. I might have hoped there will be something funny, I guess. Some of their work was interesting at first - ""Scary Movie"" to be more precise. And after that, they've been trying to milk the same cow for over a decade now, and it's not working. It hasn't worked since ""Scary Movie 3"", really, and it probably will never work again. The sad thing is, that people still give them money to produce the crap they do. The world we live in....",0
141,"Not the slightest bit epic in any sense of the word. I like some spoof movies, I didn't mind the first Scary Movie or the third (sorry), but this one is a clear example of why spoof movies are so critically hated. The film trys to be in with the crowd by making jokes that are modern, like cracking gags about cribs, Paris Hilton and any bloody film that came out in the year or so before this one. At least this movie trys and makes jokes, unlike some lesser spoof films *cough*DisasterMovie*cough*, its just a shame every jokes falls flatter than a steamrolled pancake. Name one scene or joke in this film you find funny, and i'll cart you off to a mental institution, and nothing with Fred Willard counts, no matter how awesome he is",0
142,"This tackling the action/adventure genre such as The Chronicles of Narnia, Epic Movie is yet another edition to this terrible series of 'spoof' (and I use that term in the loosest sense) movies. The lack of talent it must take to create something so poor is frankly mind boggling and the sooner people stop paying to watch these things the better.",0
143,"Worst movie I've ever spent money on, why do they do these things I found one part funny, the Willy Wonka dance to Fergalicious the rest is well.....*place expletive here*",0
144,"Probably the best film Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer have ever written. But, still, it's utterly terrible. The humour is cheap - not in a good way - and the performances are simply lame. How could it possibly get worse from there? Well, just check out every film they've written since this one.",0
145,"Avoid this trash at all costs. Bottom of the barrel stuff, probably only laughed once, even then it wasn't that funny. If I could give this film a minus score I would, again avoid at all costs.",0
146,"Epic Movie comes nowhere close to being epic, it should been called ""Failure Movie"" from what I see. The plot is just plain dumb and stupid, it just parodies other movies to make for another retard movie. The acting is kind of bad in this one and the script consists of toilet jokes. This is not the recipe for an epic movie. i can't say anything good about it. I'm sorry. Overall ""Epic Movie"" sucks, the Scary Movies are pretty bad and Epic Movie is the same. Except worse. Epic Movie does not deserve to have ""Epic"" in it's title. You know what's epic? The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, Inception, Bourne, The Dark Knight. They deserve the title of Epic but this gets the title of ""One of the Worst Movies Ever"". I hate this movie. Breakdown for ""Epic Movie"": Presentation: 1.7, Plot: 1.5, Acting: 1.5, Dialogue: .8, Lasting Appeal: .5. Score: 1.3 out of 10 ""Disaster"".",0
147,"Surely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, parody films hardly hit, just as some franchise ""Scary Movie"". No comments, bad from start to finish. If you want to preserve the health of your eyes, do not watch this movie.",0
148,One of the worst films I have ever seen. The only reason it doesn't have a 0 is because I don't know if I could bring myself to give anything less then 1. I'd highly recommend that anybody with any shred of common sense steer well clear of this film. Get as far away as possible from this atrocity.,0
149,"The movie relied too much on bodily humor and pop culture references and not enough funny. I didn't laugh, but rather felt embarrassed when watching this movie in the theatre. My sister and I went to see Scary movie 4 in theatres and thought it was decent, it gave us a few laughs. So when we saw this movie made by the same directors we thought it might give us a few laughs. But in the end it was nothing but gross humor with little comedy whatsoever. This movie should have been called ""Epic Fail"".",0
150,"Epic Movie has atrocious comedy, acting and ridiculous premise. I know this is what parodies are meant to have but in that case Epic Move fails at being a parody, which I never knew was possible.",0
151,"These parody movies are terrible but some what genies because they make so much money of this crap. The jokes are stupid but I have to admit there where 1 or 2 jokes that made he go ""hehe"" but that was it. Don't watch this crap.",0
152,"If the raunchy stupid Scary Movie trilogy wasn't enough, Epic Movie takes the spoof collection by wind. Director Jason Seltzer has included spoofs of The Lion the Witch And The Wardrobe- Superbad style,  Samuel. L  Jackson, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory- Sweeny Todd style, Superman, and Harlord and Kumar White Castle  no offence- kal penn). Epic Movie may go down to be the worst spoofs in history.",0
153,"la ridicules la estupides y esas cosas no van conmigo, una pelicula totalmente mediocre y.............................................................",0
154,"Epic Movie just tried to do too much. They tried to parody every movie possible it seemed like.Epic movie had potential and could have been really funny. Instead we were given a long crapfest.",0
155,"This insulting, disgusting movie is just inappropriate and wrong. If you're waiting for a decent story, you are obviously going to notice that the story is maybe even non-existent. What about the humor? Yeah, because this movie is made for laughs, right? NO! THIS PIECE OF CRAP IS DISGUSTING RATHER THAN FUNNY! IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK!!! Do not even think about buying this crap. (Final Score: 0.00)",0
156,"These filmmakers have to understand that pop-culture gags and parodies just don't work without anything else supporting them, particularly a cohesive plot and actual humour. This films lacks both to a disastrous effect.",0
157,"I'm so tired and bored trashing on spoof serial killers Friedberg and Seltzer, because they made so many god-awful parodies, apparently they don't have the IQ of 10  because they keep making unfunny terribly made spoofs just to torture us smart people. These two filmmakers don't even have an audience (well expect half witted people). The only reason why I am giving this a low score is just because it was at least not boring, it had a few funny moments. Four troubled adult orphans (Kal Penn, Adam Campbell who also starred in Date Movie, Faune Chambers and Jayma Mays) from four separate movies are in this spoof blockbuster, each of them get a golden ticket from the Wily Wonka Factory, their trip doesn't go as well as planned so their kidnapped. Lucy (Mays) discovers a closet that has a mythic realm called Narnia. So the four orphans enter this realm which they must escape, a which called ""White **** is hunting for them. The cast is talented they have been in good films but they must been there for the pay checks. Crispin Glover who was great in Back In The Future, this film is the worst in his career. Grade D-",0
158,why have i wasted my life watching this terrible so called parody. it thinks if it takes a film thinks that if it makes a reference to a film and adds some sort of disgusting toilet or lame shock humour it counts as parody well no it doesn't and these writers really need to retire for all our collective sanity's,0
159,"I understand that there are people who like this movie because they want to see the world burn. I even heard some people talking that this is the best example of a great comedy.... This... Is... An... Abomination.. To every comedy there is!This is not funny, this is a torture. I'm glad that the people who reviewed it actually made it to their pc's.0/10 Don't watch this",0
160,"I don't normally write movie reviews, but I hated this flick so much I had to do this. Don't watch Epic Movie! Ever. You'd have to be absolutely brain-dead to find any enjoyment in this, and let me tell you: being high doesn't make it any better. I didn't laugh or even smile once. This is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen in my life. It's supposed to be a comedy parodying epic fantasy movies. Except it's not funny, at all. The jokes are some of the worst I've ever seen in any movie ever. The costumes, props, practical effects and CGI are so horribly cheap I think I've seen high school plays with higher production values. In one scene an elderly Caucasian actor's Asian stunt double doesn't match the actor and they don't even attempt to give him the same costume. They just put a pair of pants and a cheap wig on him, and clearly show his face on camera. Everything about this movie is unbelievably lazy and half-baked. It's like not even the people who made this cared. They just haphazardly slapped this ugly piece of turd together and called it a day. Avoid this like the plague. Watch anything from Michael Bay or Uwe Boll instead. Their movies are also atrocious, but at least they're unintentionally funny. In Epic Movie there's no humor at all, intentional or otherwise.",0
161,"This movie isn't even.... epic. Hence my first part of my username has 'Epic' in it, yet I can't even believe I used that part right and this movie didn't and I didn't even try it.",0
162,"Epic Movie gives audiences exactly what you would expect from a Friedberg/Seltzer film, including but not limited to lazy pop culture gags, scatological humor, offensive sterotypes, mean-spirited characters and horrible acting.",0
163,"J'ai remarqué qu'en général et en particulier lorsqu'il y a ""Movie"" dans le titre, c'est de la daube ! ceci expliquerait pourquoi Spartatouille est marrant (bien que super débile, cela va sans dire) et pourquoi les Scary Movie sont soit mauvais soit médiocres dans le genre restreint des films gogols.Cependant le ""Big"" avant ""Movie"" est un signal d'alarme alarmant (""Epic"" dans le titre original, ce qui est sans doute... encore pire) et se trouve confirmé au visionnage. On a un pot-pourri de Narnia et Harry Potter entre autres ""choses"" qui ne se prêtent pas ou difficilement à la caricature, car ces choses sont déjà hautement débiles et mongolos par défaut : il s'agit de leur essence même.Quand on ajoute à ça un manque d'imagination et un humour scato d'ado, ça ne peut forcément donner que de la merde, de la big grosse merde. Plus qu'à tirer la chasse donc !",0
164,"The fact that I've even watched this film, spending the necessary amount of time to see it all the way through, actually makes me worry about my limited lifespan. That's how bad this is.",0
