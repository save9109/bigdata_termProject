0,"The Force Awakens is another way of saying A New Hope. If it had a theme it would be rebirth. Although there is wit, a lot of action, personality, there was less surprises. The movie took place in locations we have all seen before. They revisit a small amount of areas making it feel less like an adventure. It almost feels unnessesary because why retell the first SW like it was broken? They played it too safe. Maybe JJ will have more creative freedom with the next one. He probably wanted to put his own cteative stamp on a project after the new characters were established. I would like to see less characters killed off. I think it's used too much as a lazy filler. I'd rather see people die in old age respectfully.",1
1,"I enjoyed this movie, I love seeing the Star Wars back. Unfortunately, there were some aspects of the movie i disliked very much and have degraded my opinion of the movie. Most of the story in The Force Awakens is copied from A New Hope, even the name can suggest the same thing. Main character grows up on a barren planet without it's parents, has a strong force within him/herself. The enemy has a deathstar / deathplanet. Main enemy character has a teacher controlling/helping him from the shadows(in secret). I also take issue with the speed at which Rey not only learned to control the Force, but you might even say mastered it. Being able to mind control a storm trooper from the first try and then even controlling him without even having visual connection. Kylo Ren acting out like a 12 year old child, having temper tantrums whenever things weren't going his way. A lot of things left unexplained, e.g. why did Luke went away, how can Luke's old lightsaber callout to Rey. Overall I enjoyed the movie and 100% recommend to watch it but things like these I've mentioned ruin the quality of the movie for me.",1
2,"How do you write a sequel to America’s most beloved space opera trilogy more than 30 years later?  How do you make a movie which appeals to a multi-generation fan base more massive than the death star, and which has been badly damaged by a series of misbegotten prequels, and thus needs to make the jump to light speed quickly?   Not an easy task.  You return to the tried and true.  You bring back the original cast, and write a story that recreates and revisits those most memorable moments in those original movies.  The result is something familiar, maybe a little old and faded, but not totally out of date.  So yes, the story is more than a bit of a remake of the original, but who cares!  It’s a re-union tour.  And a transition piece which allows for the introduction of new generation of characters, and in that regard Rey (Daisy Ridley) appears to be a winner.",1
3,"I am not typically a Star Wars fan but this movie was enjoyable. I enjoyed the cameos and found it to be well rounded in content. It made a good movie for someone that isn't very familiar with the franchise, it definitely stands on its own. It was nice to see a more mixed gender cast for a change, and without apologetics.",1
4,"JJ Abrams has delivered an absolute blast of a film with The Force Awakens, which is admittedly a film with flaws, but an incredible ride for any Star Wars fan to behold and possibly one of the greatest in the franchise now.PRO’SFirst off I must admit I was sceptical about John Boyega from watching the trailers, but I actually found him a highly enjoyable watch, being able to infuse comedy into the film and still hold his own in more serious scenes. But whilst Boyega does a good job, Adam Driver absolutely kills it as Kylo Ren, bringing sheer and unchiselled menace to the screen, absolutely dominating any other actors with his presence and still yet being able to bring a sense of humanity to him. Driver has made possibly one of the best Star Wars villains, but we’ll have to see how he progresses through the next 2 entries.The Nostalgia is also palpable and surprisingly well executed, giving you goose bumps and not bombarding you with every single reference they can think of.The Visual effects and practical effects (yes they actually have sets in this film) are of high quality and really immerse you in this universe, with its new additions and its familiar ones.The set pieces in the film are exceedingly exciting to watch, especially the lightsaber battle at they end. The fighting is certainly grittier and faster paced, but luckily not stepping into the silly speed domain of Yoda/Dooka fights.The overall pace of the film is incredibly executed well, picking up at the exact right moments and slowing for others, and with the film starting off with a kickass scene and still giving us time to get to know the characters quickly.The humour in TFA is actually a very nice addition to the film, actually genuinely bringing laughs at times (one scene with BB-8 bringing out many laughs), although at some times the humour seems a little out of context with the Star Wars universe, but it is still ultimately enjoyable.The surprises the film brings also are actually pretty well done also and work effectively, even when you can kind of see them coming, they’re all done well, despite all the speculation beforehand.The Story also has a very dark tone, similar to Episode 5 which is great, and balances it great between the comedy and lighter moments of the film.I also loved the Hierarchy in which the First Order was made, not making Kylo Ren seem fully powerful and being treated the way he probably should be for how volatile he is.The film is actually an incredible set up for future episodes and ends perfectly and conclusively which makes you hyped for the next episode.UNSURE’STo be straight up, the story is so close to being the same as the original trilogy’s but there is still enough kind of layers added onto this films that it kind of gets away with it, but to be honest you don’t care too much as the execution of the film is great, but it is noticeable.This is something that I found a lot of people didn’t agree with me, but I thought Daisy Ridley started off a little rusty. Her line deliveries felt very stale and something about her demeanour on screen came across a little annoying. Despite this she does improve through the running time and by the end I found her a likeable character, but I still preferred Finn (Boyega). However, chemistry between the two is good and feels pretty genuine.CON’SSadly, I found that Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron was terribly underused, as he seemed like an awesome character and Isaac put up a good performance as we know he’s a good actor, and so we certainly wish we could see more of him.Captain Phasma who was hyped up quite a bit prior to the release was also horrendously underused, even more so than Poe, and literally only appears at the start and at a rather insignificant part of the film later on, which makes her just feel like a creation made for selling toys.Lastly, my final complaint (out of a surprising few) is the scene just after Han Solo is introduced again. The scene include these aliens that I can’t remember the name of (Ranthids?) and a bunch of cannon fodder for them that arrive just on time that just seemed forced and added to try have another action sequence in it, and I wasn’t too sure about the design of the alien either.Overall, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a resounding success with a few minor blips that hardly detract from the experience of it. It sets up brilliantly for the new trilogy and showcases an incredible cast of actors with a brilliant amount of action. Star Wars is back, and this one has a high midichl--- naaah just kidding, f**k that, the force is just motherf**king strong in this one.8.5/10",1
5,"JJ Abrams' vision of Star Wars is essentially a fresh coat of paint on an old car. The Force Awakens is remarkably similar to A New Hope in numerous ways, and while I enjoy both of these movies, The Force Awakens doesn't quite captivate the same way the very first entry into this franchise does.  What this film DOES do well is flash what lies ahead for us - the technical prowess is incredible here. X-Wings in formation striking beachheads or enemies in space are incredible.  Everything George Lucas did through 6 episodes is suddenly garbage in the wake of the Abrams touch.  The new cast is also solid, even if Kylo Ren's character isn't as well explained as I would have liked.  Certain characters and the background story need some work to transcend all the other excellent franchises being iterated on year after year right now.  Star Wars is no longer alone in the sci-fi world, it's merely a cornerstone and The Force Awakens does only enough to remind us of what Star Wars can be, but doesn't fully deliver in its resurgence.  Regardless, this movie was very enjoyable and should please many fans worldwide.  The BEST news is that Star Wars isn't limited to just episodes 7-9 as there are four other side-plot movies in development as well.  So while the core story of this new Star Wars adventure isn't completely built yet (at least, in this movie), these other movies taking the Marvel universe approach could perhaps fill in some of the blanks and keep satiating our appetites for all things Star Wars.",1
6,"“The Force Awakens” was a thrilling, emotional journey all the way through. JJ Abrams did a remarkable job by staying true to the original trilogy's DNA and managed to combine iconic characters with new ones very smoothly. The new story-line fits very well, mixing up classic elements with the new setting/atmosphere. Rey is the highest point of this new Star Wars world and i don't think anyone of us saw that coming (BB-8 was awesome too). In my opinion, the lowest point - other than not having Luke say one single word in the entire movie and just getting to see his face for a second on screen – was the main villain. I would have picked a different actor with more character to portray Kylo Ren. The guy started off well, showing potential, but then (even if it was part of the script) he got burned and lacked the appeal and personality to reverse it. General Hux did a better job as a villain with his “military persona”, though. Overall, it was an outstanding 1st chapter and it's too bad we have to wait until 2017 for the next one.",1
7,"$2 billion dollars box office and rising. I have just watched the movie this week. It is a Disney movie. Escapist, fast moving fun with family friendly characters. I can only assume the people who gave this movie 0/10 are racist, sexist or have part of the their brain missing. I have already watched the movie three times. Love it.",1
8,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I finally got to see the film and I am definitely telling you this film is loads better than Age of Ultron and I was extremely happy when I left. I have never seen any Star Wars films and this was my first one since my friends pulled me to it. I was worried by the negativity but the film really blew me away. The acting was great and the action sequences were cool. I'm not quite sure if the reason I enjoyed it so much was because I saw it in 4XD or something where the chairs move. I did notice some cliches and plot holes, but I didn't really care as long as it was entertaining, I'm fine! This is one of those movies that is fun for the whole family and fun to watch with friends. Also great for a Christmas Movie! Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are amazing in this film!",1
9,"Star Wars the Force Awakens achieves in bringing together the original trilogy's sense of magic while simultaneously integrating a modern take on the biggest science fiction franchise (sorry Star Trek) As an individual who has experienced the Original trilogy and the Prequels at the same time in my childhood, I could only find the good points of the films. As my taste matured, the Original Trilogy stood well above the Prequels so when the first teasers for the Force Awakens were released my anticipation and expectations reached extremely high levels. Star Wars the Force Awakens allows JJ Abrams the chance to direct/produce/co-write yet another major science fiction franchise which he completes to a degree. Minor faults in editing and chopping of action sequences can be jarring, however, these minor faults are too few.The film launches at a breakneck speed as the major characters are introduced throughout with Daisey Ridley the standout. The characters of Rey and Finn both combine elements of the Original Trilogy's characters with the Han, Luke and Leia influences clearly seen. This only makes the characters more engaging with the on screen chemistry between Finn and Rey entirely authentic and brillant, completly leaving behind the Chrisstenson and Portman's forced relationship.The film shares many parallels with A New Hope with several plot points and scenes clearly similar to A New Hope, but Abrams instead twists these plot points in a new way while adding subtle nostalgic hints and humor. Clearly the script was the most impressive as the lines of dialogue at no point feel forced while maintaining momentum and adding the Original Trilogy's cast back into the world famous roles. All the performances are strong and was one of the few movies where I couldn't find one member of the cast who felt out of place.Harrison Ford's performance is the top of the pile with Han Solo's character showing all the points that made him one of the most iconic characters of all time while Carrie Fisher also figures strongly.Adam Driver and the script both combine for the making of a complex villain in Kylo Ren  with Adam Driver giving a performance to the level that Anakin Skywalker deserved in the prequels.Star Wars the Force Awakens is not a perfect film,however, too few exist and the Force Awakens delivers beats felt in the Original Trilogy, more specifically a New Hope, but never takes the franchise into a dangerous place such as the Prequels did, which, while making the Force Awakens feel ""safe"" doesn't ever diminish the film.",1
10,"To put it simply, it was a badly executed good idea. Im glad i didnt pay to watch this because if i did, id have a bit of an empty feeling after. but thankfully Thepiratebay and i are very good friends, would of never paid to watch it. but it was ok to kill 2hrs of my meaningless life",1
11,"This movie makes things right. Prequels be damned, the Sequel Trilogy is in the hands of a great director, and if the movies after it are similarly good, this might be the best trilogy. It does have its flaws, but the humor is on point, the mix of action, comedy, drama is very well done, the story is beautifully crafted, and the visuals - fantastic in every sense of the word. The movie is amazing for veterans and newcomers alike, but it looks like it's made with veterans in mind. Instead of watching Metacritic user reviews of it, just go watch it right now, J.J has done a great job, and i'm happy that the Sequel Trilogy is in good hands.",1
12,"It's been 32 years since the Star Wars film canon last progressed, leading many fans to lose hope for a proper leap forward in the franchise. So, have J.J. Abrams and Co. struck a winner with this daunting attempt at a seventh episode? Yeah. Yeah, they sure have. You'll hoot and holler at the familiar faces spouting trademark quips of yore. You'll smile wide at the fresh, new faces charming up the screen with their infectious enthusiasm. You'll gasp at every new development. You'll gape at every set piece. Your eyes will well up with tears of joy. And then the tears will stream with every melancholy beat that follows after. Basically, whether you're a newbie or just one of the true fans who's been holding out for far too long, ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is the perfect movie to reintroduce you to the magic of cinema's greatest franchise.",1
13,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is one of my favourite films of 2015 and this is why; For the first time since RotJ I've watched a Star Wars film that actually feels like a Star Wars film. Right from the opening shot of a Star Destroyer casting a shadow across the planet Jakku, you immediately see how much care and attention has been put into this film. It could've been so easy for JJ Abrams to fill this film to the brim with CGI, but what we have here is a film with a healthy balance of CGI and practical effects (more in favour of practical) just like episodes IV to VI. I've seen some people score 0/10 and this film is nowhere near that. I can understand why some people may not like it, but I can't help but feel The Force Awakens is being hit with the super negative reviews because of how big and hyped this movie was and that it's now ""cool"" to rage on Episode VII. People have also been commenting on how the film is too much like A New Hope, but just remember that pretty much all three trilogies follow a similar path, the same way in which the first 3 Indiana Jones films do (and when they did change the formula, we got ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""....) The film isn't without it's floors, but then again no film is. Overall, this is a very enjoying film and a great Star Wars film.",1
14,"Having been whistled up in the Star Wars universe myself when I was a child, I did a little pre-screening research on the film. Out of all the trailers and interviews that were done on the movie there was one in particular, an interview done with director J.J. Abrams, that stuck out to me. Having written the script himself with the help of Lawrence Kasdan, the mastermind behind arguably the best Star Wars film ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Abrams said that the movie was going back to its original roots and the whole film was basically a faithful recreation of the space magic George Lucas had once shown us. After watching the film, I couldn’t agree more or less with his statement. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is an embodiment of the original trilogy (the good ones of course) that we all got to love and worship and, furthermore, is a testament to the fact that regardless of the crazy hype and commercialization the old sci-fi space adventure franchise still stands firm through the ages, enough for audiences of all shapes and sizes to thoroughly enjoy and be happy with. Let’s be clear with this; I’m not saying the movie breaks any new ground. Character and plot development is still a bit rushed and shallow, as well as glimpses of the infamous corny dialogue still stick out now and then during the course of the film. But then again, I can’t say this is a terrible film either. The heart-pumping action, the beautiful music, the grandiose scenery, and the endless imagination that lifted Star Wars to legendary heights are all there and flawlessly executed. Overall, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a true Star Wars film right down to the bone marrow, with all the pros and cons of its original predecessors. Director J.J. Abrams, like he did with the Mission Impossible and Star Trek series, blows off the dust of an old series and refines it  with a movie good enough for both Star Wars manias and average joes to run for a giddy old-fashioned space ride. Nothing new is discovered, but truly the force is still strong with this one. Enjoy!",1
15,"As many of the professional critics have written, we can finally write off the prequels and get back to the Star Wars we've known and loved.  The franchise is now in really good hands. The two young actors playing Fin and Ray are absolutely terrific - I was worried that they wouldn't be.  Adam Driver is solid, though not outstanding.  Loved seeing the actors from the first films (withholding the significance of each for obvious reasons).  Having been deluged with so much BB-8 merchandising, etc., I was concerned that ""it"" wouldn't be nearly as likable or endearing as R2, but I was happily flat wrong - love that little robot.  The technology is brilliant - advancing from the 70s and early 80s, but not losing the charm from individual set pieces and objects. Bottom line:  it's very similar to the ""A New Hope"", but it's a very solid launching pad for many more sequels to come. Of course, some scenes dragged, and the lack of originality dings it a bit. Not enough to take away from my whole-hearted recommendation. I'll see it again - not right away - but I can see young people (and many who are new to the series) eating this up.",1
16,"An absolute joy from the moment the iconic text crawl emblazons the screen, the energy flows through the entire audience, much like the Force itself would. Without spoiling a single aspect of the film, it gets back to it's original formula, an adventure, from beginning to end. The score is more subtle than John Williams signature to this franchise, but the good kind of subtle, and gives you a fusion between sounds the beat through every second of Star Wars that we hold dear, blended with song that let's you know you're watching an Abbram's picture. The writing it's amazing, and executed well by our newest additions to the franchise, and our old favourites. The action and visuals astound! Now, it isn't a perfect film, as some of the minor characters haven't been expanded upon in this outing, but you get the sense that this is just the beginning. It's funny, heartwarming, and tear-jerking. This makes up for the most recent entries, of course I'm talking about the prequels. You really get the sense that everyone on-board gave their heart and soul to give us one of the most exciting entries in the Star Wars mythos. I can't wait until Episode VIII arrives.",1
17,"I was unsure what to expect from this chapter of the famous and beloved saga. There were mixed feelings about Episodes I, II and III obviously. I didn’t mind Episode II and Episode III and I endure Episode I, as it reminds me of the excitement I felt, as a 13 year old at the time, to be witnessing Star Wars at the cinemas. I was concerned that a major company like Disney was in the driver’s seat and it appeared George Lucas having sold the rights - including the lucrative merchandising rights that made him most of his $5.1B - was keen to vacate the space and have a hand off approach to the project. Would it be the same without the Star Wars creator there every step of the way making sure everything fit in with his original vision and previous chapters? Essentially would it keep its Star Wars-iness or would it be commercialised and Disney-fied beyond recognition to the horror of millions? I’m very pleased to report that J. J. Abrams has delivered in spades. It fits seamlessly into the Star Wars universe. However, you do need to take your mind back to the 1983 Return of the Jedi and remind yourself this movie slots in 30 years after that. All the while forgetting Episodes I, II and III. Once you’ve made that mind shift you’re able to fully enjoy what unfolds. All the original Star Wars characters that appear are 32 years older than they were in Episode VI, so it’s no drastic mental jump to accept it is 30 years since the events of Return of the Jedi. There are a new generation of heroes that step up for the Light Side in Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). Like all Star Wars movies Episode VII is based around a small cast of heroes. These two form the core of the movie. And probably will for the rest of the sequels. Daisy and John provide strong compelling performances that hold the movie and cast together and work in perfectly with the beloved characters of Princess (General) Leia, Han Solo as well as C-3PO and a few other throwbacks. There are many moments that elicit audible responses from the audience. Aspects that connect back to some of the more memorable moments in the first three movies. And these are a nice touch to bed it down in the Star Wars universe. The graphics as expected are flawless but there is an awkward kind of aspect to some design elements and the level of computer graphics given the quality of both from Return of the Jedi 32 years ago, but this is obviously not avoidable. The relationship between Han and Leia is handed brilliantly and their is great on screen chemistry. There is a sense of a lot of time having passed and a lot having gone under the bridge with these two. Harrison Ford makes what I think was an awkward first appearance but given he’s now a much older battle hardened character it doesn’t detract too much. Perhaps it was intended? He warms into it and is “Han” in no time. Carrie Fisher gives a stellar performance and her first appearance in this movie is well delivered and handled. She’s entirely believable as a General of the Rebels. Her scenes with Han probably provide the best moments and this should be welcoming news to old school Star Wars fans. No shortage of nostalgic tear jerker moments with these two. A lot has happened between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. It doesn’t explain all that has happened between then and now but it goes a long way to starting on the journey. Much like The Phantom Menace’s plot line did for the lead up to A New Hope. There’s a new generation of Dark Side villains to become familiar with. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is the new Sith apprentice and Driver inhabits the character completely. The soundtrack from the lauded composer John Williams is top notch as expected. A lot of Star Wars’ feel has been created by him and his masterpiece scores. He doesn’t let the team down. The script is fast paced and full of detail. Almost to the point of being overwhelming, as there is so much to pick up. But this is typical Star Wars and it’s a case of strap in and catch up. The script isn’t cliched, kitsch or derivative, which I thought could be a major issue. Humour changes over time. It’s hard to maintain a tone when creating movies over such a long time span that are supposed to fit in seamlessly after one and other. Many will want to watch all 7 in order and they all need to feel like they belong. The Force Awakens did this brilliantly but with a slightly modern edgy aspect. There are plenty of jokes that die hard fans will get and enjoy. There is, rightly so, a romanticism around Star Wars - with many having grown up with this genre creating saga - like no other series in movie history. The bar is set very high and people will run a very critical eye over every detail.

In my opinion it reaches the highs we all hoped it would and fits in with the rest of the vast Star Wars universe.

The movie of the year. Exceeds its high expectations.",1
18,"The Force Awakens is Star Wars reborn. In fact, I am of the opinion that it surpasses any of its predecessors. With acting performances far superior to anything seen in the Star Wars movies to date, this movie improves upon all the flaws of the original trilogy, while learning from the mistakes of the prequels. It loses minor marks due to the similarities that can be drawn between this movie and A New Hope, which may be seen as a not so subtle attempt to appeal to the nostalgia of it's audience, but it pulls it off with style, and has so much more to offer. Anyone who is reviewing this film negatively had decided they wouldn't like it before they even entered the theatre. This film boasts some of the best characters in the universe, a story arch to rival that of both previous trilogies, and far superior cinematography, direction, editing and special effects.",1
19,"J.J just successfully did what the creator himself couldn't do with the prequels. Star Wars has returned to its roots where humor, action and beloved characters are all combined in a flawless way. *Spoiler free review* ’Star Wars The Force Awakens' is a wonderful journey of, once again; good and evil. It’s definitely the most character-driven movie of the franchise to this date, and it really is a good one. We see similar faces and a bunch of new ones. Rey, Finn & Han are the major players and they all have a spectacular chemistry and surprisingly much humor. We experience wonderful development of both old as new individuals, and the acting performance of this diversity-friendly flick is five-star worthy! One character’s fate is a big event in this film. Some of you might find it like a smart move meanwhile others just find it like a bad one. I think it gave the film a brand new future. But it’s still a bad choice by the writers from a story-perspective. Can the franchise really continue after this event? The moment could also have been much more powerfully presented. Rey is probably going to be the new favorite of this trilogy. She’s smart, funny, independent and just fantastic. We see her develop in a wonderful way, but there are two moments in this film where her character might have been too rushed into development. But this might be further explained in episode 8 & 9, were they probably will establish more background to her character. Kylo Ren is another big individual in this space-epic. As the main protagonist does he somewhat hold up as the new Darth Vader. Sure, he's not as menacing nor as awesome but he's without any doubt one of the best villains in the whole franchise (and the most complex). But there are a few minor aspects with that make him look a bit flawed. He got a very special behavior and I do find it very unique to see a villain like him act like this. But there could have been much more understanding to why he act like he does. He sometimes come of as an immature and childish villain, and I miss a better background why he act in this peculiar way. The second time I saw this film though, made me look at Rey's and Kylo's flaws in a much less critical way. There're hints throughout the film that might give an inside to why they are as they are. J.J and his mystery box; I should have known it wouldn't be simple enough to notice everything in the first viewing. The movie starts in a very high-paced way and it continues to be exactly that throughout the whole flick. I especially love the first act; it's the most character-driven, action packed and intense part of the movie. There, characters are quickly introduced and the feel throughout the movie is very ""SW-ish, it really is a return to the old days. But 'The Force Awakens' might use too much of the old ingredients and less of new ones. There are very many similar aspects from the original trilogy, perhaps too many. The lack of originality of the plot in the 2nd and 3rd act made the film a bit meh, I wanted more to happen since there weren't that many original nor mind-blowing scenes. It's kinda the same with the action; very similar to the old days and too remake-ish. The second screening did however boost the action-feel, even though there could have been more originality and power to the action. Those were pretty much my biggest complains about this film. The plot is very remake-ish yes, but I still enjoyed it and it never drags along! It's great to, after have seen the film three times, still have several questions that remains unanswered. There are tons of aspects that could have been better yes; like that the music had too little drama, power and thrills or that there wasn't enough space or that too many scenes were shown in the trailers. Yes, the film got flaws. But ohh boy it's good. It's been thirty years since RoTJ and we still, after seen the film, got questions. Everything basic with the film is excellent - flawless dialogs with humor, minimum exposition are presented in a very discrete way, splendid & unique J.J-cinematography and one of the most emotional endings in the franchise (but a bit too convenient). Everything that George Lucas failed to deliver in the prequels are top-notch in this film! Star Wars has finally returned, and it really uses a lot of its passed self to build this new foundation on. Sure it’s no 'Empire Strikes Back', but it didn't need to be. It’s one of the best in the series, but not as inventive! J.J Abrams gave the franchise new energy, but perhaps too much to please the fans and forgot the regular moviegoers. It's a character driven fan flick, and it got better after every time I saw it (3 times). There're lots of teases throughout the film that really did diminish the flaws that are mentioned above, and it took time to notice them.Star Wars is finally back! Personal rating (1st viewing): 85/100, 3rd viewing: 90/100Critical rating (1st viewing): 81/100, 3rd viewing: 86/100",1
20,"A long time ago in a galaxy far away there was great sci fi movies that went by the name of Star Wars and we have finally returned there. This movie was the best possible return for the original great trilogy. Not just playing off of nostalgic moments(although it did have it's moments) but also adding great new characters that we grow to love and respect just as much as the original cast like Han Solo and Luke. And a villain although certainly not as great as Vader(not at all surprising) but fascinating and unique in his own way he wasn't like Darth Vader and it's a very good thing because no one does what Darth Vader did like Darth Vader. Not to mention the superbly filmed action scenes that i just sat and drooled over while watching the epic battles unfold before my eyes. There is a few complaints that i do have however they are quite minor but i am going to warn you there are some spoilers ahead and if you have not yet seen the movie i recommend that you do not read the following entry into my review you have been given a good long proper warning so here we go. The complaint that i have is that in pretty much every Star Wars movie i do like to see a well done light saber duel a battle between two masters such as Obi Wan and Darth Vader however you didn't really get that in this movie it was really only two i'm going to be honest here rookies going at it and my second complaint was that you didn't get to see Luke Skywalker until the very end of the movie which kind of disappointed me because i really like the character of Luke. Overall though disappointment doesn't take away from the awesome experience that The Force Awakens brought us and it gets a 9/10",1
21,"I want to say this first, whoever gives this movie less than 5 is not being objective in my opinion and is just trolling… With that out of the way… I won’t call myself a die hard Star Wars fan but did enjoy the previous films, and, must admit that I even enjoyed certain moments in the prequels. The GoodSo off the cuff. I would rate Star Wars The Force Awakens right up there with the Empire strikes back. The acting was great in most instances. I enjoyed Rey, Finn and Poe’s characters. Kylo Ren was my favourite though. Han Solo was also better than what I expected. Great special effects and sound. The BadThis didn’t bother me so much but I if I have to single out a problem I would say that this movie borrowed allot of the plot elements of episode 4, but as my art teacher told me “Originality is overrated, if you can improve on something and it works then why not.” 9/10",1
22,"After the long, long wait, I honestly expected JJ Abraham's entry in the legendary science-fiction series to be a bit like Halo 4 - good game, but not a true Halo in the sense of atmosphere & that big presence you feel when playing. But this sci-fi blockbuster NAILED the atmosphere. The sheer nostalgia I felt at the end(which I won't mention any specific bits of, since if you're reading this you probably haven't seen the film) made me remember my childhood, watching Episode V over and over & playing with toy lightsabres and OH MY GOD, so much nostalgia. While I was upset by the death of a certain someone, the villain made up for it. He had something I'd never seen before in a bad guy - being torn apart & slowly driven insane by the dark and the light. Now I only have to wait until 2017 for Episode VIII..... dammit.",1
23,J.J. Abrams had an almost impossible task but did very well. While he played it very safe his The Force Awakens is a masterfully done movie and a good start for the rest of the new trilogy. I would rate it the fourth best Star Wars Movie and that's all I hoped for.,1
24,"Finally saw SWTFA this past weekend after all the hype and hyperbole has died down and stayed away from any spoilers. That said, the movie was definitely entertaining. But afterward, I felt something was missing. I hate to use the word pedestrian, but besides the nostalgic feeling seeing the favorite characters (Chewie practically stole every scene he was in, IMO, not to take away from Ford though) return to the big screen, the magic was missing. The action sequences were well staged, the special effects (except for the Rathtars in the hallways) were well done (let's admit, effects artists can create ANYTHING nowadays) and mostly practical. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley (her first film??!!) did very well as our protagonists, while Adam Driver was mixed (seriously, SPOILER......Han and Leia created THAT face?) And that's another problem I have with the series as it continues. It's like the line from Spaceballs..."" I  am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate."" In a galaxy not only far away, but assumingly populated by billions of people and creatures, does everyone have to be related?",1
25,"Luke Skywalker has gone missing and General Leah Organa has dispatched her best resistance fighter pilot, Poe Dameron, to investigate. These details (as you probably can tell) are part of the opening crawl and sets the tone for the seventh Star Wars movie. It's a fun, emotional and poetic motion picture that really captures the spirit of the original trilogy. It's imperfections are few (the film may have left me wanting a little more than it should have), but this is still the joint second-best chapter in the series. It's as good as A New Hope, but The Empire Strikes Back remains my favorite. What is truly astonishing about Star Wars: The Force Awakens is how it manages to retread the familiar beats of A New Hope, but remains fresh and exciting nonetheless. I loved the new cast. Rey, Finn and Poe are fantastically realized characters, especially the very good Oscar Isaac who plays Poe (he's the new Han Solo of this trilogy). The ending is not a definitive one, but it's emotional and moving; the final shot will grab you and leave you thinking about what it could mean for the next two episodes. The original Star Wars movies are legendary. This film is magical.",1
26,"I enjoyed this film thoroughly.  The characters and aspects which were re-introduced from past films did so in a tasteful and relevant way.  I felt that the story was well written and told, with the exception of Carrie Fishers' scenes.  They just fell flat and that is the one real critique I buy from all these harsh reviews.  The story probably had some ""holes"" in it as well, but nothing too critical that  would distract from the characters or general plot. All-in-all this is a solid film all the way through, that is easy to follow, and will make you refuse to go to the bathroom out of fear from missing something.  A well-deserved 8/10.",1
27,I absolutely loved it! It felt like it had been made with a lot of love as well as an understanding of what makes Star Wars great. Not a big fan of Abrams but he has proven himself to be the perfect choice to relaunch the franchise.,1
28,"Even if its nowhere near as good as episode 5 and 6 this is still one of the best movies of 2015, totally living up to the hype it justify going to see this on release date, great new comers as well as a lot of nostalgia and a lot of fan service, this is a hell lot better than the prequels and its not the piece of **** that some people say it is.",1
29,"Pretty Much Perfect. The film is funny, exciting and thoroughly entertaining. The new cast members are great, particularly John Boyega as Finn, who provides most of the comedy in the film (an interaction with new droid, BB-8 and another with Han Solo being two stand out examples). Daisy Ridley is similarly terrific as Rey, though she takes on a far more serious role. The plot hits many of the same major notes as ‘A New Hope’, but remains different enough to feel like a revitalisation, as opposed to a simple re-tread. Original cast members are used effectively but sparingly, giving the new cast room to breathe and start developing their own characters. Also, the action scenes are intense, well-directed and spread out just enough that the film never feels exhausting or over-stuffed; an early chase through the wreckage of a Star Destroyer, featuring the Millennium Falcon and a couple of Tie-Fighters, standing out as one of the best in the movie. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. If you are a fan of the series, the chances of you being disappointed are slim to nil. Go see it as soon as you can. Then get on the hype train for Episode 8.",1
30,"All I can say is it's pretty clear that the people that didn't like TFA clearly flocked to metacritic to try to be as anti-hype as possible. Every positive vote review is getting a ton of unhelpful votes, and all the negative ones are getting unhelpful reviews right off the bat. Kinda silly. I liked it. Characters were fun, action was good, visuals were great...I did a full review elsewhere so I don't feel like getting into the pros and cons or even my full review. It's not perfect but it's a hell of a lot better than the prequels.",1
31,"Star Wars the force awakens is a very well rounded movie. The writing, cinematography and theActing make this movie a very recommended watch for all.",1
32,"The Force Awakens is going down in history as the most successful movie when it came to making dollars. The movie imo isn't as good as ""a new hope"" and ""the empire strikes back"" but still is a solid movie. The movie contained great sounds and production along with bringing back memories from the original trilogy such as the millennium falcon and old characters. One big problem is that the story copied a few things from the original star wars. (Death star, locations, etc) but it isnt as big of a problem as some people say it is.    P.S. Idk why it is rated pg-13 and that probably scared away overprotective parents. Screw Voluntary Movie Rating System.",1
33,"Sometimes the best way to decide if you like a film is how good you feel walking out of the cinema; and I had a big grin on my face. The new characters were very engaging, the action sequences thrilling (I particularly enjoyed the sequence on Hans' ship) and many a laugh out loud moment (Chewie and BB8 having particular moments). Some marks taken off for a slightly rushed final sequence and perhaps an overly-similar plot to Episode IV but these were far outweighed by the positives.The most Star Wars-y Star Wars film ever; including the originals.",1
34,"The greatest achievement of this movie is that Abrams has succeeded in creating new characters that could become cinematic icons that will stand the test of time. I'm talking about Rey, Finn and BB-8. For that, he must be applauded. With reference to the review below, in answer to your question about IMDB - this was organised by fans of the EU who arranged to flood review sites with negative reviews by creating multiple accounts. Look to the overall rating to get a true idea of the consensus. Thanks.",1
35,"(+) The movie looks really good.(+) The main villain, and a few other characters are interesting.(+) The movie feels like the original ones.(+) Good action sequences(-) It shows too much resemblance to the New Hope, it lacks creativity and courage.(-) Most of the main characters are boring, unreal, or just being a copy from the original series.",1
36,"Like many Star Wars fans, I've waited so long for a worthy sequel to Return Of The Jedi. We all thought that the prequels released between 1999-2005 would fill that void, but as we all learnt, those films are better off where they belong, very much In the past... With The Force Awakens, JJ Abrams and the entire team that worked on this film have absolutely nailed it! I can't even begin to imagine the amount of pressure they must have felt to get this movie right and to satisfy the fans of what has become one of the most iconic movie franchises In the world, but I believe they have done the Star Wars universe some much needed justice. The film itself manages to combine a great sense of old with the new. Han, Leia and Luke return yes, but Its the addition of the new characters as well as the old guards presence, that really brings the film to life and really makes you care about all the characters, not just the characters we have known, and grown to love over so many years. The 146 minutes of viewing time flew past and not only am I eager to go and watch the film again, but I cannot wait for the next installment and to see where the future of Star Wars takes us...",1
37,"This is the Star Wars movie we should have gotten after Return of the Jedi. The characters are well written and the chemistry between them feels real. The story has the adventurous feel that the prequels sorely lacked. The action scenes are incredible fun and the practical and cgi effects look gorgeous. The John Williams scores are as always amazing. The only criticisms I can think of is that the movie does indeed borrow much from A New Hope, but there are so many twists and differences that I wouldn't even consider it a con. What keeps the movie from being perfect is a number of coincidences that are obviously there for fan service but the strong performances more thank make up for this. I give this a solid 9/10 but I will write this out as a 10/10 only because I know some bozo is going to give it a ridiculous 0/10 which I don't even believe the prequels deserve.",1
38,"A very fine movie with amazing effects and shots, The Force Awakens delivers an entertaining start of a new trilogy. With a mediocre plot, amazing characters, and interesting twists, this movie gets a 7 out of 10.",1
39,"The Force will be strong in this review. If you were ever looking for a movie that lives up to a very long hype, that movie is 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', a movie that, in my opinion, is just as fantastic and thrilling as ""A New Hope"" (1977) and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980). Directed by J.J. Abrams ('Star Trek' and 'Super 8'), the movie is filled with gorgeous set pieces, some fast-paced action scenes that is pure eye candy, and a well-told and well-paced story. Luke Skywalker has disappeared since the events of ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), and we meet some new characters who try to find out where Luke is. We meet a pilot named Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who is sending a BB-8 Droid the map to where Luke has disappeared to. We also meet a former Storm Trooper whose name is Finn (John Boyega, in an ambitious performance) who is on the run from the orders of the film's main enemy, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who promises to finish the job that Darth Vader set out to do. Finn ends up in an accident and meets up with a young, female protagonist named Rey (Daisy Ridley) and they agree to help each other to send the droid where it needs to be in order to find the missing, legendary Luke. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, and his accomplice, the wookiee, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) in order to help the two young warriors find Luke and finish their mission. More familiar characters do return in this movie, but the main focus is on; Rey, Finn and Han. These are the three reasons why anyone, ""Star Wars"" fans in particular, should see this movie. Back in 1999, everybody was waiting so long to see ""The Phantom Menace"", and the result was disappointment, and mostly hate. That wasn't the movie everybody wanted to see. In my opinion, ""The Force Awakens"" is what ""The Phantom Menace"" should've been. Filled with superb action, a memorable plot, and some troubled characters with a dark past, who we end up caring for. Many of you may, or may not know about my strong dislike for 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014), a Marvel comics movie made very similar in style to ""Star Wars"". This was also the movie I wanted ""Guardians"" to be. The humor has to be reduced to when it's appropriate to joke, the characters need drive and focus instead of being so thinly written and having forced romance (Drax and Gamora from ""Guardians""). The action needs purpose and the villain needs motivation and needs to be memorable (Does anybody still remember Ronan from ""Guardians""?). All in all, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a movie that is worth the hype, everything from the action, to the characters, to the plot, right down to hearing the iconic theme by John Williams while the opening credits still remains the yellow text crawling upwards on the screen. It's nostalgic, but also new and fresh. J.J. Abrams did a fantastic, albeit very complicated, job of bringing in over 30 years of ""Star Wars"" into one movie, it may look overcrowded, but it's organised to a fault. You will have no trouble following the story, plus with a few surprises added in, this is a movie that is not to be missed, and must be seen in the theater. This is why, for me, it is a 10/10. Absolute perfection...",1
40,"Easily the second best Star Wars film (behind episode 5) with it's great characters,great story and amazing directing by JJ Abrams, the people who don't like this wonderful film are clearly trying to be special snow flakes. I would say go see it but you probably have already.",1
41,"Great movie. the chemistry between the old and the characters is great, the special effects and sound was amazing and the story build up is very well done. the movie is made in such a way that a non star wars fan will love it. the only problem i had with the film was that there was a bit of an over use of humour (which i don't think really takes anything away from the movie). overall : amazing movie, good visuals, amazing cast and acting and great storytelling, its good to know that star wars is finally back and may the force be with you.",1
42,"Star Wars the force awakens reminds me everything I love for Star Wars,this entire movie kinda feels like ""a new hope"".It the same kind of formula.The story this time tells a good story.2 heros in a movie this time,Finn and Rey.They are the best characters I have ever seen in a Star Wars movie.J J Abrams is really good at making a good character.Kylo Ren is also an amazing character,he is unique in his own way.Not just a Vadar-like villian,He is more like a emotional person.Other people in the first order just feel disappointing.Space battles are too few in this movie,it focus on ground combats and the characters.The lightsaber battles are fantastic,it is like real person fighting with a sword,you can see Kylo Ren,Rey and Finn all very afraid with each other,and when they start to fight against each other,it just the best lightsaber battle I have ever seen.Overall The force awaken is an outstanding movie,but some of the characters don't do much in the movie,like Captain phasma.The whole movie and the ending is very epic.But there are some questions that the movie don't answered,probably going to explain in the next episode,I recommend every star wars fan to watch this movie right away.",1
43,"A decent return for Star Wars. While it is no where near the awfulness of the prequels, it also doesn't quite reach the heights of a film like Empire Strikes Back. John Boyega did a great job as Finn and the rest of the supporting cast was pretty good as well. Rey on the other hand I found to be annoying and whined too much. Also a big reveal occurs much too early for it to have a major impact later in the film. Overall The Force Awakens has some great visuals, excellent action scenes and some good performances. This film isn't a masterpiece or even the best film of 2015, but it is a fun time.",1
44,"It's a great movie, far better than expected. It has its shortcomings - namely being to faithful to its source material and not really delivering something new - but the great pictures and a decent cast ultimately make the movie a satisfying and worthwhile experience.",1
45,As a fan of the original trilogy I was happy VII delivered a meaningful morality play with soulful characters. Storm troopers have personalities! It had sentiment and excitement. I'm thankful for the fearless new plotline. The force and franchise will thrive.,1
47,"Fun, visually jawdropping and well acted, Star Wars The Force Awakens is a welcome return for the Star Wars franchsie after the dark times (the special editions and the prequels). This is the best Star Wars movie since 1983 (the year when Return Of The Jedi came out). It mixes the old and the new perfectly.¨The new cast (Daisy Ridley, Jon Boyega and Oscar Issac) is great, as well as the old cast (Mark Hamill (even though he does not say a single word in the movie xD), Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford). The effects are fantastic (minus the CGI on the rathtars and Mas Kanata). It mixes CGI effects and practical effects wonderfully. It is a fun ride from start to finish with great banter between the characters, realistic looking lightsaber fights (more realistic then the cartoon fights in the prequels), exciting ship to ship battles/chases (The Millenium Falcon chase on Jakku was an edge on your seat level ride :D) Kylo Ren was a great villian. He was conflicted, had understandable motvations (he wants to be as powerful as Darth Vader was) and the scene between him and Han Solo was perfect (it is also the scene where Han Solo died, which was heartbreaking ;_;) The flaws I had with TFA is as I said before the CGI on the rathtars and Mas Kanata. They didn`t blend in that well and look like something from the prequels (which is not good O_O), the stupidly over the top speech from General Hux on Starkiller Base was so unintentionally funny and Starkiller Base (it was just a third Death Star, but the end battle on it was fun :D) Overall, I give Star Wars The Force Awakens a 9/10. I have seen it 3 times now, and I want to see it one more time before it goes out from the theaters and releases on Blu Ray/DVD. I am pleased with what JJ Abrams, Disney and Lucasfilm has done with The Force Awakens and  I am excited for Rouge One this December, Episode 8, Episode 9, and furte sequels and spin-offs.",1
48,"The Force Awakens is proof that if you go into the theatre with moderate expectations, you will be blown away when it turns out great. I'm sure that gave away my general impressions of the movie, which is fine because you've either already seen it and want your feelings backed up or you haven't seen it at all yet. The latter of which is weird. The first twenty minutes after the opening scene of the movie are the best part based on a pure storytelling standpoint. There is very little spoken dialogue by Rey, our main character but we still understand her. The excellent shot design shows us exactly when the movie is set, the state of the galaxy, our main character's motivations, personality, hopes and dreams. They do a fantastic job showing why we care about Rey with next to no exposition. I've praised the first scenes of the movie, does that mean the rest feels lacklustre? Aside from a few scenes, no. With that said, I enjoyed nearly every scene in the movie. Even the ones that didn't necessarily need to be there. I recall the first action scene after meeting Han Solo and Chewbacca, while fun it was entirely pointless for as long as it went on. The action scenes were decent, but not great. This is the way it should be as Star Wars doesn't need to be The Avengers. At least not the main trilogy, feel free to switch it up for Rogue One! The main problem with the action scenes is they are mostly similar. Tie fighters attack the ground, there's some people there, things blow up. The lightsaber fight on the other hand was awesome. I've seen people criticize that it wasn't choreographed or fancy enough. I disagree given the characters presented. They had a dirty fight for their lives without all the dancing and prancing we saw in the prequels. While I loved the Darth Maul fight scene in The Phantom Menace, we didn't need that style for this movie. The characters save this movie in a big way. The casting is bang on for every single character. Daisy Ridley owns her casting and gives Rey a much appreciated personality, John Boyega puts on the upset performance of the movie and Oscar Isaac plays pulls off the perfect cross between Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in Poe Dameron. Speaking of Han Solo, Harrison Ford fell back in to his role with much more grace than I expected. It felt like Han Solo plus thirty extra years. He didn't play the exact same character, there was a nuance of guilt and trepidation from him throughout the entire movie. Good on you, Ford. Kylo Ren has been a point of contention among people. I think Adam Driver does a pretty good job with the character he is given. Kylo Ren is not supposed to be a a big bad villain, he's a troubled kid trying to rebel who got caught up in more than he wanted. He reminds me of Prince Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender, which is a huge compliment. Supreme Leader Snoke is the master of Kylo Ren, leader of the vicious First Order and most generic baddie this side of Mos Eisley. There is absolutely nothing interesting about this character so far. We know he's evil because he looks like the wrapping photo on a cigarette box and talks like he smoked the pack. Sidious had mystique around him, but they begin with an unhooded Snoke, stunting the reveal and have him do absolutely nothing to captivate an audience. He reminds me of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe villains I just can't remember. I hope that they have Andy Serkis do some spider wall crawling with multiple limbs or something in the next one. Snoke is a very poor CGI job which is a shame considering the majority of the movie looks fantastic. This is mostly due to J.J. Abrams living up to his word and using real props. What an idea. The real suits and sets work extremely well with CGI touches to clean it up. More movies need to use this formula and I haven't been this impressed with practical effects since Hellboy II: The Golden Army. It does make certain non-practical effects look much worse especially when making living things, as evidenced by Snoke. The set design is an absolute masterwork. Every location has so much detail and speaks to you like it has a history behind it. They varied up the locations enough too, with my favourite being a particular snowy forested place. Props to the people that made the props. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a compelling movie to all Star Wars fans that is sure to be remembered in the future. It's the type of movie I am looking forward to showing my kids one day so they can appreciate the same universe I did growing up. A love-letter to the original and passing of the lightsaber to a new generation. While it does have flaws, that's all part of the charm. I can fondly say that it gave me the same familiar feeling I had watching the originals as a kid.",1
49,"Star Wars The Force Awakens gives me great hope for the future of the saga. Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, it gets back to basics and achieves what it set out to do - introduce Star Wars to a new generation.",1
50,"For me, the biggest problem is the way they resolved the threat at the end of the movie.  It seemed absolutely ridiculous, which is saying something after sitting through every other Star Wars movie ever made, and not once being as appalled at the lack of thought put into a resolution. That aside, I really did enjoy most of the movie, so I'll give it a 7.",1
51,"Such an incredible movie. I laughed, cheered, cried, and applauded. I think most of the people who dislike this one were just wanted something that wasn't Star Wars and so were disappointed when J.J. delivered a movie that is most definitely Star Wars.",1
52,"Personally, I enjoyed The Force Awakens. It was great to see the legacy tribe return (aka Fisher, Hamil, and Ford). On top of that the special effects were top notch, the new planets were interesting, and the new dynamics were engaging. Can't wait for Episode VIII!",1
53,"Okay, we all knew it. Star Wars VII would never live quite up to the masterful creations of the Original Trilogy. But anyone has to admit, it was a pretty darn good movie! I am ready to admit, I grew up as a Prequels kid. I had just one VCR tape in my possession and that was Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Call me deprived, but at the time, I thought it was amazing. Hit 10, I had watched all of them, and by 14, I understood that the prequels were definitely not as good as the OT, regardless of its flashy effects and the presence of Ewan McGregor, my favourite actor at the time (still top 10). I learnt to love the original ideas of Star Wars - odd band of misfits in search for princess before destroying bastion of evil and representation of oppression in form of moon-sized superweapon. Once I understood these, the core components of Star Wars, story and characterisation, not necessarily the flashy lightsaber fights and big battles, I began to think about how someone should have given A New Hope to Star Wars, even if unable to remove the marring stains of the Prequels. For me, at least, The Force Awakens was that chance. Admittedly, I joined the hype train. From pulling all-nighters to watch trailers as-released, as well as film theories and snippets of information, to buying a number of Chewbacca shirts in preparation for the big day (howl out to my Wookiee brethren), I was into it. I knew in the back of my mind that it would disappoint. The question was how much. The answer - not much. Not much at all. As a person who, within the first two weeks, had watched it seven times, I can attest that no matter how much this film lets us down, it drags it up just as well. Yes, the action was a bit too fast paced, with focus constantly changing from one moment to the next, and the story itself was a bit slow, but I enjoyed it. It played to my nerdy self, giving me hope that Star Wars is going to new places. So let's go to the nitty gritty. Characters. We are introduced to a cast of new faces, from the maverick Poe Dameron to John Boyega's rendition of ex-stormtrooper Finn. Probably the star of this show, with a beautiful accent to match, is Rey, as portrayed by Daisy Ridley. Her shifts in character and beats in each scene are articulate and well-crafted. The music is done beautifully, with John Williams reprising his role as Star Wars' composer, and multiple parts of the music mirror those from the Original Trilogy gorgeously. As well as this, pieces such as The Abduction, Rey's Theme and some others have made good additions to the list of Star Wars Leitmotifs. All in all, Episode VII has made its way into Star Wars history, and I believe successfully. People have been waiting a long time, and it would never have been just as good as the Originals. But certainly it isn't the Prequel trilogy, and that is something very good.",1
54,"Star Wars is back, and it’s back in spectacular fashion. After the opening crawl, the opening few shots and the first character interactions, I knew that Star Wars was back. The story is fast paced, humorous, visually stunning and emotionally gripping, ensuring director JJ Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan have successfully returned us to a galaxy far, far away. Whilst each member of the original cast was brilliant, it was the new cast that stole the show, particularly Daisy Ridley’s portrayal of Rey, and Adam Driver’s terrifyingly powerful yet human display of Kylo Ren. Such characters were subject to magical settings and themes and more fantastical elements displayed than ever before, and it was brilliant. Whilst no film is perfect, demonstrated as a few characters were underdeveloped and will hopefully play a bigger role in future acts, no character is expendable however and whether they are on screen for thirty seconds or an hour, each has a part to play in the progression of the story. The magic of the force, the magic of the lightsaber, the magic of aliens and starships, the magic of the Star Wars blockbuster, the magic has all returned and promises to thrive for years to come. The Force Awakens exceeds all expectations, and with perhaps one of the most emotional and spectacular final shot’s in any film to date, the audience is left both wanting to immediately watch the movie again and wanting to watch Episode 8. After years of anxious waiting, and years of positive signs we can finally confirm, JJ Abrams has done it. Star Wars is back.",1
55,"A thrilling throwback to the glory of the original trilogy. The new characters are lovable and the legacy characters are still awesome. Some of the best scenes are between Han and Leia whose chemistry is still there. Overall, I am thrilled to see where this new journey takes us.",1
56,"Not as amazing as I expected it to be, but still good and entertaining. Both a strength and weakness is in how heavily it relies on callbacks to the previous films, particularly Episode IV: A New Hope, which it closely mimics in terms of major plot points and even imagery. The fight scenes are better than I thought they would be, which is great since I'm big into action. The special effects, of course, are lightyears beyond what Lucasarts did with the original trilogy, making the whole thing more believable and immersive. The biggest strength is undoubtedly the excellent performances of the new characters, in particular Oscar Isaac's Po and Daisy Ridley's Rey. I will admit that I was the least impressed with Boyega's portrayal of Finn. Maybe it is the way the character is written, but it simply did not seem right to me. BB-8 is of course the adorable little robot that everybody wants to have nowadays, and had a number of fun moments. There are more than a few plot holes, questionable actions by characters, and seemingly dumb plot points that, as a long-time Star Wars fan, I am ready to forgive simply because the overall package was still a good enough beginning to the next saga of Star Wars.",1
57,"The force awakens is definitely a Star wars movie that can proudly sit in the top end of the Star wars spectrum. However, one could be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja vu when watching this box office beast. If it wasn't for the thirty year gap between sequels, then forgiving this movie for its recycled plot, might not have been so easy. Luckily its a thrilling experience to see such a beloved universe being given new life.",1
58,"This movie, unlike the prequels, has a soul. Star Wars is back, at last! Great story, multifaceted characters, some memorable scenes, a young woman as main protagonist, I love it to bits.",1
59,"I'd like to talk about Kylo Ren in this review. Ren could very well be the most interesting character to emerge from the Star Wars mythology. Beautifully portrayed by Adam Driver, here we have a young man desperately trying to live up to his Grandfather's legacy, and failing. Many fans have criticised Ren for being too 'weak', and that his appearance under the mask not intimidating enough. This seems to me to be an immature assessment of the character. These weaknesses and failures are the reasons Ren is so great - not as a leader or warrior, but as an character I want to watch unfold. And why his journey throughout the planned trilogy will be so utterly fascinating.",1
60,"The Force Awakens is the movie we've wanted for years. It has great characters, cinematography, music, just everything. The plot is basically the same as A New Hope but it doesn't matter in this case because that subplot isn't what's important in this movie, It's the story about Rey, Finn and Kylo Ren that is at the centre of attention and JJ pulls it off incredibly good!.  Amazing movie and me and a lot of other people just can't wait for 2017 when we get to continue this new piece of film history.",1
61,Its got all the right ingredients from the previous star wars films turned on by a 100% into a full blast of excitement and nostalgia at the same time. Loved everything about it! There is nothing more to add. Bring episode 8 now please!,1
62,"A return to form for the franchise. Highs, lows, tears, laughter, an absolute masterpiece of movie making magic. The returning characters that we all know and love do wonders for the film, and the new characters are interesting, lovable and all around brilliant. "" It's good to be home. """,1
63,"This movie is done expertly,however it has some glaring flaws I just simply cannot overlook.It is done well with great characters returning and introducing new interesting ones,and a single bad one I will talk about later.The Effects are amazing,you are on the edge of your seat as the Order sets off its super weapon.It catches your attention throughoutDialogue is great,nothing more to it.Story is....above average,there are some things are issues and I won't spoil it for the sake of spoilers. The worst part is the main villain who essentially takes Darth Vader's place,indeed a extremely hard part to fill but it is done bad.The character comes off as a rebellious teenager slamming doors and banging on walls. The movie is great,but I cannot give it a 10/10 like other people with these glaring flaws.",1
64,"WOW! The Force Awakens was everything I hoped it would be, and more. A perfect mix of old and new, playing on nostalgia whilst introducing elements that will take the franchise onto new heights. Disney have proved themselves to be worthy custodians of this precious franchise. Episode VIII can't come quickly enough.",1
65,"Bob Iger, Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams should be applauded for this sensitively handled 'soft reboot' of the Star Wars universe. It feels strangely old fashioned (in a good way), a million miles from the Fast and Furious, Transformers and countless over generic modern action films.  It's clearly aping the style of the original movie, and I think criticism of the recycled plot is fair, but despite this, it felt like a breath of fresh air for its whole running time. This is largely due to the new cast members who infuse the familiar story with spades of energy, soul and humour. The new droid BB-8 is a good metaphor for the film - likeable, fun, well rounded, cleary owes a great deal to the past while putting a new spin on the original.",1
66,"The only thing I don't like about this film it should have more Luke Skywalker. Hopefully next film will have more Luke and we will see him take on Kylo Ren. I love the new designs of the stormtrooper and x wings they are actually better than the ones from the original films without being too different. The new baddie Snoke should have been done with a real actor but that's a small complaint. Maz is amazing hopefully she will return in the next one. I like the ways she can see through people and what they think id like to see her in a scene with Kylo Ren, lets see whats going on in his head. Leia and Han it's so great to see these back too bad it cant last. I'd like to see Leia use the Force more in the next one. Rey is the best character in the new films and I think we will love her like we love Luke. It would be good to see her seduced by the dark side and join Ren, lets see what happens if she is not as strong as Luke. Finn is like the new Han Solo he's funny and a flawed character. I hope BB8 joins with Artoo in the next one, I never really liked C3P0 so wouldn't be to sad to see him go.",1
67,"This movie bodes well for future Star Wars movies - hopefully Disney will give the same love and attention to all these films. It's cleary evident that this instalment has been made by fans for fans. The nostalgic elements were appropriate this time, but let's hope the next entry is more daring.",1
68,Must admit this isn't gonna be the most objective review as I'm a MAAAHOOOSIVE Star Wars fan but s**t I freaking lost my sh** over this movie! :-) From the opening crawl to that awesome last shot I was hooked. In fact I think the only thing I was disappointed with was that there was no Fox fanfare at the start.....man I missed that. But he'll yeah this movie is da bomb!,1
69,"Star Wars fans will hate me for this review. This is the best star wars movie, yes i said it! I like the old trilogy, hate the new trilogy and love the newest movie!",1
70,"Este séptimo episodio de la saga fue perfecto para volver a traer a aquellos personajes de la trilogía original. Muchos se quejan que es una ""remake"" del ""A New Hope"", yo pienso que en cierta parte pueden llegar a tener razón, pero más que un ""remake"" lo considero más un homenaje muy típico de J.J. Abrams que hace en sus películas. Si bien la película me gustó, tengo que admitir que gran parte me decepcionó, pero eso no quita que haya sido una buena película. Uno de los primeras inquietudes que me generó fue el villano Kylo Ren. En los trailers lo hacían ver como un villano ""Bad Ass"", que parecía que podría llegar a estar en la misma altura de lo que fue Darth Vader, y al fin y al cabo es uno de los villanos más raros y peor logrados de toda la saga. En contraste por ejemplo en ""The Phantom Menace"", el villano de la película ""Darth Maul"", no tuvo nada de protagonismo en la película, pero aún así logró convercer y admirar a los fanáticos como uno de los mejores Siths de la saga. Otra cosa que me molesto fue el tema de la fuerza de Rey, no entiendo como de repente puede descubrir la fuerza y poder acabar con el villano, y Luke tiene que entrenar con Yoda en el Episodio V, solo para poder al menos combatir con Darth Vader. En comparación con las precuela, aquí John Williams, me decepcionó, creí que el soundtrack iba a ser algo más épico como las precuelas. Y por último quiero decir que se nota mucho que está hecho por Disney, podrán hacerlo con el universo de Marvel pero con Star Wars no queda igual. Quiero cerrar diciéndo que esta película es buena, entretenida, con actuaciones muy buenas y sobre todo el regreso de Harrison Ford como Han Solo, más carismático en esta película que en cualquiera de la saga. Es un gran regreso para la trilogía original, y de seguro atraerá a nuevo público.",1
71,"I really enjoyed the force awakens, the action was especially good as it wasn't shot in that horrible modern way like fast and furious and transformers where it keeps slowing down. star was is back and better than ever IMO.",1
72,"This movie is very funny , very entertaining .It has details I did not like .The characters well done. Everyone will like this movie .Go and see it .Leaves many questions unanswered.STAR WARS IS BACK !",1
73,"Star Wars was dead to me previous to watching this movie. I officially checked out when the Clone Wars movie released. Now I'm back on board 100%, the Force Awakens is a magnificent return to form.",1
74,AWESOME! That is only way to describe Force Awakens. This is the best SW film ever I hated the last three movies this is as good if not BETTER than parts 4 and 5. $2 BILLION  and counting this movie deserves to be seen again and again it will be up there with the greats.,1
75,So Star Wars! All those people who don't like it are just haters and had already decided it would not be good going into the movie. I am probably one of the biggest Star Wars and Star Trek fans out there and I loved it. So much of it lends to the rest of the Star Wars Saga. It is up there with Episode V. I love cinema and make movies myself therefore I have an idea what constitutes a bad film. I love all of Star Wars for various reasons and I guess unlike some of the reviewers on here I tend to be a positive person. I highly recommend this movie!,1
76,"Thank you JJ Abrams for bringing the magic back! For me, previous to the prequels, Star Wars had an indescribable magic that made those first three films different to anything else. Abrams' triumph is that he has somehow been able to re-create that magic and soul. JJ 100% gets what makes Star Wars different, and manages to express that on the screen. I don't see him as an artist, but more of a skilled craftsman. And that's exactly what this franchise needed.",1
77,"Have watched this twice now, first time would have given it a 7 or 8 but my enjoyment increased quite a lot on second viewing. Going into it first time I wanted it to be the greatest film I'd ever seen.....It wasn't.  Plenty to nit-pick. After the second viewing, with my lofty expectations no longer a factor, the film really bloomed. It has been made with so much love and care, and the actors really shine. I think I'll enjoy it even more with future viewings, just like I did with ANH and ESB (Jedi, not so much). Sure it has flaws and there is no denying the story is a re-tread, but it's all executed so beautifully it doesn't matter.It can't have been easy to create new characters that people are going to love like the old ones, but from what I've seen here they've done just that. And that's probably the crowning achievement of the Force Awakens and what makes it a great film.",1
78,The Star Wars magic is back - the true test was whether the Force Awakens could recreate the feeling those original movies. The answer is a resounding 'yes'. Credit to JJ and the crew for achieving what I believed was impossible.,1
79,"I absolutely loved every minute of the Force Awakens, been to see it three times now and I honestly think it got better with each viewing. There's so much to discover with repeated viewings (for instance I noticed Rey's Luke Skywalker rag doll on second viewing), I can't wait to see it again. There is no denying that the plot echoes that of Ep IV, but I think it was the right decision for the franchise moving forward. Get back to basics with this one, establish a new fan base among younger fans, and then move into unchartered territory with future instalments. Exciting times to be a Star Wars fan.",1
80,"Definitely my favourite Star Wars movie and possibly my favourite movie of 2015. The Force Awakens had a lot to live up to, and didn't disappoint. It's not without flaws but the overall experience was a 10/10 for me.",1
81,I must say I enjoyed this tremendously! If one is looking for a rollicking good time at the movies then The Force Awakens delivers. Particularly liked the Stormtrooper chap and his pilot friend but everyone involved was a lot of fun. All in all it was rather splendid!,1
82,"I've seen the movie twice, the second time was just as good, if not better, than the first and got to enjoy the story without wondering what was coming next. I thought the character development and interaction between the new characters, and the interaction with the established characters was excellent, there were plenty of nods and references to the previous films which I loved seeing, and the CGI was magnificent. I think the movie was an excellent bridge from the original trilogy to the development of Finn, Kylo Ren and Rey and I cant wait to see what comes next. I'm surprised at the number of hater comments for this film, it was pure spectacle and just what a Star Wars film should be.",1
83,"I have never seen any Star Wars movie and I have never been a Star Wars fan until i saw The Force Awakens. The storyline is great and the character relations are great as well. I have seen no mistakes in this movie and the acting is very well done. They also learned from their mistakes from the previous Star Wars movies. In TFA they used more practical effects making a realistic movie as if you are actually in the movie.I give this a 10/10 because I liked the movie, I have no regret at all watching it and it was an amazing experience. Go Star Wars :D",1
84,I watched the Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens in the cinemas in the odeon. The film was brilliant and i am a big fan of star wars for years and i want to carry on watching the film when the new star wars film some out on DVD.,1
85,Episódio VII é esplêndido e magnífico. Voltar a ver os velhos e eternizados personagens da trilogia original é uma grande alegria. Fora que o enredo é tão bom quanto o do Episódio IV. Menção de honra a atriz com a melhor atuação do filme: Daisy Ridley. Quem diria que a nova protagonista da nova trilogia fosse ser tão bem desenvolvida. Ridley realmente dá um show de atuação na pele de Rey. E Rey dá um show por ser uma personagem tão boa.,1
86,"Great movie that everyone not just SW fans should watch!People who only like the original SW Episodes IV to VI should simply stop watching this movies, you will simply not get what you want and that's a good thing. The original SW movies created that great universe we all love but apart from that they only offer a lot of bad acting.Everyone who complains about the acting and the plot of Episode VII should put off their rose-colored glasses and actually compare the new movie with the old.",1
87,"OH YEH Star Wars is the best film I seen all year!I love Kylo Ren! When he clattering **** out of that control panel! BB-8  is so cute and only he can compete with R2. Rey and Finn so cool I can't wait to see more. And Poe, well we need more of him in the next one! It deserve to be number one all time movie at box office I've seen it three times now.",1
88,"Giving it a 10 just to counteract some of the strange ""zero"" ratings it's receiving. No movie is worth a zero rating.  Not matter how bad.  People are just being angry grudge children about it.",1
89,"Although this movie was not great, it is a welcome return to what Star Wars used to be like before the last few Lucas movies destroyed the original series. The acting was not too hot, but the plot was decent and the special effects good. Although nothing special it felt good to be back again.",1
90,"JJ did it. Easily the best Star Wars since Empire, and it might even match that movie for emotional punch. Feels fresh and new, mainly due to injection of brilliant new protagonists Rey, Finn and Kylo Ren. The only scene I personally found disappointing was the Rathtars on board Han's freighter. This scene had the look of a generic fantasy/sci-fi pic with its use of CGI. The Scottish guy was a bit unnecessary as well, would have prefered they used more of the guys from The Raid. Hope they develop Maz Kanata a bit more in the sequels, I found her to be quite charming and unique.",1
91,"This film expands the Star Wars mythology (as can be the least to be expected after the EU being wiped clean) as well as providing a very promising backdrop for the future of the franchise. The very fast paced nature of the film left little room for too much dialogue but I would argue it wasn't needed as the story was quite probably the best anyone could've asked for which is in my opinion the main thing, other things can be expanded and cleaned up in the sequels not to mention the possibility of tie-ins in the other anthology films.",1
92,"Star Wars as its meant to be. A triumph from start to finish, the Force Awakens has everything that made me fall in love with this Universe in the first place.",1
93,"Whoohoo!!!!!! Force Awakens freakin' ROCKS man! Everything about this movie rules - the actors, the script, the effects......the little ball robot! The laser swords!!!! Harrison Ford is the Don. Chubacca, I love. This movie FLAT OUT RULES!!!!! Who give this movie zero out of 10 do you need a head examination!!?!?!?!?! What so this movie is worse than Transformers???? Don't think so!",1
94,Classic Star Wars . This is the movie Mr Plinkett wanted made in his notorious video reviews of the prequels - characters to care about with exciting action. Quite simple really.,1
95,"An absolute masterpiece classic! J. J. Abrams has brought his unique directing style to Star Wars and made Star Wars great again. J. J. Abrams made the Star Trek reboots better than the originals, now he's done it again with Star Wars. He made us forget about episodes 1-3, and let us start fresh with this new installment. This movie has amazing visuals and special effects, great new characters, awesome new villains, and good old Star Wars lore. Though it was a bit disappointing that they killed off Han Solo and Luke Skywalker was only in the end of the movie. But let's hope that the sequels can show more of Luke and bring back bad-ass Kylo Ren. An absolute must see for all the Star Wars fans and nerds out there!",1
96,"Things to like in The Force Awakens : Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, BB-8, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Maz Kanata, Millennium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, lightsaber battle, X-Wings in Takadona, Stormtroopers, humour, special effects, soundtrackThings I'm not sure of: General Hux, S.L. Snoke, Starkiller Base, General Leia, Unkar PluttThings I don't like: Starkiller briefing scene, Rey's Force abilities, Capt. Phasma",1
97,"This certainly was way better than I would ever have expected. It fixed the bad after-taste from the prequels. A bit disappointed that one main character only briefly appears at the end and that they killed off my favourite character also. But that being said, it all served it's purpose and created a very good setup for the next two movies. I hope the future directors can live up to the expectations set by this.",1
98,"This movie was excellent.  I've seen the movie twice now, so the following is based on my analysis of two viewings.  Minor spoilers will abound, but nothing too big. First of all, yes, this movie is very similar to episode 4, aka the ""original"" star wars.  So what!  It knows that it is doing this and, unlike the negative reviews, isn't pulling a fast one.  It is intentionally following a similar thread, almost like a symphony.  The prequels were actually supposed to be more similar to the originals until G Lucas messed them up.  But, to break it down - lost heroes unite.  One of them is strong in the force, they at the end is a battle, and the good guys destroy a space station.  Sound familiar?  Well, it happened in the Phantom Menace, A New Hope, and Force Awakens.  So any complaints about the story being a copy are unreasonable - the movie is intentionally being parallel to its predecessors. Where this movie SHINES is in its new cast.  Rey, Fin, Poe, and Kylo Ren were all excellent.  Han Solo served enough of a plot point but was necessarily killed off to leave room for the new group.  I was surprised at just how good this new cast is.  I haven't felt this excited about a group of characters in a sci fi show since the original star wars trilogy.  None of the prequels had this quality of cast.  Ewan McGreggor was good, Liam Neeson got killed before we could appreciate him, Sam Jackson was in the prequels too infrequently, so we were left with Hayden Christiansen and a boring version of Natalie Portman (who, aside from the prequels, is actually a great actress).  No such complaints can be found for the Force Awakens.  That move is simply awesome.  Go with an open mind.  Don't tear it apart due to its similarities to the originals - and just realize those similarities are intentional, and don't be too sad when you see Han die, it is sad, but don't let it ruin the movie.  All said, J.J. Abrams nailed this movie more than anyone else could have. Oh, and just to throw some fuel on the fire - Rey is clearly Luke's lost daughter...",1
99,"By far the best movie of the year so far. I loved the new and old characters, I loved the visual effects, I loved the story, I just loved every aspect of this movie, and I cannot wait to see Episode 8.",1
100,"If you enjoy the original Star Wars universe and are all grown up now this is a guaranteed 10 and will hold a special place in your heart, otherwise pic a number between 1 and 9. it's not going to be fully appreciated if you are the newer generation of fan and not lucky enough to experienced the nostalgia written into this. there has been an awakening and this has began to make thing's right.",1
101,"This Review may contain some mild spoilers Star wars VII is a good movie.  I enjoyed it, the actors are great, Original cast blends well whit the new one and I am not surprised that the vast majority of the viewers think it is great. But... as a (moderatly hardcore fan) I gave it a 7 because there is one element that I simply cannot get over.  How can a jedi train himself so rapidly.  When you know how hard it is to become a jedi and to master the ways of the force, you just cannot accept to see what hapens in the force awakens.  They will have to find a very good explaination for me to get on board this idea that you can somehow become so skilled, so rapidly and by yourself.  Every Star Wars movies, books or story driven games shows us that even the strongest force sensistive person needs time and training to use the force...",1
102,"Its hard to meet everyones standards and people immediately go in with a mind set. I loved this film, not better than the original trilogy, but it gave me hope to see more of my favorite space opera. I found kylo to be ugly, and wish for more background for certain things, but my favorite part of every movie and show beside obviously the plot and actual story is the easter eggs and they were amazing to catch! Worth every penny all 5 times i went in IMAX, the best way to see star wars! Way to go Disney.",1
103,"I am a huge fan of the Star Wars series, and this one did not disappoint. Disney has revamped the saga and still followed the traditional aspects of the other films. Friendship, bravery and courage are all prominent aspect  of all these films and the new characters in this one keep to suit. Harrison Ford stole the show training the new heroes on how to be a part of the resistance. Daisy Ridley was a great actress and I have a feeling her character will develop into a wonderful, beautiful Jeti master. I have high hopes for the episodes to come. I don't want to say too much, but the series new main character are very reminiscent of the previous character and I look forward to seeing how their paths cross and change throughout the series.",1
104,"How could it get any better? Episodes 4, 5, and 6 were already classics, but this is amazing. It perfectly blends Sci-Fi, Action, and Comedy. It also has a good soundtrack, good choice of cast, interesting backstory, realistic special effects and CGI, memorable characters, and the list goes on and on. I don't know what George Lucas's Idea was going to be, but what ever it is I don't was to know it because J. J. Abrams made this one of the greatest films ever.",1
105,"Absolutely magical return to firm for the Star Wars franchise. Take a bow JJ Abrams, this was everything I hoped it would be. The Force Awakens rocked!",1
106,LOVED LOVED LOVED the Force Awakens!!!!!!! For once I agree with the critics this is a wonderful movie I absolutely fell in love with. It deserves to be such a financial success because it has been made with so much care and love for Star Wars. JJ Abrams is the greatest!!!!!!,1
107,Force Awakens is my new favourite SW film. It's so good it almost makes me forget Ep I-III (actually Ep III is okay). Congratulations John Boyega winning BAFTA rising star he totally deserves it.,1
108,"The Force Awakens is proper old fashioned swashbuckling stuff, made in the spirit of the original three Star Wars movies. Non-stop fun from start to finish. Bravo JJ Abrams!",1
109,"To be honest I was nervous about this as I have not been impressed with any of JJ Abrams back catalogue - even the first Star Trek. Lost, MI;III, Super 8 - all terrible. And after seeing STID I was convinced this was going to be a disaster. How wrong I was! Abrams gets the tone dead right, includes just enough nods to the past without  becoming distracting, and introduces new characters who more than live up to the legacy of Hamill, Ford and Fisher. To be honest I would have been happy to see Abrams see out the full trilogy as he clearly 'gets' Star Wars. There's a fundamental understanding of it's appeal which he is able to translate onto the screen. As it is, Rian Johnson is taking the reigns - as a huge fan of Looper, Episode 8 could be the Star Wars movie to end all Star Wars movies.",1
110,"Awesome movie, awesome cast, John Williams awesome score, awesome mixture of practical effects and CGI, awesome comedy moments, awesome action scenes and awesome emotion. Just all round awesome!",1
111,"WOW - scrolling through these user reviews it's clear that many of the 'zero' scores have been written by the same oddball, using multiple accounts and uprating their own reviews!  As I said, just WOW! Please, if you're reading this (which I know you are) SEEK HELP NOW! Anyway, onto the movie. Lucasfilm made the right decision in sweeping away the rather ropey and old fashioned Expanded Universe and have created something far cooler. I mean, Admiral Thrawn? REALLY? A blue guy with red eyes with a snake around his neck? That appeals to a certain kind of person for sure but it ain't gonna cut it for a modern audience. Thankfully there's nothing that lame here.....just great new characters and action in an admittedly familiar story. Doesn't stop it from being an easy 10/10",1
112,"Force Awakens was my first proper exposure to the Star Wars films, having only caught snippets of previous instalments on TV. I have to say I was totally blown away by this movie! I was sceptical at first and was in no particular hurry to see it but I have to say I think it deserves the plaudits. The two new leads were great (seeing 'old favourites' return held no special appeal to me), I look forward to spending more time with them in sequels. The story was simple to follow and exciting, I didn't feel like I had to have any previous knowledge of the films to enjoy this one. Perhaps there were certain details I didn't appreciate the significance but I was surprised at how accessible it all was. I think it's worth mentioning that the tone of this movie felt perfect for a family film - I hope they don't go too 'dark' with the next ones, this had just the right amount of edge to please adults whilst not terrifying young kids.",1
113,"Equal best Star Wars film ever in my opinion. Sort of combines elements of the first two very effectively. To paraphrase the movie itself, this makes things right. Star Wars was not the prequels. This is Star Wars.",1
114,"Acting 9/10Screenplay 9/10Editing 10/10Sound effects editing 8/10Visusl effects 10/10Soundtrack 10/10 Would also mention the effective use of 3D.",1
115,"this movie is awesome!!!! love it! rey is so cool! but my least  favorite part is when kylo ren kills han solo. I cried when he died. still mad at him for killing him. but at least chewy is still alive! BB-8, han solo, finn, rey an chewy are my favorites!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
116,38 year old star wars fan here. Thank God JJ Abrams delivered. This was everything I hoped it would be. So much to look forward to with Star Wars now. And we are getting a film every year! Roll on Rogue One.,1
117,"Magnificent. That's the perfect word to describe this magical return to the Star Wars universe I love. Pretty much perfect, this movie was everything I wanted it to be.",1
118,"I totally flipped my **** for this movie, I've been three times and it gets better each time. Daisy is a total bad*** cant wait to see her again and John Boyega is soooooo funny. Lets see Daisy turn to the dark side and Kylo Ren switch to the light side, I think that would be an interesting way to make the next film. I wanna see more of Snoke as well, hopefully we'll get to see some dark side training which we haven't seen before.",1
119,"This movie is f*******g FAN-TAS-TIC!!!!!!!!!. JJ Abrams understands Star Wars and gives fans exactly what they wanted (unless you a entitled EU fan of course). The perfect antidote to the sterile stuff that has come out over the last few years pre Disney, I cant wait to get this on Blu-Ray next week!!!!! Bring on more. We want more Star Wars!!!!",1
120,"JJ Abrams' vision of Star Wars is essentially a fresh coat of paint on an old car. The Force Awakens is remarkably similar to A New Hope in numerous ways, and while I enjoy both of these movies, The Force Awakens doesn't quite captivate the same way the very first entry into this franchise does. What this film DOES do well is flash what lies ahead for us - the technical prowess is incredible here. X-Wings in formation striking beachheads or enemies in space are incredible. Everything George Lucas did through 6 episodes is suddenly garbage in the wake of the Abrams touch. The new cast is also solid, even if Kylo Ren's character isn't as well explained as I would have liked. Certain characters and the background story need some work to transcend all the other excellent franchises being iterated on year after year right now. Star Wars is no longer alone in the sci-fi world, it's merely a cornerstone and The Force Awakens does only enough to remind us of what Star Wars can be, but doesn't fully deliver in its resurgence. Regardless, this movie was very enjoyable and should please many fans worldwide. The BEST news is that Star Wars isn't limited to just episodes 7-9 as there are four other side-plot movies in development as well. So while the core story of this new Star Wars adventure isn't completely built yet (at least, in this movie), these other movies taking the Marvel universe approach could perhaps fill in some of the blanks and keep satiating our appetites for all things Star Wars.",1
121,"Best Star Wars ever. Beautifully made, respectful to the franchise whilst introducing new exciting elements. The Force Awakens was the perfect way to introduce the franchise to a new generation.",1
122,"One of great adventure films ever made. This has all the ingredients that go toward making a fun movie - propulsive action, great characters and a lot of humour that always hits the mark. The Force is strong with this one.",1
123,"Fantastic movie, and most people realize either this, or that it is at least good.  I'm not sure what pair of eyes and a brain could experience this and think ""Ugh, this was terrible"" or ""this is a complete rehash of episode IV"" or any other totally insane way of thinking.  This movie is the prime reason people go to the theater. Period.",1
124,"This movie exceeded all my expectations and a perfect start for a new trilogy. Daisy Ridley blew me away with her performance as a newcomer. although it parallels the plot beats of the original trilogy especially a New Hope,  i can understand why it needed to be made that way to take away the sour taste of the prequels and bring us back to the reason why we love the OT,it is  because of the CHARACTERS. this film is a character driven film and it is told through the point of view of the characters.i don't understand those who hate this film, the aesthetic look and editing of this film are enough reason to win  the awards. the use of practical effects and real locations are very nicely done. Overall i really loved this film and very much looking forward to the 2 sequels.",1
125,Watching this movie made me so happy. I actually like all Star Wars films including The Phantom Menace. But this was way better than any of the prequels and it is as good as A New Hope in my opinion. I love the soundtrack John Williams means everything to Star Wars. This was a beautiful movie well acted and directed. It score full marks from me. Jimmy.,1
126,"An absolutely glorious return to the original spirit of the Star Wars saga. Force Awakens was perfect. The cast, the writing, the effects - everything felt just right. Such a great time to be a Star Wars fan.",1
127,"+ Daisy Ridley+ John Boyega+ Adam Driver+ the new droid BB-8+ the updated X-Wing designs+ the Imperial grayeyard+ John Williams score+ ""Droid, please!""+ ""Sainitation?!?!?!""+ TR8-TR - the recycled story- not enough Luke",1
128,"Hugely entertaining, bursting with energy, with some serious emotional heft, the Force Awakens heralds an exciting future for the franchise. Abrams manages to skilfully blend new elements with the older familiar tropes to great effect. He is a master craftsman, rather than an artist, which is perhaps what was needed to get the franchise back on track after having being derailed by the reviled prequels.",1
129,"this movie flat out rules. this is the best star wars movie since empire strikes back. it was the most exciting movie of the year with the best special effects, best acting and best story. so much fun in this movie. all the new characters are brilliant but the old ones are good as well, especially Harrison ford as han solo. cant wait to get this on blu ray so I can watch many many times over. the force awakens is perfect star wars film.",1
130,"The Force Awakens is the best thing to happen to Star Wars since the Original Trilogy concluded over 30 years ago. One can vividly remember watching Empire Strikes Back when I was four years old - watching this movie on the big screen brought it all those wonderful emotions back, and it felt blissful. Star Wars is in the best possible hands now, Disney has a terrific track record of nurturing franchises rather than running them into the ground. Lets hope they give each new Star Wars movie the love and attention that has been bestowed on the Force Awakens.",1
131,"It's mindless sci fi action, just like the original trilogy. It's good to see the franchise back at it's peak: somewhere around ""good but not great"". I encourage people who consider themselves film buffs to go back and watch the original trilogy and ask yourselves if it even reaches the standards you remember it setting. That bar really wasn't so high, which makes it even more sad that the prequels couldn't reach it. It's no problem for JJ Abrams to rehash some genre tropes and throw them on the screen in a stylish setting. That's what The Force Awakens is and what the franchise has always been.",1
132,"A much needed CPR for the franchise arrives, and in the best form it could have. They played it pretty safe, I suppose, taking elements from Episode IV, but nowhere did it seem forced. Now, for me, the Star Wars movies have no nostalgia value, and I watched all the other ones about three years ago, but The Force Awakens still felt like it was something special. Let's be honest, J.J Abrams was the perfect person to direct this movie. I mean the guy created Lost, for crying out loud. So, yeah, great movie, and long live Han Solo.",1
133,"Probably only the 4th best SW film, but that's still an amazing achievement. JJ Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have created a handful of new characters that have a chance to become cinematic icons like those from the original trilogy. That was the real test - could these new characters hold a candle to some of the most beloved of all time? The answer is a resounding YES.",1
134,"The Force Awakens is a good movie, don't get me wrong, but i can't rate it higher because of several reasons. It is A New Hope all over again, and that bothered me. I found the new characters with the exception of Kylo Ren to be enjoyable. There was a ton of potential with Kylo but once we started to truly see him, I was pissed.",1
135,A worthy return to the franchise. Whilst for me not quite in the same league as the original trilogy it did enough to pique my interest for what is to come.,1
136,"Man I loved this movie, even though I aint a Star Wars fan really. I thought it was the best action/fantasy type movie of the last few years, definitely better than any of the recent superhero movies. The critics were right on this one, go see it if you haven't already caught it, its a blast.",1
137,"So there's bad films, then good films, then great films, then godly films, and then there's this one. Trust me, I've seen a lot of godly movies in my day, but the latest installment of the Star Wars saga takes it to a whole new level! I was actually upset when I learned that this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar. BB-8...he's cute. That is the only word that comes to mind. A cute robot. And I don't mean the Robin Williams robot from Robots. I mean an actually cute robot! Now, I nearly cried when Han Solo died. It was possibly the saddest of all death scenes in the entire franchise! I left the theater in total awe at this movie, IT IS THAT GOOD.",1
138,"Been fortunate enough to see this in IMAX 3D twice, and I felt that the format  really enhanced the experience. I haven't heard much about the use of 3D in this film, 3D is now somewhat passé, if not completely redundant, but I felt it actually added something in this instance. Seeing X-Wings, Tie Fighters and Star Destroyers flying out the screen was something I've wanted to see for a long time and it was tastefully done here.",1
139,"Perfect as far as I'm concerned - this was exactly the Star Wars movie I was hoping for. I particularly liked the portrayals of Rey and Kylo Ren, and how Rey was a Jedi/Luke Skywalker fanboy,  and Ren was a Dark Side/Vader fanboy. This was a fascinating and creative twist for new Star Wars characters. I look forward to seeing how Rian Johnson develops them in Episode VIII.",1
140,"There are four types of people giving this movie 0/10:1) Racists2) Sexists3) Entitled EU saddo fanboys4) A combination of all of the aboveIn fact, I would go so far as saying that it's actually just a handful of people, all fitting into category four, with multiple accounts, seeing as though they are all written in the same style raising the same points in the same order with the same lack of flair or critical insight. One can only imagine the lives these individuals must lead.JJ Abrams stated it was necessary to take a couple of steps back in order to move forward - that's bang on the money. This film establishes new characters in a familiar story that will open Star Wars up to a whole new generation. Future films written by Rian Johnson will be wildly inventive.If Disney had stuck with the EU, it would have killed Star Wars. The dwindling fanbase of that world would have been happy, everyone else would have found those stories laughable. Thank you Disney for making the right decisions with this franchise.",1
141,"The old magic is well and truly back. ""This will begin to make things right"" says Max von Sydow as the movie kicks off - prophetic words indeed.......",1
142,"The Force Awakens was spectacular. Being a Star Wars fan since 1980, I have very biased opinions about the franchise. I loved how episode 7 pays homage to the original trilogy. The dogfighting was cool and there was practical use of CGI, but I did miss the fight coordination and swashbuckling Jedi from the prequels. (Which I also loved, by the way, as it appealed to the rabid 5 year old fanboy in me.) The new characters are a fresh addition to the universe, and I can't wait for their stories to unfold in the next instalments. SW:TFA felt familiar and true to the action, comedy, adventure mix of the earlier movies, and all of a sudden, I became that excited,  5-year old again.",1
143,"Okay so I have deep love of Star Wars so this will be a bias review. The criticism that the story is too similar to 'A New Hope' is fair, but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of this movie at all. I can also see why people complain that Rey is too powerful but again, this is just a fantasy movie not true life so this doesn't bother me. And I actually liked Starkiller base, to me these massive superweapons are a part of Star Wars. So I understand the criticisms from fans but none of them were negative points, for most people this just makes the movie better. The Force Awakens added to the magic and the mythology of Star Wars, in fact this seemed like a theme in the movie, especially when Rey and Finn talk to Han Solo about the Force. The movie seemed to be to be also a tribute to Star Wars and also a sequel, it was able to serve both purposes successfully.",1
144,"I believe this one hell of a good kick back in the direction by J.J. Abrams showing a true devotion to his movies once again it brings back all the nostalgia and just n general is a great movie, this movie uses a good blend of CG I and practical making it a lot better than some other movies today that solely rely on it and I truly believe this movie will hold up for decades as the CG I used is not terrible or over used what so ever a lot of things being done practical like the original trilogy before the redo of all the terrible CG I. So its safe to say this one gets a high 9/10 from me.",1
145,"I saw the original trilogy in theaters so I've been a fan of Star Wars since the 70s. This is how I judge Star Wars: Did it make me feel like a kid again? Oh my god YES! That is something that the Prequels NEVER were able to do (Okay, in full disclosure maybe a for a moment when I saw the opening crawler in Phantom Menace I felt like a kid). For me the film in perfect in every way that matters. Story is great! There are so many layers that people will be finding new meaning for years to come. Characters are awesome! BB-8 is cute! Finn made me laugh and his loyalty to Rey was amazing. Rey and Poe is awesome; looking forward to seeing Poe really have more scenes. The original cast does an awesome job. Music is good, although there where no standout moments it was definitely a John Williams score. Special Effects is top notch. Finally massive props to Disney to hiring Lawrence Kasdan (the original screenwriter for Empire Strikes Back!) and J.J. Abrams for creating an absolutely worthy entry to the Star Wars mythos. Overall Episode 7 is my favorite Star Wars film. I say this as a kid who grew up WITH Star Wars from the 70s. For a long time 5 was my favorite. Just to be sure it wasn't a fluke I recently rewatched 4, 5, and 6 and I stand by 7 as my top pick. 7 is a powerful film in certain ways and in one amazing way which I won't spoil for you. To all the haters. I understand your reaction, I really do, but given time you'll eventually see that this film is definitely one of the best Star Wars film made.",1
146,This Movie WAS AMAZING!!! The Movie we asked ever since the credits rolled at the end of ROTJ!!! In JJ We Trust!!! I Loved an i recommend EVERYBODY WATCHES THE MOVIE!!!,1
147,"A hole in one, knockout punch, home run for JJ Abrams and Lucasfilm.This was so good it made me forgive Lucasfilm for all the damage they did to the Star Wars brand from the Special Editions to the Disney takeover.",1
148,"Force Awakens is my favourite movie if all times. All my friends and family lived this movie, it is the best Star Wars movie with the best actors, story and effects. It should have been chosen for the Oscars it is that good. This will go down as one of the greatest movies of all time. It deserves to beat Avatar as the number one movie of all time, it is so much better.",1
149,"BEST. STAR. WARS. EVER.It's that simple. It's that complicated. ""Too similar to Ep IV"" yeah whatever. ""Rey is a Mary Sue"" sorry you don't understand what that term means. ""Nothing new"" just a flat out lie. Fact is, this is a great film made with love and care for Star Wars.",1
150,"""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" 10 Scale Rating: 9.5 (Epic) ... The Good: Finally we have a Star Wars film that deserves to stand alongside the original trilogy. Like that original trilogy, The Force Awakens is character driven, giving us new leads that the next generation of fans will love. Unlike the prequels that gave us stiff dialogue and bland acting, this film is well acted (mostly) all around and presents deep and well fleshed out individuals. From the conflicted Finn, the independent Rey, and the menacing yet very human Kylo Ren, Abrams has crafted a cast that children will grow up enjoying. The baton was definitely passed  as we don't have the original cast crammed down our throat. They are support characters here as a new era of heroics and villainy begins.  As my generation grew up fantasizing about and pretending to be Luke, Han, Leia, Darth Vader, and R2D2 (to name a few), the next generation of Star Wars fans will do the same with Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo Ren and BB-8. Also unlike the prequels, The Force Awakens doesn't rely solely on CGI for the denizens of the universe and goes back to the series' roots. When it does rely on effects for a character, it looks far more realistic and is well done. Gone are the full blown cartoons that look out of place and instead we get creatures, allies, and villains that would fit right into the original film but with a visual upgrade. The action was well choreographed and the dogfights between TIE Fighters and X-Wings were intense. The humor was well placed and well timed, again hearkening back to the films of old. This movie was actually funny and a breath of fresh air after the stuffiness and seriousness of the previous trilogy. Ultimately, The Force Awakens is every bit as good as Empire Strikes back or Return of the Jedi and wipes away the disappointing memory of the prequels. The best movie of 2015 and among the best of all time. Cannot wait for the next installment. The Bad: All the issues I had with the film are minor and more nitpicking than anything. Gwendoline Christie's Captain Phasma, for example, was under-utilized and doesn't really do much despite over a year of build-up in regard to the character. Adam Driver (who played Kylo Ren, the main villain of the film) was hit and miss once he took his mask off, but eventually seems to settle into the role. A few of the story elements were somewhat vague when it came to the state of the galaxy and where everyone stands, namely The Resistance (Leia's group) and the New Republic. Lastly, several elements of the film were taken almost directly from A New Hope. Among other things, we have an orphan on a desert world who dreams of one day leaving, a robot that communicates with beeps and whistles that has information that both sides want, a masked villain who answers to a shadowy figure, and the bad guys have a weapon that is capable of destroying planets. It doesn't take away from the film, really, but it is difficult to ignore the similarities.",1
151,"100% the movie of the decade so far, TFA lived up to the ridiculously high expectations and in fact exceeded them, in every way. Can't wait for Episode VIII!",1
152,"The Force Awakens is is truly a spectacular comeback for the saga after the mixed response to the prequels, it is a lot like A New Hope but that is where it really succeeded . Reliving the old memories and. making new memories , this can definitely be compared with the original trilogy and it is much much better than the prequels",1
153,"No Spoilers. This movie was great. Some people are just never going to be satisfied, so don't worry about the negative reviews. If you don't like this, than you probably just don't like a lot of things. This is easily one of the top 3 films, way up there with Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope. Go see it, have fun, let it take you back to when you were first experiencing this world. Embrace it and you will be glad you did. Thanks JJ Abrams for saving the franchise!",1
154,"I loved it! It was really fun to watch. I had a great time. And finally - Star Wars is back! After all these boring prequels, we've got our favourite universe back again. Perfect job, Disney. :)",1
155,"I had a blast with Force Awakens. Not to be taken too seriously, thus movie was just a whole lot of fun. Great cast and some well done action scenes, great villain too. A must see for fans of action/sci-fi.",1
156,"My realistic rating is 9.5, but since that's score's not possible here, I'll go with 10 because this film was FANTASTIC! J.J. Abrams has managed to do what I think was impossible: Resurrect the Star Wars magic. Great characters and great action scenes are two of the reasons why I think The Force Awakens is the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back. It's definitely in my top three Star Wars films, that's for damn sure!",1
157,"I'll make it short: The Force Awakens is also the awakening of Star Wars. The first spoken words are ""This will begin to make things right"". It truly is. 30+ years after The Return of The Jedi this is the first movie, that actually feels like Star Wars. Plotwise there could have been a little more innovations, but I can totally understand that they were trying to go back to what made the originals great and more or less copy that for groundwork reasons. When you leave that aside, you'll get an all new Star Wars with great characters, fun, thrill, emotion, beautiful cinematography and much more. I couldn't be happier with it.",1
158,"First time around, I was mesmerized; blinded by nostalgia and overwhelming excitement. As the story sank in over the following weeks I began to realize the flaws. The deeper it sank, the lower my opinion fell. By last week I had completely removed this film from five star territory. So second time around I was expecting to see every flaw in full exposure, fully realizing every misfired attempt. To the joy of every midi-chlorian within me, was that expectation unrealized. I know, I know, those things are preposterous. Instead of realizing the flaws I had conjured up over time, a second viewing laid them to rest. Aside from my distaste in the quickness of Rey's awakening and the fact that Kylo Ren lost a duel to her and barely defeated a stormtrooper, nearly everything I thought I disliked was clarified. I initially found Driver's performance satisfactory and found the struggle within his character less than convincing. Second time around, I noticed the struggle was actually quite well displayed and Driver pulled it off wonderfully. First time around I hated Gleeson's role. Second time around, I still stand by my opinion that he was miscast and lacks the conviction to play a role suitable for someone twice his age, but he made the best of his position. In fact his Hitler-esque speech was quite well-performed. There were also many small lines and simple scenes that improved my overall opinion the second time around. I've now fully placed this film among the likes of the Empire Strikes Back. While nothing can match the spectacle of the original and the Force Awakens is not void of all flaws, the action is perhaps the best science-fiction has ever looked on a big screen, the comedy throws the franchise into the Marvel/Disney engulfed age of cinema we know and love today, and the story is engaging enough to earn your attention. Abrams also drops enough breadcrumbs for the fan in us all to eagerly await the next chapter. The only thing lacking in the Force Awakens is a darkness like that of Vader's, which is why the Empire Strikes Back holds such a special place in my heart. The Force Awakens is nonetheless an absolutely beautiful spectacle of science-fiction and what is perhaps the best thing about it is the road that lies ahead. I almost don't want the sequel to come too soon so that I may forever create the future in the fan-driven dreams of mine. Dear Rian Johnson, No pressure.",1
159,"J.J. Abrams saved the magic of Star Wars. For years, almost decades, the wonderful world of the galaxy far, far away was plundered and savaged by soulless, talentless hack G.L. and thousands of millenials writing their awful fan-fics that were getting stamps of being ""canon"" (""expanded"" universe). After the awful prequel movies, one of the WORST movies in the history of the cinema, Disney (of all!!!) decided to take the matters in their own hands and got the franchise back on tracks. The hutt overlord Lucas was so fed up on its corpse, he decided to sell it. He could do no more damage to it, the limit was reached with the Clone Wars.And Disney and J.J. Abrams reincarnated, resurrected the Star Wars back to its former glory. Ditched the whole prequels **** and murdered the expanded universe. The ""clones"" are mentioned once in the whole movie and stormtroopers are once again full fleshed human beings. Yeah, rabid milleinals and prequel's awfulness deniers are spilling out how much of the plot's structure was copied from the New Hope. Only shows how little they know about good film making and keeping up the franchise. This movie reinvented the good old Star Wars magic in the best way available. Despite the similiarities, the Force Awakens keeps its individuality and remains fresh. Although you could predict the main plot after the introduction of the new Death Star, the pacing and new characters with new personalities keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. Although Ray has surely too much mary-sueness to her, it doesn't assault the logics of what's going on around her too much. And the movie isn't centred on her completely, because the Finn character, which - in spite of my prejudice - came out to be the strongest character in the whole picture. The performance of his actor was absolutely stellar and it was absolutely amazing to watch him develop throughout the movie. The old team of actors didn't feel too forced and it's obvious they were having a blast returning to the Star Wars under a competent direction. What a great way to end their careers after >30 years since the first movie.The cinematography is absolutely stellar. The limited use of CGI and a **** of actual sets and costumes  shows its superiority over the phony, fake and unrealistic world of buffonery of the prequels. After a such wonderful restart I can only hope that they will keep the good job up. I'm aware the Disney is gonna milk their share as well from Star Wars franchise, but holy **** I believe they can do it with respect Star Wars deserves. Can't wait for the episode 8th and I hope for the hell of the spin-off with Rouge One movie.Keep it up, Disney!",1
160,Great Movie! I hope they change their mind about New Rouge and make a remake of the Force Awakens. It's a great movie after all! () () () () () () () (),1
161,"Walking out of this movie, I felt as if a promise that was made to me as a child was finally fulfilled 30 years later.  I turned to my sons (one of which is the exact same age I was when the first movie came out) and asked what they thought.  ""Can we see it again?""  Hard to argue against that. There is a lot of depth here that I can't go into without spoiling things, but suffice it to say that people will be talking about a number of the scenes for a long time.  This is a return to form - individual efforts rather than galactic politics, actors and sets rather than CGI, mythology rather than cataloging the make-believe. Fans will love this.  Children will love this.  People new to the franchise will need to see the first three (Ep 4-6) to understand, but then will love it.  Fans of Sci Fi will love it.  Students of film history and those who prefer the Bicycle Thief to The Fifth Element...well...maybe not so much, but they would if they let their guard down. Hands down, THE most rewarding movie experience I have had in 10-15 years.",1
162,"This was an amazing film, full of energy, drama and humour. I was enthralled from the start. This could be a launching pad for great things for Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver, all outstanding in roles that could one day become iconic. Lets just hope Disney can maintain the quality control, and don't eschew quality over quantity.",1
163,"я согласен, этот фильм не лучше других, но и не хуже. Нормальная история, а про спецэффекты вообще молчу. мне понравился.",1
164,"Straight up this movie is awesome. The new characters rock, man I am in love with Daisy Ridley!!!!! And Kylo Ren, he kinda makes Darth Vader look one dimensional. BB-8 is better than Artoo. Don’t want to hate on the old movies but this one sort of blows them away.",1
165,"A beautifully made homage to George Lucas's original vision, TFA superficially appears to be a remix of former glories but there are certainly significant aspects that feel fresh and new, specifically the new characters. Technical aspects are all first class, with John Williams score, perhaps less 'in your face' than previous instalments, the icing on a very satisfying cake. Star Wars is as strong as ever, long may it continue.",1
166,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens straight up rules. I loved everything about this film, yeah the story's the same as ANH but so what, it's a freakin' good story.",1
167,"Mad Max Fury Road, Creed and now this, 2015 was a great year for reinvigorating dormant franchises. This one hit the ball out of the park with an outrageously fun adventure. Popcorn entertainment at it's best.",1
168,"This is a great movie. The effects were great. The story was good and it definitely deserves the praise it has received. I've seen a lot of people say the story for this is terrible. In my opinion compared to the other Star Wars movies this is probably the best one in terms of story. Star Wars has never had a phenomenal story. Especially since Jorge Lucas eventually became more interested in selling toys than making legitimately good storylines. I do like how they didn't just make Kylo Ren completely characterless. He is infinitely better than characters such as Darth Maul who is a guy who wears a cool mask. That's his character. He is better than Anakin by far. There is a difference between a flawed character and a terrible one. Having a flawed character can be better in some situations. In conclusion this movie is really good. Possibly my best movie of the year.",1
169,"Roll on Christmas 2017, can't wait to see the second part of this new trilogy! Honestly, I feel so excited to see what happens with these new characters, particularly Rey and Kylo Ren. JJ Abrams has set the scene for an intriguing sequel and I haven't been this excited about Star Wars since the weeks before Ep I was released. I think Rian Johnson will deliver something special, luckily we have Rogue one in just 10 months time to make the waiting that bit easier.",1
170,"Having heard the news of Disney continuing the famous franchise for another trilogy, Star Wars returned to the screens last December with a fun-filled, action-packed adventure that saw us relive the nostalgia of the old trilogy, maybe not so much the prequels that followed however, and what a joy it was to watch and having seen it just short of twice now I remain confident to my view that JJ's work of bringing back that magic was successful on his part and that his work set up this whole new trilogy superbly. Introducing fresh new faces, adding twists and turns to what we thought would happen after seeing the trailer, it really was a brilliant film to see and although I may not have given it a 9 or a 10 - partially due to some smaller factors that could've been better smoothed out - it nonetheless is a film you must see and also a film that may encourage new, unknowing fans to give the franchise a go. The air of magic and mystery all added to make this film such a spectacle with truly breathtaking on-screen scenes and sound editing, it was just a shame they didn't bag anything at the Oscars, but what can you say when you're up against Mad Max. Whether or not the lower ratings on this site are from fans who were against the renewal in the first place or just didn't like how the story unfolded or was told, I firmly believe watching this film is worth while and teas up the next two sequels very nicely for the two other directors respectively.",1
171,"I grew up with the franchise as I was 12 when I saw the first movie - episode 4...and this movie goes back to the original formula and follows on form there...the three ""first episodes"" seem to have a life of their own and were detached from the first 3 but this one brings it right back home and the story feels directly connected. All is well in the world when Star Wars is great.",1
172,"Star Wars Reborn. That's the best way to describe the Force Awakens. From out of the ashes of the Prequel Trilogy and the Expanded Universe rises a Star Wars fit for the 21st Century. Taking the elements that built the iconic Original Trilogy and spicing them up with a game new cast, it's not hard to see how this has become one of the most successful movies of all time.",1
173,"With a structure like A New Hope, the Star Wars franchise is resurrected with a great cast, really good effects and excellent directing from J.J. Abrams.",1
174,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" spoke to my every emotion and effectively balances nostalgia and discovery in the galaxy. The characters are exuberant, the visuals are vibrant, and the directing is top-notch. ""The Force Awakens"" is a cinematic experience like no other, and becomes an incredible film.",1
175,"A movie that lacks originality and borrows heavily from A New Hope? Yes, that's correct for sure. But, is it badly acted? Poorly written? Lacking in action? Hell no. The Force Awakens is an excellent movie that everyone should watch. It's got great charm that resemble the humor of the original trilogy, exciting action scenes and great returning and new characters. I know, it sucks that J.J. Abrams was kind of lazy for this project, and it's definitely a shame for sure, I still think The Force Awakens is a very fun film.",1
176,"Perhaps not the most creative/inventive Star Wars movie, but what it lacks in that department it more than makes up for in being FUN - and that's the reason  I go to see a movie like this. What's more, it feels like authentic Star Wars.The game cast and funny script are highlights, and the action, whilst certainly familiar, is well structured and edited. The story is propulsive and it feels like it's over in the bat of eye - unlike many of todays bloated blockbusters.",1
177,"A hugely entreating return to the storytelling that made Star Wars such a hit in the first place. To be fair to George Lucas, his last three entries into the saga attempted to do something new, which is clearly not the case with Episode 7. However those movies were crippled with dialogue that no actor, no matter how good, could make sound good. This is where Abrams and Kasdan have been able to elevate the series - with great dialogue and brisk storytelling.",1
178,"I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The characters were well fleshed out and engaging, the story was involving and pleasantly free 9f exposition, and the design and effects were eye popping. First class popcorn entertainment.",1
179,"This is as good if not better then the original trilogy, no joke. This was amazing and is a thousand times better then the pieces of crap called the prequel trilogy. Now it does basically follow the formula of a new hope but it does manage to still sprinkle in some surprises. I am very excited for future films and you should be too.",1
180,Another great entry into the Star Wars saga after the disappointing prequels. Force Awakens has awakened my interest in Star Wars which had been dormant for many years. Back on the bandwagon now!,1
181,"The Force Awakens is a revalation - kudos to J J Abrams for casting these little known new actors who give the film the little push from 'good' to 'great'. Really excited for Episode 8, I have a good feeling about this.....",1
182,"This movie is the bees knees, the cats whiskers, the dogs b****cks. Boyega and Ridley have great charisma and chemistry, Adam Driver is some sinister **** as Kylo Ren and Harrison Ford is the boss. Couldn't possibly ask for more from a Star Wars movie.",1
183,"I'd like to address some of the common criticisms levelled at this film:1) ""The story is smilar to a New Hope.""Yes,  it is, and that's why its good.2) ""Rey is overpowered.""I would suggest this is an entirely chauvinistic complaint. Also, She doesn't beat Ren at the end, it's a no score draw.3) ""Kylo Ren is too weak.""Yes, he is, and that's why he's a good villain.4) ""It's trying to be politically correct.""If you have this opinion, it tells me all I need to know about you, and it immediately negates your right to be listened to.Great film, easy 10/10.",1
184,"The Force Awakens help to rebuild Star Wars after the prequels burned it to the ground. The story and characters are a mix of old and new. Kylo Ren is a menacing villain, and Po and Rey are great protagonists also. If you were burned by the prequels, The Force Awakens should help to cleanse your mouth.",1
185,This is a fun movie. It doesn't require deep critical analysis. It doesn't need to have alleged plot holes put under the microscope. It certainly doesn't need to be subject to discussion on political correctness. It's just fun.,1
186,"Give or take a few minor quips, Star Wars The Force Awakens was everything I hoped it would be. After a dark period post prequels, I'm so happy to have Star a Wars back in my life.",1
187,"I loved the Force Awakens, a charming, exciting, funny return to past glories. Abrams was the safe pair of hands that the franchise needed, and he delivered  a movie that should introduce a new generation to the joy of Star Wars.",1
188,"Oh my. George Lucas, you got owned!! I'm sooo very happy this turned out the way it did! :-DOh my. George Lucas, you got owned!! I'm sooo very happy this turned out the way it did! :-D",1
189,"A workmanlike entry into the Star Wars canon that avoids any major mis-steps and generally keeps it safe, although I think it's worth mentioning that Kylo Ren is an unusual villain - far more nuanced than what we've come to expect from this saga. It feels like JJ was re-establishing the status quo rather than making any attempt to break new ground (with the aforementioned villain the exception), and on that basis The Force Awakens is a massive success. Rian Johnson should be expected to take the story into more uncharted territory with the next chapter, the groundwork has been done and it's time for the sequel trilogy to spread its wings.",1
190,All i can say about this movie is that its AMAZING 100% ALL THE WAY  but its more like star wars a new hope but its really great i would watch it again,1
191,TFA rocks. Haters gon hate but the facts speak for themselves. 93% RT critics and 90% RT users.  8.4 on IMDB from nearly half a million ratings. This is a well made film and absolutely respectful of the franchise. Star Wars is in the best possible hands.,1
192,"What a great movie! SWTFA is just FUN FUN FUN, even though I don't consider myself a fan of Star Wars. I have been dragged back to see it again since seeing it at Xmas and, honestly, I think I enjoyed it even more second time round! Anyone who enjoys escapist entertainment will love this movie.",1
193,"J.J. Abrams have made a beautifully crafted Star Wars addition that balances new and old that adds up to enjoyable sci-fi entertainment. The haters need to just shut up, because this movie, while it was similar to A New Hope, it respected the old films and was rather a reimagining. Hater just hate it because it was better than they expected it to be. Just go watch it",1
194,"A flawed masterpiece. It's understandable that hardcore Star Wars fans might think that this has nothing new to offer - personally I enjoyed the homage to earlier films and appreciated the new characters who were engaging and original. Technical aspects were top notch all round, and John Williams' score as wonderful as ever.",1
195,"THE GOOD:-Dan Mindel's cinematography. Looks like classic Star Wars. Not too flashy, drops a few breathtaking images.-John Williams soundtrack. Didn't stand out at first, grew on me after a second listen. Rey's theme is a Star Wars classic.-Visual effects. Not sure what the digital/practical split is, but it seems to be a sensible mix of both worlds.-Rey/Finn/Poe. A trimutive worthy of Luke, Han and Leia.-Kylo Ren. The entire series most fascinating character.-Han Solo and Chewie. The chemistry was there. THE BAD:-Carrie Fisher. Nicely written scenes with Han but Fisher's acting looks rusty. Hopefully she'll loosen up a bit in the next one, still believe she can be great.-Not enough innovation in terms of story or design. It's fine they went this route for this first entry, but it won't cut it for VIII onwards.-Capt. Phasma wasted. Should have taken the place of TR8-TR at the battle of Takadona - seems like a bit of a no brainer that one. THE UGLY:-Snoke and Rathtars SFX. Jarringly obvious CGI, and in the case of Snoke, entirely unnecessary. Hopefully they will listen to criticism and have Snoke portrayed by Andy Serkis in make up next time.",1
196,"This has potential to kick off a golden era of Star Wars movies. Abrams faced a difficult task and whilst the film had a few glaring flaws, he absolutely succeeded where it counted - creating new characters  who can follow in the footsteps of true icons, and bringing the tone and feel, and dare I say 'magic', of the early films back.",1
197,"I find it funny that there's people in alternative disguise giving this movie a negative review when you know you can't stop the positives from growing high every day. If you want to know a movie where to give a 0 in, trust me on this one. I have the movie waiting for you. This movie's not worth giving a 0 in unless you want your opinion to suck so badly. Along with Inside Out, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a success for the movies and you're going to love it more than how I gave a 10 on such a movie like this. Don't even try to crap out that ""No"" button on the ""Helpful?"" section unless your opinion's so bad it deserves to go for my 0's. I know I've been spoiled before watching this movie, but I'm not giving you spoilers so you're safe if you haven't watched this movie yet.  Don't even try to crap out another negative review unless you want your opinion to once again suck so badly. I've actually watched this movie in 3D and it was a fun blast. I hope you'll love it as the same as I did because this was actually better than the prequels. If you want to give this movie a 0, don't do it. You're just wasting your time. Waste your time giving a 0 on my 0's.",1
198,"Star Wars is back strong ! "" It suck its new hope all over again "" .. That's just weak logic.. Episode VII is a soft reboot but it is just better in any way.. Acting , Visuals & Audio , Character Development , Emotionally , the directing and generally is better as a film than any other star wars except Ep.5 maybe .. So stop on hating that its kinda unoriginal and enjoy the god-damn movie because it really keeps you on till the last moment ! And for those who hate on Kylo Ren i inform you that he is by far the best character they've created on the star wars saga .",1
199,THANK YOU to everyone involved in the Force Awakens for bringing Star Wars back to life. The movie made me feel like I was a kid again. What more could anyone want?,1
200,"This was a terrific movie, whether you love Star Wars or not. Story was fun and easy to follow, and didn't get bogged down I'm exposition, often a flaw in this type of film. It had funny moments, exciting moments and characters I was rooting for. And of course a really interesting bad guy who I look forward to seeing more of in future. The most fun picture of 2015 for me.",1
201,"The Force Awakens pays respectful homage to the movies that came before it, not just A New Hope but also in a few key scenes The Empire Strikes Back. That's not to say that the movie has nothing new to offer - the characters, essentially the heart of any film, feel fresh and new. They carry the movie and by the end you feel the series is forging it's own new path.",1
202,"This is a great movie. Don't listen to the people saying it's not worth admission.  Don't listen to the people saying it clings too much to the A New Hope.  Don't listen to the people who gripe about the villains.  And don't listen to the people who shout about plot holes. This is a great movie. The new trio of actors they found for this movie (playing Rey, Finn & Poe) are great!  You actually care about them, unlike Anakin and Padme from the prequels.  I also think Kylo Ren is perfect for a young, angry Sith apprentice.  Isn't that exactly how he should act?  Angry, bitter, confused and scared?  Great to seen Han Solo back...him and Chewie bring a lot of humour to the movie.  Seeing Leia again was meh. Visuals and sound are awesome!  It's a Star Wars movie after all.  Writing, dialogue, and directing is all great. There are a few flaws of course, which is why I can't give this movie higher than an 8.  The plot does follow the original quite a bit.  There's a fine line between giving a homage to the original work and plain copying.  I personally think they straddle that line fine, but would have preferred if they went a more original route.  We really didn't need a third Death Star!  I'm also a little worried about the head villain.  We don't  see much of him in this movie, so hopefully his character works out in the next two. As for plot holes, I would say they're less actual plot holes and more plot devices that defy scientific reality.  A weapon that can completely harness the power of the sun in a small planetary body, then someone direct that flow of energy into destroying multiple planets at a time?  I don't know about that. Definitely a very entertaining movie though.  Has me stoked for the second!",1
203,"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was little. I had very High expectations for this this film and it gladly exceeded. Star Wars The Force Awakens is absolutely much better then prequels, like way better. It also had one of my favorite cameos of all time which is 3 of the main stars from The Raid and Raid 2. Rama, Mad dog, and the assassin from Raid 2. It also features some of the original cast such as harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, And Mark Hamil, and of course Chewbacca. All I have to say is The Force Awaken is on the list with the originals fun entertaining and memorable, which is what make it great.",1
204,I effing love this movie. I had a great big grin on my face all the way through. Its not as good as The Empire Strikes Back but definitely better than Return of the Jedi.,1
205,"Honestly, the movie was so amazing. I enjoyed most of it. It was not perfect, but indeed a masterpiece. So much character development, such great action. The rehashing of A new hope did not bother me much.",1
206,"After I,II and III, we NEEDED a good film and George did it, bringing us an assom 2 hours, the refresh of the film concept is assom, the bad thing is that George Lucas has an ""age"".",1
207,"There isn't much that I have to say about this terrific installment but this movie was worth replaying over and over again. And somehow you'll get the idea that you will indeed love the old characters and the new characters. However, it feels like a new hope all over again after the demise of Dark Vader from Episode VI. And this movie was amazing but it has that formula that it feels like we're watching Episode IV's A New Hope again at least J.J Abrams know how to direct and revitalize a sci-fi flick right?!",1
208,"This is a Star Wars movie made for non-Star Wars fans. Here is why: - The movie is simplified to the maximum. Gone are all those details from the saga that made the universe rich and credible. All combat space ships are a renewed version of X-wings and Tie Fighters. Gone are the Y-wing bombers, the fast A-wings or the Tie interceptors. Only the Millenium Falcon remains. This is because even amateurs who never watched a Star Wars movie know what it is. -  There is a basic ""non-written rule"" in the Star Wars universe that has been broken in this movie. And this  is, I believe, what made all old-school Star Wars fans angry. The fact that a stupid untrained teenager can just take a lightsaber and use it like he is allowed too. Long gone are those padawans that worked hard for years with discipline, learning from their jedi mentors. Now everybody can just pick up a lightsaber and be the hero of the day. And this is the message that Disney wants to give to the new generation of kids. - The villain is a joke. Not only mediocre, but a real joke. Darth Maul, Count Dooku, Vader, the Emperor... All of them had their charisma. Even Grievous is a better villain than this pimplehead teenager with personality issues. Congratulations Disney, you made the first Star Wars emo villain. - Did I mention that this villain has super crazy powers? He can stop laser shots with his mind!! Incredible. Not even Vader or the Emperor were able to do such a thing. But, oh, wait. When it comes to using the lightsaber, this other teenagers can easily kick his ass, even if they never touched a saber. Imagine Darth Maul being kicked in the ass by a jedi noob? Darth Vader? The emperor? Come on, even Sebulba would have kicked some Kyle o Ren ass. - The only essence that was left in Star Wars VII was Han Solo. The only one. And what did they do? Make him die. In a moment that is very reminiscent of that famous ""I am your father"" scene. Seriously, Disney? - The whole script is a cheap copy of Star Wars Episode IV, which is, in any way possible, infinitely better than this movie. Thanks Disney for ruining a franchise. Chapeau. Hope the dollars are worth it.",0
209,"Best film i've seen in years. Ok, elements of A New Hope are similar, but it doesn't mean its an awful film. I loved every second of it and love what Disney have done. Hoping for more stories in the future.",1
210,solid re-boot with star making turns from Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. Adam Driver makes for the series most compelling bad guy torn between dark/light. Oscar Isaac sadly underused. Should be the starting point for great things.,1
211,"On leaving the cinema having just seen this I felt mixed emotions. Luke Skywalker was my hero as a kid and hearing that Mark Hammill would be reprising the iconic role was what got me back on board with Star Wars. It was thrilling to imagine the return of my all time favourite movie character. I imagined how powerful he must have become over the 30 year break between films and predicted scenes of Luke kicking serious butt as the most potent Jedi of all. I wanted to see Luke fulfill his potential. And as anyone who has seen the film will know.....that didn't quite happen. To say the least. And I was majorly gutted he didn't get a scene with Han - what a wasted opportunity I thought. The film scored a 6 or 7 for me.Then, watching the movie a second time, the treatment of Luke made more sense. He was being portrayed as a mythical character, a legend and an enigma. Luke metaphorically stood above all the other characters in the film, he had become something other - worldly. By just giving him that single moment Abrams and Kasdan elevated the character. And as my initial disappointment wore off, it made me even more intrigued, even more in awe of him. A brave move I feel on the part of the film makers.",1
212,"Utterly brilliant return to form. Beautifully made, written with wit and heart and wonderfully acted all round with charasmatic new leads. The Force Awakens is the perfect movie for non-angry nerds.",1
213,"The Force Awakens is a technical achievement and very fun. But, ultimately, it lack originality, which is a real shame. However, that flaw is overshadowed by the incredible action and charming characters. And, haters, I understand you. I'm as angry as you are about this movie's major lack of originality, but you are really being dishonest with yourselves, at least most of you. You need to ask yourself: ""Is this movie well realized, even though it shares too many similarities with A New Hope? Are the characters well acted? Is the action fun?"" If you answer the questions by saying 'yes', than it's pretty unfair to give this movie a 0, just because it's unoriginal. People make mistakes, and without mistakes there will be no progress. J J Abrams' laziness and cowardliness is very embarrassing and shameful, but, please, be more optimistic. I respect all of you haters, because, without you, the next movies would probably be another copies of the original trilogy, but don't be too harsh. Besides, why do you ignore the very few original ideas that this movie presents? For example: Finn's character development is really great, original and inspiring. Seeing a stormtrooper, turning into a Resistance fighter was a joy to watch. What about Kylo Ren? Sure, he has a few similarities compared to Darth Vader, mainly his clothes and armor, but his personality is different and he presents a less experienced warrior. So, that's a plus. Although, he isn't as gripping and terrifying as Darth Vader, especially when he takes off his mask. That moment was sort of anti-climatic. OK, so Rey was a total badass in this movie, but it's also a convenient badassery. It's weird to see her succeed in almost everything in this movie, without even training. However, if this aspect gets explained in the upcoming SW movies, I would appreciate that. The returning characters shine in this movie, especially Han Solo, who is my favorite SW character. He's funny, charismatic and badass in this movie, featuring the same characteristics of the original trilogy. Also, his death is dramatic, and Chewbaca's reaction was so sad. Although, Leia's reaction was weirdly passive, really. Snoak , the main main villain, wasn't  enough shown, and I don't really know his backstory or his personality all that much, but I will be patient to get informed for this character in the next movie. However, I have heard theories that this guy is Darth Plegious, which really adds to the intrigue and enigma of Snoak. Phasma in this movie was also not shown enough and, really, she was a bit boring in this movie (maybe because of her minimal appearance), but her armor looks badass, so kudos for that. And, the redhead general was decent. So, the characters in The Force Awakens are mostly well written and well designed. What about the action? Freaking amazing, super fun, cinematic... It has it all. Also, the lightsaber battles are tense and satisfying. If you're looking for an action movie that will blow your mind with it's visuals, this movie is for you. Story? I love the story, but the major flaw still stays. It is so similar to A New Hope, it's almost criminal. But, I enjoyed the story so much. Honestly, this is the first Star Wars movie that I've watched, so I may have been more easily impressed than other people, but I still love it. I have watched A New Hope before this movie, and I certainly noticed the similarities. However, the whole adventure to find Luke Skywalker is intriguing IMO. The whole process of doing that, while brutally familiar, is incredibly fun. But, however, if the next movie will be a copy of the original trilogy, that would really piss me off and I would definitely join the haters. However, this time, I'm forgiving the writer, but please, more originality next time. Luke Skywalker is shown in this movie for only 30 seconds, but it's worth it and it's a fitting ending. So, basically, I secretly don't like this movie because of it's derivative plot, but I can't lie to myself. I enjoyed this movie so freaking much. But that may have been because this is my first SW movie. I will watch it a second time and maybe my opinion will change, but until then, The Force Awakens stay with an 8/10 from me. So, yeah.",1
214,"The Force Awakens was sweeeet!  John Boyega deserves all the hype, the best thing about this film. He will go on to be a great star I am sure. He was great as Moses in Attack the Block which is underated movie check it out.",1
215,Dis flat out rocks. JJ Abrams has created a masterpiece full stop. Love love love everything about this movie!!!! Today it is released on blu ray will watch many many times!!!!!!,1
216,"“This will begin to make things right.” So speaks Max Von Sydow in the first words of The Force Awakens; and how appropriate that is. In short, The Force Awakens is an enormous triumph, a return to the ways of the original trilogy, and, specifically, what made them so loved, and so good. All due respect and admiration to George Lucas for creating the Star Wars universe, but JJ Abrams truly seems to understand what made the originals so damn good better than Lucas himself- intrigue. Mysticism. Tragedy. Fun. Is it a perfect movie? No. No movie is, truly. But for everything that didn’t quite sit right- of which there aren’t many- there were a plethora of other things which Abrams and his crew perfectly hit the target with. The Force Awakens is a sequel worth waiting 30 years for (and it is, make no mistake, the best Star Wars movie since at least 1983), with a stellar cast (Ridley and Driver shine, but every new and old face alike command the screen and so obviously want to be there, and that brings the whole thing to life); incredible direction and smart writing; and stunning aliens, visuals, and great characters- all of which are so fresh and unique with the perfect blend of old and new it injects life into this universe sometimes just by aesthetic, with Chewie, Han and C390 still bringing the laugh, while new additions like BB-8 cement themselves as worthy, the quirky droid destined to be a fan favourite and loved as only two droids ever have been. How I’ve missed the magic of this galaxy, far, far away. And here we are, launched back into two and a half hours of sheer brilliance, with all of the magic, wit and fun which made the original trilogy what it was. Episode VII is certainly a great indicator for things to come, leaving you craving more with its phenomenal ending and, even still, it provides a triumphant, hugely satisfying adventure on its own, realising my hopes as a fan, and surpassing them. Accordingly, while no movie is perfect, it gets a 10 from me.",1
217,now i would amet the story is same thing like a new hope and kylo ren face reviel is dissaponting but i still love the hell out of this film i don't care if people hate this film i still love it from beginning to end,1
218,"Good - could have been outstanding with a more original story. It has many outstanding elements, the cast from top to bottom, the design, the action scenes and the effects. The writing is good and the the humour works. Plot is too derivative to be a truly great movie.",1
219,"Loved it. Reminded me of the old movies, in a good way. Pretty much loved everything about it, from the new little ball robot to the new bad guy who was surprisingly multi-layered. Definitely on board for the next one.",1
220,"The head says 7, but the heart says 10. To be brutally honest there are aspects of the Force Awakens that irritated me - primarily, I felt that Rey's journey of learning the ways of the Force could have been handled much more gracefully. I'm actually not sure what JJ was thinking when he decided to have an untrained Rey do a Jedi mind trick on Daniel Craig. And it often steers just a little bit too close to Ep IV for comfort, particularly in the Resistance briefing room scene with the new Death Star. But I'm going to score this film based on the overall experience, and the emotions it left me with. And on that count, its an easy 10. It certainly pressed all the right buttons as far as I was concerned.",1
221,"I go to the theater with a big expectation,and i dont get it all,but i get a really good feeling,and i get satisfied and more hyped to the next movie !",1
222,"Magnificent celebration of everything that was great about Star Wars. This movie FEELS like Star Wars. But there's more to the Force Awakens than piggybacking off nostalgia - our new heroes feel fresh, fun  and relevant, and it's great to see the Star Wars universe embrace inclusivity without feeling forced.  Our new main villain is a delicious cocktail who could well be the most interesting character we've seen in the SW Universe. There is much to look forward to in the next episode and I cant wait to see how these characters develop.",1
223,"This was fab! John and Daisy are awesome, chubacca is so cool and bb8 is adorable! Will Poe and Finn get in on on the next one - I certainly hope so! X",1
224,"Just watched this one Blu Ray after seeing it twice previously at a theatre. First time I saw it, I would give it a 7. There were elements that disappointed me. Second time I appreciated it more and, knowing what to expect, I forgave some of the flaws - I'd re-rate it an 8.Third time - despite not being on the big screen, I realised just how much I actually LOVE this movie. There is so much to love here it nullifies those qualms I had earlier.Honestly, its the characters that make this a  great movie - great characters are the foundation of great films and this movie has an abundance of great characters. Cant wait to see where they take us next.",1
225,"Disney and JJ Abrams have course corrected Star Wars and now the future looks bright for the franchise. Let it be said that this movie has sveral issues, but none so severe that they de-rail what is undeniably first class entertainment.Those bemoaning Disney's influence here and long for the 'good old days' under Lucas' stewardship would do well to consider the last theatrically released Star Wars movie - The Clone Wars. Remember 'SkyGuy' and Ziro the Hutt?",1
226,"It's Star Wars done right. Not much else to say about it. Finally, a Star Wars movie that puts right what the prequels destroyed. Can't wait for the rest. BTW I find it a travesty that the garbage that is Batman v Superman has a better user score than this lol",1
227,"I don't understand the over inflated score this movie has. I believe people want so bad this movie to be good and they turn into zealots because of this.On short, this movie is beautiful visually. The acting is the best so far in the series and natural. The pace is steady and funny moments are well balanced. The sound is above average, mainly because it tends to become predictable in toward the end.  If a movie would be defined by only by those things, this SW would be a solid 9, maybe even 10.But its not. A movie is a visual novel. And the story is terrible, so terrible that I felt bad how dumb and force it was. The characters lack depth, and the inner conflicts are pathetically expressed on screen. They exist just to showcase fan favorite concepts and to form a narrative that is a remake of episode 4.  At this chapter this movie is bellow Hanna Barbara level.",0
228,"This movie has so many jarring plot holes, inconsistencies that it's a cringe-fest. Plain and simple - it doesn't make any sense. Seriously if you thought the prequels were bad, they seem like a stroke of genius compared to this crap.How this movie gets good reviews is beyond me. I love Star Wars but this movie is a joke. They should have just followed the books. Hell, they should have even went with George Lucas ideas. Some of the issues: 1) A storm trooper getting an existential crisis in a middle of a battle? Reasons for doing what's he doing. ""It's not right"". Thank you for 3rd grade arguments.2) Met 5 mins ago but storm trooper and rebel agent are bros for life?3) How did rebel bro survive? Why did he abandon his super important mission?4) How did the lightsaber ""talk""?5) Why is the rebel alliance, the ""rebel"" resistance? Didn't they defeat the running government before? Who are they resisting against?6) How did they build the 40 times bigger ""death star"" when it took the actual Empire YEARS and the full support of the ENTIRE galaxy. These guys are like 1/10 of the Empire and they build something 40 times bigger.7) Why did Luke just run off instead of facing responsibility? Why did he go on a fricckin island? Why does nobody know where he is? Cause plot demands it?8) Who is the Sith guy? Why didn't Palpatine know about him? Why would Palpatine let competition like that exist?9) What is Kylo's motivation (other than cause plot says it)? How can you go dark side when you have arguably best diplomat as mom, best smuggler as dad, best jedi as master?10) How is it not a rip-off of Episode 4, plot basically follows same friggin story except new ""graphics""?11) How can a storm trooper use a lightsaber and stuff?12) Who is the CGI yellow mouse that's a friend of Han Solo? How does she has Luke's light saber? How is she connected? What's her point? What's her motivation? How does the light saber speak to the girl? Light sabers aren't force sensitive or living things to be able to talk through the Force?13) How can a complete novice (practically knows 5 mins before that she actually has the force) use Jedi Mind Trick when it is established that first it only works on the weak minded and second you need to be well-versed in the Force to be able to use it?14) How can a complete novice defeat a well trained Jedi (or rather ex-Jedi) trained for some years by none other than Luke Skywalker who managed to kill other students (who were also Jedi)?15) Why is everyone acting like the Rebel Alliance defeated the Empire, the Force and the Jedi is some kind of MYTH? It happened what like 10-15 years ago? How is it not a common knowledge how the Empire was defeated? Why does nobody knows about it? Why is Han Solo talking about it like it's some kind of legend? I can add at least 30 more points to this list - that's just what comes off the top of my mind. Anyone telling me this movie is good is either watching a STAND ALONE movie that is not Star Wars or has no idea what the **** are they talking about. Respectable critics schmitics my ass :D﻿",0
229,"A successful albeit very safe movie from JJ Abrams. I think Disney cleary had one eye on re-establishing a wide fanbase and weren't too concerned about breaking new ground. Not great but good, streets ahead of your average blockbuster and a solid launch pad for hopefully more daring sequels.",1
230,"Wow, J.J. Abrams is awesome and so is his incredible view of Star Wars, the new characters are so cool and they are better than all of the characters in the prequels. Rey is awesome, Finn is awesome, Poe is awesome, and Kylo Ren is an incredible villain.",1
231,"I physically couldn't be more excited for Episode VIII. Literally, I don't think I cam take it. I need to go into a fridge and hibernate until December 2017. This movie was the greatest Christmas present I've been given since my Aunt Mary bought me an X-Wing fighter in 1981.",1
232,"Many people hate the prequels for some reason. But I believe this movie has to be the worst star wars episode ever. If George Lucas  was the director and that disney did not own star wars, I think this movie would been great.",0
233,"After watching the movie 3 times at the cinema (3D, full Imax, regular) - I can safely say that for me, The Force Awakens places itself in the Top 3 of the Star Wars franchise. STORY:I don't agree with people complaining about the fact that the movie looks like A New Hope and is uninspired... This is Star Wars. Star Wars was never about ''re-inventing'' anything. As a big fan, I was happy to feel at home while watching it. And even if you're a new fan, the movie has enough twists and action to catch your attention and curiosity to the entire saga. Also, this is the 1rst movie of the 3rd trilogy, so they are going for a safer approach (getting us attached to new characters etc), which is perfectly fine. The movie is well paced. All scenes have their place. The nice attention to details is appreciated (ex: the BB-8 vs Finn scene where BB-8's lighter). Overall, the only thing that maybe bugged me a bit was Starkiller base. I did find it a bit odd that after 2 Death Stars destroyed, the baddies would've known better that making a bigger Death Star. CHARACTERS/ACTORS:Rey: I'M IN LOVE with her character. I'm also very happy to finally see a kickass main female jedi in the movies! Daisy Ridley did an amazing job and I think they casted the perfect woman for the role.Finn: John Boyega was on point. Character is funny and loveable, however I did find he was missing a little bit of depth. For a guy that spent his whole life being a slave-soldier for the First Order, he should've had a little bit more sadness or PTSD or something. Nothing that ruined the character - more of a personal opinion.BB-8: I want 1000000000 BB-8s. I haven't felt that attached to a character since R2-D2 (not just droids). So loyal and sweet. Best droid ever.Kylo Ren: DUDE. I loooooved Kylo Ren. Loved the fact he was a whiny and immature man still struggling with the force. Very weak inside and clearly in pain. I cannot wait to see if he will come back to the light side or not. Adam Driver was so deep and delivered an amazing performance in my opinion.Capt. Phasma: I think she was a little overhyped. Great character, but  very un-important. Nothing specific to say about her.Poe Dameron: The love of my life. Best pilot EVER. I adore the relation he has with Finn and Oscar Isaac played Poe so naturally. He fits the role so perfectly. I really really hope we will see more of him in the next movies.Han/Leia: Was very happy to see them again. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great actors and I really felt that they just jumped into their old shoes... Natural, on point and so heartwarming perfomances from the both of them. RIP Han, you're the best. We'll miss you.Luke: We did not see much, obviously. But I loved the final scene. Also, Hamill looks badass!?!?! The look he had... what do you think? Is he Rey's dad?Snoke: The most mysterious guy in the movie for sure. All the theories... That character confuses me, but I'm not sure if it's positive or not yet. Time will tell! Ill stop here about the actors and characters, but honestly, all of them were amazing and easy to feel attached to. VISUAL:AMAAAAZING. Also, shout out to the scene transitions. A great balance with today's technology and old school set props. Beautiful landscapes as well. Breathtaking shots really. CONCLUSION:A GREAT Star Wars movie just like we love them. I am NOT disappointed and am very excited for Rogue I and Episode VIII. Let the THEORIES time begin!",1
234,"Before this movie i wasn't really into star wars, i had seen some parts of the movies but wasn't really interested in them at the time but episode 7 changed that for me.

Is it really THAT important to know the exact location of ONE Jedi™ Knight? In that case, why? Kylo Ren™ murdered all of Luke's apprentices in cold blood. It's not like Luke is gonna come outta hiding just to train a few more people, right? In that case, Kylo Ren™ can just murder those too, and while he's there he can just find Luke and kill him! This is a way better plot than the one we got!- Why is Starkiller Base™ powered by stars? In order to fire it's beam it needs to drain energy from the nearby stars. And the planet Starkiller Base™ was located on just had 2 stars. What happens when Starkiller Base™ has drained all the energy from the 2 suns? Do they just pack up and move to another planet and build a base powered by stars there, too? In fact, why don't they just build another Death Star™? I mean, the rebellion could have just destroyed the plans when they blew up the second Death Star™. But are you telling me that there aren't more than 1 plan out there? You know, just in case someone stole or destroyed the others. It feels like a pretty stupid design choose for a superweapon (Starkiller Base™).- And much much more! And before any of you say ""Luke is more lf a marry sue than Rey is"" NO! NO! Luke knew how to fly a ship because his father could, those sort of thing things runs in the blood, you know. He is strong with the force because 2 Jedi masters trained him. Plus he's the son of the Chosen One. You know, the one that could destroy the Sith, bring balance and peace to the galaxy and could become the most powerful Jedi that had ever lived. That makes alot more sense than someone who magically knew how to use the force with no trainging what so ever and could beat up a Sith apprentice again, with no training what so ever. What, is she the daughter of Luke? Well she can't be since she only thought he was a myth. It is NEVER explained in the movie! And watch J.J make the big reveal in Episode 8 and reveal that she is Kylo's sister or what ever. Because J.J can't come up with a good idea so he just copies stories that has been told before and adds some more characters to them. Atleast Lucas had some original ideas. You know, the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and some other movies he made outside of Star Wars. Oh, I'm running out of characters here. Well, don't go and see this movie. In fact, don't buy it on Blu-Ray. Just pirate it if you want to sit though 2 hours of torture.",0
238,"I just saw The Last Jedi. It retroactively RUINS The Force Awakens. No explanation is given for Rey's powers in TLJ and she only becomes more powerful. I wrote the below before TLJ. But now the whole new trilogy has been made into garbage. Thanks Rian Johnson for destroying Star Wars.Both TFA and Rogue One are great movies. I give The Force Awakens a 10 and Rogue One a 9, only because TFA enjoys the benefit of Han Solo. Harrison Ford does a fantastic job. 25 years ago, if anyone had told me one of the very best Star Wars films, in which Han Solo would figure prominently, would be released in 2015, I would have suggested they lay off the sauce. For me, One element that makes this film work so well is the instinctive empathy and compassion of Rey, it permeates everything she does even while she is at the same time as hard as nails, and the moral determination of Finn. Finn for all his bumbling machismo, is someone you admire for his unerring and moral compass. Even Solo, wizened by years, is driven to his own best moment by compassion. And it is all delivered in the context of a thrill ride of an action movie that never stops. There's nothing message-like about it. It is baked into the characters and drama. They all embody the light side by their actions more than Obi Wan ever did by talking about it.Even though in trying to measure objectively I place this behind The Empire Strikes Back, I have actually enjoyed it personally more than any other Star Wars film - maybe because its very existence seems so improbable, maybe because it is heartening in late middle age to see Han Solo roughing up aliens and pirates in his mid-70s, maybe because Daisy Ridley is just such an excellent actress, or maybe because I know this is just the start and that there are at least 5 more films to come. It is like the Star Wars universe was dead and gone and has now been brought gloriously back to life. I've seen The Force Awakens twice. The first time in 2D. Second time in 3D. My recommendation. See it in 3D! There was one moment when the tip of a star destroyer hovering in space seemed to be about to bump my nose!Han Solo and Rey dominate. They carry TFA on their shoulders. Han kicks azz - I cannot express how great it was to see him back in action and featured so prominently. He's fantastic as old dude busting people up. Ford said he has no sentimentality for the character, but he burst the audiences hearts. Daisy is perfect. Whoever cast her deserves a bonus, and Daisy deserves to be a major star. Most importantly the characters interplay excellently. Rey's major moment brought tears to my eyes. The audience cheered. It was perfection.",1
239,"if you don't know this already, i grew up with Star Wars. this was the franchise that inspired me to be a movie fanatic and to express my opinion on any kinda movie i watch. i loved the original trilogy as a kid, and i still love it today. but as we all know, even one of the greatest sagas in history has its downside. and that's when the prequels come in. even if i do admit that Revenge of the Sith was the best outta the prequels, it still doesn't change the fact that the prequels sucked. so of course, i've been waiting for this movie ever since it was first announced on October 2012, when Disney bought Lucasfilms. and then, the day of the big release finally came and let me just say: i wasn't disappointed at the slightest.Star Wars: The Force Awakens definitely is the return to form for the saga. i loved this movie so much, and it clearly shows that J.J. Abrams put so much love into this project. it's amazing to look at, with some of the most beautiful and revolutionary special effects ever put into a movie, it had a great, exciting and intriguing story - even if it felt a lot like A New Hope - while also leaving unanswered questions to help expand the Star Wars universe, and all the characters - both old and new - were fantastic, bringing layers and layers of emotions and depth. this is one of those movies i'm gonna remember for a really long time, and it definitely makes me proud to be a Star Wars fan!",1
240,"For being a new Star Wars movie and releasing after the prequels, this film had a lot to live up to. The answer was, oh boy was it better than the prequels! It shocks me to see people wasting their time complaining about a film with well developed characters and amazing visual effects. The film does take some plot elements from the OT but puts them in a way that takes homage to them. Just go see it. You won't regret it.",1
241,"It's a great movie, far better than expected. It has its shortcomings - namely being to faithful to its source material and not really delivering something new - but the great pictures and a decent cast ultimately make the movie a satisfying and worthwhile experience.",1
243,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a very good film and is certainly worth watching as it recaptures the classic moments of the original films films and offers very new and interesting characters such as; Snoke, Kylo Ren, Finn and Rey who add a fresh of fresh air to the franchise. The film contains a lot of nostalgia and suprising moments which will make viewers want to see the film again and again.",1
244,"I can honestly say that I didn't have very high expectations about this film, and I say that because I knew the movie was going to be directed by JJ Abrams. Don't get me wrong, I liked Star Trek 1. All Star Trek 2 did however was bring home to me the fact that if I was waiting to see anything revolutionary or even new from Abrams, I was wasting my time. I still can't fathom why after the runaway success of first film, rather than putting his stamp on the franchise by doing something memorable and new the best he could do was to rehash the Wrath of Khan. I knew then he lacked the bravery and vision required to create the type of film I had been dreaming of ever since I saw the Empire Strikes Back, and if the Force Awakens is anything to go by, I know now that I was right. There is nothing new or vaguely original about episode VII. This is movie making by the numbers plagiarism as an art form, and blatantly so. There isn't an original theme in the entire film! It is nothing more than a tired retread. Luke and Rey, Darth Vadar and Kylo Ren, fallen father fallen son and the similarities between episode IV and VII go on and on. Say what you want about episodes I-III, stilted writing, poor casting, even poorer acting, at least they showed more originality than anything this sorry film has to offer. If Abrams past efforts are anything to go by then we know how this will end, just watch episode VI two years from now instead of episode VIII and save yourself the price of admission.",0
245,I really liked this movie the first time when it was called Star Wars episode IV: A New Hope. that was a good movie. this was A New Hope with better special effects and worse acting and writing.,0
246,"This is not a Star Wars movie, it's a scifi movie that happens to have Han Solo and lightsabers The plot is nonexistant.  I just saw it and I already can't remember what happens.  Why do they need to kill Luke so bad?  It's not explained and I can't bring myself to care, because I know the answer:  Fan service. but the worst thing about it is that there's just no ""mystical Star Wars feeling.""  It just feels like boring old real life.  They didn't try to transport you to another world JJ Abrams is a childish doofus.  He cuts from a scene just before something interesting could potentially happen.  He makes a cut probably every five seconds.  He literally has no attention span.  The only thing that happens in this movie is fights and explosions. I don't want or need to be told that ""the force is real.""  The movie should just assume that.  I don't need time to be wasted convincing the characters.  This was a terrible decision.  Hopefully Luke will fill this role later (probably not), but I need an established ""Force presence.""  I need leaders, experts and mentors in the force so real stuff can happen, instead of kiddy amateur stuff that has no impact on anything.  What is this, is this universe pure Anarchy where everyone is removed from society when they turn 30?  What is actually going on in this world?  Is it just a bunch of kids spazzing out playing pretend?  Where are the powerful people, the people that matter?  Snoke is there, but doesn't really do anything.  The newbie kids should get kicked around by the obviousness of the force. Harrison Ford was great.  The only good part of the movie was Han Solo.  Unfortunately there's not enough Han Solo to save it.  Story-wise, he really felt shoehorned in anyway The style of humor just decimates any chance of taking the movie seriously.  It comes too close to breaking the fourth wall, and it's just a very cheap, very self-satisfying way to write something.  Luckily, once Harrison Ford shows up, that style of humor diminishes somewhat Just give me a second to get to know these characters, their personal lives, their flaws and weaknesses, something relatable, that's all I ask.  When I see a movie, I want to forget I'm watching a movie.  I don't want fictitious-feeling invincible characters who feel no fear and have no real challenges to overcome.  The whole basic thing that makes a movie interesting is having a challenge we're not totally sure the characters can win.  At no point in this movie did a character once show honest doubt and therefore have to try their hardest Wait for the next movie I guess",0
247,"Oh boy!, I can't even begin to fathom how in the world they could mess this up like that!. If you are one of the persons who thought that prequels were bad and it couldn't get worst than that....believe it, IT CAN GET WORST! The Force Awakens is just a remake/reboot with a complete LACK OF ORIGINALITY. Is  a complete rip-off of Episode IV, yes, is exactly the same story, just with worst story and performance: a droid carrying important plans is lost in the desert, an orphan lives in that desert and lives a dull life there dreaming and looking to the horizon, the bad guys go and raid a village  in the desert to look for this droid, you have a new Death Star (yes, for the 3rd time!, seems the evil power in turn hasn't learned the lesson and still creates weapons of mass destruction with design flaws, destructable in one single point at plain sight!) just this time bigger and meaner, another trench run with Xwings, and the list goes on and on). This poor excuse of a movie has huge plotholes, so bad that it seems it was based on a first draft rather than a revised script. It makes me wonder how Lawrence Kasdan was so laureated, seems he was following Lucas orders while adapting the script of the original trilogy and without that creative ideas from Lucas, he's lost and his pen writes just nonsense and mumbo jumbo!. Or maybe just following the ""magnificent"" idea of reboot Star Wars from some Disney executive or Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy, and try to sell it to the audience as a ""sequel"", when is clear is NOT. They sell you just nostalgia all over the movie, which is a huge easter egg from Ep IV and V literally.But what is worst, is that it seems they got rid of all Lucas canon about what we knew about the Force:Rey instantly master the Force after touching a lightsaber and a day later that she learned she had the Force, she's able to perform Jedi mind tricks and acquires expert swordsmanship, with any training whatsoever!, she's even able to beat a seasoned dark force user like Kylo Ren that was supposedly trained by Luke and Snoke (they bad copy of Emperor Palpatine and the one pulling the strings of the First Order), just because of millenial girlpower I guess!. That puts the Jedi women of the past to shame since they had to train for years with a Jedi master to be able to become half as proficient as Rey seems to be with the Force in just a few hours. Not even Anakin, the chosen one, could master advanced force techniques or control minds without training. Not only that, Finn (the stormtrooper that , in his words, worked in ""sanitation"") was able to match this darforce user (Kylo Ren) in a lightsaber combat and lasted more than 3 mins! Yes, a non-force user like Finn, fighting with a lightsaber as equal with a seasoned dark force user!. Just ridiculous!. You never saw that under Lucas canon. Also, this janitor stormtrooper is an expert gunner and has top-secret technical data on how to beat the super Death Star (called ""Starkiller"")...seems the First Order has to work in their security on who to disclose this kind of delicate information. Also, they use a ""Deus ex machina"" method to resolve the plot when R2-D2, being put in low battery mode, suddenly wakes up with an important piece of information to find Luke, which everybody (good and bad guys) were looking for like crazy during the whole movie. And the main villain, Kylo Ren, is just a brat with angry issues, very childish emo-type of guy, which has any of the screen presence or evilness as Darth Vader had. And when he removes his helmet in the movie, that's so hilarious and pathetic that you can't avoid to throw a laugh in that moment. Seriously. I could go on and on with a HUGE list of flaws, plotholes and points of departure from the canon we knew from 6 past movies and clone wars series. Seems like if Disney jumped in a time-travel DeLorean to the future and reached an alternate Star Wars reality with messed up Force laws and physics, and told you what they saw. This is the new DIsney canon, a simplistic, nonsense galaxy where force beings are powerful just because girlpower and will, and not through discipline and training like the Jedi order for ""thousand generations"" (as Obi Wan put it in OT) did. And don't get me wrong, I've always being a huge fan of Star Wars and appreciated the richness in the story behind....but TFA is just plain wrong and shouldn't be considered as part of Star Wars. This is not Star Wars, this is something else, with the ""Star Wars"" name on it and the aesthetics. JJ Abrams should apologize and rethink the whole story because this movie in the current state is just plain pathetic and boring.",0
248,"Best Star Wars EVER!!!!!!!!! Rey, Finn, Poe - the new power three. They are better than I ever could hope for, so likable. Kylo Ren is SUCH and interesting and crazy character, he's most interesting villain in a blockbuster movie in a long time. These characters will go on to become icons over time, just like the originals did.",1
249,"*No Spoilers* I wrote this review because, having looked at a fair number of reviews, many of the negatives were nitpicky or vague critiques or they did not adequately capture what I thought were the real issues in the movie. I did not like the movie but I disliked it due to what I see as larger more fundamental problems. First, overarching plot issues muddled the story, broke the engagement & momentum, rearranged the character roles, and halted any development. Secondly, and more importantly, the protagonist Rey (Daisy Ridley), who is far and away the worst part of the movie, but not for the reasons many are saying. I went into this movie having avidly avoided any trailers, spoilers, or discussion regarding the movie whatsoever. I wanted to be totally open and really give the movie a chance. And for the first half I was hooked and on board! Reimagining the themes from Episode IV the movie put me perfectly back in the Star Wars universe and the new characters had me excited. John Boyega as Fin was far and away the best character in the movie and I really liked the attempt to give a new and humanizing view of the storm troopers. I have seen various complaints about the campiness, deus ex machinas, and plot holes in the film, however to me these are just part of the Star Wars experience and I was totally fine with forgiving, if not embracing, them. Unfortunately for me the movie suffers from far more fundamental problems dealing with plot structure and characters. I have heard people say ""well if it wasn't a Star Wars movie it would be better"". This is just wrong. The fact that it is a Star Wars movie is about it's only redeeming quality. It is poorly paced, confusing, and completely abandoned character development. About halfway through the movie I realized to my dismay that the Episode IV callbacks, which I initially took as a framing device to get us into the movie/universe, were actually guiding and shoehorning the movie into this weird Star Wars rehash. The new and unique plot they started to give us was completely abandoned and the movie went on this headlong rush to hit a whole bunch of predetermined, unnecessary, plot points and scenes pulled directly from the original movie. This totally puts a halt on any character development as everyone is suddenly shifted into reprises of characters/roles from the original movie. This is most noticeable with Fin whose character arc basically just stops. So what we are left with is a very poorly paced and confusing plot-line with the things we were told we should care about for the first half completely tossed onto the back burner or ignored completely. The only positive to this is that it covers up the movie’s biggest flaw. Having read a fair amount of the reviews I am astounded that more people are not talking about what a terrible character Rey) is. Not in that she is a bad person, but in that she is a completely flawless character. She is brave, noble, powerful, humble, loyal, knowledgable and a whole litany of other awesome adjectives. I am all for female protagonists, but the problem is that this is ultimately not really helping push females in hollywood forward. It seems to me that Disney/JJ was scared of 1) people not liking the character 2) getting bashed for portraying a flawed female heroine. However, the problem with a flawless character is that humans aren't perfect. We can't really connect with her. Secondly there is nowhere for her character to go. She just runs through the movie making all the correct choices and hitting the key plot points. In the original trilogy we saw Luke struggle with naivety, dealing with loss, overconfidence, and temptation. In every instance he was punished for his faults and had to grow through the adversity. The movie makes a few attempts to create some of this, but they are feeble at best. We see ""naive"" wonder at Rey seeing trees for the first time, but then 30 seconds later she demonstrates extreme maturity and wisdom, showing that no she isn't really naive she is just ignorant of a few things (and the movie makes it very clear that it is really just a few things as she is basically an expert in everything she comes up against). She has a brief moment of rejecting her power and destiny, but does a complete reversal and steps into her ""hero shoes"" within 5 minutes of that. As an audience we can really like a perfect character, but we cannot love them because we can't see ourselves in them. We can't ever love Rey and we don't ever get to see her grow because she has nowhere to grow. As much as I wanted to like this movie I just couldn’t. I am astounded by the number of people who tell me it an amazing Star Wars movie or that it is just a plain amazing movie, because trying to be as objective as possible, I just cannot see a good movie in what we were given. If you loved it then I am happy for you. I really wish I could have enjoyed it, but apparently not enough to gloss over the fatal flaws. 2/10 Lightsabers",0
251,"Magnificent! The Star Wars movie I dreamt about since the disappointment of Episode 1 back in 1999. The perfect launch pad for a new saga, the future of this franchise looks very promising.",1
252,"Its a pretty bland movie, its literally Mary Sue on steroids. She literally has a roid rage and does everything by herself, if you want to throw away everything waht the force is and what it Starwars stands for then you clearly love this movie. Its pathetic action flick gimmick. Not even enjoyable.",0
253,"A great rebirth for the new generation. The Force Awakens is packed with a great visuals, action and story. JJ Abrams does a fantastic job with his directing skills, it almost felt like he was born to make this film. While the film does a lot to play it more on the safe side, it is off to a great start in a new trilogy for the new generation. Adam Driver plays Kylo Ren, one of the main antagonists that does a great job at being a different villain than what we have previously seen in the other 6 Star Wars films. He was not the perfect villain, however we see him transitioning into the villain we only thought we knew. Overall, I'm excited for what's to come for the future of this franchise, especially with the new cast.",1
255,"Worst... Star Wars movie... ever! Instead of creating something new and original Abrams shamelessly uses an old plot. Also, the characters in the movie have no depth at all (which Abrams claims is the most important thing!). I mean, what the hell is up with this Kylo Ren character? It seems like just decided to join the sith as some kind of dumb puberty act. The acting as well as some of the jokes are painful to watch. I would give it a 1 for special effects, but somehow the ""authentic puppetry"" doesn't match with all the CGI, making it even more unbelievable than with the bad acting alone. Also, Abrams managed to create an orange CGI character even more annoying than Jar Jar.",0
257,"To be honest, this is the first Star Wars movie I've ever seen.  It was quite boring, and I fell asleep midway through this fiasco.  Technology seemed old and not up to today's standards.  Funky looking creatures that made no sense.  Story line was weak, and I can tell there was hidden disappointment from the hard core fans after the movie was over.  The lame attempt at humor didn't even garner a chuckle from me, but of course the hard core fans laughed.  Not much thought was put into the design of the advanced space craft fighters, which were essentially a cylinder with an oversized disc on each end...Really??  Not very aerodynamic.  Also, all the controls the pilots used to control these pieces of garbage were laughable at best!  Essentially press a series of old fashioned looking buttons seems to make these things fly, shoot, make evasive maneuvers, etc.  Prior to the movie starting, there was a preview of the new Star Trek movie, which even in preview looks far superior to this piece of crap.  The Star Wars series should call it quits and just END IT!",0
258,"Star Wars Ep VII is mostly a rip-off of Ep. IV. No originality or innovation. We saw more of the same plot devices used in the old movies and lacked the element of surprise. The characters have no chemistry, they are underdeveloped, superficial and does not captivate or connect with the audience. The new hero is a Mary Sue, the new villains are all weak and pathetic crybabies. This is basically a lazy cop out reboot with a SJW/PC agenda being sold as a new installment in the series. Worst episode of the series, thanks Jar Jar Abrams and Dark Lord of the Sith Disney for exploiting fans nostalgia.",0
259,"Plain awful.  I went in with lowered expectations, hoping to be proven wrong.  Well, I was proven wrong.  It was worse than I was expecting!  A few thoughts: 1) Poor story telling.   Basically just a redo of A New Hope.  No backstory provided in any sense. 2) This is a sequel to Episode 6?  There is no connection to the events of Return of the Jedi at all.  It's supposed to be 30 years later and yet they talk about it like it's ancient, mythological history. 3) Missing the Star Wars feel.  It felt much more like a typical Hollywood movie than a Star Wars film.  Nothing special about it other than the Star Wars brand.  Violence was too edgy for a Star Wars movie. 4) Boring, undeveloped characters.  We are supposed to love the characters because the director says so, not because we are provided any reason to root for them.  No way can these new characters carry the franchise going forward.  When the credits roll, we still know basically nothing about Rey, except that she is really awesome, has no flaws in her character, and is better at everything than everybody else in the film.  Her character is over-the-top perfect.  She can even fix and fly the Millenium Falcon better than Han Solo 15 minutes after climbing aboard, to say nothing of her 30 second mastery of mind tricks, or her instantly-acquired light saber skills. 5) Too many ridiculous coincidences.  I can usually look past these, but in this movie they are the main plot device. 6) Ford, Fisher, Hamill awkwardly shoe-horned in.  Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, but even he came across as going through the motions.  The other two might as well not be in the movie.  There's little connection between the old and new characters.  No real passing of the torch. 7) Many plot-holes and inconsistencies.  It doesn't play well with other, established facts of the Star Wars universe.  They took it wherever they wanted to go. Well, there's a lot more to dislike about this movie, but I'm out of breath.  I won't be seeing any more of these in the theater.",0
260,"Oh my, Oh God, Oh why.... Where do I begin with this mini review? As a Star Wars fan I have always loved the original movies and liked the prequels and appreciated the meaningful narrative that the saga told - to this day it is one of my favourite movie franchises. Having said that, this entry falls so flat and feels so empty that I nearly had a heart attack after seeing the hype and all-round positivity surrounding this picture. While watching the movie many things became apparent. Firstly it moves at a breakneck speed and you eventually realise why, there is no story or character development whatsoever - its almost as if someone had a gun at the back of the directors head, forcing him to move quickly before people catch on to the shallowness and superficiality of SW7. Secondly because the movie is crammed and there is no room to breathe, all the happy coincidences that happen in the film stick out like a sore thumb and feel false; its true to say that there are coincidences in the previous installments but because there actually is a deep and meaningful story it doesn't hit you in the eye like a bolt of lightning but occurs seamlessly and works. Thirdly where was the score? We're talking John Williams the maestro here. I expect he himself had a stroke when he watched it and could only deliver a generic compilation that would be appropriate to the film. I could go on with my list of disappointments but can't be bothered ...zzz..zz..zz In conclusion this is a Disney movie and in all honesty feels more like a Guardians of the Galaxy 2 rather than a genuine entry into the saga and thats the problem. Star Wars was never on the surface in terms of depth, it had poetry, a compelling spiritual battle, growing momentum that led ( for me ) to a satisfying and well paced conclusion. If you like your movies light hearted, fun, shallow and not too serious then this movie will be right up your alley. But if you're like me and you wanted to see and experience that deep, rich and meaningul story that connects with you and leaves you feeling transported to another galaxy - this is DEFINITELY NOT IT!",0
261,"If you are fans of Star Wars, stand clear of this movie. It is nothing but a remake of Star Wars IV for Twilight fans. Let's stop J.J. Abrams before it is too late!",0
263,"I like space battles. I like death-defying stunts and acrobatic choreographed combat scenes. I like action. I like cgi. I like all these things but they need to support a somewhat engaging story and characters. Sadly, we get a rehash of the same story we have seen before. The same plot lines with the same progression as before. It's paint-by-numbers star wars. You have seen it all before and it's missing the adventure movie magic in an immersive fantasy world. The actors give good performances. Very good within filling the shoes of old characters recycled with a twist. Those boundaries quickly become obvious however undermining all their effort. Disney/JJ Abrams have clearly banked a nostalgia filled cash-in on their purchase of the franchise. Their no-risk approach is well polished but ultimately forgettable.",0
264,"I thought the new characters were portrayed by the actors as well as the writers would allow, and therein lies the issue with this movie. It bottlenecks with the writing. Rife with plot holes often interpreted as teasers for VIII and IX or references to comics, books and other media, which no one should have to purchase in addition to get the entire story. TFA was a simulacrum of a Star Wars movie, a two hour advertisement for merchandise and satellite media driven by the in-situ nostalgia of the boomers/X-ers and the generation-defining nostalgia of millenials: for the sake of authenticity, the desire for the ""I was there"" experiences for an age that never was. Everyone rating this movie average and below has covered the bases. It's another bathtub fantasy on the silver screen, a wish-granting romp through daddy's things.",0
265,"Can it really be that bad? Yeah, it really can be that bad, and it is. I couldn't believe that all of these negative reviews could possibly be accurate, especially the zeros, but after seeing it, I wish I could give it a negative number. The movie isn't just bad, it's downright upsetting. Talk about going from a high to a low. I was expecting the beginning of a great new series of films. Instead, I got a clueless director doing nothing but clumsily reshooting older episodes. We've gone from one of the most imaginative filmmakers in cinema history to a director who apparently has no imagination whatsoever. And after expecting a wedding but getting a funeral, I will not be back in the theatre for the next burial.",0
267,"It was a mediocre story, and the way it was told was mediocre. It proposed a contrived continuity that was immediately doubtful along with a string of convenient coincidences that were so unbelievable they were confusing. While the look of the film went deep, the characters and their relationships did not. I wanted to be reunited with maturer, wiser friends, not shells of their former selves. I wanted to meet new characters in a renewed galaxy, not mere naive enthusiasm fast tracked through a fatalistic rehash. I wanted the film to draw me in and speak to my heart, like the original trilogy did, but instead I found myself a bystander unmoved by a spectacle “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” I want to esteem J.J. Abrams and company as more creative and courageous than this, but that would make this release all the more baffling. After the revisionist Khan story of Star Trek: Into Darkness, which I enjoyed up until the role-reversing self-sacrifice scene, I was cautiously optimistic to hear Mr. Abrams had taken on the next Star Wars film. But while the alternate timeline of Into Darkness made sense in the context of the film that preceded it, the seemingly alternate timeline of The Force Awakens did not after the redemptive resolution of Return Of The Jedi.",0
268,"Force Awakens is kind of movie which makes you miss James Cameron. The visionary director who actually understands the need and desire of the audience. Force Awaken even lacks the philosophy offered by original movie. It’s a product which is made with only one intention, ‘Feed the hungry fans and cash the cow’.Starting with the story, it was like watching A New Hope’s mesh up with Jurassic World. All elements of the Original movie were present. The Trio of young characters, the good turned bad antagonist and his relationship with the protagonist. Even the death star and some old stars were there. There absolutely is no real goal in the movie. We movie from securing the map to preparing the Jedi to destroying the death star. And story itself has holes big enough to swallow a galaxy which is far far away. It seems that in last 30 years only earth have progressed in technology and biological domain, the galaxy which was so advance 40 years ago, now seems be living the same. Like the original series, antagonists are not killed and neither the family of protagonist is revealed. I wonder if they have any idea about DNA and biology. Also it’s not clear that how come antagonist know a lot of technology. From a 30 years old spaceship to a newly built death star. She knows the right circuits to pull out. Characters seemed to be very distant throughout the movie. There absolutely was no chemistry between Han Solo and Princess/General Lea. Who unexpectedly is never mentioned to be from Jedi family. Although after recent success of female protagonist oriented film series, they did pass the torch to a girl.Moving to visual effects and cinematography, perhaps the focus really was to add unnecessary and blunt action sequence. Much like prequels directed by George Lucas, colors were blurred and not so bright. There was no need to watch the movie in Imax or 3d, the worst a director can do to a 3d movie. J J Abrams really lacked a vision here. It is just like watching a 2d film.Acting is okie, Although I did not understand some of the wits. Daisy Ridley is great in her role. She wore the role over and is the best thing in movie crossover. Harrison Ford is good and easy in his role. Carrie Fisher is alright. She did not have much to do that explains more than enough make up even at crucial times. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac played split up of Han Solo’s character with not much required jokes.One goes with high expectation but returns very disappointed.",0
269,"Once upon a time JJ Abrams wrote down his favorite original trilogy scenes on separate note cards. He spread the cards before him. Wow, he thought, these scenes are cool. Since I'm doing the first movie of the trilogy, I'll keep most of the notecards from A New Hope and discard the rest. However, I'll keep the Vader/Luke catwalk scene as people tend cite that as their favorite. I'll keep the ROTJ cards too, actually. Ok, there's still a lot of scenes here. I'll keep the ones that I've seen referenced in popular culture the most, and discard the rest...no, wait, let's keep it all- I'll alter them just enough so as not to violate that contract we signed with George. Hmm, the original cast is older now. 30 years have passed. Let's write out the ramifications of the original trilogy such that Han is still a smuggler, Leia is leading a resistance and Luke, well, he told me he can't jump anymore so we'll stash him on an island somewhere. The opening crawl will make the movie about him, though, because, you know, Luke. Luke has disappear, Leia Luke! Crawl complete. Ok, I have unlimited freedom and creativity in this universe. I need a climactic space battle scene. What's something that's never been done before in this universe? Death Star! But mine, mine will be bigger. Planet-sized. That's big, and the original Death Star worked because it was big, right? Wait, if it's a planet, there won't be any space battles in the movie- good trade off though because big. Since the Vader/Luke catwalk scener- er I mean Han/Ren scene needs to happen, and we need force awakening, let's do a mashup ROTJ style as main character arcs are so 1970s. Ray will learn about the force by showing her concentrating and/or flashing back. They'll explain it in the next episode of Lost. I guess I'm old school- I like character growth, originality, pacing and WONDER. These are created dynamically and with intent and priority, and won't emerge passively from a cut n paste hackjob. I can go on for days about this farce, but I've seen others doing a good job. Glad I'm not alone. 3 stars, because some of the acting was nice. I'd rank it 5th in the series, above TPM and AOTC.",0
270,"This film was exactly what I was afraid it was going to be, boring and 100% not Star Wars. I am very confident that in the fullness of time this will be recognised as the worst Star Wars film by a mile. I cannot be bothered to list all of the reasons why, all the other user reviews on here have done a good job already.",0
272,"I'm so disappointed about this movie and can not understand how anyone give this episode a good rating.Story from episode 4, bad actors, nothing new. JUST BAD!",0
273,"Know that this is the first typed critique I have made of anything in my life. I feel it is my duty to not let Disney and Jar Jar Abrams get the best of all of us. I'm punching back. This movie should've been titled The Force Went to Sleep. It was a complete butchery of the potential I really thought the Star Wars franchise would have with the start of Episode VII. I've been a fan of the story since a child in the 80's. Never would I have imagined Episode VII would be worse than the prequels. I was wrong. Forgive me George Lucas. For all of your CGI insanity and lack of exploring the force deeper in the prequels in a more adult fashion like in IV, V, and VI, you still knew the importance of original storytelling. After seeing this new Star Wars, you and I are at least back on neutral ground. Now I understand the whole 'history repeats itself premise' when it comes to life and perhaps even film, and I don't think per se that was a flawed undertaking to bring to this one; however, this movie was a rehash of events and scenes from the original three and spewed nothing but a lack of creative storytelling. All that time Lawrence Kasdan and JJ Abrams spent frolicking around Hollywood with a notepad coming up with story ideas while enjoying lattes on Santa Monica beach or wherever the hell they were was all for naught. Judging by the end result, they were not willing to take the leap into uncharted territory and take some risk which is exactly what was needed. Instead they decided to be cute thinking they would rehash events and scenes from the originals which they new all the fans fell in love with. Disney probably had to pay for an air purification crew to have around JJ and Lawrence on set as they were that used to smelling their own farts. There's a difference between history repeating itself through character conflict and a new generation and a difference in history repeating itself through the same plot. The first twenty minutes of the film were decent, but it didn't take long after that for things to spiral downwards at hyperspeed. Characters and events were introduced at such a fast pace it felt like the writers and director were all on a nose candy bender starting on day one and ending up on some remote islands at the end with no idea what just happened. None of the characters have depth and nothing registers. It's just scene after spontaneous character appearance after scene after spontaneous character appearance and so on. An hour in and it really starts to dawn on you how bad it is. At that point it turned into a comedy for me up until the end.  Unfortunately! When Kylo Ren had that temper tantrum with the lightsaber like a boy after being grounded and loosing his video game privileges, I honestly just turned and said ""did that just happen?"". Well it did happen, and it's just plain weird. Even the stormtroopers seemed embarrassed. You'll know the scene when you see it.  Not exactly representative of someone deserving of knowing and feeling the force whether it be the darkside or the light in my most humble fan-based opinion.  Perhaps he grows up in the next episode. Even the darkside in the original movies had some respect for the mystical nature of the universe and power they harnessed though for ultimately selfish reasons.  This movie is missing that at both ends of the force.  For me I think that is the biggest letdown. I'm not going to spoil anything and won't say don't go and see it. All Star Wars fans obviously are going to. Anyone in touch with the force will realize this movie isn't. At least there's the originals and the great story they provided. Perhaps in another twenty years humanity will get some remakes of the prequels. I changed my initial review from a 0 to a 2 after going to see it again just to make sure it was as bad as I thought it was the first time.  I thought maybe it was just shock.  Well bad it is, but there's some redemption though very little.  I thought BB-8 had good personality.  He's alright in my book.  The stormtroopers know how to aim finally, and some of the ship designs looked cool - especially Kylo Ren's ship.  I still have the utmost respect for Harrison Ford doing his best to make it back into character too.",0
274,"I really like Star Wars, but this movie almost felt like a bad remake of A New Hope. Besides that, Kylo Ren is one of the worst villains I've ever seen. Why is he so weak? He was trained by Luke Skywalker and is quite easily defeated by Rey. How is that possible? Oh wait, he's an expert at throwing tantrums.Then there is the First Order. I know that ODESSA supposedly was the inspiration for the First Order, but all they seem to be is a bunch of incompetent Space-Nazi-Wannabes. Don't they know how the first Death Star was destroyed? Why didn't they implement tougher security measures? ...I just want some consistency.Well, at least the actors did a good job, especially Adam Driver (it's not his fault Kylo Ren is such a poorly written character) and Harrison Ford.I'll give the next movie a chance, but this one has far too many flaws.",0
275,I'm giving this a 0 because it's incomprehensible for this to get a 10. This is a fundamentally flawed movie. The writing is horrible. JJ absolutely was the worst director for this series. SO many unexplained plot points that make no sense. This is an insult to the Star Wars franchise. It is so obvious this lacks George Lucas's creative vision.,0
276,"This movie must be one of the most overrated films of the century. The acting is wooden, the humour misplaced and the action is clichéd time ten. The plot, if you can call it that, is a little more than a contrived re-make of the first Star Wars but similar art production that made the first one so fun.",0
277,"If you thought Jar Jar Binks was bad, then just wait until you see what Jar Jar Abrams has in store for you. First off, the writing is very poor and comes over like poorly written fan fiction. This movie lacks a real plot, character development, character chemistry and any logical connection between most scenes. The main villain isn't even menacing, he just feels like a hot-tempered cry baby who throws temper tantrums like a little brat. He even has problems fighting the weakest non-force sensitive characters in close combat because he suddenly forgets how to use his force powers thanks to the awful writing. All of the supporting characters, even returning ones, are extremely shallow. Only the main character and one very beloved returning character have anything redeemable about them, and the latter is only on screen for about 30 seconds. The directing is also abysmal. There are just so many unflattering camera angles, poorly choreographed as well crudely visualised scenes and the pacing is simply awkward. Jar Jar Abrams never went to film school, and oh boy, his abysmal directing skills really show in this movie. The only thing that Jar Jar Abrams seems to have gotten right was copying the aesthetics of the Original Trilogy, although he completely fails at implementing it in a creative and artistic way to please the audience. Only the final scene can bring any redemption to this trainwreck, but it is not enough to save it from being a bad film. If you only care about flashy lights shown in an awkward manner, then this is the film for you. Otherwise stay away. 3/10",0
278,"A poor film. JJ Abrams has brought his TV show sensibilities to a universe that demands the most cinematic treatment and crafted 2 hours of shallow, scrappy B movie buffed to a high shine with beautiful CG. If you've seen his Star Trek reboot you know what to expect. Many of the problems with this film rest almost entirely upon his shoulders. The casting is just atrocious and one of the biggest weaknesses in this soul less and committee led cash cow. It has no ideas of its own and as others have said, plays like a remix of moments from the first trilogy. Credit is due to ILM and the talented artists and designers who have made this the best looking Star Wars movie to date but that's about the only good thing I can say about it.",0
280,"So bad it makes me appreciate Episode 1. It even makes me appreciate Prometheus. no, wait. No it doesn't. Read all the other bad reviews. They articulate the details pretty well.

281,"Episode 7:  The Forced Mistakes.  There is no reason that this movie had to be this God-awful.  How about having the courage to actually try to tell a new story?  There was not a single risk taken in the entire film!  It was nothing except what worked in past films except for a few details here and there.  The problem is, it doesn't work in this film because WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT BEFORE!  Give us what we were told was coming, a new episode.  What complete cowards.  Disgraceful.",0
283,"Serious Spoiler Warning: The new Star Wars is a tired, worn out imitation of itself. I am baffled by the good reviews. I used to love the original Star Wars, but this one is just a re-run of the EXACT SAME things we have already seen. This is the FOURTH giant, round space ship that got blown up. Count them, FOUR!!!!! I just don't care anymore!More things that were the same as what we've already seen:-Old villain was Luke's father, new villain is Han's son.-Old villain killed old man hero/father figure Obi-wan, to show he was scary. New villain killed old man hero/father figure Han, to show he was scary.-Old movie had important item hidden on droid, droid is sent to dessert planet, where it finds 2 unlikely heroes and Chewbacca, who fly millennium falcon to to giant round spaceship, then return droid to Rebellion. New movie, exact same thing, except returned the droid to ""resistance"" instead of ""rebellion.""-Old movie, mysterious emperor guy who is black-helmet-villains' boss. Mysterious ruler has one military guy who commands giant round space ship, who he lets compete wi black helmet guy . New movie, exact same, right down to the military guy competing with helmet guy, it even LOOKS like the same mysterious emperor guy.-Old movies, wise little green guy. New movies, wise little orange lady.I could go on. It was the EXACT SAME frickin' movie! The originals were beloved because they were creative. The new movies are just a tired repeat of what we've already seen.",0
284,"Great acting and casting, great FX, decent directing, decent dialogue, but LAZY and TERRIBLE WRITING. If I were into watching shallow Marvel-type movies, and had never before seen a Stars Wars movie, I would have given this an 8 or 9.  BUT, it only deserves a 2 because I HAVE seen all the Star Wars movies,  and expected quite a lot more.  The Force Awakens is a shiny well-directed turd of a story. It doesn't deserve a 0 because Daisy Ridley put in an amazing performance as Rey, and I'll give Abrams credit for focusing more on the characters and less on FX and fight sequences. But it was a total disservice to Lucas and the Star Wars universe.  The plot holes and lazy writing throughout were unforgivable.  And the final third of this movie where it fell apart seemed like it had been written in a day, the entire sequence blowing up the death star was so anti-climatic, and actions seemed simply executed to carry out the plot (a gun to the head and Captain Phasma brings down the shields?!?!?  At least Return of the Jedi wrote an interesting plot just for the shield).  And although the dialogue was miles better than the prequels, I still cringed at a few parts (such as Poe and Kylo Ren...""Do you go first?""...horrendous)  Other parts seemed to stick out like sore thumbs...did we really need a Nazi-like Hitler-like speech from General Hux?  Is this the only way you can think of for us to hate him?  Lazy writing. I won't go into the details such as the terrible idea and execution of the Star Killer, or the death star 3.0 being blown up easier than a store full of fireworks, or Rey learning Jedi powers almost instantaneously (is this Xmen?)  I can forgive Abrams and Disney for playing it safe and re-doing A New Hope, but at LEAST work on the plot and writing details a bit more?!?! It's not like there aren't talented writers in Hollywood, so it is obvious that Disney sees Star Wars as a simple money ticket for their merchandising and theme parks, and could care less about making a masterpiece.  At least Lucas tried with his prequels, but made the mistake in thinking he could direct and write dialogue.  The fanboys out there are rationalizing every hole in the plot, I've even heard that Rey was a master Jedi, and has had her memory erased!?  When you have to rationalize excuses for a bad story telling, you have a bad story telling!!!! In the end, I feel quite stupid that I thought Disney would care about trying to outdo the original trilogy.  Lucas will soon move on, and we need to also move on.  Star Wars, I knew thee well.",0
285,This movie fails in everyway possible. To echo one if the critic reviews: been there done that. There is simply no purpose for the movie. Poor writing. Poor acting. Dumb story line. 80's special effects and computer graphics that may have worked in the 80's but doesn't work anymore.,0

(Disney and Jar Jar Abrams) I never submitted to the whole history is cyclical theory and even if it was, its because human nature is intrinsically consonant leading to similar human conflicts developing over time. NOT because we ripoff the past (episodes 4 - 6), repackage it and present it to audiences believing they are that dense they cannot notice the blatant knockoff before them that is Episode 7. Immensely disappointed! The Force has not Awakened, it has been laid to rest in a grand $200 million dollar sendoff. With its kinsmen being charged $12 per person to pay their respects to the hollow shell that now stands in the place of the once rich universe that captured the imagination of millions around the world, and taught an entire generation to linger their eyes upon the stars, and wonder.",0

289,"Star Wars is about Jedi magic. That's the only way to explain its acclaimed success.Critics and viewers consent was created by Walt Disney Company's Jedi abilities. Or eventually bought by the billions they spend on every single media channel worldwide to advertise their products. The whole movie is a joke. There is NO ONE SINGLE ORIGINAL IDEA in the plot or the screenplay.While watching it I could not decide if it was a sequel or a remake of the original saga mixed with teen drama. Actors are bad, dim, childish with the only exception of the young girl.Nostalgia quickly leaves place to eternal boredomIt's a colossal (yes) eye-candy. So disappointing, even worst than Lucasfilms prequel trilogy. And I don't understand why....they had all the budget to make something memorable, but failed.

294,"1. If your plans for the conquest of the galaxy twice failed, do not worry. You just have to build a new battle station, but even larger. The third time you certainly succeed.2. A talented engineer, a pilot from God, a stalker, a self-taught Jedi mastered in half an hour more than Luke in the whole trilogy, modest, beautiful, sympathetic...Strange only that her name is Ray, and not Mary Sue.3. All the giant battle stations have special rooms made to the inside could fly a fighter plane and destroy it from within.4. If, in the distant, distant galaxy using e-mail, Skype or some other data exchange system, the film would be reduced to about five minutes.5. In a difficult situation, when you run away from the attack aircraft and fighters do not worry - there will always be nearby unprotected ""Millennium Falcon"" just waiting to be stolen.6. Under the stormtrooper armor can hide thin and vulnerable person who realizes that he is not a murderer, and leave the evil order.( He will have to kill a bunch of their colleagues - but if they are evil, then obviously it is not considered murder.)7.Skywalker children always disappoint their parents. Genetics, not otherwise.8.You like young Anakin from the prequel trilogy? Then the good news  you enjoy Kylo Ren even more.9.If one of the characters in the film said at the right moment, ""I'm not your father,"" All probably would have turned out the same way. But at least it would be funny. And finally...10.If you want to continue the ""Star Wars"", but do not know how - it does not matter. Just copy the plot of the most popular movie in the saga. No one will even notice the difference.",0
296,"I am shocked at seeing all the 10s given by user critics here. Not surprised by the high marks given by the critic reviewers though since many of them are no doubt in league with Disney. But seriously, there is so much wrong with this movie that even the beginning of the movie is a mess. Here is my review of only the first 15 minutes or so of the film: (it only went downhill from there IMHO). During the attack on Lor San Tekka's village Kylo decides to take Poe Dameron captive to learn what he did with the information he was given by Lor San Tekka. I have several questions at this point in the script the writers obviously ignored or just didnt think about: 1. If Kylo has such a command of the force which enables him to read minds then why didnt he also take Lor San into custody as well and read his mind before cutting him assunder with his nifty claymore style light sabre??? Seems like a pretty valuable and huge opportunity that a smarter sith lord in training or smarter writer wouldn't have missed! 2. When Kylo asked some of the Storm Troopers to search Poe's X-wing why didn't he ask them if a droid was on the ship? I would think by now the Empire/First Order would know that the Rebels/Resistance use droids for navigation and in flight repairs on their fighters. I am pretty sure a smarter sith lord in training or writer would have not missed this observation! 3.Why didnt the Storm Troopers notice droid tracts leading away from the X-wing...tracks that even a Storm Trooper should be able to follow? Considering how fast BB-8 was shown to move in the film the Storm Troopers could have brought back the droid in plenty of time for Kylo to place Poe in front of his own blaster shot force hanging in mid air and then release said blaster shot into Poe. Now wouldnt that have been a sight - Poe ends up blasting himself with his own weapon in front of all the villagers. A smarter sith lord in training or writer would have done this and then let the rest of the villagers live just to tell the story of how ""bad ass"" he is! I am not even a writer but i feel my scenario is far better than JJ Abrams version and I am only minutes into the film. However, this is the first of many many plot holes through out the film with so many I am beyond supprised it made it into production. If the next film is no better I am going to write off Star Wars movies for good and stick to shows like 'Game of Thrones' where the writing though not perfect is ""parsecs"" ahead.",0
297,"Abrams is has come to claim another franchise; between the sloppy story transitions and being a crummy scene for scene remake of the original Star Wars. The characters hurtle through the story and if dumb luck(a.k.a. the Force) didn't have some special plan the protagonists this would be unbelievable. This lacks any originality or rewatchability, highlighting the sad state of our cinemas. The War is over; Abrams killed it.",0
298,"I give it a 2, thought you can say its a 5, but after all the hype and amazing reviews this movie got from all critics around the world for me it was as much as disappointment episode 1 was.To be fair its not as near bad,its a nice movie to watch home, not one to wait years in the making and standing in tha line for.I get that they didnt want to have an episode 1 fiasko all over again so they played safe as far as script but what you get is a first 3 movies best ofcollection.Lets be honest, first movie is propably one of the most if not the most influential movie of the last 50 years but generally the whole series is to overated.",0
299,"This movie lacks any of the originality or even the basic identity of the Star Wars movies in the past. Bland generic film making and an even more generic plot easily sets Episode VII apart as the worst movie of the saga. This may come as a surprise to many, since the special effects are great and the actors actually do a pretty good job, however the characters are so bland and uninteresting that it all seems like a big waste. What's even worse than this movie's recycled plot and countless plot holes, is the way it portrays the old characters: Han, Leia and Luke. Han and Leia are basically losers who failed as parents, and Luke is a coward who has gone into hiding and abandoned his friends. This movie is a joke and a blatant cash grab by Disney.",0

For everyone who are new to the star wars it may be their first taste of star wars but for those who watched the previous films and know the lore this film is garbage, I am predicting the next film will follow the Empire Strikes Back and be same film again but different timeline. WHY???? SO MUCH WRONG WITH THE MOVIE ITS UNBELIEVABLE.",0
302,"This film was a giant kick into the crotch of all Star Wars Fans who were looking forward for something new and good from one our of favorite galaxies.Instead we got a overhyped mess of a movie. That they didnt folow the storyline in the books was totaly fine. But they got almost everything else wrong which could go wrong. 1. First of all this film is full of plot and logicholes. Just a few examples:Finn is shocked by the brutality of the empire and refuses to shoot innocent civilians. But only moments later he obviously doesnt have any problem with slaughtering his comrades and friends. Yeah good job you hypocrite. Where the hell did the new order get the ressources to build Death Star number 3? And obviously they must have run out of money because there are no alarms or surveillance on the station when Han and his Crew boarded it.Oh and this time they didnt made the exhaust shaft torpedo or Millenium Falcon sized but this doesnt stop the rebels from blowing a hole into the outer wall and fly in. Must be these damn budget cuts again.... Something bad happens the first time Han Solo doesnt shoot first 2. The SettingLonely Droid rolling alone on some desert planet looking for someone who he can give some important information?Young scrap collector on the mentioned desert planet who is going to be the chosen one?A Bunch of X-Wings attacking a oversized battle station and destroying it?The generator room with the long slim bridge which almost looks the same like the one on Bespin?Now if you think that Disney has been recycling the best scenes from the previous parts you are basically right. Its nothing new. They just polished it a bit up, renamed it and presented it as something fresh.On top of that its filled with Disney **** and cliches:First Order = Space Nazis, only thing that was missing were officers shouting ""Heil Snoke""Ive met you not even 3h ago and you are already the most important person in my life even tough I know **** about you.That guy doesnt know ho to handle a lightsaber but instead of shooting him I throw my rifle away and beat him up with a space police baton.My spine just go ripped apart by a lightsaber but the plotarmor protects me.The Villain just got his throat slashed by a lightsaber but still survives it with a scratch. 3. CharactersThis is by far the weakest point of the movie. Many of the characters look like they dont want to be in this film.The Stormtroopers are even more stupid than in the films before. They seemed to have dumped all Commando structures and weapons systems exept the blasters. Its like the gave their soldiers a gun and a armor and sent them into battle with no training what so ever. And most of them were so surprised that they actually hit something at the begin of the film that they forgot how to aim at the end of the film. Han, Chewie, BB8, Leia and Poe were great you gotta credit the for that. The others however were in a complete worse league. Here we have Kylo Ren who is acting like he just became a Sith to piss of his parents and because its cool. And because he isnt villain enough Disney gave him his mask as fashion statement and not as something life important.Seriously it would have been better with everyone else as Sith, even Jaja **** Bings Fynn is a hypocrite who doesnt actually know what he is doing around here. He just mindlessly follow the others. Rey ist some kind of immortal main character who is lvl 99 by default and got more skill than a trained Sith knight even tough she had absolutely no training. Random pilots who dies at the attack and for which the viewers are supposed to feel sorry. Too bad it didnt work since everyone of them got less than 60 sec screentime together. Seriously, if you liked the feeling from the old Star Wars movies you should really consider to stay away from this one. It looks like a recycling product with some new paint and hastly written characters and basically is a single huge letdown.",0
304,"Really disappointing experience! Watched the original trilogy as a teenager and this was a bad remake of the first movie, but also parts taken from second and third movie.

Super-Girl Rey learns mind tricks and lightsaber duels a trained Sith without training.- Third death-star with the same design flaws as previous two; what a joke! This movie was terrible and I predict people will start to hate it really fast. Overrated!!!",0
305,"Upon seeing the force awakens I tried to think of something I liked in the film. I couldn't. I'm not being facetious when I say this I literally couldn't find one thing I liked about this film. It was an unoriginal rehash of episodes 4 & 5. Besides the repackaged plot all the characters were cringeworthy especially rey and fin. All rey was was the chick from the hunger games except with a light saber. Apparently rey is good at everything and i mean everything, to a point where as a viewer you say,""ok I get it shes talented. Give it a rest."" Listen I don't have a problem with a woman as the main lead but it seemed like disney was shoving it down the audience's throat that she was a strong,independent, capable woman. Plus daisy ridley was a total miscast. You're telling me that a girl that looks and sounds like her grew up on a poverty stricken dessert planet. Yeah ok. They should have cast someone more like sigourney weaver who is strong without being annoying. As for fin I thought from the trailers that he was going to be this badass, disciplined character who is scarred by the past. Yeah he was a badass minus the bad. All he did the whole movie was crack stupid jokes and played more of a jar jar binks role. It doesn't make sense to have a character trained from birth to be a soldier be so flamboyant. Apparently all the soldiers do all day is crack jokes because he was sure telling a lot of them. Bb-8 was useless and clearly marketed for the kids. Ren was an emo cry baby that looked like he belonged in a tim burton movie. And a third death star? No wait this was a mega death star that could blow up 5 planets! Whoa!  I guess when it comes to death stars third times the charm. Overall the didn't feel like star wars. It didn't have that star wars vibe to it. It felt more like a **** sci fi movie (kind of looked fan made) with some star wars set pieces. And it hurts me to say this but the prequels were better than FA and i highly dislike those films. Disney made safe film that paid excessive homage to the original trilogy without being creative or original themselves but hey I guess its all about $$$. Oh and what was with that weird staring contest at the end of the movie?  Weird",0
306,"I gave this movie a 0 because it pretends to be a new Star Wars film, which is not. As a mindless fantasy action flick however it is probably a 6. The movie basically plays it so safe that it is hard to consider it as anything else other than a rip off of A New Hope with some cameos that make it almost feel like a parody of itself. Lame humor most of the timeAction sequences after action sequences just for the sake of having action sequencesHardly any build-up or tension about anything going onAlmost no character developmentNo rewatchability factorNo memorable lines to quoteAll the villains in this movie suck, I found none of them menacingThe hero of the movie is just so good at everything that you cannot worry about her about anythingSome things are just so repetitive and stupid, but I cannot spoil them.. but, seriously, enough alreadyFor some reason we have ""the Resistance"" when a New Republic was formed after ROTJ Anyway, the movie is not a terrible way to spend 2 hours, but I hate the fact that everything has now become about marketing and hype when the films themselves are mediocre at best. The prequels can be laughable at times, but they tell a story, and also have some memorable scenes, which brings me to the last complaint: something like Duel of the Fates in Force Awakens? literally, NON-EXISTENT SCORE!",0
307,"""Wow, JJ nailed it! This really feels like Star Wars!""Just the tip of the iceberg: Scottish death gang and Asian thugs called... Kanjiklub??? Tentacled monsters (god-awful CGI) chasing them through corridors as if in a cheap Alien3-ripoff? Stormtrooper dropping his blaster to fight an ex-janitor with a... baton? A planet that sucks out the power of its sun (!) to fire through... hyperspace??? Resistance pilot cracking jokes when kneeling half-paralyzed before a (supposedly) evil lord (""You talk first? I talk first?"")??? Emo brat in homemade Halloween Vader-costume (speaking through a bucket, apparently) smashing through his own ship with a homemade medieval flamesword??? The Falcon coming out of hyperspace ONTO the surface of a planet??? ""Boyfriend, cute boyfriend""??? ""Mr Solo?"" Circling helicopter shot of Luke standing on an Irish island with a ""Zoolander Blue Steel"" gaze???Seriously, people, what the hell were you smoking?I don't know what it is, but sure is NOT Star Wars.",0
308,The Force Awakens is a complete train wreck the first 10 minutes was alright but the rest of the movie felt as is there wasn't even a world they were exploring JJ Abrhams vision is so shallo he couldn't see out of a kiddie pool at the local park every element in the movie was bland from the worlds they visited to the hap hazard music score. The part that struck me as infantile was when Oscar isaac in the first 5 mins of the movie spurts out an obnoxious line of so you talk first or I talk first or what after what just appeared to be an entire village being massacered. This movie doesn't even hold a candle to the other 6 Star Wars movies and its a complete travesty such s film was even created it felt like the entire movie was pacing along at a pace so fast that there was no time to discuss what was actually happening no meaningful dialogue that explained any progress or what was transgressing. It was a movie that was on par with Michael bays sequel transformers movies brain dead explosions and action everywhere with no meaningful story or character development an infantile babble bumbling disaster.,0
309,"Very,very disappointed. This new part is a joke and just another money grab. Typical example of greed. Without the old characters this movie would be just another boom-crash-bang empty Hollywood crap. It's sad and unbelievable that people think this is a good movie. The new characters are simply boring and another few years no-one will remember them. The only character who is worth something is Rey. But still, nothing compared to Solo or any other old character. The story is weak full of with logical holes, and some of the scenes are pathetic. Like the scene where Rey and the new bad guy fighting. Just simply bad. No wonder they poured it down the worlds throat with advertising. Empty, badly done except for the cgi, perfect for the brainwashed...",0
310,"Dull, dull, dull.....The showing my wife and I went to was around 10% full and mostly with people in their 40's and 50's. This told me a lot. Seeing the show was an act of nostalgia for those that were literally blown away by what we're cutting edge effects in their time.What Disney have done is dishonest... Plot....Some important info is hidden by a fleeing rebel in a droid. The baddies are sent to recover said droid. The baddies have a chuffing big round thing with a massive gun on it that can destroy planets. They use it to destroy some planets which upsets everyone. The rebels need to destroy said round thing which involves someone getting inside, disabling the shields and allowing a load of X-wings to target the vulnerable bit. Which they do. And it blows up. And everyone is happy.Sound familiar.......? They didn't even try to hide their shameless plagiarism. Right down to an X-Wing or two flying down a heavily defended channel to deliver the fateful blow, a bar scene with a bunch of very odd looking aliens that all go quiet when the main characters enter, a face off between father and son ( yes, you got it... On a very large, narrow bridge thingy), I could go on..... It's the very first one all over again but with a bit more advanced cgi.Regurgitate a formula, hype it up, make a squillion.Embarrassing that I fell for it. Glad I bought the large popcorn bucket because counting it gave me something to do whilst all the noise and shooting was going on.",0
311,"The story was a steaming pile of implausible conveniences.but it looked great, except the calamari  and pancake face somehow looked more plastic than they did in the previous movies.",0
312,"Honestly. I seriously cannot believe how paid-off these critics are. Anyone who even has a shred of intelligence that has seen the other movies knows how bad this film was. Not only that, but there is simply some BIG mistakes in the plot. My issues:(1) How many death star/planets is there going to be? I guess we're going to see 2-3 more I suppose......(2) Why would someone like Captain Phasma just hand willing lower the shields.....I mean someone who would be in her position had to be ruthless to get there and would die or even trick Han Solo and Finn before lowering those shields.(3) How in the world did Rey defeat Kylo Ren? Ok I get it that Rey is the main character and shouldn't die, but the first movie should have established the next set of movies by Rey fleeing from Kylo who's simply cannot pursue Rey because of setback to the Empire(4) Leia loses the love of her life and her son (emotionall speaking). Leia should have dropped to the ground on her knees and cried out in sorrow, much like Luke does when he finds out Vader is his father. This was practically emotionaless. How any critic can ignore the 4 above problems is just mind boggling. Honestly, Meta-Critic should just get rid of Critic reviews since their such **** these days.",0
314,Very rehashed plot. Almost identical to episode 4. Acting was uninspired. Light saber fights boring. Easily the worst Star Wars movie of the series. I truly hope that the franchise improves in parts 8 and 9. It would be a shame for Star Wars to end with this piece of dung.,0
315,"another jj total failure, he ruins star trek he ruin also star wars. Mediocre and lame movie. The characters seem  chosen random on the road, the bad guy looks like a sociopath with anger management issues and the whole story is a reboot of the first film: a robot must deliver something, the chars  defend the robot and blah blah blah. A copy and paste from episone 4 a total shame.",0
316,"This movie is a remake disguised as a sequel.  Bad guy in a mask, worse guy with a hood and and old wrinkly face, and a general with a British accent and a crisp uniform.  Good guy (girl) from a desert planet who dreams of exploring the galaxy.  The good guys and the bad guys are related to each other.  Death star type weapon that could destroy the universe, hastily planned assault by rebel pilots in orange jumpsuits. I challenge anyone reading this to give me a good one liner from this movie that comes close to anything that the emperor said to luke in return of the jedi.  Yes, the dialog in episodes 4-6 left something to be desired at times, but it was memorable.  I felt nothing watching this movie.  And I did not go into it expecting to hate it.",0
317,"Save your money, the memory, and your pants. This movie was so atrocious I just **** my pants in disbelief. I say this as a movie lover, as a Star Wars fan, and as someone who paid the price of admission. I’ve never posted a movie review before today but felt compelled as I simply cannot fathom how this movie is receiving the positive critic ratings it has and continues to receive. I suspect it helps when you have Disney’s pockets and media delivery machine. As a movie lover, the film had virtually no character development. You don’t care if the characters live or die because you know next to nothing about them. The relationships constructed between the characters over the course of the movie don’t feel real or believable. Oddly this applies equally to original trilogy characters as well as to new faces. The plot was propelled forward at ludicrous speed and by the occasional awkwardly-delivered explanation, dropped with the subtlety of a fat pink giraffe by one of the characters.  The audience was entitled to and denied a deeper understanding of characters and events in this movie as it comes as the first installment after the original trilogy.  In short you were left with an EPIC sense of… meh. On the upside, the CGI was beautifully done and the new robot was moderately endearing. The biggest failing for this film, despite it largely coming off as a remake of episode 4, was that it didn’t feel like Star Wars. It was a Frankenstein monster whose parts were sourced from other Star Wars movies (primarily A New Hope).  IT. HAD. NO. SOUL. With a universe as expansive as Star Wars and a franchise so beloved, you would think at least modest creative risks would be taken to further the story or to transport the audience to new and exotic worlds. Say what you will about episodes 1-3, but the worlds in those prequels at least felt immersive and novel.  While viewing TFA I actually heard the person seated next to me mutter, “I didn’t realize this was supposed to be a remake…”.  CHEERS TO THAT, BUDDY! If you haven’t seen the original Star Wars films you have a shot at enjoying this film, but as someone who loved the original three movies, even the subsequent prequels, I call BS as I **** my pants all over again in frustration. Spoiler alert: It pales in comparison to the dump Disney just took on the Star Wars franchise.",0
318,"To see this movie once is more than enough. It lacks both the originality of previous episodes and the carefree fun of the 2008 Clone Wars series. And some of the situations are simply not credible. ***SOME SPOILERS AHEAD*** Hm... We have captured an X-Wing pilot. He doesn't have the plans we are looking for anymore, because he hid them somewhere (and we know that for fact). We can see his X-Wing and there is no droid around. Where are the plans? Let's go and torture the pilot on our base, because leaving someone behind looking for the missing droid would require too much brain activity. We are on a Star Destroyer and steal a TIE. And we have almost no problem getting out except for a cable that ties the TIE to the wall? Seriously, why aren't there shields protecting the entrance to the hangar? Or anyone can fly in and out as they fancy? A stormtrooper is able to defend himself for several minutes against half-trained ex-Jedi in a lightsaber duel (OK, I know he lost in the end, but still). Why didn't the said ex-Jedi just use the Force and just snap his neck, slam him into a tree, or anything? I guess the Force is not so strong in this family, the intelligence most certainly isn't. And so on and so on. All in all, it's not a very good rehash of the previous movies with several flaws in logic.",0
319,"So, like many before me I did not believe the well-written and thoughtful negative reviews and I went to see the movie. I mean it is a 200 million JJ Abrams movie and I like JJ Abrams. How bad can it be? It turns out it can be pretty bad. And it is not JJs fault. JJ Abrams has strengths and he has weaknesses. His strengths are an ability to create intense, memorable, R-rated characters, full of flare and fun to watch. His main weakness is his willingness to sacrifice the strength of the plot for the bigger bang. So what happens when JJ Abrams meets Disney executives, the manufacturers of the wholesome family entertainment? The answer is you get all of the JJs weaknesses while he is obviously forbidden from using any of his strengths. You should never forget that Disney execs are the brain trust that hated Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow and only Depp's ""star power"" forced them to acquiesce. So what you get is an impossibly bland version of Star Wars universe, shot the same way all of Disney's TV movies for preschoolers are shot. The movie was carefully sanitized to extract any content that a 5-7 years old may find traumatic according to the most modern definitions of what a 5-7 years old finds traumatic (everything). Every scene of the movie you can see that the force grip executed by Darth Disney on JJ Abrams' throat was a powerful one and his leash was very short. Death, grief, fear, evil, romantic desire: all are removed or downplayed to the level of the core definition of ""wholesome family entertainment"". My wife who is not a Star Wars fan but likes action and sci-fi and simply takes every movie as a stand-alone story gave it 3/10. She said it was basically another Disney Channel movie she would watch on TV with our kid. For me, as a Star Wars fan this movie was a bitter disappointment. 0/10. The thing is it could be a substantially better movie even with the same script (very minor changes) and the same director and the same actors, if they were ever allowed to cross the boundaries of a de-facto PG rating. You can read other reviews for blow-by-blow details of what makes this movie so bad (those stories, they are all true), but at its core it is caused simply by Disney being Disney and JJ Abrams being only half of JJ Abrams - per Disney requirements.",0
322,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens sucks big time. Probably the worst SW movie made. It starts off very strongly they introduce great new characters like Rey, Poe, and BB8 pretty early on. Kylo Ren comes out of his ship, looks like a total badass - stops a blaster shot in mid-air. - At this point, I'm totally buying into the movie. Within the next 1/2 hour, I quickly got annoyed by the extremely **** writing and bad story-telling.- We are led to believe that the First Order is this neo-Nazi totalitarian equivalent, we see it right in the beginning by their ruthless killing of a seemingly innocent village. I thought that it is crappy writing, since I cannot empathize at all with the motives of the villains. It's J.J's crappy way of showing us who the ""bad"" guys are.- Then a bunch of ridiculous coincidences happen, Finn, BB-8 and Rey unite and form some kind of trio. More coincidences happen, and they meet up with Han Solo and Chewbacca. During this entire time, Rey can do absolutely no wrong, apparently she's a super genius who knows how to pilot, fix circuitry, fight with a light saber, she can use the Jedi Mind Trick - most on her first attempts ever, with no training. Remember that badass Sith Apprentice who stopped a blaster bolt in mid-air, well he had a light saber fight with a space janitor, who was able to somehow tag him on the shoulder. And then afterwards, got over powered by a girl who had not used a light saber in at least 10 years (we don't know if she was part of Luke's Jedi school). I'm all for strong female characters, but this movie was such ****And Captain Phasma sucks too, looks like Boba Fett but has no backbone. - She nicely represents the whole theme of the movie: Hype + Visuals; but actually sucks. This is completely leaving out the massive plot holes- The rebels won in Episode 6, Return of the Jedi - Why is the galactic setting the same as A New Hope?- How does the First Order (Who LOST in Episode 6) - build a super massive Death Star 3.0, where did they find the time and resources to build it? Nobody in the Republic knew it was being built?- How does Kylo Ren, son of Han Solo and Leia, nephew of Luke Skywalker, go to the dark side, and why  would a Sith Lord waste his time on this emotionally unstable person?- The light saber CHOSE Rey??? - What is this Harry Potter? I could go on - I'm giving it 2/10 The GreatPoe, BB-8The Good- Rey (acting skills), Han Solo and Chewie, Picture, Sound, Millennium FalconThe Bad- Finn, Rey (being too perfect), , Kylo Ren, Setting, R2-D2 inexplicably being inactive and having ""the map""The Awful- 3rd Death Star (very original), Luke's 10 seconds of screen time, Entire Plot (a really bad remake of A New Hope), C3P-O's red arm, Phasma, First Order, Kylo Ren's emotions.",0
323,"this is a god awful remake of a new hope with elements of emprie and jedi thrown together. Very disappointing movie. actually very boring to be honest maybe this would have made a good star trek film but this is probably the worst star wars and that includes 1,2 and 3. Also all the new characters suck",0
324,"If you have watched New Hope, don't bother with this one. Story is just a rehash, only worse in almost every regard. Villain is just a pathetic imitation of Vader. People were complaining about how Anakin's turning to the dark side looked... But it was still a masteriece compared to how terrible character of Kylo Ren is. Relations between characters are artificial and... damn, so much to say, but can't because of spoilers. Don't waste your money on this movie and just wait until it will be released on TV. In 2 years, or 10... doesn't really matter, you aren't loosing much.",0
325,"When you see 2000+ positive reviews for this film remember that the success of this movie is putting food on the table for 25,000+ people, and unfortunately taking food off of mine.  What a complete waste of time.  If disappointment was a four letter word it would be “Star,” and if refund was a four letter word it would be “Wars.”  It is difficult to know where to start a review when the movie itself didn’t know where to start.  The only thing that kept me awake in this film was the occasional cameo of an elderly star or ageless droid.  Warning: a teenage scavenger hunt has more plot than this movie.  It honestly feels like the Jets and Sharks, Crips and Bloods, and Hatfield and McCoy’s were locked in the writing room with a colorful pharma bowl in the center of the table.Most of the characters did the best they could with a canned and uninspiring script; however, Chewy and Droids will keep you amused with their deliveries.  The villains were a joke.  The Napoleonic Ginger (Hux) was a disgrace to gingers; in fact, Boris Becker wielding a tennis racquet would have been more menacing.  When Kylo Ren took off his mask I laughed out loud!  Then, I had a difficult time focusing on his lines because I was expecting him to wave a magic wand causing doves fly out of his hair.  Once again Rafael Nadal wielding a tennis racquet would have been more menacing.  With all due respect, I do see this as being a good film if you are 14 or under.  I taught 8th grade and for them I will raise the bar to 7 mainly because their internal reference library is much smaller and congested with similar swill.",0
326,"Terrible movie.  The first 30 minutes or so aren't that bad, but eventually, something stupid starts happening every 5 minutes!  And there is nothing original at all.  A pure recycle job for teenies who don't know any better.  The drop-off in ticket sales for the next one is going to be big.  0 / 10",0
327,"The movie tells the story of the resistance fight against the totalitarian First Order: space nazis. Unfortunately, the central plot, the battle to take out the nazi superweapon with a squadron of X-wing fighters, has been told before in two previous Star Wars movies, and so the story felt predictable. Daisy Ridley, playing a key character, often delivered her lines as if in theatre rehearsal, effusive and earnest, rather like Hermione Granger. This was an opportunity to use these fables to show is something new, but here was just repetition.",0
328,"I too felt a need to create a Metacritic account just to review this. I wish JJ Abrams didn't exist.  A lot of reviews rightly criticize him for ruining two sci-fi franchises in Star Trek and Star Wars, but let's not forget his hack friend Damon Lindelof also ruined the Alien franchise with the crappy writing in Prometheus. I can't fathom how critics rated this as highly as they did.  Kudos to Michael Hiltzik of the LA Times for having the stones to appropriately review this turd. Star Wars TFA critical flaw is that it suffers from writing I'd expect to find on a Disney Channel show for eleventeen year olds.  Others reviews have provided an overview of the enormous plot holes present in the script, so I'll focus only on the central Maguffin, the star map to Luke.  The main plot arc for the entire movie focuses on locating Luke, who, inconsistently with all his characterization in the preceding 3 films, has disappeared as soon as the going gets tough.  The search for Luke revolves around a portion of a star map, stored on the Star Wars equivalent of a USB drive.  However, later in the film during the battle around the Starkiller base, we repeatedly see the Resistance HQ getting real-time updates from the battle.  This establishes that faster-than-light transmission of information is possible even under the most extreme conditions.  Why then, did the Resistance bother making a map and committing it to their Star Wars USB when they could've just beamed the information directly back to rebel HQ?!?  In other words, instead of just sending an email, they decided they'd rather put the information on a USB and physically transport it across the entirety of a hostile galaxy.  Yeah, that's the central plot, and it would be a historical anachronism in present day Earth, let alone in a Star Wars movie. The film is set against a muddy backdrop, where the outcome of events of the first six episodes is unclear.  I kept expecting at least a cursory attempt at exposition at some point during the film, but apparently forgettable and pointless fifteen minute scenes fighting tentacle monsters were more deserving of screen time than a basic understanding of the setting. The characters were more often flat caricatures than believable people with understandable motivations.  The new characters were particularly bad: -Finn is the bumbling sidekick, whose only apparent purpose is to provide comic relief when not providing crucial details about the Starkiller base due to his vast experience in the custodial arts.  His conscientious objection to pointless killing is conveniently forgotten when it's time to gleefully cut down some storm troopers.  The failure to explore his de-conditioning as a storm trooper and to show his growth as a character is another of the many missed opportunities in the film. -Rey.  Exhaustively covered in other reviews, but she can do everything effortlessly and with no training, which dissolves any tension related to this character's place in the plot because we know beforehand that she will easily succeed at anything she tries. -Kylo Ren started as one of the more interesting characters with his struggles between the dark and light side of the force (although apparently no one told him that Vader wasn't a paragon of the dark side and redeemed himself before dying.  No big deal, only one of the most important developments of the preceding six films.)  The chance to explore his motivation in a stunning act of betrayal against the light side and his uncle Luke is wasted in favor portraying flat teen angst.  Kylo is reduced to a foil to show us how awesome Ren is. The older characters don't really belong and are shoehorned into the script wherever possible.  It seems like Harrison Ford really tried to give us Han Solo, but at some point realized what a disaster the script was going to be.  Princess Leia was a trainwreck.  C3PO's face moves more than Carrie Fisher's. I desperately wanted to like this movie, but it's clear that I'm no longer Disney's target audience.  This is bland, safe, filmmaking where every facet of the script was run through multiple focus groups to optimize Disney's return on investment.  The resulting product will no doubt give executives and Disney shareholders what they desire, at the expense of making anything resembling a good Star Wars film.",0
329,"Clearly Disney and Abrams had no idea whatsoever to do with this franchise, so they retreated back into the original films and did a remake instead.  Wow!  The result: a sad excuse of a so-called next episode.  It's not just that this film is so bad.  What does it say about future episodes?  If they have this much trouble coming up with a new idea already, what the heck are they going to do when they run out of original source material to plagiarize?",0
330,"This is the work of Disney rapeing the most awesome scifi franchise of all time. The movie is filled with childish jokes that result in absurd and ridiculous characters that were once epic. Some of them are so shallow-brained and replaceable it wouldn't stand out if they weren't there at all, even story wise. Considering the story it's like some 10 year olds were asked to write a remake of episode 4 just with cheaper actors. They disobey the lore of the classic movies and desperately try to get some connections, probably for the older audience. I think the decision to use some old faces was a generally a good idea but Carrie Fisher looks so wasted and pumped with Botox they shouldn't have used her. Daisy Ridley does her job quite well, but overall there's just a lack of legendary individuals like Christopher Lee, Alec Guinness etc. The evil characters seem flat and unauthentic. One could say a poor copy of once great villains.",0
331,"I almost rated 1 in respect to the crew of this movie. But then I realized even they have a responsibility to ensure an authentic product.Truly, dark times have descended. I fear for the souls of all true Star Wars fans.What sort of world is this when the prequels seem relevant & authentic verses this recent trash?SW had the opportunity of Gilgamesh, Zeus, Jesus or Arthur. But jj reduced it to Iron Man, Wolverine or some dumb **** What else can I say? Werner Herzog, please save Star Wars!",0
332,"So I just wanted to add a couple of comments about istarwars 7s. In my opinion this movie was the biggest pile of cinema garbage I have ever seen. I don't know why they feel the need to take something that was old and great and completely ruin it. I knew jj as*hat was going to ruin this from the gate, just like he had ruined star trek.. Here's a couple reasons why I hated istarwars 7s: 1. First off the fact that they took something that was so great and dumbed it down to the point that it was just meant for the masses of dumbas*es that don't want to have to think whilst watching a movie. They just want to see mindless explosions and don't care about proper story line might as well have been directed by Micheal freakin Bay.. EXPLOSIONS! MICHEAL BAY! MICHEAL BAY EXPLOSIONS! MICHEAL EXPLOSION BAY! EXPLOSION! EXPLOSION BAY!!. It did not feel like a star wars movie whatsoever. I really preferred the prequels to this steaming pile of dog **** Of course OT is the best! There was really no character development, No real story development, Nothing. Just one action scene to the next.. The only reason it did so good in theaters is because A people are dumb and B the nostalgia factor.. 2. It really was just a remake of a new hope with a couple of flashy new features, thus why I call it either istarwars 7s or ianewhope 7s. I mean come on.. A whole universe, you can create anything you can imagine, and you do another f*cking death star that was a huge thing, but wasn't actually a huge thing at all. It felt like the were just kind of like, oh yeah death star, we already know what to do with this, we'll just blow it up and get it out of the way real quick so we can get back to finding Luke because for some reason that's much more important then the however many planets just got blown up.. You know we just lost all of our structured government but Luke will make it all better.. 3. Finn is only in it so it can be politically correct and so Disney does not have to worry about pissing off certain groups of people despite being one of the worst characters ever.. 4. The awkward forced ""funny"" moments that weren't really funny... at all.... 5. The soundtrack was garbage. The soundtrack has been amazing and original for every previous movie but definitely not this one.. 6. The awkward forced romance between the Finn an Rey. 7. There was way too many convenient situations or coincidences:A. The millenium falcon just so happened to be on jakku in perfect condition with the hatches open ready to fly when they needed to make a quick escape.B. Rey mastered flying the millenium falcon within minutes of flying it.C. Rey knew how to fix the falcon even with all of hans ""special modifications""D. Han and chewy just so happened to be right next to jakku for no reason what so ever to pick up the Rey and Finn.E. If the empirenazis know the location of the rebel base why didn't they blow that up first?F. Walking through empire bases like you f*cking own the place? Remember what it was like for Luke and the gang to make it out of the OG deathstar?G. Finding Rey so easily in a planet size military base. 8. I feel like it was just mindless action and nothing was explained. FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THEY WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN THE NEXT MOVIES: So the next couple movies are going to be drawn out prequels to this one? Like Reys past jedi training and how she got her memories erased and dropped off by her father Luke on jakku for her own protection from supreme leader voldemort I mean snoke. Like the Finns back story. Like what luke has been up to since going in to hiding. Like how they managed to build death star ver 3.2. Like what happened to the rebellion and empire after ROTJ. Like supreme leader voldemorts i mean snoke back story. Like that guy with the masks back story. Like who that yellow yoda was and why it had lukes lightsaber. 9. I just feel like the writers were being lazy, took too many shortcuts, and should have done a better job explaining things. The whole movie felt really rushed as well like they tried to fit in as many things as possible in the shortest amount of time. 10. The villians... Seriously. These are the bad guys? They made kylo seem like such a bad a*s, but in reality he's just a whiny little b*tch with no skills. He should have either kept the mask on the whole time or not worn one at all! Plus there is really no point in him wearing a mask in the first place.. And I know it's going to end up being another struggle for good and evil with him. You could see the conflict in him whilst talking to han. He'll probably end up turning good at the last minute and saving everyone from supreme leader voldemort. I mean.. well f*ck it.. and his stupid **** pointless lightsaber? Seriously? There was absolutely no point having that cross lightsaber. Not to mention the cross guard would be easily cut through if hit in the right spot... Also WTF?? Him and the knights of ren can destroy all of lukes students, jedi school, and defeat luke. But yet in this movie he's a p*ssy b*tch? Can't even defeat two people that have never yielded a sword? 11. Supreme leader voldemort? Seriously? That's all you could come up with? And what's up with the empire? When did they turn into nazis? I mean come one. War rallies? Big red banners with their symbol? They even do the nazi salute? 12. So the first time picking up a light saber and you can match someone thats been using a lightsaber for probably years. I understand rey used a staff and probably was trained by her father luke when she was young but that just makes it ok to say that she can just become an instant master with a sword? A staff is nothing like fighting with a sword.. and the Finn should have never been able to keep up anywhere near as close to the guy with the mask.. Have you ever tried to use a sword? It's no easy task i can tell you that much. Don't believe me? Try and go up against a guy that's been using a sword for at least a couple years when you have no experience. I bet you won't last thirty seconds. And the guy with the mask being injured is no excuse. I mean come on. He could have just forced choked them both or force pushed them into another tree.. And the Finn should have never been able to land a hit on him.. 13. The ending? Again seriously? You're just going to stand there and stare at each other for ten awkward minutes whilst the camera goes back and forth? I felt like it was a family guy joke. Almost thought I was watching blue harvest.. 14. BB8 was stupid... 15. The scene on hans freighter with the monsters was completely unnecessary.. The computer graphics were terrible. Not to mention it was hard seeing old han trying to act.. He's just too old.. They really should have used that time for maybe some character development? 16. Rey was too perfect. She's just a master at everything? She's a bad ass fighter, can use a lightsaber like a master, can fly anything, can fix anything, and an instant master force user? 17. Where's the truly iconic characters? Think about how much of a huge impression iconic characters in the past made. Like darth, his mask, his voice, his breathing, his talking, these are things that made him truly unique. people were talking about him for years after that movie. Or the the princess in ROTJ wearing that bikini and her goofy hairstyles. Again all things that were original and truly unique. None of these characters have anything unique or iconic going on. These are not characters that will be remembered and talked about for years and years.. 18. The director of a star trek movie should never ever direct a star wars movie! 19. Why did the yellow yoda character have anikans pod racing flag and boba fetts mandelorian symbol flag outside of her casino bar thing?",0
333,"This film was an insult to the Star Wars franchise. Atm I'm feeling like it is the worst movie of the whole saga, even worse than Episode 1 which I already rate quite low. The simple but devastating reason for this is that the movie did not expand the lore at all but copied almost everything from Episode 4 and mixed it with stupid diversity crap. The stuff that was made different from the originals almost always ends in senseless luck moments. - Coincidences are the driving force of the plot, which is just a joke. It doesn't immerse you, it doesn't feel like Star Wars. For me this isn't Star Wars or canon. Anyone who rates this higher than Episode 3 is no true Star Wars fan.",0
334,"A totally predictable and boring reboot of Star Wars IV. The death was unnecessary, and even though the first part and the characters were okay, the argument/ script was really awful and full of nonsense and absurdities. I think Disney paid a LOT of money to all these ""specialized critics"" websites, to change people's minds to make them think they liked the movie, when it was a boring and dull **** Even some of the prequels were better than this movie.",0
335,"What a disaster. It doesn't take a half-brained horse to see the obvious flaws this movie has. Everyone talks about episode 1 and 2 being the worst, but they look like masterpieces compared to this junk. At least the first 2 episodes had creative and original ideas, unlike this travesty. Disney has stolen a huge cultural moment from me because they created such a plot-hole ridden story, that takes leaps in logic to tell a tasteless, classless rip-off of episode 4. George Lucas looks like Charlie Chaplin after this one. Thank you Disney and critically ashamed director J.J. **** for stealing 12 dollars, 2 hours, and earning my disrespect for this embarrassment and abomination in film.",0
336,"It is very interesting how this film has polarized the audience. My 0 score includes a deduction for spending an obscene $300 million and yet blowing the basics. After viewing the film, I was lukewarm, yet had to meter my opinion since so many have invested so much in wanting to love this film -- yet I have grown colder and colder towards it. First, I must admit, I entered the theater with both great hope and trepidation. I have seen how JJ Abrams productions fall flat when it really comes time to give the stories meat. Great on hype, build-up, action execution -- and then, nothing really interesting inside the magic box. I was so ready to give it a break. But from the very beginning the movie just left me cold. Starting with the flickering lights inside the storm trooper transport, to the first awful wooden and nonsensical lines uttered, the perfect timing of events and seamless takes, the forced action, blood-stained finger swipes on Finn's helmet (the simple hand-acting of which seemed itself awkward and forced), the jump-to-the-ending exhortations of Max von Sydow to Kylo Ren, er soon to be revealed as Ben Solo,  the misplaced comedic lines of Poe to Kylo Ren -- it felt like the film was off by a beat (and not in an offbeat way), yet was assaulting me with pew-pew laser blasts and awesome deep-throated evil-voices which meant I ought to be engrossed and having a good time.  I was still giving it a chance in those first 5 minute, even though I'm old enough to know that bad situations rarely get better all on their own. On the days following, my son and I ""cleansed"" by watching A New Hope -- one time the new enhanced, HD, and the next day by chance an old vhs of the original. And wow,  it was indeed a delicious treat, every scene just bursting with originality, even on the nth viewing (and I rarely watch movies even a second time.) The Force Awakens, now reviewing the first scenes a second time (albeit not at the theater), is just hard to watch. I just got to the Rey scavenging scene, and the over-dramatization of picking parts out of an abandoned battleship (or whatever), with her wearing full face-covering and darkened goggles inside the dark hulk only to remove them when out in the blasting sun, and having drunk down to the last few drops of water when she should be a seasoned pro, is just more awkward rubbing-the-wrong-way, just-for-dramatic-effect, just-because-we-think-someone-will-find-this-cool immature film making. And I love unbelievable fantasy! But, please, it is the accumulation of all these bad moments, and I really could go on, that kept pulling me out of the the story with a flashing ""wtf"" floating across my retina which I tried to will myself to forget, but could not, and ultimately finishing with a dizzying helicopter shot of Rey and Luke just moments after the ""big reveal"" which itself was the ultimate tease of the film, just seconds before the end ... well, ""wtf"" and ""that was it?"" was not far from my lips as the credits began to roll.",0
337,"I thought Star Wars - The Force Awakens was terrible. They ruined the star wars franchise. Actors and acting was just atrocious. Story and plot was boring and not believable at all. I really don't like how it took Luke Skywalker three movies (including training by Yoda) before he could use/handle the force and defeat Darth Vader, but it takes this girl 14 seconds (with no training) to figure out and master all the nuances of the force and defeat the dark side/Kylo Ren. She went from scavenger/nobody to the ultimate jedi warrior in 14 seconds with no training. Just ridiculous and stupid. She is not believable as a hero/jedi saving the galaxy and Kylo Ren is not believable as the bad guy (new Darth Vader) - he's a wuss. I'm surprised they did not have him break down and cry and surrender to the girl. Terrible job as a villain. I won't bother going to see any more Star Wars movies now that Disney is doing them.",0
339,"SUPER DISAPPOINTING! Full of repeat story lines: father/son situation again, death star again, repeated trench run, novices defeating highly trained dark lords, same x-wing planes? Seriously? A few new characters, that's all. I love the star wars franchise and was thoroughly unsatisfied. I hope Lucas gets heated and takes over creative control from Disney. That's all.",0
340,"TL;DNR This movie reminded me of Jurassic World in all the wrong ways. It was filled with constant references to an older movie (ANH), had a similar plot to said movie, was trying to be bigger and better than what it was referencing, and had a nauseating amount nostalgia porn from the movie it was trying to outdo. If you liked Jurassic World, you may enjoy Episode VII, but I warn you, it doesn't even have anything original like a dinosaur battle at the end. **Spoilers**Longer Review I don't know where to begin with this movie. My biggest gripe with it is just how unoriginal the entire movie is! I felt like I had seen all of this before. And I had in the original trilogy (and maybe the video game Force Unleashed). It was like someone was taking the general plot of A New Hope and rushing through all the build up so that they could have a huge action sequence. The movie rarely lets us breathe and take in the world the characters live in (Rey's opening sequence is about the only exception I can think of). One of the most annoying examples of this was Finn's life. He was a storm trooper who, after one battle, decides to go rogue and help the Resistance. Yeah, I rolled my eyes when he explained why he wanted to help the Resistance, but that wasn't what really pissed me off. It was the fact that as soon as he was away from the First Order, he shows no signs of indoctrination or unfamiliarity with the outside world, especially since he makes a point of saying all storm troopers are kidnapped as children. Despite having lived with these people and knowing they are the same as him, he has no trouble killing them. But he doesn't want to kill the Resistance, whom he has no connection to. There is no moral dilemma for him. They don't explore his journey at all. He just turns from ""bad to good."" That's it. And then they make him into the butt of everyone's jokes. It was around the time he meets up with Rey that I realized the point of his character was to make everyone else (or at least Rey) look good. Seriously, he is the incompetent one in the movie who's flaws all the other characters are very quick to point out. There is no character like this in the Original Trilogy. They treat him as a buffoon much like Jar Jar Abra- I mean Binks. Now, how to talk about Rey...? Mad Max had strong female characters. Rey is not a strong female character, because she isn't a character. She's a Mary-Sue who is perfect at everything. As a protagonist she might work in a video game, if only because the audience would feel like her achievements were the result of them playing the game; the results of their hard work. But that isn't case. Her successes feel unearned, even compared to Luke's. It wasn't until the third movie that he could stand up to Vader, yet Rey overpowers Kylo Ren (read: Darth Vader) with zero training. Where is the struggle when there are no failures? Which brings us to our villain, Kylo Ren. He had a pretty cool opening sequence in which he shows off his mastery of the Force in a very impressive way. He came across as a bad ass. But as the movie rolls on, they don't give him a good motivation nor characterization to explain his disposition. He acts like an angry teen like Anakin in the prequels. Specifically Anakin from Revenge of the Sith. And then he gets stomped by a first time lightsaber user.... Yes, he is clearly the new Vader. *eye roll* And all of this leads to the ultimate point: that they wanted to shove their under developed characters into the plot of A New Hope with no characterization nor coherency. They don't care about logic, all they are trying to do is squeeze happy nostalgia feelings from the audience by pulling off the same scenes from previous movies. They tried to pass it off as a coherent movie by appealing to nostalgia or by making elements bigger (ie: Starkiller Base is a bigger Death Star and the movie lets you know this by showing you a visual comparison). Like people should accept this convoluted doppelganger of A New Hope simply because it reminds them of it. This movie is lazy and pandering.",0
341,"TL;DR This is a 'meh"" movie which does not deserve the scores it is receiving. The Resistance! Thank god you've come! Glad to see the scores dropping to somewhat realistic levels. If you like nonsensical coincidence driven plots, illogical yet bland crowd pleasing story , a complete lack of context for any events or characters, an avalanche of nonstop soulless references and... ""jokes"", total disrespect for source lore, obvious plot devices that slap you in the face with their obviousness so hard that they are obvious and dare I say it, tropes... Then you will love this movie. There's really nothing more I can say about this nostalgia-fest of a film that hasn't been said already, but I felt like I had to do my part in combating the undeserved, ludicrous, and insane scores of  10's and 9's this movie is receiving. In fact, as a life long lurker, this is the first review I've ever done of anything, but the injustice of a ""meh at best"" movie receiving critical acclaim simply because its Star Wars and Abrams directed forced me to join this discussion. Don't let hype and nostalgia blind you, tell the truth. List of criticisms begins, quickly becomes a bit ranty; NO who, what, when, where, why, or how about anything at all. It's a general comment. 20% dialogue / 80% boom boom and flashbacks and zoomed in faces going ""gngh!"". No background information about the state of the galaxy, political climate, the Order, the New Republic,the main characters, or anything else. Coincidences! R2 turns on, why? Millennium Falcon is right there, ready for escape, why? Luke's Lightsaber, why? Fin crashes right next to Rey's hometown from orbit, how? There's more but point made. Rey is the most magically great at everything, better than boyz, ""#badassgirl"" I have ever seen. Offensive to anyone who doesn't like to be blatantly pandered to. Her nonsensical mastery of force techniquesdevalues what and how the Force functions and the extreme dedication and effort required to be a Jedi.We all deserve female characters who resemble reality instead of a pandering strawman. Finn has a complete 180 character reversal because nonsense. Symptom of a bad movie. Boy band villain is the most groan worthy dark jedi imaginable. His tantrums are not evil or ""scary"" as themovie tried to bash you over the head with... just petulant. Boring, weak, emasculated, bleh. Five planets were destroyed, trillions of people were killed, and it was barely referenced. The entire scene in which that happens runs five minutes then immediately become another action scene. Also...who, what, where, when, how! Snoke is a stupid name, why does he choose do use a giant hologram (cause its so cwl) and why did he send his ""untrained"" apprentice to do all this if he is so useless! How did the Order get the resources to build star killer base? The Empire could build the Death Star because they had the resources of an entire galaxy at their disposal! How did a terrorist organization notonly match that feat but surpass it five times over? The Han spoiler was so obvious from so far that it lost all its emotional gravity. Phasma did nothing. Don't tell me ""Well, Boba Fett also did nothing at first!"". True, that's why they didn't put him on the poster. There's more of course but.... In closing, this movie was insulting to anyone with a brain. Lucas was accused of writing the prequel films for children. I make the same accusation against Abrams, except he was writing for the masses. The only great thing this movie will do for the franchise is pump money into Expanded Universe games and books, which is where the magic has always lived anyways. Let's just hope that Disney embraces that fact instead of truly killing the source of Star Wars fandom... (loljkwerdoomedxxx)",0
342,"I have a groundbreaking idea for a new Lord of the Rings movie: I will call it The Ring Awakens and it will follow the exact plot of the Fellowship of the Ring, but I'll make Frodo a girl so no one will notice that I'm too lazy or afraid to come up with an original idea.",0
343,"Basically just a rehash of new hope and nothing about the movie drew me in. I didn't care for any of the characters, the dialog was dull and boring , the pacing was just awkward and the villain was just dumbOverall I was pretty disappointed with this movie.",0

345,"This may have been the greatest movie disappointment of my life.  As a fan of Star Wars and a fan of just good movies, I was expecting a great film based on the kind of reaction that this film was getting.  Instead, I couldn't wait for the film to be over it was so bad.  There was no imagination shown on the part of this creative team whatsoever.  It was all just a collection of scenes copied from previous Star Wars films with just enough difference to allow them to pretend it was something new.  That's bad enough, but even if one was blind to the fact that it was just a cut & paste of other films, the overall quality was awful.  Repeatedly, I was thinking to myself, ""Why would that happen?  Why would they do that?  That was just stupid.""  The only question for me is, will I even bother with the next episode.  My strong leaning right now is, no, and if a first film turns me off that much from even considering the second, it is a complete failure:  0/10.",0
346,"This movie is the best thing that could ever happen for George Lucas' legacy. It was so bad that Lucas looks like a prodigal genius in comparison. This movie makes the Phantom Menace look like Empire Strikes Back. It makes Jar Jar Binks look like Darth Vader. In short, Abrams has single-handedly destroyed Star Wars. After 40 years of Lucas brilliance, Star Wars has just been dealt the fatal death blow. I would rather watch Chewbacca and Kylo Ren tongue kiss for 120 minutes than watch this steaming pile of space doo a second time.",0
347,"This is not Star Wars. First, I am not Hard Core Star Wars fan.Never read any of the star wars books etc.My family loved all six Star Wars movies, fun for entire family. Three generations of my family watched this new movie. No one liked it. Why? I will try to write the main reasons:1. Plot is hollow - bad copy/paste job from Ep IV through VI.The main goal is “Find Luke Skywalker” - why, never explained. When they find him - all is over - Bad guys are defeated, their Super Death Star destroyed and their army with it.2. Scenes are poorly stitched together - too many coincidences.3. Another Death Star - this time unbelievable. How close to the sun this planet must be to harvest its energy? It is attached to the sun and has atmosphere, forest, snow? Everything should be scorched within seconds. How dumb we should be? Is it a starship-planet or it is built in republic system under their noses to destroy entire republic. Is the Republic only in one star system now?4. Republic is destroyed by the Super Death Star and Super Death Star with a huge Bad army is destroyed by the Republic. What is left?5. Characters:- Good old Han Solo - 70 years old smuggler? Was he not a general and hero in Ep VI? HE WAS KILLED BY HIS OWN SON - who is pathetic bad ass little worm. The worst death of a hero I have ever seen. Sorry, he is not hero in this movie, he is only very insignificant character.- Princess Leia, why is she here - another very insignificant character. Her part is very small and pale... Zero emotions between her and Solo in the scene where they talk about their son. Very strange, sorry I forgot, C3PO is to be blamed for that.- Stormtrooper Phil - why is he in this movie? The answer is simple - they wanted a black man with a light saber. They made him look like a cowardly moron. He loses every fight in this movie. First Ray punched him in the face, BB8 shot him in the leg, then his fellow stormtrooper discards a blaster to fight him with some silly weapon and he would have killed him if not..., and finally he is again fighting with light saber against pathetic sith moron (sorry, moron is not correct word - that would mean two morons, I must think of a better word) - he loses again. What a character.- Bad Guy with some new and scary powers at the beginning - turned out to be a puddy cat. And I called him a moron, sorry again, I really must think of a better word.- Ray, cute and very shiny - we could have loved her if she was presented more human and less superhuman, sorry wrong word again - supergirl. She is there alone in all her glory, strong independent woman, surrounded by weak, incompetent, moronic (I must stop to use this word) men. Who needs men anyway? Someone else said, she is instant Jedi, knows everything and can learn anything in seconds, really impressive. She eats Sith Lords for breakfast. All characters in this movie are there just to support her greatness. 5. Some power behind this movie really hates men. And, with a very good reason:Han Solo abandoned his wife and his son - he is a criminal, it is to be expected.Luke Skywalker abandoned everyone and everything, including his child or children. Entire planets have been destroyed, millions died and he just doesn’t care. Not even for his own blood. How cruel and selfish - even Jar Jar would have said “how rude”.Supreme leader Snooky, Snoopy, sorry his name is hard to remember, really evil man, kills everyone who stand in his way.Big Bad Sith (Black) Puddy Cat, he is evil, what can be expected from the son of a criminal. Well, he is evil in a good way, poor, poor boy. He has more good in him the 3 evil men from above (Han, Luke and Snoopy). He just can’t see it. Well, he is not actually bad, he just looks like a frightened school girl and that is his quality. I give this only one star because it has Star Wars in its title - that is a lie. Without that, it would be 5 or 6 stars. To all of you who write 10 stars reviews and call us, disappointed people, haters.There is nothing to hate - just disappointment. Why are you so upset about negative reviews, when there are 100.000 of you and only a handful of us? I am not upset with your 10 stars with very short reviews.And please when you write review and give 10 stars, please explain why (in details) this movie deserves 10 starts in more then two sentences if you can. To all of you out there, I say, go and see for yourself. Some people may love, others may hate, only you can judge for yourself.",0
348,"Everyone here said all I think about the plot, but there are more things done badly. Like Finn. He represents a lot of what's wrong with this movie. Spoilers below. Finn looks like a character from Guardians of the Galaxy, joking all the time, breaking the tension that never was there to begin with.He doesn't bring us the point of view of a real stormtrooper. He simply doesn't carry the weight of being an ex-soldier haunted by the terrible things he said he saw. So, what did he see? The first mission in which he participated was that from the beginning. This rookie, who worked in sanitation and couldn't even pilot a TIE fighter was participating in a mission to recover secret information about the last Jedi.At first he seemed to care about the comrade who died in front of him... But no, he was just a coward. He had absolutely no problem with killing his former colleagues later. Being an ex-stormtrooper doesn't add anything to his development. And what a wasted opportunity of making a better rivalry with Phasma. He was also joking too much for someone who spent his entire life under severe discipline and didn't even had a name moments before.There were other guys trying to be funny in this movie already, Poe and Han (even Kylo Ren with his tantrums and funny face). They could have made Finn more interesting, but no. It's not enough to have BB-8 as comic relief. What is his role in this story then? He isn't a real ex-villain. He isn't a pilot. He isn't a jedi, he wasn't fighting for what is right, nor for money or for his dreams..... just being reckless for a girl he barely knew.... Wait... That's it! His only purpose in this movie (and maybe in the entire new trilogy) is being Rey's romantic interest and making her look better by being her useless protector. We can't even ignore him because he is one of the main characters. We are supposed to adore him for how charismatic he is.",0
349,"I feel that this movie is just a derivative remake of Episode 4: A new hope. This might be forgivable, but It is filled with absurd coincidences throughout the movie just to drive the plot forward. Granted you can say that the force is the driving force behind these coincidences, but the movie relies far too heavily on them. It is such a problem that it removes much of the beliveability from the movie. This then resulted in myself feeling particularly removed and uninterested in any of the actions of the characters, which then in turn resulted in a rather boring movie going experience.",0

JJ Abrams and co. erred toward attracting a more general audience than the hardcore fanbase, and was absolutely successful in that respect.

THE STORY. THE CHARACTERS. THE CREATIVITY. THE SENSE OF SCALE. THE SENSE OF DESTINY. THE **** HEART!!! It's all gone. Please don't watch this movie. Lucas should have sold the rights to David Lynch or someone with a single creative bone in their body. Peace",0
364,"Disney has just succeeded so perfectly at lowering your standards to the point that you feel as though you got lucky to even get a movie that is a nostalgic copy of the movies you used to love. Sure, the practical effects are there, but the reliance on fan service and nostalgia doesn't make up for a terrible script and phoned in performances by Ford and Fisher. JJ does what JJ does best and ruins another franchise with his derivative shtick. It may have the anatomy of A New Hope (because they cloned it), but has none of the soul of the franchise. All the Disney panderers and shills out there may call the cat a fish as much as they want, but only now, at the end, do they realize that the cat will drown nonetheless. The Mary Sue lead, the 1138 coincidences and the terrible pacing will not stand the test of time, and the entire hypnotic hype will come crashing down as people realize the awful truth-- even the horrible prequels had more of a Star Wars feel than this institutional humiliation.",0

I don't think Star Wars 4-6 were the greatest movies of all time either.  I know the story line, and I like it, but I'm not emotionally invested in the franchise.  I just literally wanted to see a movie with an interesting story line, and was willing to accept substandard acting and cringe worthy humor.  Well, I got 2 out of the 3. I know you can't talk about JJ Abrams without mentioning the Star Trek reboots.  I liked those movies.  They were over the top with action and explosions, but actually had reasonably interesting story lines.  I liked the old Star Trek movies as well.  They are both good story lines and told in very different styles. Won't be watching episode 8, if they ever make it.  The story line of 7 is so bad, I can't possibly imagine how the franchise will be saved without a do-over. Even for the psychopaths that don't mind being mislead and lied to, there's no chance this movie is a perfect 10 out of 10.  10/10 means it's one of the greatest movies of all time.

Speaking of sanitation, how does a janitor know where the most vulnerable part of the planet was located?3.	It was dumb for the Death Star to have a single point of destruction and yet not be completely protected with like a million turrets. But that was made 30 years ago and I didn’t care because my expectations back then were very different than what they are today. It’s a complete failure of the story that many years have passed since the Death Star and they continue to make the same mistake! What a joke.4.	Now that I’ve barely scratched the surface of sword fighting through training, I can tell you that anyone who goes up against a trained swordsman will not last more than a few swings let alone a few minutes. The black guy and the girl should have been cut into pieces way before she discovered the force within. Anyway, I did enjoy the movie overall because of two main factors: 1.

You thought that RN was a good character? Or a good actor for that matter? All that panting and sweating for the first 10 minutes of the movie. Zero chemistry between the 2 main leads????Please.This movie is a disgrace.",0
374,"An amateurish cash grab attempt which works well due to the franchised fan base, i honestly don't know where to begin. The Antagonist just came across as a termpermental emo with parental issues, i am absolutely stunned at the casting of him. Although the screenplay definitely did not help.Starkiller base........ LOL Zero character development meant you had little empathy for the good guys, a fundamental need in filmaking. I just didn't care who was doing what half an hour in.The script could've been put together by a fan, it was that bad. Plenty of toys to be bought i guess,to rekindle some of that 40bn.5 for the movie -3 because it's star wars and nearly a total excercise in plagiarism by Abrams. So disappoint",0
375,"I am sorry, this is a TERRIBLE movie! First, a complete rehash of the first one. Second, plot makes NO sense. Third, writing is sloppy, pointless, weak and riddled with errors. Fourth, yes, the CGI is cool, but you just don't care about the characters to matter. Fifth, a SCOTTISH accent from one of the bad guys! The FIrst Order?! It's just SAD that they had all this talent, money and made such a poor movie. I was very disappointed.",0
376,"HILARIOUS! My friends and I laughed our way through it with Episode IV muted on a different screen. It's a masterful comedy... the moments that synced up perfectly were just amazing! Both masked bad guys throw a Force tantrum on their subordinates at the same time, both X-Wing trench runs start at the same time, Han and Leia meet at the same time, the Millennium Falcon jumps to hyperspace at the same time... the list goes on! It's almost a shot-for-shot gender-swap parody, and I highly recommend that everyone watches it this way! /sarcasm",0
377,"So. Let it be known that I was Princess Leia for 6 Halloweens in a row as a child. I played the scene where Leia and Luke swing to safety on my Tarzan swing with my neighbor Kevin 100's of times. When it snowed, we were on Hoth. When it was summer, we were in Yoda's swamp. Last night, I was so excited. I thought, 'This is gonna be GREAT!!' So thrilled, what a fun way to spend Christmas Eve. Now, all I want for Christmas is my memories back. This reboot (redo? Rework?) was god, I don't know. It wasn't funny. It wasn't awesome. It wasn't new. It wasn't a continuation of the story. It wasn't fresh. It wasn't great. Worse yet, it wasn't Star Wars. It. Was. Lame. And I am sad.",0
378,"TFA had almost no plot and childish enemies. It was not a true sequel to ROTJ because it had no backstory or setting whatsoever to tie the movies together, much less provide much of a setting with explanations for this movie itself. It really seemed like an implausible Marvel snoozefest with no internal consistency or logic. The camera worked sometimes but other times was very unflattering with strange soap opera angles and unbelievably awkward closeups. FWIW, I didnt mind Rey, Finn, or even Kylo Ren, but the movie can't break a ""1"". Waited 20 years for this, shouldnt be too hard to write even a generic plot with some minimal backstory. One good thing: I finally was able to appreciate and enjoy the prequels.",0
379,"Wow, what a pile of complete crap, the Star Wars franchise is officially dead. First off, very few things in the movie make sense.  In particular, the last so called Jedi fight scene is a complete farce and completely destroyed any hope of me seeing future movies in this reboot of the series.  Apparently, even total Jedi noobs can harness the full power of the Force without any training what so ever.  Pretty sad. Also, many events are completely implausible.  The original movies were totally out of this world but at least they maintained some sense of reality.  Not the case in this movie, the director decided to just make stuff up without any reason behind it. Finally, the movie lacks any heart at all.  As stated by many here, the prequels were terrible, but at least they had heart.  This movie completely fails to capture that aspect of previous Star Wars movies and by the end of it, you don't even care about any of the new characters because of it. No idea why there are so many good reviews for this movie, but my advice is to wait for it on BR/DVD or Netflix if you can.  If you are a true Star Wars fan, this movie is a total waste of money to watch in the theaters and you will be disappointed.  I gave it a 2 because I thought it did start out good and the final scene did redeem it a bit, but it still was not enough to save this garbage excuse of a movie.",0
380,"Yes, I know that many out there will never give Lucas a break after Attack of the Clones, but after this debacle, let me just say it:  ""Man I wish George Lucas was here!""  No, he wasn't the movie maker he was back in the 70s and 80s, but at least he had a vision.  George was a story-teller with a vast understanding of mythology and politics.  Abrams is just a mere movie-maker.  He's no visionary.  In fact, the only vision that anyone at Disney had with this film was dollar signs.  The classic films are actually about something big, the struggle between good and evil both out there in the world and within our own souls.  This film is just a smattering of random scenes from previous films thrown together to make a buck.  There is nothing big going on.  It's just a shallow money grab.  Yeah, episodes I and II were really bad movies, but, man, I would give anything to have a visionary like Lucas back at the helm now.",0
381,"This was nothing but a high-budget fan fiction. I had a completely open mind, and during the first half-hour I actually really enjoyed it.  And then in true J.J. Abrams fashion, it became apparent that there really was no point, and that it was being made up as they went.  The prequels had a long list of flaws, but they at least had heart, whereas this one is a soulless counterfeit. The viewers who are rating this 10/10 will say that critical reviewers are just looking for something to be upset about.  Not true.  It’s completely reasonable to be disappointed by such a slap-dash, string of stitched-together nonsense presented as a coherent story. I guess for some fans, no dramatic tension or pacing is needed – just neat ships and fun action – like when playing action figures or video games.  And all this talk of “nostalgia…”  The original Star Wars wasn’t good because of “nostalgia.”  So while some viewers enjoyed the jokes and the self-parodying, force-fed references to other Star Wars movies, what makes a movie work is and always will be competent storytelling. The problem is that Disney has heard loud and clear that playing to the lowest common denominator sells tickets, so they have no reason not to continue to do so.",0
382,"It's sad all these movie reviews came back to this move and gave it 8,7,and 10's. Money talks I guess, this movie was Terrible. From start to finish , this Star Wars movie was a carbon copy of the Star Wars A New Hope movie , with just a few characters switched around . Rey became Wonder Woman within the last 30 minutes of this movie , while a beloved character of the Star Wars franchise was offed by a villain wearing mask and didn't need one at all. This movie was a insult to the Star Wars fanbase. I guess in the next Star Wars movie - The World Order Strikes Back, Fin will be frozen in carbonite and Rey will train Luke Skywalker on using the force .",0
383,"My wife and I viewed the movie separately, and both came home really disappointed. Looking at the reviews, it is interesting that although most reviews were positive and the movie has a 4.5 star rating, the ""most helpful"" list contains almost exclusively bad reviews - a demonstration of the hype associated with this movie. Rehashed Episode 4 indeed, and I am an avid Star Wars fan. My complaints are basically in two areas: 1. Totally uncompelling characters. I had trouble even remembering the names of the people, Finn being the only one that stuck. The Darth Vader-wannabe was a truly pathetic villain, indeed he looks like a kid that would be beat up in high school, and whines like one that would have his head stuffed in a toilet. Even Han and Leia just came across as old and tired. Remember Grand Moff Tarkin from 30 years ago - tall, gaunt figure with skull-like face and excellent villain voice? Remember any of the Imperial commanders in this movie from 30 minutes ago? 2. Lack of continuity with Return of the Jedi, forget the EU. ROTJ ended with the Rebellion victorious, Han and Leia ready to be married, Luke Skywalker in his prime as a Jedi. Now TFA comes along, Han has lost the Falcon for some time (he'd rather die first), he and Leia have had a force-powerful child (Leia I suppose) and have broken up, the Republic pretty much defeated by an Imperial remnant, and Luke Skywalker wandered off due to disappointment. Killing off a major character (Solo) in a series is also generally considered a continuity problem in literature. In a way it's a good thing that the villain was such a dweeb - it would be hard to explain Darth Vader being defeated by a couple of total noobs. There are numerous other problems, like that planet weapon would never have fired again anyway because there was no sun left to draw on, and people crossing large distances in a short time on foot. On the plus side, X-Wings are still cool. Star Destroyers are still cool. TIE fighters are still cool, although with all the complex systems shown at the beginning, I think they lost the original idea of TIE fighters being quick and cheap to produce. I dreaded what Disney would do to this movie from the day I heard they were doing it, and was horrified that the Extended Universe was going to be dropped. Every real Star Wars fan know the name of the real Episode 7 - ""Heir to the Empire"". The only good thing about Thrawn being left out of this movie is that Abrams didn't screw up Thrawn the way he screwed up Khan.",0
384,"This movie just makes me feel sad and confused and betrayed.  Disney was entrusted with something beautiful and valuable and beloved and they RUINED it!!  Why?- with literally unlimited resources of money and talent at their disposal did Disney create THIS?  I think George Lucas is looking pretty good right about now, for all his flaws at least he had a vision and created a work of art that millions of people fell in love with and that stands the test of time.  Now all that is squandered.... I fear forever. I predict that everyone who took part in this will regret it big time.  This might even be a career killer for some. It's a shame that the actors must bear the brunt of the backlash.  They did the best they could with what they were given. The blame should be placed where it belongs...on the Disney Evil Empire!!  They should stick with making cartoons, it's what they do best, entertaining children under the age of 10.",0
385,As an affectionate tribute to the first released Star Wars this is adequate. The storyline has been tweaked here there but with all the same characters and a couple of new tributes who are based on the old char. As a new movie though it is depressingly lacking in new ideas. Just like JJ Abrams did with Star Trek he has plundered the old films and remade them. Bit of a let down really.,0
387,"I entered the theater excited and nervous, and left confused and a little disappointed. Some quick points:The first act was very entertaining. Kylo Ren had a menacing introduction. Rey's introduction was fine, but she didn't have any inner conflict, just a vague story about her family returning for her. Finn had a lot of charm, but the character seemed inconsistent in motivation-- a peaceful protester when the 1st Order needed him (why did a janitor get sent down for that mission?). And after his escape, he's all to happy to gun down his old buddy stormtroopers. Phasma was cool. I don't have a problem with her being like Boba Fett, just standing around. But how quickly she broke down and took the shields offline was ridiculous. I read somewhere the script originally had Chewie trying to tear her arm out of that metal armor, which would have at least given her some motivation to betray the 1st Order. The part where the movie really had problems was after Rey and Finn stumble upon and steal the Falcon. And then, they get tractor beamed by a larger ship carrying, what a surprise, Han and Chewie. At this point, it's Coincidence City. The next part is such a mess, with a Scottish death crew versus the asian Kanjiklub. It felt so forced, and the animation with the raptors was TV quality. I suspect there were some problems with the script re-writing. That part feels of a lower quality than the rest of the film, enough that it brought me out of the paper-thin story. I actually didn't mind any of Kylo Ren's scenes, though he looked a lot less imposing once his helmet came off. The conflicted nature of his character was something I really enjoyed in the film. Yes, he's no Vader, more like Episode II Anakin. Maybe if they took some of his inner conflict and spread it around to the other characters, especially Rey, things would have been more balanced. The scene with Kylo and Han was telegraphed from 12 parsecs away. It felt like Leia just nagged Han about their son, but the relationship between Kylo and his parents wasn't really developed enough for me to care. The Deathstar 3.0 was a complete mess. It sucked power from it's own sun? Or did it cruise around and eat different suns? How did the ice planet stay cold enough while eating a solar slurpee? And what happened to the scale of Star Wars universe that anyone could see the weapon firing and hitting the targets from a single location? As soon as I got home from the theater I watched the last act of ANH, and the trench run from 1977 is far more intense than TFA's version. It seems it's the directing style of Abrams, maybe the editing. I'm ecstatic that this movie has made me appreciate what makes star wars tick, which is simple, documentary-styled direction, awesome world-building, and creativity. I can't believe they made a Star Wars movie that contains none of the Joseph Campbell investigating of myth. I tried second-guessing myself as I read the other reviews here. But one thing keeps standing out--the ""negative"" reviews contain a lot more detail about how the reviewer felt. The positive ones, at least many, are pretty generic. I refused to give a Star Wars movie less than a 3/10, but JJ Abrams, consider yourself lucky. Rian Johnson, you are my only hope.",0
388,"To paraphrase Padme from Revenge of the Sith: So this is how Star Wars dies...with thunderous applause.  Also, Rey seems to be in the wrong movie. With all her new found powers seems like she belongs  in an X-men film.  BTW....why does everyone think that Ren is a teen?  Adam Driver is 32, and besides aren't Han and Leia like a hundred years old, a little too old to be parents to a teenager I think. I'm really enjoying all the reviews....I though I was crazy not to like this movie.  Nice to know that I'm not alone.RIP Star Wars.",0
389,"Its obvious that the professional critics get paid to like the big blockbuster movies because this was just the same old Star Wars.  The battle scenes are the same.  The storm troopers wear the same uniforms as they did 30 years earlier.  Same old light saber, space craft and blasters.  Same aliens.  Same tavern scene.  Darth Vadar was replaced with a slimmed down gayer version named Ren who of course is Han Solo/Leia's son who went over to the dark side.  DUH  Rey and Finn are the new characters who are essentially clones of Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker from the original Star Wars.  Rey is one of the few  bright spots of the movie.  Finn is just plain stupid and irritating that you hope will be a minor character while the guy you think will be a major character (Poe) ends up being the minor characters. Androids are the same.   Nothing new except for the 3D.  Same plot from beginning to end as the original Star Wars.  Even the battles could have been taken directly out of the original and spliced into this mess as there was nothing new.  Heck, the entire movie is summed up in the scrolling prelude before the movie begins.  I thought surely there is more to this movie than Luke Skywalker's whereabouts.  NOPE.  That is exactly what the movie is about. nothing more.  And in the end he is on the top of a mountain herding goats or something. And I though the ending of LOST was biggest pile of crap laid by JJ Abrams. This tops that steaming pile by a mile.   I give it 3 stars only because of Harrison Ford, Chewy and Rey.  Oh, and my wife who was so fired up to see this fell asleep after about 45 minutes.  If you are 12 years old this would be great movie.  If you are over 20+ and like this then you got big problems.  At least LOST didn't  cost me $30..",0
390,"Es una porquería.Dialogos aburridos y muchas incoherencias.Cómo es posible que Rey le gane sin entrenamiento al malo que si ha sido entrenado?Cómo es posible que el soldado no hubiera acabado muerto luego de pelear con el sable con el sid?Rey se vuelve jedi sola, sin ningún entrenamiento previo.Han Solo muere de forma estúpida, luego de ser un heroe o famoso traficante.El sid, que hace de malo, en ves de dar miedo da riza, con su cara de pendejo, la verdad es que este personaje es un marica llorón.La pelea es horriblemente mala.Muchas lagunas en la historia de la nueva estrella de la muerte, que al parecer no aprenden de viejas experiencias, ya que se destruye igual que la anterior, solo hay que apuntar al centro y ya. ¿Cómo es posible que la república y los rebeldes no se hallan dado cuenta de la construcción de semejante arma? no tiene sentido.Y por eso y muchas otras cosas le doy la calificación de malícima.",0

Anyone with a mentality above age 10 will realize this is a plot empty disney cash in, and anything but Star Wars.  No logic, no background, no depth, no politics, no conflict you can't predict.  Felt like i was watching Transformers with x-wings.",0
393,"This was a movie clearly written by committee.. and by written I mean ""random bits stolen from all across existing Star Wars lore and haphazardly shoved together with no regard for plot, pacing or character development"".  This, combined with Into Darkness, has pretty much solidified JJs reputation as a terrible movie maker. It is, however, a godsend to Rifftrax, second only to a Star Wars Holiday Special.",0
394,"Feels more like a remake or remix than a continuation of the Star Wars saga. I felt almost like I was watching a fan made film that took the best parts of the original trilogy and combined them together. There are also too many plot holes and not enough creativity. I can understand leaving a few plot holes to be answered in the next movie, but so many things are left unexplained that it's hard to believe that they will all be answered in the next film.",0
395,"I watched this the other day in the cinema and to begin with was carried away on a glorious wave of nostalgia. The film went downhill quickly though, after a promising opening; derivative in the most lazy way imaginable, little to no discernible plot, terrible pacing, zero creativity, huge plot holes, and a complete disregard for the OT. This film tries hard to recapture the magic and innocence of New Hope but comes across as a very well made advert for Disney.",0
396,"Shocker. Essentially a mashup of various parts of the 6 movies preceding it. As a standalone sci film, I'd give it a 6 for a Guardians knockoff ; as a continuation of the Star Wars saga i'd give it a 3. As my mum who watched it with me said, ' i have no idea why they were fighting but the effects were nice in 3d' .Plagued by woeful dialogue and characters appearing out of nowhere for pure Deus Ex convenience.-Bad guys are absolutely tame and the one truly horrible event in the movie is ignored immediately after. --Everyone becomes best friends within a few minutes of meeting each other.-The force and fighting is can be learned within a few hours after you heard of its existence.-droids can power up and down based on the timing of the plot for .. reasons. (see it to understand)-the score was largely generic and unmemorable apart from a few john willams cues. nothing original again. the plus side is rey and finn (actors) are good.. theyre just forced with a terrible script that regresses the series and wastes a glorious opportunity of expanding the SW universe and plot.",0
397,"I've seen it once and the more I think about it the more I dislike it. I am a big SW fan of the originals, including ROTJ. Came in with an open mind, thought the beginning was strong but that was it. The special effects and cinematography are excellent with the story and characters being the weakest part. They had years to create a strong plot, they had seemingly endless possibilities (and budget). This movie lacks menace and tension. There is no depth within any of the characters. I really didn't understand what was going on the universe. Another death star? Bumping into Solo? CGI emperor? CGI old woman? Evil person being outclassed by a newbie Jedi. The list goes on. A criticism people are not discussing.  Are we to believe LUKE SKYWALKER, a character with 3 movies worth of integrity runs away from his problems and evil after a set back. He stays hidden while evil amasses and ultimately destroys billions of lives. The scene is completely different from ""Old Bens Kenobi"" retirement to Tatooine, where he watched over the last hope of the Jedi (Luke) rather than hid. Such a disappointment and now they've ruined it. They have to continue the films with these characters and this ""new"" universe. I don't believe they can turn it around. It did not feel like Star Wars. I'm not looking forward to the spin offs either with the director of Jurassic World (another over hyped empty piece of plastic) signed on. Hollywood is in shambles. J J Abraham's is a poor director. He has made millions but his legacy is that of a B class director.",0
398,"There's so much true Star Wars fans have to be upset about with this movie. The most lacking factor was wow, wonderment and awe. Plus the fact that this film had no suspense and not one great action set piece. (a first for a Star Wars film and sad) TFA feels like Star Wars The TV Movie. And if it was a TV Movie on ABC, I would have been a little more impressed but this is the first Star Wars movie in theaters that is not an EPIC. I never felt transported to other worlds, I saw a desert and a forest with minimal production design. The Prequels are looking really good right now in that aspect (actually in every aspect). I give it two stars because of the actors and the ""funny moments"" but besides that it has no build up, at times its silly, and pandering. (I feel that John Williams had no idea how to score TFA because every action scene has no buildup thus no need for his amazing talent to give rise and build to scenes, not his fault) Rey has an unusual knowledge of the force, even though she has no real idea what it is. Things that took Luke 2 movie's to do, Rey did in 1 movie. I was reminded of this while watching The Empire Strikes Back when Luke is hanging upside down and is reaching for his Lightsaber, he is struggling to reach it and its very close by. Rey was able to do it with ease with no training from Yoda and from a much further distance. Its ugly women empowerment pandering ""Anything you can do, I can do better"" in a film series that is more about Father and Sons than anything else. They destroyed a bit of the gravity of the series with that nonsense throughout the film. And I am not a Women Empowerment hater, Mad Max: Fury Road and Jupiter Ascending proved that that sort of Propaganda if you will can be done right and us guys have to shut up because it was done with thoughtfulness and heart. TFA is not that, the whole film feels rushed especially the characters development. My final negative point is something I read in another review which summed up my worst fears of what this film could have been which is: ""Which brings me to what I hated the most about the movie, and the main reason I'm giving it such a low score: it erases anything good and fulfilling we had at the end of Return of the Jedi. Every single one of the original heroes failed miserably in every aspects of their lives. Where is the reward for being good, just and do heroic deeds?So... Han failed as a husband, as a father, as a member of the resistance and overall as a man (a bitter one it seems)... same goes for Leia (oh, she is a general of a sidekick cell that's supported by the republic... great). Luke is the worse of them all: failed as a jedi master, failed as a protector of the galaxy, as uncle, as friend, as brother, as the owner of R2D2"" TFA broods with so much negativity and abandons everything that our heroes fought so hard to protect. Its a huge slap in the face. It undermines the power of GOOD. Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker all deserve a grace period after what they've been though and this film denied us that forever. We are right back in the same loop, and I get it most people come from broken homes, or fatherless childs, (I'm one of them) etc. But that doesn't mean films have to pander to society in such a manner. It could have been a great example to show that the GOOD in the world has to be protected and that its a torch of hope that we pass down to our children. TFA in my opinion has destroyed much history and has set us up for a very negative Trilogy, I guess one about the loop of destruction. And maybe that would have been acceptable if the movie was great via amazing set pieces, visual spectacle, wonderment, better pacing, a memorable score, and inspired production design but it didn't even do that. All things that are Star Wars Traditions. There's more of course, Plot holes all over the place and the misuse of Captain Phasma, is she dead?",0
399,"Horrible.  It was basically episode 4 but the stupid version.  As bad as episode I and 2 were, this was even worse.  Those ones disappointed me, but this was so bad I'm not even coming back for the next one.  A ridiculous adolescent farce.  Less than zero / 10.",0
400,"Mediocre at best. 2hr long cameo. Predictable and primitive plot. All those ""spoilers"" are laughable. Main villain is a wannabe villain, which makes him a disappointment. Same applies to the whole movie - wannabe Star Wars, which makes it a total disappointment.This is the last Episode I went to watch in a theatre.",0
401,"My review is based off two viewings. I did not know what to really make of the movie after the first view, other than being confused, disappointed and angry. So, I decided I needed to watch it again to make up my mind as to what I thought of The Force Awakens. Overall, TFA feels to me like an average Avengers/Marvel type movie with some Star Wars props/elements thrown in. As a long time Star Wars fan it does not feel like a Star Wars movie to me. I won't go in depth into a critique, as many of my points have been stated here and elsewhere. But, I'll summarize my concerns with the movie. The Plot is a rehash of Ep. 4 with elements of Ep. 5 and Ep. 6 mixed in. It is disappointing that greater imagination was not shown. Now, in and of itself, a total rehash is, I suppose, not that bad. But, the fact that so much was taken and shoved into this movie meant that much background and context to the SW universe 30 years after ROTJ was left unexplained. For example, the political context within which the New Republic, the Resistance, and the New Order are operating is unknown. The basic setting for the movie is a vacuum. The plot rushes from one action sequence to the other with a series of near unbelievable coincidences (or deux ex machina) to make it work. Such as Phasma being so easily found in a planet sized Death Star and then just disabling the shields without a fight. Now, some of this is alright - they exist in many movies; but, TFA really loads up on these so that it strains credibility and credulity. There is lack of internal logic and progression. The characters are interesting on the surface, but are undeveloped. The character of Rey is too perfect, while Finn comes off as existing for comedic effect. Neither really actively progress during the movie. Poe is a stereotypical 'war hero' type personality. Ren is potentially the most interesting. But, the movie makes him into a figure of fun with his temper tantrums and plays these off for laughs to the audience. This undermines the character. But, playing for laughs is what the movie does a lot. TFA was full of comedy and funny for the sake of it which did not help establish a clear tone, and did not support the supposed seriousness of the events happening on screen (destruction of planets, killing of villagers, a dangerous villain, and so on). Moreover, some of the character interplay was unbelievable. Poe and Finn become best friends on the basis of very little. Rey and Finn also bond too quickly. Finn, as an escapee Stormtrooper, is accepted as such far too easily by Poe, Han, and the Resistance. What, there was no suspicion that he was a spy? (It is never even really explained why Finn left other than he wanted to do ""the right thing"" - this, from someone who was conditioned from birth to be a Stormtrooper. It's just bad story-telling.) TFA is an example of lazy writing and shallow characterization. Much is asked to be taken on faith. Either it will not be explained or will be explained - in some fashion - in the next movie. To me, this is very cynical and not good enough. Finally, as some others have noted, in doing some kind of 'soft reboot' TFA regresses our heroes from the Original Trilogy. Luke, Leia and Han are all back to their Ep. 4 selves. For instance, our first view of Luke is staring out over the sea to the horizon much as he stared out over Tatooine to the horizon in Ep. 4. It is as if the character development and personal journeys of our old heroes never happened. This to me shows a lack of understanding of the source material. In fact, it arguably dishonours it. Now, this is not to say that people can't change over 30 years. But, it needs to be explained, believable and consistent. I think the paucity of real depth in this movie is shown in Williams' utterly forgettable soundtrack (for the first time ever in a Star Wars movie). This is because the old Lucas style of cinematography and story-telling which allowed Williams' music to help tell the story is absent. The movie is dominated by explosions and comedic quips leaving little space for the music to elevate and inform the movie. Age may have something to do with Williams' poor effort, but it may also be that there was little in this movie to score good music to. On my second viewing, my primary emotion was boredom. There is simply little in this movie to engage with on a mental or emotional level. Toward the end, I was just waiting for it to be over. I give the movie some points for trying in the opening Act on Jakku (the best part of the movie). The cast all do their best in terms of their own personal performances. And Harrison Ford, in particular, carries TFA through the middle sequence. But, it's not good enough. From the second Act on, the movie just goes downhill very fast in a jumble of meaningless action sequences. I'd summarize TFA in three words: lazy, shallow, cynical. Overall, I give it 3/10. (Edited and re-submitted for clarity on 4/01.)",0
402,"This film is going to have the same effect as The Phantom Menace -  beloved for 5 minutes before reality sinks in. It's amazing that with such strong imagery it still manages to be the least SW feeling film of all. This is film making by committee with the end result coming across as poor fan fiction. JJ Abrams' take on Star Trek as a light-hearted action flick was wrong, but worked because it didn't have legacy storyline to carry and it was already predefined to a degree. The same trick has not worked here, with no regard for the impact of prior events. Essentially, this is just a soft reboot which does not seem to hold the galaxy in the balance. I never gave Lucas any credit for the prequels - and as little as possible for the originals - but TFA proves he understood the scale of the universe and how to convey it.",0
403,"SO disappointed in this movie. Finally Star Wars has been wrested away from Lucas' control, and Disney had a clean slate to work with. What did they do? The basically gave us Episode VII - A New Hope 2015 Girl Power Edition. Basically take Episode IV, change the protagonist to a female and have her effortlessly become a master jedi by the end of the movie. Unfortunately it looks like Empire Strikes Back will be the last good Star Wars movie ever made.",0
404,"Unbelievable rehash.  Did someone pay the critics to give it 5 stars?  Are we Americans that thick that we can't recognize a re-run when we see it?  Did we all watch the same movie? I was really looking forward to seeing this--I have all of the series at home and have watched them several  times. But... For the first time ever, I fell asleep watching a movie in a theater.  No wonder Ford had to be paid so much to do this project; who would want to act in a movie that he's already done before?  Both Ford and Fisher looked extremely bored, and rightly so. All JJ Adams did was take out an old Star Wars script, change some of the names and scene locations and make the boom booms bigger, and that's it.  Oh, and he also cut out *all* of the character and plot development (why bother if its the same story over again?)  and sped the movie up for the Attention Deficit folks.I cared *nothing* for the characters, and I now care nothing for the Star Wars franchise which was created, obviously, to make lots of money off of people who don't understand that they're being taken for a $$$ ride.",0
405,"As a LIFELONG Star Wars fan, I cant accept this tripe. Ive read thousands of pages of expanded universe material, played thousands of hours of the video games, am absolutely enamored with this setting, and its characters. If anyone could give it a pass, it should be me. It wasnt just a bad Star wars movie...it was a bad FILM. The main features of the movie are: a rehashed story, flat dialogue, uninteresting characters, More action than acting, Doesnt follow pre established lore, Deus ex machina all throughout, sad silly forced feeling comedy, Suspension of disbelief impossible. The movie literally brought me to tears, not because of the emotional weight of the scenes or story, but in the fact that Disney has proven they have no respect for this venerated series. Did the rebellion defeat the empire? Did the characters we love and missed evolve in any meaningful way? Does this movie feel like a legitimate sequel to episode 6? Nope, Nope, Nope. It felt like the people behind this movie didnt even watch the original films or the prequels, how much would it have cost Disney to hire someone who actually knew anything about Star Wars? Disney retconned the EU for THIS garbage? The Lightsaber that Luke lost on Bespin is in the service room(that also serves as a force cave)in some random bar, in the box from Obi Wans house on Tattooine. Han doesnt know what a bowcaster is, and is generally an incompetent boob, Fin is unbelievable, Poe is flat. Rey is a mary Sue, Kylo comes off as a complete weakling that no one would follow into anything. Luke going into hiding makes no sense, the map he left makes no sense, The first Order going after an apparently non issue in Luke whos hanging out in Ireland for some reason makes no sense, R2D2 makes no sense, The Falcon on Jakku makes no sense, the garbage man Fin not cutting off his own head with the lightsaber, makes no sense. Reys unexplained piloting expertise, force using expertise, The list goes on and on and on. The death of Han Solo scene was so emotionally weightless, I didn't flinch. It should be Illegal to do this to classic Americana, its like peeing on the Alamo. I hope the mockery of our mental capacities as fans bankrupts the monstrosity called Disney and everyone involved in writing, directing, and overseeing the creation of this movie lives in poverty and shame for the rest of their days. Shame on you Disney, Shame on you Abrams You've broken my heart.",0
406,"TFA is a complete rehash of A New Hope, but it's done really badly. I can't even remember any of the music. My biggest gripe with this movie is that it never feels like it's going anywhere. Stuff blows up but there's no resolution. The characters encounters thieves but they immediately die, they fight against the new order but there's no real resistance. The new Vader guy was okay, his mask is cool, but when he took his mask I couldn't stop laughing. And what's up with the ending shot? Seriously? In the end it didn't feel like Star Wars at all.",0
407,Worst of them all. Shame on Disney and the director you have ruin this world. Really bad script and editing. Score was awful and the acting from tv movie.,0
408,"This is the worst Star Wars movie of all. Sure there's action but it lacks any substance. The plot is horrible and all over the place. Fifteen minutes into the movie and you forget after what the mission of the story is all about. I was really hoping to see new ideas and things never seen before in a Star Wars movie but this was even worse.Sure, many people condemned the prequels but at least you got to see new spacecraft, water craft, planets, new worlds, broadened horizons, great fight scenes, characters that drew you in, the development of characters as they grew throughout each movie and the compelling subject matter. This movie was just too big for Disney and even more J.J> Abrams to fill. Worlds are travelled to in the snap of a finger. Same old fighter air craft, less of them to defeat an already developed super death star?!? WTF? Destroying entire planets with no explanation as to why. The resistance not understanding how to take out the death star planet , remember the ventilation shaft? A scavenger girl that learns the force instantly almost and defeats a trained jedi villain twice with no understanding of what the force even is. Kylo Ren is one of the weakest villains of just about any movie I've ever seen, not just Star Wars. he comes off as plain childish and spoiled rather than frightening.Everything about this movie just seems small. A call to the First Order and poof! They are there instantly.  Then another call to the resistance and poof! they are there to take on the First Order. It doesn't seem hard to find anyone on these planets at all. The whole scale of things are just too small. Fighter aircraft seemed like a fraction of what it used to be. Time travel is less than light years. Worlds seem like just small cities. Even the most sacred jedi weapon is a common tool. Who the hell would want to take something like a lightsaber and turn it into that piece of crap Kylo Ren had? Really? Is this the creativity that we can expect from Disney? I had a fealing that Disney was going to blow it, but I was hoping to give the benefit of a doubt. This whole introduction to The Force Awakens was nothing more than hype and marketing to redeem the 4 billion dollars that they've paid to George Lucas for his biggest selling movies.People criticize George Lucas for becoming stale and lacking new ideas and story telling but as I've already mentioned, look at all of the new things that he brought to the prequels. Comparing the prequels to this poorly written screen of crap is far and in between. I'll watch the next 2 Star Wars movies on blue ray before I pay for this mess again at a theater. As far as I'm concerned the first 6 Star Wars movies are a trilogy of their own. Starting with 7 and up is going to be a whole different thing.",0
409,"Drink the koolade Luke, the Force does not awaken, it merely rehashes itself in heap of poorly written dialog, a tantrum throwing baby Vader for the millennium set, a Jedi girl, who instantly picks up in a few hours what it took everyone else ages to master, a new and not so improved Death Star, a guest roll by smegal as the evil overlord and a painfully ""to the letter"" rehash. It's not a wonder that Harrison Ford begged to kill off Solo and Lucas himself does not approve of the film. This film is nothing more than the bean counters at Disney capitalizing on 40 years of Star Wars in the most simplistic and uninspiring way possible, to prepare the koolade drinkers for more worthless garbage under the Star Wars banner and new expanded theme park rides.",0
410,"******MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS BELOW******* I'm posting this mainly to see if there is anyone else out there who feels the way I do about TFA, I haven't read/watched any reviews yet but the 95% on RT kind of surprised me. I'm not trying to rain on the parade at all here -- I really wanted to like this movie -- but to me it was bitterly disappointing. Cons: I did not buy any of the major relationships at all, to me this was by far the biggest failing of the movie. Finn/Rey, Finn/Poe, shockingly even Leia/Han. They all felt extremely forced and came across as trying REALLY hard to recapture the chemistry of the Big 3 in the OT. When Poe and Finn rush to embrace after Finn sees him for the first time alive, I was kind of taken aback because to me they just hadn't ""gotten there"" yet, so it just came off as weird. I don't know what the problem was, the acting, the script, or some elusive, hard-to-quantify, movie magic thing. The main problem is that throughout the movie there is basically zero character development, and as a result it's difficult to care about anything that happens. The whole movie felt like a point-for-point rehash of A New Hope -- a few nods here and there are cool and would be expected, but TFA went way beyond that. I'm honestly pretty surprised that this script was OK-ed because it is so blatant in parts. Just a few examples: -The fact that once again a critical bit of info is given to a droid who is left to his (its?) own devices -- said droid is then taken hostage by desert scavengers before being ""rescued"" by the protagonist. -All of the ball turret scenes on the Falcon. -A ""scoundrel"" type character that makes snarky remarks and likes to use his ship's undercarriage gun to blast baddies while trying to escape. -Death Star 3 (I'm REALLY surprised they went with this as I thought it was a common problem that people have with ROTJ) -Cantina scene Due to the above (and more) I frequently had the feeling that I was watching a straight up second rate remake. Last major problem I had with the movie was that it was just not subtle AT ALL. The worst example being the scenes setting up Finn to leave the First Order. I could practically hear JJ yelling into my ear ""HE'S CONFLICTED ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW! LOOK AT HIS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS! -- CAN YOU TELL HE IS CONFLICTED? IN CASE YOU COULDN'T -- LET ME SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU -- THIS CHARACTER IS VERY CONFLICTED!!!"" There were also a few really bad exposition scenes where it felt like characters were just vomiting up important plot points because the script couldn't think of a more clever way to explain the story. Ok so that's the bad, there were some parts of this movie that I did actually enjoy: -Every scene with Snoke was great. What an awesome character design. When he first came up on screen I was just blown away -- the holograph-making-him-seem-huge trick was a stroke of genius, though part of me wishes he really was that big. -Lightsaber duels following more after the style that Luke and Vader have at the end of ROTJ (i.e. passionate hacking that looks like they are really trying to kill each other). The only problem was I couldn't get emotionally wrapped up in them in the same way because again, I just did not buy the character relationships and didn't care who lived or who died. -Some very cool landscapes: my three favorites being the backdrop as Rey ""sandboards"" down a dune, the Snoke ""throne room"", and the bridge where Han bites it. -The vision sequences when Rey picks up Luke's lightsaber were great. It's a shame they didn't go anywhere with it. So to conclude, for me this movie failed, though in a different way from the prequels. Say what you want about the prequels (and I am not at all a fan -- not trying to stir the pot here -- just want to give some context to my views), but George did not ""play it safe"" and rehash the OT at all. This movie takes zero risks. And as much as the prequels suffer from general ""woodenness"", I found TFA's character relationships even less convincing (excluding maybe Anakin/Padme).",0
411,"This movie was so bad that I actually wanted to leave the theatre.  We've seen it all before, only better.  This was Episode 4 and 5 remade, but the dumb version.  If I'd have known what I was in for, I'd have stayed home.  Thanks for nothing Disney.  Enjoy my money.  Your film didn't earn it, but your marketing team sure did.",0
412,"Mickey Mouse asked Jar Jar Binks' dimwitted twin brother Jar Jar Abrams to make a Star Wars movie. ""Meesa good directa!"", Jar Jar Abrams said to Mickey, ""I maksa bestest Star Wars movie evars!"" And the result was a pile of badly directed steaming bantha poop with horrid writing. But Mickey Mouse was more than happy, because he hyped it so much that it made a lot of money anyway.",0
413,"Movie is just a rewrite of the originals. Its basically a feminist remake with a bunch of plot holes. There's hardly any introduction, to sum it up its says ""Luke isn't in this movie, and now an edgy cult order rules the galaxy."" The new girl literally does whatever she wants with no training. She even tells Han Solo how to fly his freaking ship. Which she even stole it as well with 0 effort because there's no security at all on it (no wonder why Han Solo lost his ship in the first place to random bandits) How an insult like this to Han Solo is even allowed to exist is beyond me. So the girl is the ""chosen one"" except apparently with no flaws. Kylo Ren is just another conflicted Vader who is at the whim of the top dog. They couldn't even do a big dramatic reveal that hes the son of Solo. Its told in a freaking mission briefing, wow how dramatic. No other movie in existence has messed even that up. So they're all brought together and forced into action over an important message a droid has which is held by discount R2-D2. The character names aren't even good, Finn, Rey and Snoke? I mean you use a name that is close to Snooki for the discount emperor? By this point you already know where everything is going, no need to comment further. The movie is an offensive feminist plagiarizing remake of the originals. 0/10",0
414,"Why bother with this Movie.Good1.Started amazing villain looks badass2.Good EffectsBad1. Pacing sucks and does not give time for character development. I know nothing about the characters because there was no character development in this movie.2. Logic in this movie does not exist. Somehow a garbage salvager is more brave than someone trained from birth to be a soldier. Somehow that garbage salvager can repair the Millennium Falcon better than someone whom has several decades of experience with the ship. Ill tell you what next time I have car troubles Ill go to the salvage yard rather than a mechanic, because that makes perfect sense. Somehow it takes 3 movies for Anakin to control the force as good as he does as Darth Vader. 1.5 movies for Luke Skywalker to be able to lift a rock and five freaking minutes for the main character to do a JEDI MIND TRICK. The reason not everyone is a Jedi is because very few are able to use the force and among those that can in order to control the force it takes years of training it is earned. Rey does not earn her skills its as though she magically has the ability to control the force. Being strong and the force and controlling the force are two different things entirely.3. Somehow a Sith Apprentice trained by Luke and a Dark Lord cant seem to win against a 5 min beginner force wielder that  pulls Jedi Mind tricks out of her ass and a storm trooper.4. Kylo Ren started strong in the beginning and became a whiny crying **** with daddy issues midway through the movie.5. Story had no depth they recycled Episode 4 and couldnt think of a better plot than to increase the size of a death star to  the size of a planet with the same **** WEAKNESS. This borderlines on retardation.6. Phasma was nowhere to be seen and is so inept that when she is asked as to how someone went AWOL her excuse was he was supposed to show up at this location at this time.7. The writers do not know a thing about suspense. Everything was obvious. The way they revealed the identity of Kylo Ren was a joke. The fact that Han Solo was going to die was obvious from the start of the scene.8. The Sith Lord looks like Gollum. I kept waiting for him to utter my precious every scene they show him. This movie was **** and the writers and direct should feel like **** They scrapped George Lucas script in favor of this trash and while George Lucas is not a good writer he could still be more imaginative than the retards that wrote this pile of fecal matter.",0
415,"This movie crushed my soul as star wars fan...im so dissapointed, why they have to make a remake of episode 4? did you feel in the theather that you already seen that? you already know how its going to end.Kylo ren totally dissapionting, a winny little kid and wait he is the master of the knights of ren and almost gets his @ss kicked by a janitor stormtrooper, ray is a mary sue she knows everything and in the awakening she already knows all about the force and dont tell me that his mind was wiped out because she was abandoned  when she was very young to use a lightsaber. how pepople are giving this crap a 10?? are they insane? have no love for true star wars? did they even seen the original trilogy??",0
419,"Like many other review will tell you, this film is literally a rehash of A New Hope. It becomes laughable how much material they took from the OT after you see them blow up ANOTHER death star. I wanted to see a continuation of the story, not a recycled version of the existing one. JJ has failed this franchise and the millions of fans who follow it. There is no excuse for this lack of creativity. If episode 8 continues this trend I will not be watching the finale of the new trilogy.",0
420,"Very boring movie. Can't believe this is rated as high as it is. Say what you want about the prequels at least they have a plot. So much of the plot felt forced. Oh this place happens to have a lightsaber, oh R2D2 wakes up and has the map, oh Han Solo just happened to be in the system, and the main characters happen to be in the millenium falcon.And the death planet blows up an entire star system and no one gives a ****",0
421,"God, I was so dissapointed with this movie. It was honestly the worst film of the entire franchise. I never felt immersed in the movie and there were just to many awful moments for me to really enjoy. There were a few good action scenes, but there were too many awkward scenes. I am a huge star wars fan and i was majorly dissapointed.",0
422,"As a member of both the Rebel Legion and the 501st Garrison, I believe it's safe to say I'm a ""super-fan"" of the Star Wars franchise. I grew up with the originals and my oldest son grew up with the prequels. Some of my fellow Legion and Garrison mates and got together and we all saw the movie on Christmas Eve with dinner afterward. After watching the movie, we generally walked out in stunned silence. During the following dinner, we debated and complained, pointed out every flaw, every plot hole, every unbelievable coincidence that was forced upon the viewer.. and there was much to debate as the negative reviews here rightfully point out. Too much of a rehash of A New Hope, too many coincidental events, no context, no exposition, and so on... The next day, I saw the movie again with extended family including several tween and early teen cousins, nieces/newphews, et cetera. They completely lapped it up, bouncing in their seat for every BB8 scene and every crazy camera angle of blaster shots. That's when it dawned on me: Disney's ""Star Wars"" has no interest in staying faithful to the original mythos or providing a meaningful story - they're catering to the ADHD, can't-stop-playing-with-my-phone generation. All they have to do is make a kid-friendly droid character, fill two hours with explosions and ""pewpew lazers!"" (to quote one of my nephews) and they'll sell millions of tickets and overpriced, made-in-China toys. People like myself and other unofficial fan club superfans have spent lots of money and time because we wanted to feel as though we're part of the Star Wars universe but I don't see future generations feeling the same way. The new direction of Star Wars is entirely short-sighted, based on capturing the hype and marketing while delivering forgettable films. It's the ""Moichendising!"" scene from Spaceballs come to life.",0
423,"Let me start by saying that JJ Abrams is quite possibly the biggest hack on the planet with the release of this movie. 70% in this movie was taken from the original trilogy. One of the main characters, A force sensitive girl. Is stuck on a desert planet in the middle of nowhere and her family is killed by the empire. Leaving her with no reason to stay on the planet. The empire has somehow turned a planet into a rip off of a death star, and the rebel forces attack and of course destroy it. (But not before they fly through a trench of course). The main bad guy is a cheap rip off of darth vader, mask and all. And he fails in every possible way to be an interesting or even remotely worthwhile character. It is revealed early on that he is an anorexic snow white emo pretty boy with the depth and complexity of a mud puddle and maturity of a five year old with the temper tantrums to match. This utter loser literally does nothing the entire movie but throw temper tantrums and whine about being a useless piece of crap. Oh, And they made him han and leia's son and he ends up killing han in a truly **** way. You know, Just to give him a reason to exist. Because who cares about being original? Is this **** starting to sound familiar? A masked villain dressed in black? A large round object capable of destroying an entire solar system? A force sensitive child left alone on a desert planet? Seriously? You get tasked with bringing the most beloved film franchise in history back and you do a garbage unoriginal half assed re imagining of the original? JJ Abrams, You freaking SUCK. Now onto a list of OTHER reasons why this movie is lame. 1. Light saber combat is slow and painfully awkward. These fools act like they are swinging 20 pound sledgehammers instead of beams of pure energy. 2. They bring in main characters and pretty much just have them stand there for the duration of their screen time. It's like the idiots forgot to actually write them into the script. princess leia just stands there and only moves like three times the entire time she's on screen. 3. We all know that the force takes a lifetime to truly master, Right? Well the main jedi chick pretty much masters the force in a day despite never before being exposed to jedi teachings or anything. Even managing to pull the jedi mind trick out of her ass and reading the mind of han's worthless coward of a son at one point. Skills that are supposed to take years to learn. Luke spent three movies learning how to use the force and this little girl does it in 30 minutes. Right. 4. I hope you don't like serious movies because this movie tries to make a joke like every ten minutes it seems. Star wars isn't a comedy you idiots! This movie is nothing but special effects and recycled characters and plots made exclusively to take your money and leave no lasting impression. This trilogy is already shaping up to be the death of star wars as a series. No depth. No complexity. Not even worthwhile characters or even an ounce of character development. Abrams is the M Night Shyamalan of scifi without a doubt. A complete and total hack with no real skill who gets work because his name is famous.",0
424,"I am generally disappointed with this film. Even though it had excellent production standards, the story lacked any real imagination. Remember that moment when Darth Vader told Luke Skywalker that he is Luke's father in the second film? This film has none of that. The angle of the storm trooper becoming a ""good guy"" had promise, however in the film it seemed contrived and is so socially correct that it is painful to watch. It could have been really good if they made a more mature rated film. I suspect that Disney is just dragging out the series to milk more money out of the Star Wars franchise and I won't be watching any of the other films when they are released. In fact, I think that it is time to boycott anything that is a sequel of something else so that people can start making worthwhile films again.",0
425,"***SPOILERS***Some disappointments and points of confusion:1) So much miscasting:  Ex. Kylo Ren made me think of Maryln Manson... CRIPES!  They never should have had him take off that mask.  T_T 2) Finn's character makes no sense. Traumatized by the First Order's massacre of a city after one of his fellow troopers gets killed > proceeds to massacre an entire planet's worth of fellow troopers he essentially grew up with. WHAT???  And remember: these storm troopers [according to Finn] are NOT volunteers, they're stolen and raised from birth to fight for the First Order.  I guess he just didn't have sympathy for any of those other guys who went through the same traumatizing experiences as him I suppose.   And I guess there's no reason for them to explain why Finn would suddenly feel this sense of guilt or emotion while the thousands of other troopers raised like him had none at all. 3) Kylo-Ren's character's force powers are dwarfed and overemphasized to the point where you're left wondering how weak/strong is KR at all.  a) Freezes a laser in midair, able to force push and interrogate the Ace pilot  >>> b) proceeds to get whipped first by Finn [who showed no actual force potential but can somehow turn on a light saber] then by Rey in several ways [cannot interrogate, is beaten in a light saber battle when Rey had NO prior experience to even holding one] > cannot even withdraw a lightsaber that's stuck in snow... [like Luke was able to withdraw his saber when it was stuck in frozen ice... and he was still being trained] 4) Rey's character knows how to do too much to the point it's unrealistic:  Mechanic [fine], somehow knows how to pilot the Millenum Falcon though never having had piloting experience outside of a landspeeder [what?], is able to master several jedi techniques w/o ever having exposure to any of them [Mind tricks, light saber battling, resisting the Force interrogation by KR] (are you serious???), btw, she's never been off Jakku [hence the ""Ive never seen so much Green"" comment] 5) Phasma is such a let down character- only scene she's seen as ""badass"" is the beginning massacre scene-> after she only appears when Han/Chewie get her to lower the shields whilst mocking her and proceed to throw her down a trash compactor [So I guess she's dead now?]~ yeah... girl power to the MAX! 6) Writing kinda doesn't make any sense:a) The destruction of that one system that had the Republic made no sense.  Why is the Resistance and the Republic 2 separate entities?  It's been 30 years, but last I recall [in Movies: 3 and 4- the Senate/Republic was liquidated with the rise of the Empire where the Emperor had essentially an iron grip on the galaxy.  There was no mention of a formation of a New [or old] Republic post-Empire until right before they blew away those 5 planets.  Does that mean there's no more Senate?  Why wasn't it on Coruscant?  (huh? what???) b) And why are people so forgetful of the destruction of a PLANET KILLER [aka: Death Star- from the Return of the Jedi] only after 30 years?  We all remember the Titanic and that was in the early 1900s.  Something that big that happened TWICE can't become a myth/legend only after 30 years... c) How did the building of a SOLAR SySTEM destroyer the size multiple times that of the old death stars go unnoticed by the entire galaxy when it's SO BIG?  The original trilogy made such a big deal of these planet sized super weapons but now that the First Order has built one hundreds of times the size with the capacity to knock out several planets in one blow--- no one bats an eye?  It was ""find Luke Skywalker"" plans, not ""here's the weakness to that one super solar system destroyer"" plans.  What kind of priorities is that?  But whateves, it only wiped out billions of people from 4-5 different planets including [supposedly] the Republic Fleet. d) How did Finn [being a sanitation Storm Trooper (",0
426,"Very disappointed with this star wars. Same story of the IV episode with a new look. Recycling of an original storyline to a younger generation. Lack of creativity and originality in the script. The saga came into loop. Luke is Obi-wan, the girl is the new Luke, the stormtrooper is the new Han Solo and so on ... only Chewie does not need to be renewed. There's also a new death star, of course. All within the politically right, now with women and black people as protagonists.",0
427,"No character development, predictable plot with many holes, forced chemistry between actors, weak and laughable villain, unoriginal story.It is ridiculous that the ""critics"" give this film such high praise.  I think it's hype and nostalgia that is masking the critical reviews so far.  In time the mediocrity of this movie will sink in and the consensus of the SW community will be that it is pretty much just a less-than-worthy reboot of the original trilogy. A few specific things that really bothered me: 1. Rey is an orphan, scavenging for parts to get by, but magically somehow when she is told that she has the Force, she suddenly knows out of nowhere to use the Jedi mind trick, can beat the bad guy in a lightsaber duel, and fly the Falcon like an ace pilot.  No training needed - I guess Luke is a dunce for having to train under Yoda, huh?  Sorry, not buying ANY of it.2. CGI for the supreme leader, it's the same actor who did Gollum, and it shows. How original.  And the cantina owner, unnecessarily CGI too.3.  Another Death Star, only bigger.  Destroys a solar system, minutes later everyone acts as if this were just a mere inconvenience.  Oh, and it has a weakness...sound familiar?4.  Kylo Ren is the lamest villian yet in Star Wars.  I'll let you figure out why for yourself.5.  The Han Solo and Kylo face off was so predictable I saw it coming from a mile away, and afterward it just made me feel empty and sad.  Also, when Ren and Chewy return to Leia, she totally ignores her long time friend Chewy and instead goes to Ren (whom she hardly even knows!), and shares in their grief.  I guess Chewy's grief is irrelevant to Leia because why; he's a wookie?  I am just shocked. Yeah, there were some good moments, but after it's all said and done, I'm just feeling let down and depressed.",0
428,"Thanks to the angry nerds who chased George Lucas away from Star Wars, we ended up with this garbage JJ Abrams nonsense because of you people. How this movie ended up with an overall positive response from the media is baffling. The gaping plot holes, cheese-ridden dialogue, and shameless recycling of OT scenes was painful to endure.",0
429,"I thought about walking out twice which would of been the first time I have wanted to walk out of a movie since the Phantom Menace. Han Solo and Chewbacca were at least enjoyable. Sadly Jar Jar Abrams has likely ruined 2 movies. This one and the next Star Trek which he really seemed to be very adept at directing. To think he was to be the new hope. However, it is too derivative to be anything but what it came from. Crap",0
430,"Disappointed. I'm giving it 3 stars for special effects only although with all today techs available to it compare to original Star Wars movies it may not deserve it either. Bad screen play, bad editing, bad directing, bad acting, cliché action scenes... It seems all high ratings by critics is either nostalgic -meaning blind minded- or a giving favor to Disney if was not paid!",0
431,"I started getting nervous when I kept hearing from all of these people who knew little to nothing about Star Wars how great it was, people who had no idea what made Star Wars great.  And it turns out my fears were justified.  This movie is awful.  There is nothing original in the entire two hours, and it is NOT made for people who love the franchise.  This is for young people who have never seen it before and don't realize how derivative it is from the other films, especially episode 4.  No risks are taken and no imagination shown.  The result:  a truly useless final product.  I will not be back for more.",0
432,"This is probably my least favorite Star Wars movie for the following reasons: -No Pacing.  After the anticlimactic lightsaber fight between Rey and Ben where they obviously were setting the stage for the sequel, the movie was rushed.  There was no pacing whatsoever.  The scene transitions from that to their base to the completed map to Luke in what seemed like a blink of the eye. -Little character development.  They did not put nearly as much effort into developing Finn as they should have.  His defection seemed forced by the writers, and only later in the movie does he very briefly and vaguely touch on why he defected.  Rey fared off a bit better but the movie doesn't explain her attachment to Jakku and pretty much has her instantly mastering the force, easily defeating Ben who had way more experience than she. -Everyone seemed to get over Han Solo's death way too quickly.  Also, the foreshadowing was almost insultingly obvious.  Having the light shining on him and Ben go dark just before he is killed?  Come on. -All of the combat was bland and uninspired.  This movie could have redeemed itself if the action scenes were worth it, but they were not.  The movie did nothing to get the viewer invested in the combat.  It was nothing but the same tired movies in both the fighter combat and the lightsaber combat.  Many of the scenes and maneuvers where they are attacking the ""big deathstar"" seemed to be near identical clones of the original deathstar fight. I did not expect the movie to live up to the hype, but it was a much bigger let down than expected.  I had high hopes for Disney and am disappointed.",0
433,"There are so many plot holes in this movie that prevents it to be even slightly enjoyable. To enjoy this movie one would need to throw out any logical sense and focus only on the decent action and characters. Most negative reviews would point out the major flaws in the plot. Watching this movie is like watching little kids play fantasy/sci-fi make believe where illogical things will happen and the plot armor is invincible. Treat this movie as such and things will start to make sense.",0
434,"Congratulations Disney. You turned an Epic Saga into a poor franchise...Rip-off... First I want to make clear that I'm a fan of the Star Wars Saga, movies and Expanded Universe alike. Have seen the Original Trilogy and the Prequels countless times and read more than 50 EU books (like many others have done as well of course). This ""review"" is not against anyone who like the movie but against the movie.The first letdown was when Disney announced that the Expanded Universe is not Canon anymore and the Sequel Trilogy will be based on an ""original"" plot. No matter how much I disliked this fact I hopped that they could have still made up an interesting and original plot.Unfortunately this is not the case... They have messed up the Expanded Universe and tried to make it fit in the plot of Episode IV. In the EU, Han and Leia have a son (Jacen Solo) whose Master is Luke (who else could it be?) and finally Jacen falls to the Dark Side and becomes something like Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker leaves everything behind and searches the Galaxy to answer what made Jacen become a Sith (Second Galactic Civil War, ""Legacy of the Force"" and ""Fate of the Jedi"" series).So they kept this as a base, tried to make it fit in the plot of Episode IV and then named it ""The Force Awakens"".- A droid has important information and is lost on a desert planet (they just renamed the droid from R2-D2 to BB-8 and the planet from Tatooine to Jakku)- A person with Jedi powers with no knowledge of it gets the droid (Luke became Rey)- The Imperials err.... sorry, the First Order has created a Super-weapon they call Starkiller base which is just a bigger Death Star!- The bad guys take the good girl to the planet-sized space/battle station and the good guys go for the rescue- As we all know from Episodes IV and VI the Death Stars had a weak point, so the new Imps were loyal to this and created the Starkiller base with a weak point as well! =)- The weak point can be hit only if someone lowers the shields from the inside!- On the Death Star, damn... I mean the Starkiller base the father figure is killed by the son figure, just like Obi-Wan was killed by Darth Vader...On top of that there are many plot holes. Only Disney could make Rey, who just learned to use the force, overpower Kylo Ren who's supposed to have been an apprentice to Luke Skywalker and now of Snoke (seriously, Jar Jar Bings is a more serious name than Snoke...)Episode I and II were far from perfect but AT LEAST had an original plot. The Prequels took the Saga another step forward. On the other hand, The Force Awakens (I refuse to call it Episode VII and they did well to omit it from the title) is a bad copy of Episode IV, a re-imagination of the original without a soul. It's a disrespectful spit on the face of the Star Wars Saga. A blasphemy. I dare to say that Luke will die on Episode IX just like Yoda on VI and that Rey is Kylo Ren's sister and will kill him and redeem him on Episode IX too. Congratulations Disney. You turned an Epic Saga into a poor franchise...",0
435,"This movie is a rehash of episode 4 a new hope with parts of previous movies. The little new the did was ok at best and generic at worst. It's the same empire versus rebels, shoot the weak point in the death star, lowly main character on desert planet wishes to be on an adventure.this movie literally doesn't advance the story of star wars at all. The story is a string of coincidences. The characters and their relationships are developed in an instant. The actions scenes are from previous movies. The plot is from previous movies. The characters that are worth while are from previous movies. The locations are designed to look like ones from previous movies. I knew the ending just by watching a new hope. It's obvious that this wasn't intended to be a good movie but a good cash grab. Designed for nostalgia. Don't fall for it. It has good CGI and a star wars soundtrack, that's it.The people I know who love this are bandwagon fans who quickly saw each trilogy only once without retaining anything and would cry for hours because a squirrel tripped.",0
436,"This is the worst Start Wars ever.The story is mostly from episode 4 with additional stupid stuff and plot holes.Not much new and especially nothing uniques in this film.Even Episode 1 was better and more creative as this one.For me Start Wars is unfortunately dead.  Or was killed by Disney!?",0
437,"It is really disappointing.I was always a Start Wars fan but I can only hate this episode. This movie is a proof that Hollywood do not need to create great movies, but only rehash old popular movies in a bad way and hype it as much as possible to generate profit.",0
438,The movie does little more than take the same formula Disney uses for its Marvel movies and apply Star Wars iconography to it. Stars Wars deserved better.,0
439,"How this movie is getting so much praise is beyond me.  Oh it's got Han and Leia and Chewie and Luke?  Oooo must be 10/10 woo! It's basically a parody of Star Wars a New Hope, at one point I thought ""Am I watching an Austin Powers reboot?""  the ""First Order"" Empire was so inept it was bordering on three stooges stupidity with them not giving two **** about anything. Oh something crash landed on your planet base THOUGH YOUR SHIELDS no less and no one cares or investigates or even makes a remark about it. Oh somehow out planet base shields are down and NO ONE MENTIONS IT OR EVEN TRIES TO TURN THE DAMN SHIELDS BACK ON!!! Oh there is a force user loose in the base, shesh better not alert anyone or put anyone on guard or even how about sending out some storm troopers with those light saber blocking electro weapons...  nope nothing. Hey how about locking a door so Han, Chewie and Finn at least have to blast it open or even hack it open or even fight to get into the base!!!  NOPE!  Nothing, no cameras, no security, no nothing. And that's all just the last scene, I could go on and on and on about everything in this movie like how the Xwing pilots have no problem sniping storm troopers to free Han, Chewie, Finn (the three amigos as it were) but miss the giant imperial shuttle that's parked right out back. Or how Finn, who was a storm trooper janitor, knows important information about the imperial base.  Or how the imperials have THE REST OF THE DAMN MAP TO WHERE LUKE IS!!!!  But can't be bothered to send even 1 damn probe droid!  I mean seriously?! Ugh... I could go on for another 10000000 words on why this movie is awful and not worth money to see or your time, but I would basically just be pointing out more of the same. OH OH OH!!!  Don't get me started on a magical 2 seater tie fighter with back lasers and missiles!!!  TIE FIGHTERS ARE A SINGLE SEATER SPACE CRAFT WITH FORWARD FIRING LASERS ONLY!  Holy **** I still can't believe they couldn't come up with anything better than, hey lets just pretend Tie Fighters have this stuff cause we need them to be able to escape.  Hey JJ, how about they just take idk, a Tie Bomber... oh pry cause you didn't actually read up on any Star Wars lore... oh... 0/10 for the love of all that is good with the Force do not pay to see this movie!",0
440,"Abrams did a dis-service to Star Wars. It was Disney, yep you got disney. I expect Jedi princess Rae dolls in stores from now to forever...Movie was enjoyable but could have been told as episode X. There's 25 years missing between episode 6 and episode 7 .. It was a copy cat film re-playing episode 4. Should have taken on the EXPANDED UNIVERSE for the trilogy. HEIR TO THE EMPIRE would have made a better Episode VII then this... I want GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN and Mara Jade. Dont get me wrong It enjoyable but overall writing was weak. Great screen play. I hope to see how the new Republic actually rises on screen some day.....",0
441,"This movie, had so much potential, but like Anakin, it was cut short.  Kylo Ren in the beginning was seen as a strong force user who was seen to have strong mastery of the force as he not only stop a blaster bolt in mid air, but kept it there for several minutes and then release it at will. He also built his own lightsaber which suggest that he has training with it. However as the movie progress Kylo Ren turns out to be a b*tch. Not a badass b*tch, just a **** He got destroyed by the two main characters, and both were non-jedi. Rey also somehow becomes super good at the force FOR NO REASON AT ALL. That's not how the force works, yes it can guide people, but mastery of the damn force takes years. J.J. Abrams just gave a big f*ck you the legacy universe (what used to be cannon). Kylo Ren should have easily killed both Rey and Finn, but no, turned out he sucks at not only using the lightsaber but incapable to use simple force pushes or pulls against his opponents. Overall, Kylo Ren is a little b*tch, Rey somehow gets force powers that should take years to master, and Finn somehow managed to hurt Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel. If you haven't watched ANY Star Wars movies before, its ok. But those who are true fans will be disappointed.",0
442,"0 for the plot Without a plot there is not point in making a film. Therefore a higher score cannot be justified. BB8 does not have to deliver the map. It is not integral to the unit. R2D2 had to be delivered safely, everyone was looking for the droid, being associated with the droid lead to the deaths of Luke's uncle. When one can simply remove the map from the droid where does the tension lie with being associated with the machine? Why would someone in such deep hiding leave a map. This plot line is beyond moronic. A map is there to find treasure or inanimate objects not a human. Max von Sydow dies after 1 whole minute of meaningless dialogue. I don't know who he is. Therefore his death is meaningless, the bad guy in the film is not elevated to evil, just a senseless killing. A Stormtrooper, janitor, sent with a death squad to wherever, suddenly develops a conscience. Later in the film Budha trooper has no hesitation in killing his once fellow comrades, or picking up a sabre to strike out. He is not a Jedi the first to wield a light sabre without training, or believing in the force. Saving his once enemy Poe they become best of friends straight away. Upon crashing, with a handy parachute which seems to be located beside the downed craft, Poe is nowhere to be seen. He doesn't reappear for most of the film. No Tie Fighters chase the fighter to the planet to check it has been destroyed? Rey, the healthiest scavenger in the galaxy, soon to become insta Jedi, mechanic, pilot, just takes BB8 without any fuss from a fellow scavenger. Then decides to keep it instead of trading for food, really! You are starving to death and find a top of the range television, you can complete the rest. It is out of character. Straight away you question her and her motives. Rey knows the Falcon, inside and out, this heap of junk which by all accounts would have been a part of the ""legends"" which both Finn and Rey are aware, yet there it lies melting under the baking sun on the sandy dust hole all along in her back yard and no one thinks to scavenge it? When she does expertly fly it and later on partners Han she knows the ship better than Han or Chewie. Doesn't that make them the worst pilot and copilot in Star Wars lore, no wonder the Falcon never flew properly, all they needed was Super Rey the whole time. Undermines two vital characters, I didn't even trust Han to fly the Falcon for the rest of the movie. Ren, stops a laser blast mid air, gets hit by a wookie blasting him from farther away? 3P0 has a red arm, this furthers the plot, how? Apparently no spares even though Chewie meticulously reconstructs him in Empire? A third Death Star, that can be easily defeated after a quick briefing and no detailed plan on how to defeat it, just some off the cuff remarks as to here we go again folks. The purpose of the ship is to remove the sun from the solar system therefore meaning any or all life is not possible unless a droid populated planet were possible. Therefore removing the sun removes all life. What was the need to destroy the planets, just to have mega explosions to show children in the theatre that the big metal plant is bad and resistance is good. But what are they resisting against, wasn't the Empire defeated? Ren removes a mask upon which we find he doesn't need life support? So the mask is a toy, Disney sales for the mask cannot have been in the minds of the executives? The often scant use of the force, fast food Jedi mind tricks, insta powers, even Vader reminded us ""do not underestimate the power of the force"". It seems as if it's power has been diluted, somewhat. Jedi on tap. Hux a pre pubescent general, shouting and tantrum minded like Ren, exhibits immature and leaderless qualities, responsible to lead a force called the failed order? No new ships in either the Empire or Resistance fleets? Upgrades with new paint but no new craft, I remember wanting to buy Y wing, B wing etc... Disney missed a trick there with the lack of craft. Again lazy. But back to the film, R2 is depressed, Luke was by his side for three films even in Degoba, dumps him, his loyal friend, saved by him in many occasions, but dumped so he switches himself to standby mode. Suddenly at just the right time in the movie he switches on and reveals the rest of the map. Phew! Han locates the Falcon, fifteen seconds after it leaves Jakuu. Cue Ray Harryhausen inspired calamari to inspire him to take back his ship, even while watching this I thought please god no! But it got worse, cue triads from big trouble in little China and an extra from trainspotting. Bobba Fett would have been my choice, the worst scene in any of the franchise. Take a bow Disney. I paid to watch a 200 million pound B movie. I cannot fathom how this film made it past the cutting room floor. Don't even get me started with the lack of music score. Episode 8 the title can only be FROZEN the carbonite years! Han is dead and so is the franchise. It's crap all of i",0
443,"Awful.. Disneys, Lawrence Kasdans and Abrams retro-movie ist totally missing the magic of star wars. Just memories and ghosts. The Force Awakens is just another shallow blockbuster. Poor writing, directing, acting etc. Even the score by Williams is dull and uninspired. After screwing Star Trek, the next franchise is blown into pieces.",0
444,"This movie started off really great. The characters were really amazing. Everything seemed intriguing and I really wanted to know more. Half way into the movie, it took a turn for the worst. The first biggest problem with the movie was ridiculous amount of REHASH. This movie was basically a really really bad remake of A New Hope. Imagine replacing Darth Vader with Jar Jar. That is exactly what this movie did. The new bad guy is a **** He cries, he slashes walls for no reason, and  he gets defeated by a girl who has never even used the force or a light saber. Also, when one of the commanders snitched on him to the Sith Lord...He did not do **** He probably masturbates to the helmet of Darth Vader...Save your money... Watch something else",0
448,"After five days of thought, my judgement: a travesty The prequels explained too much, this sequel explains too little. The most prominent example of this is Rey. Having barely been aware of the existence of the force at the beginning, without any instruction – such as Luke (son of Darth Vader, hence strong in the force) needed from Obi Wan, later Yoda – she (magically?) becomes aware of it, competent in its use, and powerful enough to defeat Kylo Ren, despite the fact he is Vader’s grandson and Leia’s son (hence strong in the force) and has been the padawan of Luke before being turned to the dark side by Supreme Leader Snoke. Apparently women, unlike men, can use skills without first learning them. Then there is the political correctness (o.k. I suspect that last was motivated by PC too). J.J has to have Finn stupidly hold Rey’s hand too long after getting her to run, just so she can say “I know how to run. Let go of my hand.” J.J. also has to have her say “I can handle myself” when Han hands her a blaster. In general there is too much of the telling of strength rather than just showing it. Leia never had to say she was a strong capable woman, she just showed it through her actions, like grabbing the nearest available blaster to make an escape passage into a garbage compacter. Add to the hand holding silliness the fact that Finn, despite being trained as a soldier from childhood, always looks out of his depth in any fight, and it becomes apparent that the only way this “genius” can think of making a female character strong is to make a male character next to her look stupid or weak. I have nothing against intelligent feminism, but this is not that. Actually, I think feminists should be insulted by this too. It’s certainly insulting to the female fans of the original Star Wars, who saw in Leia a strong, intelligent, witty, and, most importantly, well-motivated character. Here instead we see lip service (or [eye] lid service?) to feminism accompanied by contempt for the underlying mythology of the Star Wars universe. You have to be a padawan before becoming a jedi J.J.; you have to be a student before becoming Sensei. What Rey does here is equivalent to someone with a white belt picking a fight with the master and kicking his arse around the dojo. I’ve chosen the masculine pronoun there, not because I think a female martial arts master is impossible – I don’t – but because the kind of feminist who would think this sort of thing is good film making would have no problem with a woman being bested by a woman but, no matter how great the skills of a man, no matter how mediocre those of the woman, they would be offended by her being beaten in such a fight. The kind of feminists who admire this sort of rubbish are, unfortunately, more common than their more intelligent namesakes in our anti-intellectual culture. All that said, if you like your feminism brain dead, of the warrior without wit variety, you’ll love the character of Rey. To be fair the fault isn’t Daisy Ridley's. It's entirely that of the writers and director. If I ignore this stupidity I can quite like the character of Rey, presumably because Daisy has plenty of her own charisma. Kylo’s helmet looks like a silly beak. He has no good reason to wear it either, other than perhaps trying to imitate grandpa Vader. Or is it worn to disguise the fact that without it he looks a bit wet? Then there are his tantrums, which look ridiculous, although they do provide opportunities for comedy. General Hux when ranting like Hitler to the assembled storm troopers sounds nasally and weaselish rather than threatening. In his conflict with Kylo Ren he looks more the smug schoolboy than the imposing general. Supreme Leader Snoopy – the big baddie, literally – is impressively threatening, but it turns out his giant stature is hologrammatic. This has comic potential. Is he a Wizard of Oz type fake? Could he possibly be only 2 inches tall? Poe Dameron. I like his sense of humour when taken captive. He would make a good replacement for the now dead Han. Oh, that’s right, Han Solo dies, but we all expected that to happen anyway, so no great surprise there. I was a bit disappointed in the manner of his death though. I was hoping he would go out in a hail of blaster fire or chopped down by multiple assailants, thereby allowing his companions, in a desperate situation, to escape. Instead, on top of yet another Freudian conflict between father and son we have a soppy attempt at reconciliation resulting in a too predictable death by Kylo’s lightsaber being turned on. Kylo doesn’t even look threatening when he does it. The only good thing about that scene is the rage of Chewbacca that follows. Good ol Chewy! Friend for a lifetime. I felt more for him than for Han. How will he cope without Han? Will he turn to drink or drugs to cope with his loss? Will he cruise all the brothels in the galaxy in a futile attempt to replace that male to male bond with ""romantic"" companionship.",0
449,"You know what? Special effects are cool. That's why so much people gives 10 (10!!!!).Han Solo is not the same anymore. The whole story is copy-paste. The final scene is totally nonsense. Kylo Ren is lame and Rey is overpowered. Chewbacca is the only true character of this movie.And stopping laser midair... c'mon.",0
451,"What is Force Awakens? Does it feel like Star Wars? No it doesn't. It took me maybe 1/3rd into the film to get a smidgen of a Star Wars vibe. Ever wonder what Star Wars would look like fast paced & gritty with hard color grading, editing, & angle shots? You know, like Star Wars fan-films you see online? Force Awakens is filmed in JJ Abrams style. Lucas would use mostly flat & face shots. Yes that is a very static way of filming, but it is also a very classic way. It lets you focus on the richness of the scene. Everything was so stream in Force Awakens that it felt like a cheap 3D amusement park ride. But how were the characters? Rey? Daisy Ridley is wonderful, but sadly she's written as a Mary Sue. Literally every action she does is: showing up the boys. & I mean every. single. action. There are at least 28 moments..... in the film where they directly show this to you, then do a camera wink nod - she can take care of herself. But I love her charisma and my ""only hope"" is to see her in other things besides Disney Star Wars. Ohh Finn. The new Jar Jar Binks. Ohh wait, Jar Jar actually had a strong character arch & came from a creative well designed species with incredible indigenous technology. What was Finn? A former Storm Trooper who gets sad one of his unit dies, then has no problem murdering his poor fellow troopers to go AWOL. What's more? They remove Boyega's beautiful Chav accent & make him talk like....a ""typical"" American. Yes they go out. Even giving him cringe lines like ""Droid Plz"" ""H3ll No"", & everything trope you can imagine. He was a clown buffoon & was literally saved by Rey every scene they are together. What's more, his fake US accent is horrible and sounds HORSE while yelling (which he does a lot). If you thought Anakin and Padme were awkward in the prequels, baby you ain't seen nothing yet. I had to look away, close my eyes, etc many times during this. It was that cringe worthy. Wow. Do Boyega and Daisy have good chemistry irl? Absolutely! But it's lost when you change accents. Typical Hollywood fare, changing accent for zero reason. It doesn't work. It's not convincing to native speakers of the accent. Stop. Onto design The new Stormtroopers look horrendous, okay. We have to see so much of them, and it's these goofy gigantic duckfaces. They also seem to be composed of pure eggshell white non-reflective bristol board. ....George Lucas exercised a level of Quality Control over Lucasfilm that is now gone. JJ was given Kasdan, Williams, & Struzan. Keys to the kingdom. But what does he do? He does what he SAYS he did. Sat there like a giddy fan-boy, letting them ""do their magic"". Lucas certainly did not. He micromanaged them. The results are obvious. TFA John Williams score: mediocre TFA Drew Struzan poster: mediocre TFA Lawrence Kasdan script: rehash Experiment made! And the results are...guess what! It really was Lucas' genius that pulled together his 6 films. Lucas even added all of the good elements to Empire Strikes Back. Yes, George Lucas. In Conclusion...Star Wars Episode 7 The Force Awakens is THE worst SW film by far. I rank it below every prequel & guess what. Lucas said it is ""not his story"". meaning Not Canon. The closest thing we can get to his treatments are the EU material that yes, still did go across his desk to get approval. So please. Don't insult me this fan service JJ fest. Blips. Tiny references. Blowing up Coruscant. Death Star 3 (destroyed in the most passionless way imaginable) With Lucas there exploration, freshness, richness. Now we know why he left the project. Those people didn't understand. It's about Imagination. Wonder. Pushing Boundaries. Never again will we have wild NEW RISKS like a muppet kungfu master..giant gangster worm who chains up women in bikinis..forest kingdom of man eating bears..pod-racing..arena fight..kamino..courosaunt Any of that. It's just ripoff the originals time. Even Geonosis, also a desert planet, was completely fresh under Lucas' s supervision. Tarkin > Hux Emperor > Snoke Boba Fett > Phasma Vader > Kylo Ren Darth Maul, General Grievous, Count Dooku too all of these prequel villains far surpassed those two bit unoriginal variations in TFA. Sadly with Kathleen Kennedy ... quality control lack extends to everything. SW Battlefront, Novels, Comics, everything. She's not an artist & doesn't have Lucas' mind for approving design. and remember, this is Disney, so NO SPACE BATTLES. *sigh* it looks like Star Wars is over. I did not enjoy this film one bit. I was bored by the nothing because there was nothing. I followed this film for an entire year. What we're given is an MCU level film. A film that is not re-watchable or even cohesive. I have no desire to own the Blu-ray or watch it again. Why would I? For what? It's a forgettable movie with nothing creative or interesting. Nothing to feed the imagination. It's Hollywood. You made me appreciate George Lucas that much more.",0
452,"I am a long time star wars fan.  I've watched all of the movies multiple times.  I like both the clone wars and rebels cartoons and I've read about 12 of the books.  With that being said, I did laugh a handful of times and enjoy the special effects but I was looking for something new and creative.  I clapped and cheered in the beginning of the movie and by the end I was slow clapping to JJ Abrams.  I was so disappointed by the copy cat scenarios and the utter disrespect for the force as I suspect any invested fan will be.  The greater betrayal is ultimately these are not the droids I was looking for and probably will never again be.",0

456,"THERAPY FOR STAR WARS FANS.  Long-time Star Wars fans out there, I feel your pain.  I am your pain.  I've loved this franchise since 1977, and after 38 years, it is over for us.  JJ played it safe by making a movie that was sure to appeal to younger viewers who never cared much for Star Wars but would crush the hearts of long-time fans, a stunning new experience for newbies, a problem-ridden remake to the rest of us.  Why did he do it?  Because younger viewers are where the money is.  Ignorant of the fact that this is just a sad cobbling together of scenes from the classic films, younger viewers are gobbling it up as if it’s a stunning new breakthrough film.  They just don't know any better, and that's the whole idea.  Blind to what they are actually seeing, they are paying hand over fist for this movie while those of us in the know sit in slack-jawed amazement at the travesty that we are witnessing.  There is just no gentle way to put it.  JJ Abrams has sold us out. But here is how we have to deal with this.  Yes, we were all looking forward to another chapter in the Star Wars saga, and yes we are all disappointed that we didn't get it.  But there is no changing that now.  What's done is done.  That being the case, what we must now realize is this.  There is only one way that we could have possibly enjoyed this film and the future installments as well.  We would have to watch them in the same condition of ignorance that these younger fans are in.  In other words, we would have to have never seen and loved the classic films that captivated us so.  We would have to erase from our past the amazement and the wonder that Star Wars has given us for all of these decades.  Yes, it would have been great to have enjoyed this movie, but such enjoyment could only have been purchased at the price of the original epics.  No one who has ever been truly moved by this Franchise would ever accept such a tradeoff.  Let the younger viewers have this film and those to come.  Let them enjoy this shadow of the original under the delusion that they are witnessing an innovative new marvel.  Let them do all of this while we rest firm in the knowledge that what we ourselves experienced was the true masterpiece, an irreplaceable treasure that these merely derivative new episodes simply will never be.",0
457,"Kylo Ren, a whining fanboy, who dresses up as a pathetic wannabe-Vader, and doesn't know or understand anything about the legacy of the past, throws tantrums and thrashes around his own ship when he doesn't get what he wants. And then kills his own father, who, unlike him, was a true iconic hero.A deeply symbolic film.Every hero from the past is made a total failure. The Republic is blown to pieces. Morals, logic, coherence, originality, imagination are eliminated, as is the established visual and storytelling style.For the ""fans"", that's not Star Wars.Replace it all with explosions, zig-zagging camerawork and mindless editing (today called ""quality filmmaking""), poorly choreographed dogfights, dumb, tonally misplaced jokes, over-the-top space nazis, totally out-of place Scottish gangsters and yakuzas, and cheesy, Highlander-style, circling helicopter shots. To hell with everything else! Especially with that mumbo-jumbo about the Force! Let everyone wield a lightsaber and have their instant Force-powers! (You may keep the old costume and starship designs. And the plot, because we don't need a new one. Don't worry, we'll call it an ""hommage"".)There you are.

458,"After doing his two Star Trek movies, JJ was stuck in rehash mode with this one.  The difference is that Star Trek was announced as a relaunch, but this film is called 'Episode 7,' in other words, a continuation of the existing franchise.  Talk about a disappointment.  I breathed a huge sign a relief when I saw all of the critic reviews (which I now find inexplicable), only to be astounded by what a God-awful film this was.  To quote Luke upon first seeing the Millennium Falcon, 'what a piece of junk!'",0
459,"Daisy Ridley (""Rey"") was brilliant and may save the franchise - overall though this is the most overhyped movie of the decade.

460,"I have no idea how this film is getting such rave reviews.... I actually don't mind that it has plot similarities with a new hope, my problem is with the use of Deus Ex Machina as the sole means of plot advancement. For example, why is there a map to Luke's location if he disappeared? How did Finn manage to crash land on a planet in a location that just happened to be near Rey's village? Why was the millennium falcon on her planet and how lucky that Chewy and Han found it just after Rey and Finn? That's the first half hour of the movie alone and it continues for the duration. Really lazy screenwriting....",0

The treatment of the original characters is baffling.

Because it makes no sense whatsoever and the storyline tempts one to believe it was assembled on the back of a lunch menu and given to a bunch of talentless nobodies (majority of the cast) to act out. The simplistic narrative is a 99% fat free version of Star Wars Episode IV:  A New Hope. The first 10 minutes of the film starts off strongly however Abram’s lazy directing provides zero explanation as to how or why ‘the resistance’ or ‘the first order’ happened. There’s no explanation to anything and Abrams use of cosmetic superficial introductions of characters and themes is used a cheap substitute for solid story telling the series was accustomed to. Details matter, the audience deserves to know: - how the dark side and the wannabe villain came to be- how the death star 2.0 was built (given the empire was defeated) and was destroyed using the same method as version 1- how the most daring pilot (Poe) supposedly dies then magically reappears again- how the main female protagonist whose sole occupation was stealing spare parts with absolutely no training can defeat a Sith and mind control storm troopers. The fact I even have to mention these criticisms is a testament to Abrams inability to direct a story. All of this is compounded by Abram’s injection of Social Justice Warrior brand of feminist philosophy. - The main female protagonist (Rey) is overly hostile and crude in her conduct deploring any form of male assistance like shouting several times ‘let go of my hand’. Her actions and conduct emasculate all male characters in her presence including her wooden side kick Fin.- Hans Solo’s persona is guttered and he literally has to apologise and justify giving Rey a gun and consistently complements her to reinforce her status. In a perverted move to cement the feminist narrative, the film has Hans Solo mercilessly degraded to such an extent to symbolise how sick and repulsive the patriarchy is. This is achieved by having him killed by his son who is an extremely weak white male absent any characteristics of previous villains to symbolise the cry baby mentality SJWs despise. None of this necessarily is a problem if the film even bothered to substantiate its themes with solid lore, but it doesn’t. To add insult to injury, the film is poorly paced and during the final quarter everything is entirely rushed through. Leia who has never even met Rey is hugging her, Chewbacca who historically isn’t the easiest character to get along with is suddenly without any justification best buddies with Rey and the final battle scene is fleeting. Star Wars Episode VII is a mockery to the series. It has been maligned and warped into a talent show to champion a single person rather than celebrating the efforts of the many in the previous movies.  It’s clumsy, poorly directed and an insult to its fan by presenting obtrusive SJW feminist ideology masquerading as equality.",0
463,"Reused content from the old films. Yet again, there is a Death Star to be destroyed. Yet another force field needs to be downed by Han Solo and team. The Emperor is back, the same old bald man. Darth Vader also has a reincarnate, another masked villain, but he fails to scare. Another bar filled with aliens. Another fight on a bridge over an abyss. The only novelties are a heroine and a hero of african descent (?).  I missed the revelation by Chewbakka that he is gay. And the film manages to be worse than episode 4. The last SW movie I will see in this life, a waste of time and money. Oh, I forgot to mention: it is incredibly predictable and also boring.",0
464,This genuinely fails to deliver on almost everything but nostalgia. To be perfectly honest it barely even felt like star wars. the plot is insanely dumb and the villains are terrible. This is everything I feared & worse.,0
465,"I literally don;t know if poeple watched a different movie than I did. This movie was visually apealing. Beyond that it was, as everyone else has said, a complete rehash of the original trilogy. Except it was poorly done. The part I hated the most was the Rey. She at everything - instantly. She is better at the force than a trained ex-Jedi. She is better at flying and repairing the Millenium Falcon instantly than Han Solo himself. She is perfect with the force. She beats up people trying to steal BB-8. The list goes on and on and on. I love moives with strong female leads. This was different. THis was just sloppy writing without a character arc. I hope the beginning of Episode VIII is Luke finally talking and telling her to keep his old lightsaber because there is absolutely nothing he can teach her. She is already more powerful than he ever was - instantly. I saw the movie twice just to make sure that I wasn't crazy. The second time I saw it I realized that I hated it even more than I had at first. Then I watched the original trilogy just to make sure that I was remembering the originals better than they were. Then I watched the prequels and realized that they were at least original storylines wiht cool ideas - even if poorly executed. I would have given this movie a 7 out of 10 if it stood alone. As movie VII in the Star Wars universe it is a complete copy of other movies. This was a poor reboot. Nothing more. See other 0 or 1 reviews for the rest of my views. I've wasted enough of my time and money on this dumb movie.",0
466,I had high anticipations for this movie before I watched it. I left the movie theater feeling sorely disappointed. I found myself not liking any of the characters. None of them. They all suck and make a mockery of how easy it is to learn the ways of the force. Apparently nobody needs to be taught anything to learn how to use jedi mind tricks and force push. It was all **** It made the original star wars characters look like jedi retards for taking so long to become incredibly strong and knowledgeable in using the force.,0
467,"Being totally honest, this movie is a joke. Not a joke that deserves a 0 but I can't, for any reasonable reason, see it at 8 or 7. This movie is better than I and II but it stops there. You simply can't get a major character killed by the worst SW villain ever created. Even him killed by Jabba or Greedo would have made more sense. Also the plot is 90% rehashed material / nostalgia tricks.JJ failed big time and this movie put in clear light how much ""real critics"" are being paid by majors to sponsorize box office movies.I've seen the movie 2 times (just to be sure) and the only likeable character in the whole movie was Ray. Villain could have been more believable if he didn't remove his mask (half the cinema laughted at his unmenacing teenage face) or if he didn't fail against not 1 but 2 lightsaber noobs.Sorry but No. I expected much much more than:Star Wars IV Remix: The Whiny Teenager",0
469,"Nostalgia Porn Episode XXX: Not The Prequels Were it not for the fan service and the progressive/feminists pandering, people would realize its just a shallow remake of A New Hope that lacks any real emotional impact with the most interesting elements of the movie happening in exposition stories. The more I think about the motivation and creative drive behind this movie, the ugglier it looks. Jedi and Disney are manipulating the fans with X-Wing porn and fan service, and puppets wile adding nothing of substance to Star Wars that we didn't already have. We have female Jedi. We have black characters. In the Clone Wars cartoon we had an intersperses couple that had hybrid children (something that's far more interesting than a forced interracial romance) Is anyone even against that anymore in our society??! I wouldn't even bring it up if it weren't for the fact that JJ clearly cast these characters to look like a progressive champion among his Hollywood buddies. Expect Episode X to feature an African Luke if Finn doesn't end up with Poe in another progressive twist in the last movie. It would not surprise me at all if that happened since they already ripped off enough of a New Hope. I know if I was going to make a lazy progressive rip off Empire Strikes Back to follow up this, I would have Finn and Poe for the sake of forced equally straight out of a gay star wars fanfic. They already made a third Death Star, had Ray successfully performing and Jedi Mind + beating  (but not killing) the bad guy, shipping Ray and Finn together is the only logical step forward in this pattern of nostalgia/progressive pandering. And that does happen, anyone who does question the cinematic or literary of Episode VIII will be condemned for homophobia. Story telling is dead, and Hollywood thinks you are all idiots who will eat anything they serve you if it has a nice coat of paint. Say what you want about Lucas, but I would rather watch a three hour Jar Jar Binks stand alone film than be re-fed my childhood and calling it better than Revenge of The Sith (One of my all time favorite movies second only New Hope which they just ruined.)",0
470,"Here I was all worried about spoilers, not realizing I'd already seen them all 30 years ago :-(The effects, and particularly the new cast were great, but screen time that could have been spent better introducing the new characters was wasted fawning over the previous cast in ways which barely served the plot. And, a THIRD Death Star, really?",0
471,"This move should have been titled Star Wars: The Farce Awakens. It's a remake of Episode IV only in its production design and plot devices, but betrays all the basic ethical and metaphorical principles that, on an unconscious level, constitute Star Wars mythological foundations. Here are two examples: 1. The Empire (Evil) glorifies technology, the Rebellion (Good) uses technology merely as a tool. Notice Han Solo's sudden fascination with Chewabacca's crossbow (after 40 years of friendship). His constant remarks about how much he likes Chewie's weapon are in contradiction with the metaphorical values associated with Good established in the original trilogy, and even the prequels. The Millenium Falcon looks like crap because it's just a tool that gets the job done, as opposed to the Empire's clean, well-preserved and beloved ""technological terrors"". 2. The Dark Side is Quicker and Easier than the Light Side. These values teach us the importance of effort and learning to reach our potential. As opposed to Luke, who needs three movies to master the Force, Rey is able to use precognition, telekinesis, and even mind tricks without training, guidance or any effort whatsoever. Her use of the Force follows the principles of the Dark Side, but it's presented as beloging to the Light Side. The ""lesson"" contained in this new approach to the Force is that people are predestined to greatness (or failure), regardless of their effort and ethical values. This opinion would have been subscribed by Goebbels. But the lack of ethics in this movie is not exclusive of its content. It's also present in its form. This movie has more in common with Lost than Star Wars. It's conscious plot holes have been designed to foster endless internet debates as a free marketing tool. A good plot doesn't leave room to debate, because there's only one correct explanation. Darth Vader uses a helmet because he needs it to breath. End of the discussion. Why does Kylo Ren have one? No one knows, and the Internet can go and fill millions of pages trying to sort it out. Hint: there's no correct answer because, simply, there's no answer. This farce is an exercise in emotional and marketing manipulation. It can only seduce you if you allow it to. Thankfully, people grow wiser in time, and lies are unmasked sooner or later. I predict this movie's scores will continue to plummet, and in a few years it will be completely forgotten from our collective memory.",0
472,"The Force Awaken plays it way too safe and it feels almost rather like a nostalgia trip than a new story line with interesting story arc. So much has been borrowed from New Hope. The villains are so underwhelming and cliche. They are more pathetic than evil honestly. The good guys are kicking butt with hardly any training. Luke was actually struggling for entire 3 movies against the empire. I'm sorry but the attempt to be politically correct has ruined it. It's really a fun movie for family outing. Maybe kids will love it, but you're not going to find a lot of creativity and interesting new stuffs with this one.",0
473,"What to say? With so much hype and anticipation I was always worried it might not live up to expectation, but I really was shocked and taken aback by how many missteps this film makes! I love the original Star Wars movies, I didn't think to much of the prequels or though I loved the story and the back story of Palpatine / Darth Sidious. So I was hoping for a fresh story, some new and old characters that could push the films forward. We got the characters but not much else, the story is possibly the laziest, most patronising piece of drivel you could come up with. They have literally just rehashed A New Hope and sprinkled in a few bits from Empire and ROTJ!If you ran a competition for 12 year olds to come up with the next Star Wars story i'm convinced it would have been x10 more original, thought provoking and true to origins than this! The plot holes are too numerous to mention the amount of ridiculous coincidences are embarrassing even if the force is somehow guiding the characters destinies it still boarders way to often on the ludicrous. I really could have lived with all this if they just made it semi believable and at least tried to explain things but they didn't. As many people have mentioned the main character Rey manages to pick up everything way to quickly, within minutes of being on the Millennium Falcon she's telling Han Solo whats wrong with it!? She masters Jedi skills quicker than any Jedi from any of the movies or even the books (admittedly I've not read all of the EU books...YET?) but still this just comes across all wrong, we want to see her grow in a way Luke did in the original trilogy. I liked the idea of Finns character a storm trooper with a conscious, but again its handled in way to pander to a younger audience and felt like another missed opportunity. Kylo Ren was my favourite part of the film, I know a lot of people thought he was too weak and no doubt he was but I liked Adam Driver in this role and thought he conveyed the inner conflict thing well and couldn't help think if only Anikin had been done more like this in the prequels. Ultimately he disappoints though as he gets bested way to easily by the two leads, I mean come on? He was stopping blaster bolts with the force at the beginning of the film but by the end he struggles with a ex storm trooper who's just picked up a lightsaber for the first time! One lesson I hoped they'd learned from the prequels was when to use CGI characters and when not too, but for some reason they thought the role of the wise old Maz Kanata would be better suited to CGI, she just didn't fit in with all the other real characters around her, the whole cantina/cafe/bar was full of fantastic aliens all of whom looked real and true to the original films so why CGI Maz? Especially when you've got a fantastic actor in Lupita Wyong'o doing the motion capture and voice work?? Just get her to actually play the character? Another scene was on Han Solo's ship when he's transporting/smuggling some huge monsters, this done right could have been a great scene! but instead we get ridiculous poorly done CGI giant otcoslugs! that conveniently get accidentally released and eat all the bad guys who again conveniently show up at that exact moment! I mean come on Disney, surely you must have realised that this scene just looked like something straight from Farscape or doctor who? I really could go on all day expressing my utter disappointment but I think I have already ranted on far too long and for that I apologise but it hurts to see a franchise beloved by so many get treated like this. Its clear that this film was all about ticking boxes to maximise its marketing potential to recoup some of that 4 BILLION Disney spent buying up the franchise. I suspect JJ Abrams probably had a lot less input into this film than he'd of liked, it really feels like a board of directors tore up the original script and said we have a better idea JJ now tow the line theres a good boy! Two words sum up The Force Awakens - Corporate Greed!",0
474,"""The Farce Puts You to Sleep"" Boring, predictable and poorly written, rarely am I so disappointed in a move. Farce Awakens seems to somehow be worse than Phantom Menace without needing Jar Jar or Midi-chlorians. Recycled plot, so much so that avoiding spoilers is pointless, and writing so full of holes you could fly a death star through them. Overall the movie came across like poorly written fan fiction, even by the standards of most SW fics. The next episode better be ""The Writers are Forced Back to School""",0
475,"1 points for BB8 being big fan of R2D2, I was very afraid of this new droid but I fell in love2 points for Rey it seems really well in this character even if the repetition of character luke is really rough.3 points for the scene millenium falcon on Jakku.But then Kylo Ren, grand-son of that you know who, humiliated by a black stromtrooper while stormtrooper normally clones of Jango Fett and it is not black.With a teenage face that looks more out of Lord of the Rings as Darth Vader.And after being formed by Luke is also afflicted by a small chick who just want to discover the Force and a lightsaber for the first time.and Kylo who succeed in stopping a blaster bolt while Yoda and the Emperor never managed that.shame on you, Disney, shame you and you JJ Abrams is a fan of star wars .... LOL Sorry for my english, I'm french But I really want de write this",0
476,"Pros:  The special effects were a good blend of CGI and actual sets.  I've gotten to a point that I tune out when I see CGI but they had enough real props and tangible stuff in this movie that it kept me intrigued.  Seeing the old faces and my old toys back on the big screen was awesome too. Cons:  In just a few words, this was terrible story telling.  The story was completely disjointed, literally no character development, way too fast paced and I left the theater not caring about any of the new characters.  Poe seemed like the only old school star wars  character in the movie and I think I would rather see a movie about his development.  Finn absolutely annoyed me.  His character flaws made him unlikeable and I wish he had bailed, or ran away one of the numerous times he said he would or never woke up from his coma.  Rey is interesting but not a great character to build a franchise on.  Kylo Ren looked promising but by the end, I hated him because he was such a loser.  Snoke looks dumb. A huge, giant big miss with Phasma.  The voice just did not match that trooper and then Phasma does nothing of relevance.  On the whole, the first order is made up of spoiled nazi youth kids which is hardly a novel image in a movie and I can't take any of the seriously. There were a plethora of opportunities to really build up scenes and add some gravity to the situations but literally if was like a cliff notes version of a movie.  They could have really built up seeing the falcon for the first time but instead it was treated as unimportant.  How Hans Solo was handled was a travesty, although I wished his same fate sitting in the theater.  When I saw the death star I literally laugh out loud in the theater.  You have got to be kidding me, is this space balls 2?    They did a spectacular job in the fact that 5 planets of good guys got destroyed and I had 0 emotional reaction too it.  That takes serious lack of story telling.  The plot holes and never ending train of fortuitous coincidences made me want to gag and left me shaking my head.  A guy who could stop a laser with his mind, couldn't handle a sanitation worker? They said JJ is just trying to sell toys, but who would a 7 year old boy play with in the cast of new characters? My son won't likely pick Rey as he is a boy boy and none of the other new characters are not very cool.  In all, I am very sad.  I would have been much better off watching the trailers because the movie I had played out in my head was so much better than what I saw on the screen. Ok, here is how we fix it.  Kylo is actually a good guy and faked Hans death.  Finn is a spy for the dark side and tries to get Rey away from the jedis influence and recruit her.  Rey can keep being Rey but they were hiding her from learning about the force because she would be too powerful.  She turns to the dark side, after finding out that Luke left her even if it was for her own good.  Kylo does his best to try to help his cousin find the light side.  Poe keeps being starbuck.  Snoke mysteriously is never seen again in another movie unless Harry Potter movie comes out.",0
477,"Just saw Star Wars.   This is what i thought.1)  It was so juvenile it should have been on Nickelodeon.2)  The casting/acting was terrible, cliched but with what the actors had to work with wasn't much they could do.3)  The script was so uninteresting and dull.   Didn't make sense.   The characters only interest was their historical Star Wars interest for some SW'ars afficiondos.4) The special effects were totally dull.5)  This movie must be a tribute to Madison Avenue marketing.6)  The only redeeming feature i can think of was that I saw something in 3D (which i like a lot) but the thouroughly stupid/childish script and poor special effects ruined that too!7)  Lastly,  i was laughing at parts i shouldn't have laughed at and  if they advertised this as a comedy 'take off' on Star Wars i think it might have had some redeeming value.",0
478,"I watched the movie twice. In brief: things I liked: - Most of the first act on Jakku- Some shots and sequences later in the movie- The acting of the whole cast (Carrie Fisher excepting, sad to say)- Harrison Ford (he played Han Solo well and carried the movie through the middle) In brief, things I disliked: - The unimaginative derivative plot- The lack of context and background and explanation- The movie is too full of deux ex machina and people and circumstances lining up too perfectly too frequently- The leads bond together far too quickly- The bad relationship between Han/Leia and their son Kylo/Ben is never shown; just stated as such. This robs Han's death of any real significance or meaning as it is not believable. A terrible way to go out for an iconic character and hero.- The dialogue is bad. As bad, in a different way, than the prequels. Because there is so little explanation in the movie, characters are left to mouth terrible exposition as dialogue which sounds awful and still explains little. The movie asks you to do a lot of joining of dots. But, doesn't really even provide you with enough dots and you are left with making stuff up so that it fits or just turning off your brain. Neither is good enough. Nor is having to wait for Ep. 8 for any sort of explanation for the background to the movie or the motivations and choices of the characters. It is lazy writing and poor story-telling. To continue: - Poor world-building. I rarely, accept for the opening Jakku sequence, got that sense of immersion and world building I regard as quintessentially Star Wars.- Poor score. John Williams does a terrible job. Not sure that I blame him, though. I think there was little in this movie to score in the way he used to for Star Wars. The cinematography and story-telling is too different. His music can't help tell the story anymore, probably because there isn't much of a story to tell.- Destroys the legacy of the Original Trilogy. The main heroes of the OT have all regressed. As for Luke, he has run away with scarcely a word of explanation almost as if his heroes journey never happened. This, to me, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the source material. But, JJ Abrams did the same thing with Star Trek: ID where he did the same thing to Wrath of Khan.- The new characters are all bland and boring. Rey is, in essence, a Mary Sue. Finn is scarcely believable (no explanation is given as to why he left the FO) and seemingly exists only for comedy effect. Poe is a stereotypical 'super-pilot'. Kylo had potential but his temper tantrums are not convincing, and are portrayed for laughs. This undermines the character. He can be scary or funny. Not both. They are all uninteresting.- The movie has far too many wise-cracks and laughs. The prequels tried to be too serious. But, this goes the other way and is far too 'laugh-a-minute'. My first viewing left me a little confused. My second was easier because I expected less and watched the movie for its own sake and for what it is. A light easy assembly line block-buster with some Star Wars thrown in. But, make no bones about it, this is a mediocre movie: lacking creativity, inspiration and imagination. As the movie jumped frenetically from sequence to sequence toward its predicable end, I was just bored. As a long time Star Wars fan, I do not consider this a genuine StarWars movie. Merely a poor caricature of one. I give it 3/10.",0
479,"At least he was original with the prequels and tried to explore different issues and topics with the 1st half of his story which really is the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker by his son Luke Skywalker. The movie has tons of plot holes and you don't need to recycle an entire plot to reinvigorate a great series. This was P.C. Star Wars. Finn was such a stereotypical African American character, all loud and making unnecessary comments. Dude came off like a fanboy in a Star Wars film, crossed with Will Smith in Wild Wild West or some other stupid film making a joke every 5 seconds. And before someone even dares pull the race card, just look at Lando in Empire Strikes Back. There was a strong minority character, who was just as suave and sophisticated as Han Solo yet he sold him out only to become a hero when he realized that he was wrong. Finn went AWOL but then spent the whole movie making jokes...like come on. And don't get me started on Kylo Ren, dude was cool from a character prospective but he was soooooo emo. What supposed imposing villain wrecks a room when people fail him, Darth Vader killed his own military personnel and walked off without a care in the world trying to accomplish his mission. The prequels often struggled to establish any sort of clear storytelling conceit, beyond the idea that Anakin Skywalker would eventually turn to the Dark Side. Yet they also tried to move beyond the simplistic ""good vs evil"" conflicts in the original technology. They didn't succeed at this, but their ambition to tell more subtle, political stories about how easy it is to be corrupted by power and greed offered more nuance than they get credit for. This falls mostly on Lucas because everyone and their grandmother knows he can't write dialogue; he never could. He is a visionary. You have to ask yourself, are you as emotionally invested in a story when you already know the outcome...the answer is no. That's why the prequels are only good when you watch Episode 1-6 in order. It gets progressively better until, to steal Darth Vader's quote, ""The circle is now complete."" You watch just the Original Trilogy it is like ""What is this prequel crap???"" The Force Awakens takes a totally opposite approach, mostly just offering up far too slavish devotion to the entire Original Trilogy. Yes there's a new poorly developed conflict between good and evil. There is a new character who must be trained in the ways of the Force, yet there are plot points and character beats that are lifted wholesale, or just disguised with a simple gender flip. That's lame when it comes to storytelling when it lacks true originality. That's why The Force Awakens is trapped by its forebears. Everyone wants to say that this was a return to form. The series was not a massacre in a scrap heap after the prequels, that's the language of over zealous fanboys who want to crucify George Lucas for doing whatever he wanted with ""his"" story/series. The Force Awakens is a total disappointment and the greatest fraud in the history of film. The Original Trilogy is 24 Karat Gold, The Force Awakens is Fool's Gold...it look like Star Wars, sounds like Star Wars, but it doesn't shine like Star Wars. I rather watch A New Hope 10 times in a row on my 60"" HD home set-up then spend $13 to watch The Force Awakens in IMAX, pretty much says it all.",0
480,"Worst Star Wars film ever! As I finally got to see Star Wars last night I felt the soul of  Star Wars universe evaporating before my very eyes. The movie was cringe worthy. Yikes. How can it be getting such good reviews??? With the exception of the original casting (Harrison Ford...) the acting was terrible. The character Finn was annoying and incredibly awkward. Worse then the addition of Jar Jar Binks. He ruined the movie. And just when I thought Disney managed to produce a cool sith lord Kylo Ren takes off his mask and reveals he's some mix of side show bob and the Jonas brothers goofy step child.  And what about super size Gollum as the ""Supreme Leader"" of the dark side. And Don't even get me started on the plot. All the writers at Disney did was plagiarize George Lucas's plot  from the first three films and tweak it a bit. Come on Hans Solo is Kylo's father, all they did was reverse George Lucas's epic revelation in Empire that Darth Vadar is Luke's father. This film has ruined star wars for me forever. Only great thing about the film was the great acting of the Original cast. And then they go and kill off one of Star Wars best characters, Hans Solo. Terrible film.",0
481,"The sad decline of the force If you want to watch how is it possible to destroy a classic and all its characters please don't miss this attempt of saga. Since Disney bid for great effects and CERO originality Star Wars The Force Awakens is not more than a bad and textual copy of its original movie. Perhaps some nostalgics can be too happy viewing their old characters again as to not realize the lack of ideas and arguments. The biggest disappointment of the year.",0
482,"A massive disappointment and an insult to our intellects. There are a plethora of user reviews that cover all the negative points. What amazes me are the critic reviews, i just feel they saw a completely different movie.Without spoiling any of the plot (as if there is something original):- no character development (although the idea of the new characters has a lot of potential)- a lot of convenient coincidences to move the plot along- the Star Wars lore is discarded completely- stirs little emotions (several people walked out of the theater during the movie, and I was constantly looking at the time)- predictable outcome and ridiculous events and settings- huge plot holes and severe lack of political context (it's as if Ep VI didn't even happen)- musical score forgettable- marginally entertaining, but for a Star Wars movie, ""fun"" just doesn't cut it Missed opportunity of the decade!",0
483,"First of all, for all the 10 star reviewers out there complaining that the negative reviews are all trolls and haters, this is just completely false. Please read the negative reviews, these are legitimate issues being voiced by legitimate and passionate Star Wars fans. This franchise is so important to me that I've been depressed for the entire week since I've seen the movie. It drove me to create this metacritic account to add my voice to the discussion in order to give myself a much needed outlet for my disappointment. This is therapy... To me, The Force Awakens is not a Star Wars movie, but rather just Star Wars porn for fanboys. I am a fanboy; but this fanboy lost a part of himself sitting in the theater last week watching what was a very forgettable sci-fi flick that happened to be set in the Star Wars universe. When I think about the movie, all I can say is ""meh."" So bland. There were ZERO moments when I was on the edge of my seat and super engaged in the film. What a waste, this could have been the moment when the franchise got back on track. There was so much to draw from and so many really great options for the future direction of the story, I just cannot believe this is what we ended up with. Poor form, JJ Abrams and Disney & Co., you ruined Star Wars for me again (disastrous Episodes I-III anyone?). Here are the primary issues with the movie: UNBALANCEDRookie good guys (even if they're force-aware) do not beat ex-Jedi/Sith. They do not perform Jedi mind tricks out of nowhere (I was so confused when seeing that scene in the theater). They do not become ace pilots instantaneously. So on and so forth... CGIUsing CGI for Maz and Snoke was a very poor choice. This really distracted from the story and felt out of place. Snoke was straight up 80% Voldemort / 20% Gollum mash up. So cheesy... PLOT HOLESStormtrooper sees comrade die and senseless killing. Switches sides and commits senseless killing of his ex-comrades. Jedi master goes into hiding so no one can find him because he messed up, let's leave a treasure map to find me! So many more plot holes, just not enough characters available in this review to do this right. KYLO RENI actually love the idea of a young, unstable, tortured soul as the new bad dude. Problem is, he's not a bad dude. They should have made him really kick some @ss so you are in awe of him. He should make you fear him and make you think ""oh man, we really need Luke or we're dead."" Do not take off your mask. OLD ACTORSCarrie Fisher was painful to watch. Harrison Ford for me was also not fun to watch. MISSING SCALE/SCOPEUse CGI in space. Show 100s of ships when the Resistance is talking about their ""whole fleet."" Having a mix of old and new spacecraft duking it out would have really helped this movie. OTHERLiteral storytelling was brutal (don't hold my hand, good pilot). Music was surprisingly not epic. As so many other users have stated, one of the absolute atrocities committed by this film is the blatant disregard for the balance of power and well-established rules of the Star Wars universe. A newly force-sensitive individual should simply get obliterated by an ex-Jedi Padawan / Sith in training. An ex-Stormtrooper originally on sanitation duty (really?) should have absolutely no ability with a lightsaber, let alone be able to fend off Kylo for more than 1 or 2 blows. A scavenger should not be able to pilot the Millenium Falcon with ease after seeing it just sit there collecting rust for 30 years. A young Sith lord shouldn't have the power to freeze laser blasts and read minds in the first place. Even the Emperor and Vader couldn't do that. Juxtapose that power with Kylo's inability to defeat rookies in lightsaber duels and you see what I mean. A super planet-sized weapon should not be able to be constructed by the remnants of the well-oiled machine known as the Empire when the empire spent so much of its resources constructing a weapon a fifth of the size. Where did the First Order all of a sudden get the resources to pull this off after the fall of the Empire? Certainly they are less in control of the galaxy now. I could continue for a while here, but you get the point. All of this serves to discredit and weaken our favorite characters from the past. Their struggles and sacrifices become meaningless and insignificant. What is the point when thinking about the events and gripping struggles in Episodes IV-VI if they are just re-hashed again here? The only saving grace here would be Episode VIII coming in and filling in a bunch of back story to correct all this nonsense. Somehow Rey was trained as a Jedi much older than the flashback lets you believe. Maybe if she was further trained on Jakku by one of Luke's students you could make an argument here, but the film does not foreshadow any of this, and we'd have to wait 2 years to realize such a cleverly hidden plot device. That's a lot of time to have angry fans on your hands. I for one, am not holding my breath.",0
484,"I almost never write a review.  In fact, I never have created a review here, but I felt I had to give a score that it deserves.  I'm seeing users giving a score of 10!  OMG, really?! This is STAR WARS, the biggest, most influential sci-fi saga of our times.  Any new Star Wars movie has VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS!  You cannot view it by itself, rate it by itself.  It will ALWAYS be compared to the best is the original trilogy. Very disappointing to say the least. I actually felt cheated.  JJ Abrams: really? is this the best you can do?  It is mostly garbage!  Acting is ok.  The writing and directing is pure trash.  I really want my money back. Most have said it already, read the reviews. - Not believable tech.  A bigger death star sucks in an entire star and does not collapse in itself.  Wait.  They destroy the death star, and it makes a small explosion.  HAVE YOU SEEN the size of the star (that was consumed) compared to the 'death star'?  You would think absorbing that much energy would have created a giant supernova when it was destroyed. - No character development.  I have no love (or hate) for any of the characters, no attachment, no feeling.  It felt like when you sit down at home and you start watching a movie half-way, and you don't understand a thing, and you end up not caring about it.  People have said it ... meh! - People magically know how to use a light-saber and fight off a well-trained Kylo Ren. - Kylo Ren is defeated by someone with little or no skills in a matter of minutes?  Kylo Ren, the same guy that stopped a laser in mid-air and freezes people by extending his hand?  man! this is garbage. George Lucas, PLEASE buy this franchise back from Disney and make something worth bearing the name Star Wars.  PLEASE! PLEEEAAASEE!!  Crowd source it, I'll hand over my 401K, mortgage my house, but don't take money from the moronic people who funded TFA that only wanted to make a quick buck.",0
485,"Throughout this movie I was thinking ""Who the h%&# is that guy?"" As in what is that character doing in a star wars movie?<br/><br/>After the movie was over i saw no happy face in any of the other moviegoers, not one, and the theater was packed. There is usually always someone hyped after a good effects movie. Nothing.<br/><br/>""I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.""<br/><br/>(btw. No fantastic lines to quote either ... nothing ....)<br/><br/>I never write reviews, but i have to comment this. I did not have great expectations to the movie, as i knew that Disney had taken over the franchise and thus probably would try and milk it for what its worth. In a way i was glad, because it meant more star wars for us fans.<br/><br/>Somehow they managed to create a movie with all star wars looking parts, but no feel.<br/>It felt like the parts where chosen by focus groups from current buzz-words and opinion polls.<br/><br/>So since the product seems to come from cynical businessmen, my response is in a language they will understand.<br/><br/>1. I will not spend more money on star wars or star wars related products for quite a while.<br/>2. I will recommend to friends and family to do the same.<br/>3. I will write reviews like this where ever i can.</span><span class=""blurb_etc"">&hellip;</span> <span class=""toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand"">Expand</span></span>

It's such a downer because I love Star Wars and had such high hopes for the future of this franchise. With all of the money that this film is making, there is no doubt that Disney will double down on this approach and the next one will be terrible too.

More like Nevada, Scotland and Germany.<br/>Casting? -0 Emotionless, talentless, un-charismatic stars. From Ray to Finn to Ren.<br/>hanging - This is the part that truly made me jump in my seat. Really long loooong pauses in dialogues vague starring.<br/>Script? Ran a SW marathon just before the TFA to refresh my memory. Oh boy the rip-of. Completely copy-pasted the script of Ep4. And the dialogues suck soo soooo soo much.<br/>Photography? An absolute failure. Apart from one good take (while moving forward the camera on the subject instead of zooming in ) it's bland, no amazing landscapes no interesting lines nothing.<br/>Information? The movie doesn't give us any at all.<br/>Plot holes? Lightsabers are supposed to be used only from the trained jedi. Not some girl from the movie twilight who ""concentrated"" and learned to use the force while fighting between a cliff and a SUPER-VILAIN apprentice who is taught greatly in the ways of the force. A guy who can stop blaster beams!!!.<br/>Gore? Seriously this has to stop. It's called star WARS not star fights. It's supposed to have killings, death dismemberment. Where are the hands that are cut off clean? Just because the teens of today will have nightmares we are denied from the privilege of some good ol' fashioned violence?<br/>Music? toun toun toun to totoun to totoun, bam bam bam ba babam ba bam. I don't remember any tune from TFA.<br/><br/>Whenever I watch movies at home I jump forward the bits that suck. I could watch TFA at half the time and still not miss a thing.<br/>Poor movie. Maybe watch it once. Compared to the others is ****<br/>And I am not a SW fanatic I think they are ok, a classic like LotR or Godfather but this has no rewatchable value at ALL.</span><span class=""blurb_etc"">&hellip;</span> <span class=""toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand"">Expand</span></span>

The reviews for this movie are only good because the casting show's a new era of PC - by casting an african american, a spanish guy and a female to be the leads. Let me tell you - they are all awful, especially the girl. Aside from the bad casting - the plot and story are the same exact ones you've seen before even a *SPOILER* father/son relationship between a darth vader character and Hans Solo. Really?!   Other than being a sentimental throwback to the style of the original Star Wars, there is no redeeming value here.</span><span class=""blurb_etc"">&hellip;</span> <span class=""toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand"">Expand</span></span>

With all the media, and marketing hype, I was expecting to see a really good movie. I was disappointed. In particular, I hated the character of Rey; she was a Mary Sue character. I hate Mary Sue characters in general. Everything was so easy for her. She just flipped her fingers and everything worked for her. How the hell did you learn to do the Jedi mind control thing?<br/><br/>Harrison Ford's performance was so pathetic, that I actually felt happy when Han Solo was killed - one less annoying thing in this movie phew! Every male character in this movie was pathetic. Seems like guys in this movie were in touch with their feminine side in this movie. Who wrote the script? A bunch of teenage kids?<br/><br/>I bet Superman hates Rey. Superman, for example, is allergic to kryptonite, and he got his butt kicked by Wonder Woman. What could be more humiliating for a strong muscular dude than to get his butt kicked by a chick that looks like a supermodel? On the other hand, all Mary Sue Rey does to get out of a tough spot is say ""i'm good enough, i'm smart enough, and, doggone it, the force is with me"".<br/><br/>If the movie producers would have chosen Ronda Rousey for the lead role, I would have bought everything done by her without questions. Ronda is built like a mean bad-*ss scary fighter, unlike the actress that played Rey. When Ronda says jump, you reply ""how high Mam!""; she doesn't need stinky Jedi mind control tricks.</span><span class=""blurb_etc"">&hellip;</span> <span class=""toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand"">Expand</span></span>

I had no idea it was going to be a remake of A New Hope, otherwise I may have waited for it be released on DVD.  What is wrong with Hollywood ? Are there no original ideas left ? They basically replaced Luke with a girl and and Darth Vadar with a stroppy man child, and copied the entire plot (which was thin in the original to begin with) of A New Hope.  The writers somehow thought it would be a good idea to give us a conflicted villain, seems like nothing was learned from the prequels, they also forgot the lessons of what made the originals great, simple is best, Star Wars is not Russian literature, we don't need need complicated villains who are torn between good and evil, nobody cares if he misses his daddy, we just want our villains to act and behave as villains do, don't we ? Minor annoyances,  Carrie Fisher, it really shows that she hasn't acted for decades, she was pretty awful.  The under 25 group of officers that run the death planet thingy, no wonder it got blown up (Grand Moff Tarkin is spinning in his grave), the stormtroopers who really cant aim straight, maybe they are all former waste compactor operatives and janitors. The main cast are an enthusiastic bunch but they lack the star quality of Ford and Hammil, I had forgotten their names 5 minutes after leaving my seat. The music was also not memorable, something I expect from a Star Wars movie.  Plus points for me was Jakku, even though it was basically a copy of Tatooine it worked well, Han Solos little side operation smuggling giant dangerous monsters brought a smile to my face, even though Ford looks and acts his advanced age, Han should be relaxing somewhere on a beach spending his retirement loot, not risking his life being chased by bounty hunters. The last scene with Luke on that beautiful Irish island was a nice touch.  I left the theater feeling empty and disappointed, needless to say my nephew absolutely loved it, and i suppose thats who it was made for.  A good kids movie but lacking in originality and depth  and not much better than the prequels, but thats enough for it get a good review it seems</span><span class=""blurb_etc"">&hellip;</span> <span class=""toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand"">Expand</span></span>

They didn't have charisma or something that can catch you to feel happy when looking at them.<br/><br/>I can't say that the movie is bad, it is not but I expected more from it. It's star wars, on of the biggest space action movie ever, and as everyone already pre-said ""Disney will ruin everything"". And this phrase is kind of true.<br/><br/>I want to say thanks for J.J.

It turned out, my expectations matched what I saw in a latest instalment of the saga. I ask myself: why do these things happen? After contemplating for a bit, I come to think that one needs a firm grasp of philosophy and science, a good eye for actors and a cunning storyline, in order to deliver a Sci-Fi masterpiece. A visionary, a man capable of immersing you completely in a parallel reality, where heroes and villains become real.<br/><br/>Well, JJ Abrams simply isn't the man for the job. I'm sure he would be able to make fantastic ads for TV or something similar, but to wave a magic wand on stage of Star Wars .. one needs somebody else. Disney, that was bad judgment. You could as well invite me to do the job, I could screw this film up for half his fee.</span><span class=""blurb_etc"">&hellip;</span> <span class=""toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand"">Expand</span></span>

486,"I just love the fact that more and more fans are coming out and rating this movie for what it is: pure trash!  It is shameful that the critics can be so byass. It leads me to believe they have been bought by the Disney corporation to give this movie a good review. I cannot give this movie even a one point rating, it is embarrasing to sea that supposed professionals can be so lazy and slopy to produce this kind of embarrasing movie.",0
487,"This movie is a carbon-copy of the original trilogy, let me state that in the first sentence. But I admit it is possible to overlook this obvious flaw.What isn't possible to overlook is the overall stupidity of the plot. It has more plot holes than swiss cheese: the clone army is _completely_ gone form the universe for some reason, the new Death Star is capable of sucking the suns dry (!), but still has not only the breathable atmosphere (!!), but also snow (!!!), shoots a laser beam that splits into five at a random point of its trajectory (!!!!) and leaves behind a functioning sun after being destroyed (!x5).Heroes pull off impossible stunts (like synchronizing their shooting and piloting while being in different rooms of the ship and not communicating their next move verbally); the main protagonist is a Mary Sue who has no inner flaws that make her human or likable, but has abilities that far surpass that of the most powerful Jedi or Siths shown in the previous films. The antagonist party, the New Order (they are the Empire, but with a much more straitforward Nazi vibe) exists not because it is justified by the course of history over the last 30 years, but because Disney needed something stormtrooperish to market as toys. Otherwise, the New Order shouldn't even have any resources to begin with.Overall, The Force Awakens is not a film - it is a massive marketing machina designed specifically to help Disney try their hand at striking specific cords in the souls of the fans.",0
488,"So this is what happens when Disney buys a franchise - Cut out the best parts of the previous parts, clue them together somehow, put a lot of state of the art CGI on top of it, then sell it as a ""rejuvenation / fresh start"". In fact, its just all the same stuff all over again. The writing must have looked something like this:"" Ok... lets do this.. hm, but that was all already done before. - I have an idea, lets make it... bigger! Excellent, then we don't have to find something originally NEW. Our fans will love us"" . Or maybe it was all about fear from Disney Execs of disappointing the core fans, thus starting **** storms all over. Thats why they probably thought recreating ""core"" scenes of the original as closely as possible and sell it as a new movie is a clever idea. And yeah, because it looks so incredibly familiar and close, lets rename the planets... that will make us look innovative. Hell, you can say a lot about George Lucas and some of his more stupid character or story choices, but at least he tried to tell HIS story. And he did it quite well in his first 3 movies, and not so well in his prequels. And, though some of his characters where plain stupid and an imposition ( Jar Jar Bings), at least they kind of stayed in character and were unique. Some of the current main cast and the plot feel hollow, only Han Solo rescues many scenes with his presence. Was it really required to burn up all the cool storylines that were created in the books by Timothy Zahn for... this? I have to admit one thing - they did an absolute briliant marketing strategy with all this secrecy and non-spoiler policies. That probably means the hype will carry the movie through, even if it is only a medicore sci fi movie with plot holes so huge that a star destroyer fits through.",0
489,"For all the hype, this movie fell many steps short.  What a disappointment.  While I enjoyed seeing old characters again, there is a reason Carrie Fisher has not had much success as an actress beyond Star Wars. She was absolutely horrible.  There was very little story or character development.  The new Dark Lord was portrayed as a whiny brat who threw temper tantrums, destroying his own ship, any time things didn't go his way.  The plot jumped from scene to scene and there never really was a sense of menace from the 1st Order---whom the audience knows virtually nothing about.  Silver linings - the new, diverse cast of main characters and John Williams film score (though it fell a little short on character themes).  Bottom line - I want George Lucas back!",0
490,"At the moment Ren took off his mask, revealing a teenage emo Loki, the movie was on life-support. The first half built up a mysterious & powerful villain who even stopped a blaster beam in mid-air, suspended it for several minutes & then released it. So they set up an intimidating & fearsome villain, a must have in any Star Wars movie, then they completely obliterate that half way through, revealing our feared villain to be a petulant, wiry, goofy looking kid played by a bad actor. And it just got worse from there. The moment the movie went off life-support & died is when they all gather round the 3D image of the new Death Planet rip-off & then Miles from LOST figures out in 20 seconds that, lo & behold it has almost the exact same weakness as the Death Star in IV! After about 30 seconds of explanation it's like ""ok...BREAK! Let's do it!"" From that point on the movie was a pathetic, rushed, re-do of episode IV's Death Star attack. I actually couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was like a parody. The Death Planet even had a trench! Fancy that! Just lazy garbage. And the fact that people still don't care that they were given a cheap remake (not to mention the rest of the countless issues with the movie) just goes to show that our average movie goer could be fed Bantha droppings on cardboard for 2 hours with the Star Wars scroll & theme & think it is the best thing since sliced bread. But the parallels to IV don't stop there! If only they did. From the very beginning we see plans, or in this case a map, put into R2-D2, I mean BB8, so they can escape the clutches of the Empire, I mean First Order. BB8 ends up on a desert planet, Tatooine, I mean Jakku, where he runs into an amateur pilot, Luke, I mean Rey, stuck on the planet who dreams of going into space. Wow! Why didn't I think of this plot! Incredible! First we meet Finn, who is this trilogy's answer to Jar Jar Binks. After being raised a First Order Stormtrooper his entire life, he suddenly decides he can't kill people, chooses to leave, leaves, & then ends up killing his former stormtrooper mates with no conscience. There is no great inner conflict portrayed, no depth of character, no background, no character development. He just decides it's not for him & bam, he's out there slinging comic relief one liners. Then he meets up with Rey. Rey is a starving scavenger one minute who then suddenly turns into a combination of Steven Segal, Obi Wan, & Chuck Yeager. Why? Because Girl Power! 1st she's struggling to find enough junk to keep herself alive by selling it. Next thing you know she is single handedly piloting the Falcon better than the Red Baron. Then through coincidence (which is the only way the plot ever moves in this movie) Han & Chewy just so happen to tractor beam them in. Then Rey suddenly becomes a 1st class engineer who would put Scottie to shame! She starts lecturing Solo about how his ship works & knows it better than he does. Plus she can speak Wookie & droid! Rey's character is never developed, she's unrealistically perfect at everything without trying, & thus we could not care less about her as she's not credible. Later Rey is captured by our emo barista, Ren. And Rey ends up using the Jedi-mind trick! How does she even know about this? Ehh, who cares. Fans are dumb & they'll buy it. Maybe she watched episode IV? The movie spends about 5 seconds on the father-son relationship between Han & Ren, & failed to emotionally invest us in it one iota. Ben-Ren impales Solo with the lightsaber & he falls off a walkway into oblivion. Chewy is over it in 30 seconds.  Yep. There you go. 3 movies worth of beloved character sent off in a rushed, poorly done scene with no suspense. See ya Solo! Later, Rey starts fighting Emo-Ren w/ lightsabers… & proceeds to start kicking his ass!? Yes, she goes  from starving scavenger to beating a trained jedi with a light saber she’s never used. Wow, this light saber thing isn't so hard after all! Maybe next episode 3PO can finally take the gloves off, issue a crowd roaring taunt to Ren, ""Bring it, wuss!"" & then start delivering the best ass kicking light saber jiu-jitsu we've seen since Yoda in the prequels! In the originals Luke failed at everything & it took him 3 movies of training & losing to even become a Jedi Knight, not even master, & finally beat Vader. That is called developing a story, developing a character, building feeling for that character, building suspense. It's basically called movie making 101 which is apparently now a lost art. In the end this was a lazy, special effects, copy & paste job meant to entertain & make money with no concern for any sort of plot, consistency, depth, character, credibility or anything else. JJ got you to the theater, got your money, & even got a large number of nostalgic fans to check their brains at the door & like it. Mission accomplished, Disney!",0
491,"I hated Lucas prequel, but at least he tried something.Here we just have a lazy rehash of a new hope featuring such original features as:* another desert planet* another snow planet* another cantina* another Yoda character, except red* another death star* guess what, this death star happens to have a trench to its weak point. I guess it's a mandatory feature* another death star explodingAlso for some reason, despite the fact the Rebellion killed the Emperor and blown up the Death Star (the second one), 30 years later it's still the Rebellion fighting the Empire except now the Rebellion is called the Resistance and the Empire is called the First Order, because... Well because probably the writers were afraid of coming up with original ideas. The Kylo Ren character is kind of interesting in that he has some personality. The main problem is it's the personality of a whiny child, almost a Scott Evil parody which is *actually* played for laughs once in the movie. While it is a bit refreshing it is actually very inappropriate for a villain that should instill some menace and that instead is so inefficient at litterally everything that you almost want to point and laugh at him. The general guy seems looks like some teenager in an ill-fitting costume and Darth CGI is, well, just big lump of CGI. In fact the bad guys are so inept almost like cluncky cartoon villains. Maybe they didn't to scare children because Disney? Anyway it's bad. The good guys are as white bread as it goes. The Finn character is supposed to have some depth because he was a stormtrooper or something but seriously who cares, he just ends being your generic wise-cracking sidekick.Rey makes you think about some bad video game character. She is completly bland. She can do anything and she goes from one Serie's main character to another in a series of pointless cameos.The characters from the old trilogy are shoe-horned into the movie for no good reason. The plot is the same as in ""a New Hope"" except with more coincidences. The Death Star is bigger but it blows up just the same. Actually when the Rebel... eh, I mean the Resistance blows it up your just surprised not having some StormTrooper yelling ""Oh, no, not again!"". Again, I hated Lucas prequels but at least he was trying to come up with new ideas. In comparisons this movie is some kind of souless counterfeit concocted by Disney's mad scientists. Oh, yeah, the laser saber fights ditched the dumb jumping around from the prequels to something more appropriate. So at least there's something.",0
492,"ok serious review this time. I managed to get a copy online. The following review will analyze both the trailer and the subsequent garbage that was released in theatres. Firstly, in the trailer, the real fanbase was pandered to with flashy tie-x-wing fights and a new lightsaber. They introduced two key protagonists, Finn and Rey. And the return of han solo.  The badguys were going to be kylo ren and captain phasma. So how did this trailer seduce so many fans for the impending box office blowout? It didn't. It was all media. Toxic internet communities like reddit were hyped for months for this movie. Twitter, facebook, this movie used all forms of social media to make sure every single living being knew about this movie. The trailer was just a seduction tool, to show some flashy action and to create expectations. It showed set-pieces in rapid order, starting off with a desert area, followed by a space sequence, a spaceship interior, a village, a forest, and finally a snow landscape. All these sequences adjacent to eachother make the audience expect a dynamic and fast-paced film. And that's what the masses want. Hollywood knows that audiences don't want to sit through a movie BORED! So they fabricate this trailer which would appeal to masses. And this brings me to the film review. The key problem is not a predictable plot. It is the lack of character struggle - of inner conflict, of any insightful themes. In addition, acting, script, and directing were flawed. The black protagonist is a stormtrooper who 'betrays' his federation and then can easily go on a stormtrooper killing rampage moments later. There is no explanation on how the darkside draws kylo ren in. As such, these two main characters feel tacked on the film. The plot moves these characters, but the characters make no conscious effect towards the plot. It is as if they are puppets on strings. They are so empty, and devoid of human character. As aforementioned, there is no emotional reaction to the stormtrooper's situation of betraying his troops. The only counterexample is in Rey's character, who was really believable as a poor woman living by trading junk. Midway in the film, her character is ruined though. The minor characters use a script of one-liners and the camera tries to make every character shine through jarring closeups and rapid character and camera movement. Again another counterexample is the far-shot scene of kylo ren meeting han solo on the bridge with the light and dark motifs. A big scene like that might be the reason for the positive reviews, however thefar too numerous flawed scenes detract from the few good moments like rey's introduction on the desert, and kylo ren and han's meeting. Now I'm no film elitist and I've tried to keep the review informal to this point. Also, I'm not a film buff but tried to use some critical theory of art since I am interested in theodore adorno's philosophy.I downloaded this movie expecting a fun movie, but ended up repulsed. Don't line disney's and jjabrams pockets. Don't go to the theatres, and I hope this review is a lesson on all Hollywood movies hyped by social media. Don't be superficial.",0
493,"Пробуждение силы - фильм играющий на ностальгии ""фанатов "" серии не выражающий никаких новых идей. Начнем с сюжета: во-первых повстанцы победившие империю , опять сражаются с ней, только в новом обличии - ""Первый орден"". В фильме показано более нелогичное облучение джедая, Рей только прикасается к мечу Энакина, так бац она умеет внушать, владеет телепатией. Качество картинки довольно посредственное, за исключением некоторых сцен. Бои на мечах смотрятся, как бои на дубинках ,в о время этой битвы не был применён не один прием силы, ав едь могушество Кайла было показано в начале фильма. Возражение старых героев словно битьё  трупа, ввели героев, что-бы они больше не показывались исключая исторически важных(Люк).",0
494,"Several years after the events of Return of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker has gone missing and a new empire known as the First Order rises from the original Empire after its defeat, vowing to not stop until every Jedi is dead. In the beginning, we see Rebel Resistance pilot Poe Dameron meeting with a companion that gives him a small device that poses significance of searching for any of the remaining Jedi. It isn’t until The First Order creates an ambush and leader Kylo Ren kidnaps the pilot. One of the Stormtroopers, however – cannot bear the trauma and chaos The First Order delivers, and decides to escape the reign of the dark side. Along the way is a girl Rey, strong-willed and sort of resembles a female Luke Skywalker based on mannerisms and her slow transition into a much stronger character with a surprise twist in the middle of the movie. Soon, all three meet up together along with a likely group of old friends from the original Star Wars movies that will band together to take out Kylo Ren and The First Order, while protecting the droid with the clue to Skywalker’s whereabouts. Pros: Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac are the only stars in the movie who really stand out. Daisy as the adventrous and rebellious Rey and Isaac as the wisecracking badass Rebel pilot Poe Dameron. The visuals are amazing (the space fights, the large creatures in the Millennium Falcon, the new Death Star’s laser) Bringing back the old cast (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, Peter Mayhew). Good character development with Rey, Poe, and the new Resistance. The sets and locations in the movie remind me of the original trilogy’s planets Tattooine, Hoth, and Yavin 4. The supporting villain General Hux is powerful with his speech to the First Order when they are about to wage war with the Resistance. CGI with certain characters (Clerk that Rey goes for metal money, Supreme Leader Snoke, and other supporting roles who help out Han Solo and the Resistance.) The script is better than some of the original trilogies’ dialogues and has improved from the prequels. The movie is fun with its sense of humor and visually striking battles. The twists and turns, such as Kylo Ren being a former son of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker exiling himself after Kylo Ren turns to the dark side is surprising. Mixed: Finn is an all right character, goes from traumatized by the First Order’s cruel and violent actions toward anyone affiliated with the Rebels to being some sort of happy go lucky hero. Poorly developed but could have had a better start and better actor to play the role. They should have also made the character more conflicted. The story moves at a slow pace until the newcomers meet up with some of the rebels and the old allies feels rushed. The friendship between Rey and Finn feels forced, but could progress a little better. How do these characters know how to fly the Millennium Falcon? If this was a real situation, nobody would even know how to pilot a ship like that! Cons: Kylo Ren and the actor who plays the villain is one of the most critical mistakes ever made in this movie. Where Darth Vader showed plenty of power, discipline, and was super calm under pressure and receiving bad news, Kylo Ren is so weak – He walks like a Californian surfer, throws tantrums like a little child and has a monotone Batman voice when interrogating his victims. Rey is given Mary-Sue qualities near the end of the movie instead of just giving some sort of background as to how she is able to fight well. Han Solo was killed off too quickly and it was obvious and predictable as to what was going to take place that moment when Han Solo confronts his son, convincing him to change back to the light side. There isn’t too much background about how the First Order was established after the fall of the Empire. There was only one lightsaber duel in the end, and it was TERRIBLE. It looked more like horror icons going at each other rather than a real, intense fight with heroes and villains who have practiced REAL light saber duels for a very long time.

Felt like a style-over-substance type of movie, with the story being less of a concern in the movie and visuals being important.

The Stormtroopers are lame as well. In the originals, the Stormtroopers were more combat hard and authentically genetically controlled soldiers while in this movie they act like rookies and are more like video gamers who were transported into a virtual reality.

Lor San Tekka was only in the movie to advance the plot, but could have been useful later on in the movie..",0
495,"Overall a very disapointing movie:- the plot is basicly the original trilogy condensed in 2h16min, but done very badly, full of plot holes and non sensical situations- the really fast paced rythm doesnt allow for any emotional connection whatsoever, even the death han solo is brushed off in 2 minutes- the darth vader rep aka kylo ren is beyond ridiculous, the CGI emperor clone is average at best- and most surprising of all even the music is subpar, never though i would say that about a john williams score but here it is, its like he knew he was doing a cash grab for kids and didnt even try.",0
496,"nah, i see fanbois push their +10 reviews. it was actually so bad it didnt worth the time ive wasted on watching it... the actors are rubbish, i could play better, the story is one by one episode 4 except that here isnt even a story just running jumping exploding shooting exploding monster eating exploding shooting end of movie... when i watch episode 4-6 i feel like they have made a 2 hours movie about days, months or years, this one on the other hand looks like they have made a 2 hours movie out of 5 minutes of events... lame. lame screenplay, lame actors just lame everything.",0
497,"2 hour toy commercial. Seriously, that's what this movie is. A marketing exercise which has no regard or respect for the universe George Lucas created. Sure, the prequels were not great but this film didn't have a tenth of the atmosphere and production value they have. From the opening scene I never at any point thought I was watching a Star Wars movie. There is no suspense or atmospher to the film. The new characters are undeveloped and I just didn't care about them. Finn the storm trooper who does sanitation ? Is a bumbling idiot in combat.Ray seems to be just there to appease the feminist/PC brigade by rejecting a mans help at everything and being able to do everything instantly like flying a ship, Jedi powers, combat with no training at all. The baddie kylo ran or whatever was ok until he took the mask off to reveal a spotty teenager who throws the most laughable temper tantrums and despite being trained by golem gets his asked kicked by Finn and Ray who have never used a light sabre before Harrison ford was the only good thing in this movie which brings me on to killing off Han Solo. It was done so badly it was awful. You could see it coming from a mile away. Leia threepio Luke and Argo are just wheeled out along with props and settings from the original trilogy just to provide nostalgia and a week attempt to make it Star Wars. The general and all the other actors gave pretty much soap acting at best and that include Finn. The Death Star 3 lol was a joke with another single point of weakness. Oh and the republic gets destroyed by it but I didn't care it's just so badly written. General Leica is leader of a resistance who's ""fleet"" consists of about 8 swings ??? There is so much I could rant about that's bad I just  cannot write it all up it would be a book. Basically Jo Abrams and Disney screwed Star Wars up and there's no way to unscrew it. And as another reviewer said it makes the prequels seem a whole lot better at least there was a story to them of some substance",0
498,"A combination of characters not being fleshed, bad acting and not staying true to Star Wars lore make this the worst movie in the franchise to date. This was an obviously pushed through production with the intentions of making the profit margins as large as possible and not focus on character development or delivering a compelling story line. The main focus of Disney is on selling merchandise, and the cash crop Star Wars is. Some might argue Star wars was always meant for children but this is a new low. Any grown man or woman buying into the not only unbelievable plot but unfaithful Star Wars fandom must have fell asleep during the movie.",0
499,"I really looked forward to this movie, but came away disappointed.  The story line is just a remake of an earlier story.  Yet another ""Death Star"".  Really?  Another version of Darth Vader.  Really?  I suppose I was expecting an original story, but not so much. At Least Harrison Ford won't have to come back for the next episode. I imagine George Lucas is laughing--all the way to the bank",0
500,"I'm dumbfounded how this movie is getting good reviews in some circles. This movie is horrible. And I'm sick and tired of critics giving positive lazy reviews of something that history will show was crap. You don't care about these characters. You don't care ( outside of Hans Solo) about anybody in this film. Nothing is explained. There is no edge of your seat story to hold it together. In short, this thing goes nowhere!  a complete waste of $10, and 2 hours of my life I can't get back. Look, I wanted to like this movie. I did. But there was nothing. Bad acting. Bad story. Bad music. Need I go on? Save your money. Your welcome.",0
501,"WTF, that's some movie which i hated. I'm one of the first generation star wars fan's. but this movie is terrible. Self the bad boy is no secret anymore. When he is angry he destroys the Console with his light saber instead of killing the messenger. There is not really any story behind it. just a combination of old topics. Nothing is really new. And the new Actors are terrible. This movie don't deserve a rating at all. That's more made for from the production straight into the video store. terrible",0
502,"Well I just watched it and I was very disappointed, the casting was horrible and there was no Luke Skywalker..  how could two untrained Jedi overpower a sith master? it does not make any sense... plus the love between the two characters seems forced and not realistic at all... I am a huge star wars fan and have collected all the toys etc... I was ok with Phantom menace but this movie was just to predictable.",0
503,"As a major SW fan since childhood (I like all the films, including the prequels, as well as the expanded universe comics, novels and even video games), basically I am the ideal fan that every corporation wants to have, I am massively dissapointed in this film. It basically makes  the prequels look like masterpieces, whatever flaws they may have. George Lucas >> JJ Abrams. Read the rest of the realistic negative reviews if you want more detail on why this is so bad. I've already wasted enough time with my opinions on this. But I am not letting the blind fanboys get away with the hype, the film is bad and deserves to be remembered as a bad film, this should be a lesson for future filmmakers on how not to butcher a beloved film series. Giving this a 2 only for the somewhat good first act on Jakku. The rest of the film is just face palm after face palm, bad one liners, plot hole after plot hole.... it's just UGHHHHH.",0
504,"I created a metacritic account just for this movie. It sucks, seriously. Like it's been said in previous reviews the story is horrible, the relationships between characted terrible, the character developpement non existent, the villain ridiculous, humor is misplaced (this is not the avengers.) And what the **** is Voldemort doing here ? I'll add that WE ARE IN 2015 : pretty SFX are standard now. It was amazing back in 70's/80's and was sufficient to make a great movie. But it's not anymore. Did you watch Starship troopers ? And then did you watch Starship Troopers 2 ? That's it, same sensation. But imagine there was all that big hype around starship troopers 2 and everyone said it was the greatest movie of all time. And you're here like : wait...what ??",0
505,"Why is this movie doing so well?  Because Episode 4 was a great movie, and Episode 7 is a remake of it?  But why aren't fans turned off by the fact that it's just a remake?  Because the majority of them are too young to realize it.  Almost nothing in this movie is at all new, and the little bit that is new is either not good, or doesn't even make sense.  It's a truly awful insult to long time Star Wars fans everywhere.  I wonder if this will start a new trend in Hollywood of remaking old movies and disguising them as new.",0
506,"I signed up to just voice my novice opinion on this movie. I've never written a review on anything, so this probably won't be too good of a read. But this movie failed. And what I can't understand is how it has received such praise. The trailers looked great and from everything I read and saw in the promo videos, it looked like it was in good hands. I feel like Abrams/Disney did some kind of Jedi mind trick and it took the awfulness of the movie to snap me out of it. I was amazed at how horribly let down I felt during and after that movie after so much promise leading up to it. I agree with most of what everyone else is saying who gave it a low rating and I can appreciate the fact I'm not alone. I went into the movie only knowing the trailers, so I had no idea what the actual story was. What a dreadful letdown.  Boy... anyway. Pros- The chicken sandwich I had, very tasty Cons- The movie",0
507,"I was very disappointed with this movie as it essentially had the same plot as Star Wars A New Hope with a larger death star. There were so many plot holes and too many convenient coincidences (Rey finds Luke Skywalkers lightsaber in the basement of some bar??). The empire and rebellion have been replaced with the First Order and the Resistance, but the movie does not explain how these groups came to be. You have to wait until the end of the movie to see Luke Skywalker, and he does not even speak.  Stick with the original Star Wars movies. I can't believe there were so many positive reviews for this movie! Ridiculous.",0
508,"A movie made not to tell the next chapter of the saga, but to pander the disgruntled ""fans"". No, this is not a continuation of the six-part saga from George Lucas. That was a story made by an artist. This is a cheap copy of one of its chapters made to sell.",0
509,Were critics praising this pile of garbage under the influence of the jedi mind trick or something?  What absolute cowards!  No one experienced in film could possibly look at this joke and not see it for what it is:  1/2 rip-off of previous films and 1/2 incoherent ridiculousness.  Beyond awful.,0
510,"In a world where there are nuances and parodies of Star Wars everywhere from Spaceballs to Family Guy I would never have thought the franchise itself would fall victim to this trend. The similarities with A New Hope are endless but that's not what I'm going to write about. Star Wars always has an honest story to tell. This was more fan fiction than film yet even fan fiction can still be great. Some people don't understand that there's more to Star Wars than lightsabers and spaceships. The originals was a story about a revolution in a pirate themed sci-fi world with heavy Taoist philosophy and samurai. The prequels were sort of a cold war/medieval war blend, freedom vs fascism, and the originals being good vs evil. This film's themes were just so bland! I love a fun movie but in the end, it's completely worthless without proper context. It's strange that there was nothing I can call original or a motif but only things that were rehashes. The film fails to have an identity of it's own. It isn't genuine or adventurous enough to be considered Star Wars. Many people have a positive attitude to the notion of Star Wars being a massive Universe with limitless possibilities. When I watch a Star Wars movie I always say to myself ''wow what an engaging story'' and if you summarize the plot into one sentence it would give me chills reading it. Sadly the newest instalment offers nothing interesting, nothing that captures the imagination. There's no context and Star Wars is often about context. There's no investment hence there is no pay-off, there's no stakes hence there is nothing to give a **** about.",0
511,"Entertaining movie, should have been called anything but Star Wars. I had great fun watching it but it ends there. No more, no less and definitely not a Star Wars. Just a blockbuster, to be followed by many others until Disney has squeezed all the money they could from the franchise and will leave it up, destroyed and unpopular.",0
512,"If you are willing to spend a good time in the cinema with your family you may like this movie. But that all the good I can say about it. The story is just a repetition of episode IV in all possible ways, there’s no ambition, no desire to say anything new. There is nothing new under the sky, and is hard to find an explanation of how this movie justifies its own existence. The original trilogy was an excellent remix of a lot of epic stories, the prequel trilogy was an ambitious attempt to put some deepness and politics in to an action movie, this movie seems to be just a reboot of the original trilogy. It’s just sad.",0
513,"I really want to love this movie but i cant ... it has so many flaws, a carbon copy of episode 4, the new order is now under the command of a bunch of teens , the villains arent evil!!! what where you thinking jar jar abhrams?? rey is way too overporwered and kylo ren is a crying b!tch, and if you are going too kill a big hero do it with the honor he deserves, nobody was touched by his death i really cant believe people gaving a 10 to this movie , the thrawn trilogy is way better than this!!  IM TOTALLY DISSAPOINTED!!!",0
515,"The force sure wasn't awakened in this debacle, but I sure was.  And what I've learned is tis:  Critics are not to be trusted.  Disney played them like a fiddle, keeping them away from the film until the hype machine was roaring, assuring that any critic who dared to speak against this joke of a film knew that they would be speaking out against what was sure to be the biggest hit of the year.  And the critics, just like the early viewing kids and teens, were just swept away by it.  Newsflash people:  A movie isn't good just because it gets a lot of coverage.  You need to decide if a movie is good AFTER you have seen it, not before based on the marketing.  That's what I did, and the actual quality of this film is zilch!  The biggest cash hit of the year is also the worst quality film of the decade.  Regarding critics, lesson learned.  They have lost all credibility.",0
516,"Man they're turning Star wars into  a joke. The villain's meant to be son of Princess Leila, which makes him the nephew of Luke Skywalker and the grandson of Darth Vader, gets beaten up by some girl who's character build up doesn't justify why or how she's a match for the villain. Just make the whole plot very trivial. On top of that apparently Lightsabers are now some kind of magical weapon that is able to call people. ""youve heard the calling of Luke's lightsaber... "" WTF",0
517,Why do you need deathstars and fleets train Rey for a week and watch her destroy planets and eat galaxies wtf is this **** I didn't expect sharknado type of writing in the new star wars but this is what I got and zero is that this movie gets.,0
518,"I really am a star wars fan. I have collected the comics, books and games. I have always really enjoyed this universe as a little diversion form that lame thing we call life. So, when I heard that a new film was coming I was excited. Then they tell me ALL the cannon for the past 30 years is gone, poof. sigh... Okay fine, there were some things I didn't really like here and there anyway, so lets see what you got JJ. Maybe, this will fix some of the things that went wrong in the EU, make an even better chapter. Right?  NO. This uninhibited story opportunity is wasted completely to give us nothing new at all. There were so many directions they could have gone, and rich lore to pull from, why do this? The story is simply non existent. The characters have little motivation for there reactions and show no real conflicting feeling or depth. Everything we see is unoriginal, stolen or uninteresting. One of the biggest issues is the core concept of the film. They are searching for Luke, but why? First he is not needed, they defeat the first order with a handful of x-wing pilots and a space janitor. Second he walks away from everything to find the first Jedi temple because he failed, but leaves a nebulous trail of bread crumbs in the form of a map? This makes less than zero sense. Last Rey beats Kylo Ren with ease with zero training, what the heck does she need to get better at? She already can mind trick move objects and saber fight soooo...? One of the worst elements of the film is the hand holding, figuratively. Every time something happens in the film that needs explanation through good acting or story telling, they instead have a character break it down in simple sentences so we don't miss it. If a film is made well I feel it should be able to communicate to the audience without such heavy handed tactics. A look, a quick visual, something. In this film we don't see any of this. It would appear that Disney believes its audience is brain damaged or at the least far below average intelligence. I don't mind suspending disbelief but this film asks me to suspend cognitive function in order to be entertained. I give this film 1/10 instead of zero for one reason. The visuals were at least accurate to the universe, but not one plot point or character is worth a point. It was painful to see something I loved destroyed this way. I think of what fans would have done if Peter Jackson had decided that Tolkien was no longer cannon in lord of the rings and made something like this.  It would have redefined backlash, as it was he got a lot of flack for not staying close enough to the books, but in star wars its okay to flush everything the fans love down the toilet cause Disney. sigh...",0
519,"This is the first review I have ever made. I just need to balance the force and shove one to the Disney shills and paid critics, hence the 0 rating. 1. Star Killer - by 'sucking' up a sun you destroy a solar system, so why do you need to fire on planets that will die by cold, for which no reason is given anyway? As someone else pointed out; Death Star becomes Star Destroyer! 2. Ren's mask - has no function at all! So, when he removes the mask we are wondering what the hell is it for? It took 3 films to reveal Darth Vader to the world and it's function was to help keep him alive. 3. Ren's powers - Chewbacca manages to shoot Ren even though he can stop laser blasts. Massiveinconsistency here. 4. Poe - how does he survive the crash and how does he escape from the planet? For that matter how does Finn escape a Tie Fighter hurtling towards a planet at god knows what speed with a parachute? Was he using an ejector seat? Was it a strap on oarachute and if so how did he manage to counteract  the G forces to get the parachute on? Also, parachutes in Star Wars? Huh? 5. R2D2 - how does R2 know when to reactivate from self imposed sleep depression? 6. Map - why is there a map when coordinates would do, especially as the plot does not center aroundfollowing the map at all to find Luke? 7. Rey - she learns the force without instruction or training. This may be plausible, but devalues everything we know about Luke et al in the previous films. Just horrible! 8. Finn - sanitation worker, sent on a battle mission? 9. CGI - just horrible for Maz, Snoke and those terrible creatures on the freighter run by Han. 10. Han - he is too old to run around. Why is he not a general rather than returning to his old haunts? 11. Snoke - why does he need a massive hologram? Every hologram in the previous films is life size or smaller. This makes no sense apart from the fact that it makes him 'big'. 12. Han death - oh boy! Advertised or what!!! How can you wait for 30 years, kill a legend, nobody blinks and the audience is left without even a tear? Shameful!!!! 13. Lightsaber - Maz manages to get hold of Luke's original - well played! How the hell is that possible? At the very least explain it! 14. Story - SW7 = SW4. If you had told me this before the film I wouldn't have believed you! 30 years to come up with a new story and this is the best that Disney can do? 15. Finn - can speak Wookie, can speak droid, fly the Falcon, fix the Falcon, defeat Jedi masters, self taught Jedi, self taught stick wielding martial artist. Not bad for an orphan with no support or back story. 16. Max von Sydow - gone in 60 seconds! 17. Leia - Han dies and she comforts a complete stranger rather than Chewbacca! 18. John Williams -  I noticed the film score twice. My feeling is that he didn't have any emotion or tanguble plot to feed off of. 19. Finn - he gets hold of a lightsaber and just happens to fight the only Stormtrooper in history without a blaster. 20. Ren - forgets that he is probably the most powerful Jedi we have ever seen when fighting Rey. Why doesn't he just choke her from distance when the rupture occurs? 21. Lightspeed - apparently you can exit lightspeed a few hundred feet from a planet to bypass a shield. They forgot to mention this to Lando in ROTJ! 22. Phasma - just completely useless! 23. Scavenger - leaves the net it caught BB8 with, why? 24. Planet deaths - billions of people die and nobody gives a **** unlike Ben in SW4.

25. Ren - why does he walk across the bridge and how come he can't sense his own father who is about 50 feet away? Darh Vader senses Ben in SW4 when the Falcon is on the Death Star.

26. Resistance - the Rebellion won in SW6! Who would be left to resist against?

27. Death Star 3 - where did a newly formed dark side get the resources to build an operational death star 10x's as big as any previous build. I know it is part of a planet, but it still took 3 films to replace the original death star and that was under construction with all of the resources of the previous Emperor.

28. Nazi overtones - politics and other PC agendas have nothing to do with Star Wars! Galaxy far far away ffs!

29. Falcon - just happens to be on Jakku and then Han just happens to be flying by, what are the chances! None, that's what!

30. Falcon - the gun is put out of action when Ray and Finn are trying to outrun the Tie Fighters, which results in Ray having to pull out a stall move (2 minutes after learning to fly the falcon) But doesn't the Falcon have 2 guns? Why not just use the other gun!

31. Finn - makes friends with BB8 instantly and then has the chance to trade in BB8 for food and doesn't. Probably the best fed and healthiest looking scavenger ever. Just no depth to either of these scenes.

Disney and Jar Jar Abrams ruined xmas and effectively trampled on the memories and emotional investment of anyone that truly cares about Star Wars lore. I could have pulled a better story out of my arse.",0

521,"Very mediocre film equal to the prequels like episode III but with no cool epic scenes but no boring scenes either.This movie copies the entire script of New Hope but fails with flying colors on understanding what made New Hope Great and that was perfect passing, original story, incredible character development, prefect blend of music to every scene and a very satisfying ending none of these are present in Force Awakens. I thought this movie had fewer CGI but it doesn't feel like it, the CGI is really bad as well, very noticeable there are at least 4 fully CGI characters that make a negative impact on you. The story doesn't make any sense for fans and non-fans both bad guys are poorly used and poorly developed. The dialogue was awful so despite both Finn and Rey being well acted the lack of good writing didn't make them stand out. Anyways everyone on my family left the movie disappointed, I left not remembering any scene or anything that made an impact on me(at least the prequels did), I didn't even heard any music, the movie has too much action but it's bad action not like what you see in MadMax,  it wasn't worth the ticket price and I wish this movie would never had been made because it destroyers the original movies history and characters something that the prequels were not able to do.",0
523,"Anyone remember the scene when Han Solo's beast-of-a-right-hand-man's tennis shoes were briefly shown as he walked to greet Leia?  Unbelievable editing flaw.  To think this could perhaps be the biggest money maker of all times and nearly 75% of the movie involves ""shoot em' up"" or ""blow em' up"" scenes that one's visual system cannot even really track, is just plain crazy!  Saw this in iMax and that wasn't enough to make it worth the experience. Then, the ending hike up the never-ending flight of stairs to return the precious metal to Luke.  Hey, anyone here ever hiked up stairs?  Well, you know what, you get out of breath along the way, but, not Rey...another very serious editing flaw that would be more typical of a junior director filming his/her first film.  How can anyone really give this positive views?  I am glad Solo is now dead...it would be too painful to ever see such poor acting again.",0
524,"BETRAYED.  That's exactly what long-time star wars fans were with this installment.  Basically, Abrams had no idea how to move the saga forward, so rather than even try, he decided to just remake episode 4.  It's the oldest one.  It's from the 70s.  Most young movie-goers haven't seen it or have barely seen it, so he decided to just remake that.  After all, it'll all feel fresh and new to them.  As for older long-time dedicated Star Wars fans who will realize it's not actually a new episode but just a remake, the heck with them!  This film has got to make money!  Tragically, it seems to be working, so as a purely business decision, it seems like JJ did the right thing, but morally, long-time fans who cared deeply about this franchise deserved better than to be abandoned and sold out like this.",0
525,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie, I had high hopes with Abrams work on Star Trek. The prequels weren't great but were better than this. I fear Disney will kill this franchise. I'm shocked that it received so many positive reviews.",0
526,"From the standpoint of ""movies,"" where people act and the director directs, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Some reviewers are reviewing this based on ""Star Wars,"" which is fine, but I feel that the Phantom Menace, which was panned, was an infinitely better Star Wars movie than this because it was a fine ""movie"" irrespective of its Star Wars-ness. Other reviewers have touched on the plot holes, insufferable Mary Sue main character, and how the movie is a tired (incompetent) rehash of the first Star Wars movie, but the Force Awakens greatest failings have nothing to do with the plot: The Force Awakens is the worst movie I have ever seen because the actors don't have any charisma. The two greatest offenders of this, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, mercifully are not the main characters. For the moments they do appear, of which there many, I was squirming in my seat over how bad the dialogue was. Mind you, the script is terrible, but these actors went even less than phoning it in: it's like they realized how terrible the script was and did everything they could to make the movie fail on purpose. There are soft, emotional moments between the characters they play and it is cringe worthy to watch. Both actors seem to convey their loathing for the script in their role as they vomit out the words to what the director doubtlessly intended to be a touching scene. Moving on to the other characters: The male lead is mostly forgettable, but he probably did the best he could with the script; the female lead, on the other hand, has the personality of a potato. She spends the entire movie acting out her role as if her character was the lead to a Twilight movie (noted for the main character's lack of personality), but somehow manages to find new depths of emotional range. The villains: Many have touched on the co-badguy's petulant and childish tantrums, but that is the fault of the script, not the actor. The problem is the actor himself looks like a petulant kid who would get beaten up in some highschool movie. Miscast or perfect cast? I can't tell; the script seems to imply they cast him perfectly!  Unfortunately, the whiny, petulant, insufferable attitude being broadcast by someone the movie is trying to tell me is some evil dark lord of evil space wizard does worse than break immersion, it made me laugh out loud in the theater at moments that were no doubt intended to be suspenseful. The other co-badguy villain is doubtlessly intended to be some villainous, threatening, gestapo-like, space general, but again, casting chose not only an incompetent actor, but the completely wrong look to convey anything but derision from the audience. The soft features of his face, the youthful look, the ginger complexion, and the boyish british accent makes me feel that he would be better suited to a role as a protagonist in a Harry Potter film than the evil, nazi-like, space general he attempts to portray in the Force Awakens. Now that we've examined the main characters in the film, let's talk about how they interact with eachother, which is the true awfullness that permeates the Force Awakens. I've briefly examined the Harrison Ford/Carrie Fisher interactions, but that's only a small slice of the terrible chemistry that exists between actors in the film. The male lead and female lead don't appear to be in the same film: the male lead will act as if he's in a different movie than the female lead. Whereas Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher seem to share their vehemence for the franchise, script, and possibly director, it looks like the male lead and female lead are trying their best and making it worse. The male lead will make a statement with, say, emotional scale A. The female lead will then respond with emotional scale motor oil.  That is to say, it's not even the same universe of emotion. Forget about the actors being in the same room, one begins to wonder if they've even read the (awful) script beyond the lines they parrot out because they don't actually seem to be interacting with the other actors in the film. Though Harrison Ford delivers his tired interactions with the spirit of someone who was paid a lot of money just to show up, the other actors put an effort and zeal into interacting with other characters, but the performances end up as buffoonish and trite. Charisma, there is none in this movie. It's as if the actors aren't in the same room and they have no idea who they're talking to: almost is if they're reciting lines from a script devoid of anything but their own lines. Why is anyone saying this movie is good? I feel tricked and cheated; do I live in Clown World now? Is up down and left right? I signed up for an account just to review this movie; the positive reviews make me wonder if I have been transported to an alternate reality where the values & standards of the real world no longer apply.",0
527,"this movie is way better than any of the prequels but it's just ""a new hope"" with different characters( of course related to the old ones). what's really upsetting me is the fact that all the critic reviews are way too positive. I mean are you really praising JJ abrams for directing a movie that has no new ideas(first order=empire, star killer=death star,Rey=luke,Leia is still the rebels commander etc.)? and what about the villain? he's just like a teenage boy who's got issues with his parents. i know that this movie was made for the fan-dom but that doesn't justify the lack of originality.",0
528,Movie is a remake of 4 and 6. It does not follow the story form the 6 movie onwards. It only promotes it self on nostalgia from the old movies. It is full of inconsistencies with the Star Wars universe.,0
529,"Signed up here today just to make my feelings known and to warn others who love the Star Wars universe of my experience with this truly terrible piece of story telling. I have thought for days about why The Force Awakens left me feeling unmoved and numb at it's conclusion. I have finally worked it out. JJ Abrams has killed the franchise for me, and many others. The plot and the lead character simultaneously 'jumps the shark' within the first 20 minutes, my brain was screaming what the f**k are you taking the pi*s.  From this point on all I saw on screen were actors going through the motions, none of it seemed real, nothing moved me, even events that should have saddenned me to my core.   Maybe I could forgive one such event but the movie is littered with them.  I suspect people who parked thier brains at the door didn't notice but anyone who's seen the original trilogy will react with disbelief and then anger. The only thing that will get me to watch episode 8 is if I find out that in the yellow scrolling message at its start that Luke had gone psychotic on his lonely island hideout and when Rey hands him his lightsaber, he neatly cleaves her in two with it. Then the story could begin again with something more original and hopefully credible. I suspect this will not be the case, so Star Wars in my eyes is dead and the numbness I felt was actually grief for the death of a friend I've known and loved for 38 years.",0
530,"Copy from episodes IV and V. The story is unbelievably bad, even worse the new characters are failure. Kylo Ren - crybaby villain(who makes you lough at the dark side when he takes of his mask and you see some 17 years old nerd trying to be bad), Rey - overpowered scavenger teen who learns more about force in 3 days than Luke in 3 movies, seeing Leia and  Solo old in the movie just felt wrong. This is the worst Star Wars movie till now. Thanks Disney you nailed it...",0
531,"Huge fan of the Star Wars universe , very disappointed with this lark of effort ... expected a whole bunch of new worlds/ships/cool stuff and characters , poor show .",0
532,"Spoiler free. I really really wanted to love it. Unfortunately there is no way, since disney and JJ Abrams decided to make a franchise wave for audience in range 3-13 y.o., not a movie. My standards aren't high, just the movie is very, very bad. Biggest disappointment in movie industry. All critics and reviews aren't dumb, they are just paid. Don't go and waste your time.",0
533,The biggest let down of 2015 and 2016!!! it is basically a crappy version of A New Hope. Wish I never seen it cause it just sucks so bad. I would not pay anything to watch it.,0
534,"Visually interesting but poorly written, characters were one dimensional and plot was unimaginative.  Making a bigger death star and spending five seconds planning to destroy it with the same idea ripped off from episodes IV and VI was completely asinine.  The only good thing about this shiny turd is that episode IV and V keep looking better and better.  All three writers deserve the blame for this mindless tripe but I smell more Toy Story than Empire Strikes Back.  Hopefully Disney's check will bounce and Lucas can quietly repossess the franchise and prevent any further suffering for the fans.",0
535,"Bad movie.  Total disappointment. Other commenters have said everything there is to say about this terrible movie. The fact that this movie is rated so highly by professional critics suggests that the critics are not impartial. Ive just lost any and all faith in their opinions.  They must be getting paid.",0
536,"I have to say overall I was let down by the movie.  Started out kind of slow, and was kind of boring.  I grew up watching the original Star Wars in 1977 at the theater.  As a 7 year old, I was captivated by that movie and i was looking for the same thing, only to be disappointed.  Abrams did not capture my enthusiasm.  He is no George Lucas, and he would better off staying with and directing Star Trek.  Probably with the help of Disney and Abrams, ""The Force Awakens"" is missing George Lucas's panache. For one, you killed off Han Solo. Unbelievable. One of the most iconic characters in the original trilogy.  And you introduce us to a character that basically learns the force and how to use a lightsaber in a matter of a couple hours. Really? Luke is the ""yoda"" of Jedi Knights and it took him years and years to learn about the force and the dark side.  Do I even ask what she accomplishes in episode 8?  If ever a series needs resurrected, it is now.  George Lucas, where are when we need you most?",0
537,"The movie was absolutely gutting and soul destroying. I am really shocked and appalled that Star Wars is now just soulless commercial product, with no heart, no wit and no intelligence evident in the mess that was presented on screen. Very, very sad and disappointed that a much loved and cherished saga has now been destroyed in a such a callous fashion.",0
538,"a pale shadow of what star wars is... without imagination.anyone how seen at least one of the previous from the series could almost fell the force around",0
539,"Episode VII is an exact remake, plot point for plot point, of Episode IV with a dash of elements from Episode V and VI, except with far less compelling characters who undergo zero character development throughout the film. Though I'm a fan of throwbacks and self references, Episode VII takes it too far - to the point where I started to wonder if JJ was trying to constantly remind me that I'm supposed to be watching a Star Wars film. Its attempt at humour fell flat, is misplaced for the Star Wars series to begin with, and is reminiscent of the goofy attempt at humour of the much hated prequels. On the plus side, the CGI was fantastic. Although it is far from a saving grace, seeing the Millennium Falcon and X-Wings dogfight with Tie Fighters again was a nice, albeit brief, reprieve from an an otherwise terrible film. Star Wars Episode VII: A New Hope (2015) is a mediocre attempt at a remake falsely marketed under the guise of furthering the saga.",0
540,"I thought no matter what, there was no way 'The Force Awakens' could be worse than Lucas's prequels of the late '90s.  I have a newfound respect for those movies after seeing this one.  The Force Awakens starts off strong, but quickly dissolves into obscurity.  By the end I was looking around at my clapping and cheering peers as if they were completely insane. What bothered me most was that within 15 minutes of everyone meeting each other, they formed an emotional connection and became ""BFFs"".  It was so warm and fuzzy at times, I could actually taste sweet and sour care-bear vomit in my mouth.  Rey (Daisy Ridley) is essentially the next Luke Skywalker.  In a mere 2 hours she puts Han Solo's piloting abilities to complete shame and makes him look like a 2nd year Jiffy Lube mechanic.  Rey can seamlessly use the force; mind tricks, telekinesis, and can handle a lightsaber without incident.  Skills that took Anakin, Luke, and every other Jedi in history years to obtain. Finn's (John Boyega) performance was unmemorable on the whole.  He was trained and brainwashed by The First Order his entire life, but don't let that fool you.  Never mind the fact that he worked on and help construct a flying fortress that can blow up several planets and kill billions of people simultaneously.  That wasn't a deal breaker for dear ol' Finn, oh no.  It came when he was ordered to kill a dozen or so villagers in the middle of the desert.  So he becomes a traitor and later joins ""The Resistance"".  Forget the fact that he was a Storm Trooper his whole life, there's no way he could be a spy, let's trust him and act like we've known him for years!  And with his extensive knowledge from being a Storm Trooper/sanitary worker he becomes uh, you know,  an essential... integral... asset to the planning and destruction of the new ""Death Star"".  So cool. Apparently J.J. Abrams and Disney couldn't come up with anything new.  True to modern Hollywood form, we'll just do the SAME thing, we'll just make it BIGGER.  Enter new Death Star.  It's no small moon, it's the size of Jupiter.  Quite the feat of engineering actually.  Am I to understand that the First Order was able to construct this monstrosity in complete secrecy?  That the rebels' intelligence gathering got worse over the past 30 years?  None of that matters, however.  Despite all, it's blown up by a ground team of 4 and a squadron of X-wings.  Didn't see that coming (sarcasm). The Empire was defeated, the Republic was restored, the Galactic Senate reformed... just long enough to get blown up in mere moments.  Who did they have to protect them?  Oh, the same band of rebel misfits from 30 years ago.  Seriously?  After 30 years, the rebel outfit is still operating underground and are more disorganized?  Absolutely no new technology, ships, or tactics.  Still, they are victorious over the First Order without any assistance from the Republic ...or the rest of the galaxy they helped save in the first place.  Even President Obama couldn't decide which side was more ""JV"". My next question is a little more sensitive in nature.  Is anyone else sick and tired of the strong, independent female protagonist?  I love hot, smart, kickass women just as much as the next guy, but it's getting a little ridiculous at this point.  These days, every movie has a 110 lb. woman taking down men twice their size.  Let's face it,  Ronda Rousey is a great fighter, but to think she could take down any of her male counterparts is as far-fetched as the critic reviews for this movie.  Sorry ladies. Which brings me to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).  I thought he was a good antagonist up until the end.  He can extract information from your mind and stop a laser blast in mid-air.  Completely ruthless; a bit creepy and disturbing when he takes off his helmet.  He seemed well-trained and very powerful.  Yet he fails to deflect a shot from Chewbacca who was leagues away.  Then he gets his ass kicked by 2 kids that have never used a lightsaber before.  I guess he should've went home to mommy and daddy.  Obviously, Han and Leia were terrible parents. I didn't see that one coming. All in all Stars Wars: Episode VII - The Force awakens was just another marketing scheme.  This movie felt like just another jazzed up re-imagining of a franchise.  If George Lucas could sue Disney for plagiarism, he would.  Coupled with the popularity of the franchise and the overzealous advertisement  effort, Star Wars a huge success.  The sheeple continue to enjoy being spoon-fed and they are eating this one up like its Filet Mignon.  Then there are idiots like me that knowingly keep paying for the same movie over and over again.  The horror.",0
541,"The best one could hope for in such a movie would be for the creative staff to mine the old stuff for gold and serve it up in a fresh, new way. What I witnessed was a kind of reverse alchemy wherein the gold was transformed to (mostly) lead, with an occasional blink of polished brass. I am very fond of the first two movies in the original trilogy (episode IV and V) and haven't seen much magic come out of Star Wars movies since then. There was one fine scene in ep. VII that truly captured the old magic, but that was it. 2 minutes out of 135 is not a golden ratio. That said, a person who has never seen the original trilogy could be in for a real treat. Maybe.",0
542,"Such a waste of money. Same old, been there, done that. Same conflicts, many loopholes, same enemy, same plot, same everything. It would be great for someone just starting to enter the Star Wars franchise but if you have ever experienced it before in any way shape or form it is just bland.",0
543,"Have you seen a Star Wars A New Hope ?  Then you've seen the Force Awakens. If you think that's bad, unfortunately that's not all. Actually, it gets worse.  This movie not only borrows HEAVILY from its predecessors, it is INCONSISTENT with what has already been established in the Star Wars Universe.  Unoriginal, uninspired and undoing what we have come to accept as constants in the Star Wars Universe. Actually, it gets even worse.  This movie is not only inconsistent with the Star Wars Universe, it lacks character development, and relies far too heavily on nostalgia.  Others have stated it amounts to poorly done fan fiction. I would have to agree.  I couldn't help but thinking to myself damn Mr. XXXX looks soooo old...  Believe it or not, it actually killed the nostalgia for me and made me wish I hadn't seen the character/actor like that.  I would have preferred to remember him/her in her prime, 30 years ago. To be honest, it gets even worse, the plot twists are obvious and there is an abundance of coincidence used to move the story along. This was not a good movie.",0
544,"This is the biggest disappointment of the 21st century since the residency of George W. Bush It. This is just a rehash of the original three Star Wars movies--- almost exactly--- and obviously on purpose. And with a dull, trite script and uninteresting characters. This was obviously done consciously--- but I cannot understand why or why audiences seem to love it. This was an opportunity to go where no Star Wars had gone before-- to break new ground, take us to new places and new adventures, and introduce new wise-cracking, witty, characters with panache and depth. None of that happens here. It is literally just a trite, cliche-ridden and somewhat inane remake of the first Star Wars movies, but lacking the humor, surprises, wit, soul and excellent writing and acting that made the first Star Wars movie such a wower. I almost fell asleep, no kidding--- I could see everything coming from a mile away. I think folks have bought into this--- but, really--- it's a piece of brainless junk.",0
545,"As many other fans of the true Star Wars (Ep IV-IV) I was highly disappointed by this last installment. There was so much good material in the expanded Star Wars Universe that flourished in the past 30 years and yet J.J. Abrams ended up making a mediocre rip-off of Episode IV. This movie is a reboot with references to the original trilogy, not a sequel. There is no credible explanation on why things are in the current state, Leia and Luke have laughable appearances, and even Han Solo seemed to be a sad shadow of the character everyone used to love in the original trilogy. According to J.J. Abrams anyone can use a light-saber and it takes little to no effort to master the force, even against a supposedly well trained sith. Pretty much everything we learned in Ep IV-VI is erased in this movie. The choice of Adam Driver for the villain doesn't really convince, and Kylo Ren/Snoke end up being laughable villains (a winy emo wanna-be sith lord, and a giant hologram with a funny name). All in the movie is obvious, to the point where people can imagine what's going to happen. The final demise of Han Solo is a good example of that. This installment is a shallow and successful attempt to make money, not the movie all the fans deserved to watch.",0
546,"Well film critics, you failed.  You had the massive Disney marketing juggernaut on one side pulling you to give it a 10 and the actual film product on the right, pulling you to give it a zero.  Spineless and cowering, you gave it a ten.  I realize it's scary to give a sure smash hit like this an honest review, but how long do you expect to maintain your credibility in the face of obviously inaccurate reviews like this?  This movie was nothing but a parody of Episode 4 and 5, trash through and through.  Yes, Disney failed Star Wars fans with this debacle, but you critics failed us even worse by deceiving us into wasting our time and money on this garbage.",0

I failed. FA is a complete and utter garbage. Plot is mind-numbing. Jokes are tired and cringeworthy. Idea of Kylo struggling with the whole dark/light side was nice but the execution was terrible. Felt like I was watching a failure of a straight-to-TV aimed at a 10 year old demographic. Cash grab remake/merch advertisment, and nothing more.",0
548,"I am writing this review in the hope that you will see it before you go to watch Star Wars VII, and in the process save your money and time.  If you're 10, then you might like it.  If you're an adult and appreciate well crafted story-telling with good acting, you're out of luck.  I saw the positive reviews by various critics and my hopes were raised - then dashed like an egg thrown at a wall, upon seeing it.  ""What's wrong with it?"" You say?, I say ""Nearly Everything!"".  The only saving grace was the production values which were amazing.  Everything else was pretty bad. Script - AwfulPlot - AwfulActing - Dreadful I was really hoping for something good, and instead they made a cash-in for the franchise (as expected, but I thought the glut of critics reviews were to be trusted - What a fool I was!).  If you really liked this film, then you - A) Can't be trusted to recommend anything else - ever (especially film)B) Must be J.J. AbramsC) Must be any film executive @ Disney. For the record, I really like the 'Star Wars Universe', but not this.  Definitely not this.",0
549,"First time review. The people who gave this movie high scores must not have seen Episodes 1-6.  If they had then they would give this movie a 0.  I walked out of the theater astounded.  The movie started off well then started a downward spiral to depths I have never seen before. Plot:  As tired and old as Carrie Fisher was in the movie.  Why not come up with something original.  They had total freedom to write what they wanted and they did nothing but recreate Episode 4.  Nice one.  This was a failure Characters:  Kylo Ren started out cool.  Stops a laser bolt, Ruthlessly executes a old guy.  Then they took all that away from him by giving him angsty teenager tantrums and allowed a janitor and young girl beat him in a light saber fight and the use of the force.  Rey and Finn.  I have no opinion as every scene was them running away from something while Rey is being told to us that she is a strong girl and doesn't need a man, while having Finn look like a buffoon in action, but somehow he comes up with EVERY IDEA in the movie.  If you are unlucky enough to have to sit through this movie again just watch.  Finn has every good idea, but can't do anything and in my opinion he is worse comic relief then Jar Jar Binks.  Why does he have the stupid lines he does? I am just tired of even thinking of this movie to continue writing. So many plot holes, none of it made and sense or had any continuity.  The force and training to use it was made a mockery.  I saw the movie with my wife and when we were driving home she made the comment ""I don't get it.  Luke had to carry that frog around on his back for  along time and train to do the things they made that girl do""  (She isn't a Star Wars fan, and only watched the movies with me to get ready to watch TFA with me) Then she said ""I don't know anything about Star Wars, but i think they messed this movie up"" My response was ""You are right, they messed up, and I don't think there is any way to repair the damage"" For all of Lucas' faults he at least respected the force and understood a good story.  TFA makes me appreciate episodes 1-3 in a new light.",0
550,"Really disappointing experience! Watched the original trilogy as a teenager and this was a bad remake of the first movie, but also parts taken from second and third movie. I don't understand the professional critics, how can they rate this movie so high?",0
551,"After all the hype, The Force Awakens is ultimately a failure and missed opportunity in the same vein as the prequels.  JJ Abrams gets better performances and better visuals on film than Lucas was able to with Episodes I through III, but the actual story in Episode VII is just as riddled with plot holes, dues ex machina, fan service, and one-dimensional characters.  It's Star Wars for the Transformers generation ... louder, more exaggerated, and ultimately dumbed down.",0
552,"There are some good things: old school special effects in much of the film were more realistic than prequels, storm trooper defecting was a great idea, the lead actress and actor are good, the first half is generally good until they escape the planet and that laughable scene on the millennium falcon had to happen.  The bad things: Clunky script, several bad jokes especially by Harrison Ford, terrible CGI/motion capture for the new emperor guy who is some sort of half-man or worm or something, wimpy lead bad guy, bad CGI for the fight scene against the death planet, terrible CGI for the awful escaped alien creatures on the millennium falcon, too many coincidences, the female lead was too strong and actually defeats the bad guy with no training, female lead was made too strong to be realistic, a death planet was a terrible idea, too jokey at many times in the movie. The list could go on for awhile. The biggest problem with the movie is the complete disregard for the original series emphasis on training and discipline to become a jedi and this directors inability to slow things down and develop some characters. How much better would the millennium falcon scene have been if the characters just talked a little bit and learned about each other. The terrible scenes with those creatures escaping and some ridiculous smugglers could have been cut and probably millions of dollars saved by some good dialogue at that point. The movie just had no soul and the end left them with no significant bad guy. I thought it was really a mess just like the last star trek.",0
553,"It broke my heart. It was a slap in the face. I hate Jar Jar Abrams. I hate Disney. They destroyed the future of Star Wars. Who is to blame? Whoever wrote the story.

554,"Disney what did you do to this movie?! Where did all the money go to??? First:When I watch this movie and see small Resistance base located somewhere at the middle of nowhere or 30 people cheer after the victory with no visual affects it makes me think you did not make that scene epic at all but made it look like this move is a budget movie.Luke on some island that looks like earth place in the middle of nothing, not building etc....did you remember how Yoda's place was awesome, climatic?That bar with that alien lady, what was that? No people go in or out, no landing place for other spaceships? It is like forgotten place but it is full with spaceships around, where is the landing place? where are the people???!!! Secondly:Bigger dead star planet that destroys 10 planets at one shot? Are you kidding me... and you destroy all city planet with senate that was so iconic for this series just like that in one second....was it really so hard to create new original story... I am so disappointed about that movie that I think it was maybe for somebody who never saw previous episodes and is age between 8-20... Luke abandoned his sister and hid on some planet (because some kid went to dark side what!!!!!? wasn't he stronger enough to capture him and get him back...), resistance after being victorious is smaller than before....makes no sense to me.... Lastly, why that boy wears that mask for? he does not need it? just to look cool? ehh........ I hope you make the next one right...",0
555,"It's a shame that Abrams was at the helm for this one. He's not the worst producer in the business, but he sure is a lousy storyteller. Just about all the basics of how to weave together a narrative are absent here. You can feel the insecurity and willingness to compromise in every scene, and no character, conflict or theme really gets enough attention to become compelling, which is a shame because the performers here are all talented and likeable. Lucas wasn't much of a writer, that's for sure, but he pursued his vision with passion and creativity. Abrams is more engineer than artist. He's just checking off boxes.",0
556,"It's a money-grabbing re-hash of the beloved star wars (1977). I left the cinema with a very Bitter taste in my mouth. Almost everything in it is a copy from the original, its just been jigged up with some new characters and cgi. Thats it... UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED.!!!!!!!!!!!!!John Boyega wasnt too bad as an actor in it, bit silly but wasnt too bad.Daisy Ridley was an utter disappointment, ''SHE CANT ACT'' she was awful.!!!!The stupid attempt to add humour was a failure...I cant remember laughing once at the cheesy lines. It was shockingly BAD.Star wars the force awakens: Soulless, Unremarkable, bland, dull  Need I go on !!! I gave it 3.. nothing more , nothing less",0
557,"A very unoriginal film.  I am perplexed as to how anyone who grew up watching Star Wars would consider giving this a high score.  It is just a pathetic rehash of Star Wars IV!I'm not going to reiterate what has been written by so many thoughtful viewers. But I will ask all of you this...why are we as a culture accepting this vapid excuse of creativity from film makers?  Why redo/remake works by more creative people just to keep a profitable franchise alive?  Why not try something new?Who knows it could even be profitable (and it probably would be)!  Stop listening to the ""bean counters"" Hollywood!",0
558,"After seeing it twice, I don't like it. First, the movie is a medley of sorts of the original trilogy (particularly ep. IV), only the plot is way more confusing. I keep reading additional content (like that Aftermath) and I still can't fully grasp what's the situation of the galaxy. It's a mess, and this should have been explained in the movie (having to dig information elsewhere is frustrating). Also, a new Death Star? Really? Second, the pacing is weird. The first half of the movie is somewhat stronger than the second. The ending feels like it doesn't fit and it doesn't feel much like Star Wars. Third, the villains are weak. You can't stop comparing Gen. ""Mux"" with Tarkin, ""KillO'Ben"" with Vader, and ""Supreme Leader Snarf"" with Palpatine - and they all fail to deliver (and it's not the actor's fault...). That Kylo Ren is the stupidest character since Jar Jar Binks. Nothing he says makes sense. ""I'll finish what you started..."" What did Vader start to begin with? Palpatine founded the Empire, Palpatine started hunting down the jedi, Palpatine started every war in both the classical and prequel trilogies... so what the heck is this kid talking about? Finally, having a loving father and mother, being son of two of the greatest heroes of the galaxy wasn't enough... Having the strongest force user as uncle and master is not enough... Somehow he bounded to Supreme Leader Snarf will and - then they repeat the plot again? At least we had 3 movies to try to understand Anakin's fall. By the way, nobody told this stupid kid that the grandfather he worships so much came back to the light before he died? Oh, but that's not enough. The stupid kid had to lose the lightsaber fight so we could grasp how dumb and weak he is. Kylo Ren is like ""Cartman with Authoritah fell to the dark side"" - but dumber. Forth, why wasn't the big imperial ships protecting the big bad base as well? Why that stupid name, ""First Order""? Why captain Phasma lowered the shield (the price for such treason should be surely death or worse... oh, forget it). Why make lots of puppets and then make Maz Kanata CGI? The movie kept reminding me it was just a movie! Also, that dialogue between Han and Leia. So much of it was unnecessary... Which brings me to what I hated the most about the movie, and the main reason I'm giving it such a low score: it erases anything good and fulfilling we had at the end of Return of the Jedi. Every single one of the original heroes failed miserably in every aspects of their lives. Where is the reward for being good, just and do heroic deeds?So... Han failed as a husband, as a father, as a member of the resistance and overall as a man (a bitter one it seems)... same goes for Leia (oh, she is a general of a sidekick cell that's supported by the republic... great). Luke is the worse of them all: failed as a jedi master, failed as a protector of the galaxy, as uncle, as friend, as brother, as the owner of R2D2... the plot seemed to be around finding Luke, but the movie ends and he's done nothing and you get to wonder: why? Why do they need him? What do they need him for? The resistance certainly can handle any new Death Star that appears, and it seems the plumber trooper and junkyard girl can surely handle the stupid angry kid. All that, and R2D2 being in a coma because he's sad sounds so absurd... Didn't the little droid survived the killing of younglings by Anakin Skywalker? Didn't he watch the purge of the jedi and the founding of the Empire? Well, I guess that's it. I had to watch it 2 times to be sure I didn't like it, but the more I think about it, the worse it gets. I was going to keep it to myself, but after seeing how angry ""the real fans"" are getting at anyone that disagree with them, I felt I had to come and share with you, that also didn't like the movie, that you are not alone. I can only hope the next one will end up being so good it's going to redeem this one.",0
559,"I won't dwell into the flaws of this movie that were already described by many.It's just disgusting seeing what they've done with the franchise throughout the years. It's like seeing a once good PC game being dumbed down for today's consoles. Press X to win.",0
560,"This movie was really good until 2 things happened: -minor thing- Kylo Ren took off his mask-major thing- Rey just used all the force she needed and defeated Kylo Ren in a lightsabre fight without ANY training. She also repaired millenium falcon just on a hunch... Absurdity of this is beyond anything ever imaginable. The political correctness that told someone to make female character practically a god ruined really great movie",0
563,"Ok. I hate doing this, but this is a split review. Cinematography, directing and pretty much every actor in the film gets a 10/10.The story gets a generous 3.As the movie progressed, I felt like I was sitting into a resetting ejection seat specifically designed to hit my **** meter.EJECT EJECT EJECT.... that was my brain every time some **** happened that NEVER would have happened in Star Wars.Stormtrooper is neurotic and freaked out by everything. No... Finn had decided to leave, why would he be scared. He's well trained and is executing a plan of action. Why make the black guy a **** in the first 3 minutes of meeting him? HE'S A STORMTROOPER... not some cowardly **** Surely some of the training would have stuck.Then Homie the Poe guy can't outfly four highly destructible missiles like Anakin did in RoTS (ep 3.) but instead IS capable of shooting down literally every tie fighter in on Maz Kanata's planet, but then is incapable of replicating that feat when trying to blow up the Death Star 3.Kylo Ren freezes time... not a blaster bolt... time... if it was the bolt, the electricity surrouding it would have kept jumping. It didn't it stopped TIME.Ok... Kylo has an insta win in the first 10 minutes.... I almost walked out.I settled in for the long haul and had to hit eject again when they escaped from tatooine... how does a girl lost in a desert know how to fly a ship that apparently doesn't work after changing one switch.Then hit eject again.Random meeting with Han and Chewie.Then again.Space bug doesn't immediately eat Finn.Then again.The Lightsaber gives visions? uhhhh...hhhhhuuuuu?How?Then again.An X-wing somehow snipes stormtroopers while moving, and doesn't even cause explosions... which then take place moments later when someone who isn't poe completely misses the stormtroopers.And again.When Poe Dameron ganks 6+ tie fighters in less than 10 seconds. A feat that no other pilot, jedi or non-jedi has ever replicated. Even in the now non-canon books.... at least with lasers cannons.And again.When everyone meets at the rebel base and no one gives a **** about how Poe survived, or why he hadn't told anyone about Finn's place in the escapeAnd again.When the entire planning session to destroy a planet sized star killing super base took a whole 30 seconds of **** conversation and easy answers.Then again.When Han flies a millenium falcon under the shields at light speed and no one asks why this wasn't the plan for Death Star 2.
Then again.When Kylo and Rey have a semi-orgasmic screaming match which apparently portrayed Rey finding out that she can read minds too..... because that's always been a Jedi thing right?AND AGAINWhen Rey immediately knows how to mind trick Daniel Craig... I mean ... some anonymous stormtrooper into doing whatever she wants.... and if that's the case, just do it to everyone you encounter and take the base over 100%.And again.When Rey starts climbing over stuff because she likes climbing over stuff.Then againWhen Finn announces he doesn't know anything really and is just a sanitation guy. Funny but **** you.Then againWhen Finn announces he knows how to disable the shield after all.Then againWhen Phasma gives up the codes so easily it's as if the film makers were looking for a surefire way of confirming why women should never exist in combat roles.Then again when the shields could be turned off without a redundancyAnd again when only 12 x-wings are all that's left of the rebel alliance after 30 years of growth.... bad job leia.And again when they pull out 400 bombs from a satchel the size of the one from Hangover.And again when Han has a stilted and boring conversation with the nutso individual with a red lightsaber and all black clothing.And again when the sun was finally pulled into the weapon and the room went dark and that caused the DARKNESS ... it's dark side ****ers and that's retarded.And again when everyone runs away from Kylo ren and 3 stormtroopers.And again when Kylo rocks up and a sanitation attendant duels him with a lightsaber, being extremely proficient at a number of points, eventually succumbing to his wounds.And again when Rey jumps up after being concussed, wins a force pull battle against a trained Anti-jedi after showing almost no indication of knowing the force was even a thing ever, but suddenly owning said jedi in saber combat after less than two miinutes of back and forth.And again when R2 turns on an knows exactly where the map is.And again when it's the only missing peice of said mapAnd again when they send desert planet girl to see Luke instead of his sister who he would know and give more than two ****s for.So yeah.Pretty average story... again. being super generous with the 3/10. I am really reluctant to see it agian as it might turn me off star wars for ever.
BAD.",0
564,"Didn't really do it for me. It definitely started strong, but it just moved very slowly. The best scene, for me, is when Rey is introduced to the Force; it was great leap into the character's psyche, and Daisy Ridley exhibited a great performance. In fact, all of the acting was great. The flaws of the movie were its length and lack of creativity. It is extremely boring, cliched, and fake. There is little, if any character development, and therefore lacked any deep fulfillment. This made it feel like a total waste of engagement on the part of the audience.",0
565,"I enjoyed the ride as the movie flowed on, till plot kept going downhill. At first you get a nostalgic feeling as you notice the references to the older films (some in humourous and entertaining ways).Eventually the movie turns dry, with poor acting and just outrightly copies 'a new hope'. Highly disappointed that inspite of all the hype and scope the movie had, it just blandly copied a older successful version of itself.What made the movie worse is how it potrayed the good and the bad guys. So the new 'darth vadar' is bad because he turns evil , because he was frightened??.... umm ok, he trained to be a jedi by luke but went to the dark side,  and is so powerful that he can stop laser beams by using the force. But ... but gets easily defeated by someone basically holding a light saber the first time with no training ...coz yea she the good guy.This movie was disappointing, its a bland remake and can be fun to watch as a good defeats bad story regardless of any logic or plot",0
566,"This movie is a lazy cut and paste of a new hope, i really don't understand how people are giving this movie such high scores. The main characters Rey and Finn weren't likable characters. The villain Kylo Ren was a complete joke, so much so in fact that most of the audience on launch night kept laughing at him and while I'm not against humor in a star wars film this is done to the detriment of the character. He really cannot be taken seriously anymore after a point in the movie. I was even disappointed by the musical score, i was sure there was no way John Williams had anything to do with this one but i was wrong. There certainly wasn't a ""duel of the fates"" or ""battle of the heroes"". And i won't even get into the numerous plot holes in the movie simply because i don't feel like writing a review that long. In short this movie is crap and gave me a new appreciation for the prequels. (Yes, I'm an original trilogy fan)",0
567,"This was not an earnest, thoughtful continuation of the Star Wars saga. This was taxidermy. The cheap, unsettling, not-convincing kind. Like many others here - casual and hardcore fans alike - I really wanted to like this movie, and signed in (after 3 years of forgetting I had this account) to voice my discontent. Many of the ""most helpful"" reviews cover all the same flaws and complaints I have, so no need to rehash them. Considering the resources, attention, and hype that went into this movie, it almost seems deliberately bad. Maybe - in this era of rage-inducing attention-seeking clickbait - it's more profitable to make a controversial product than a straight-up good one. How much more traffic and ad revenue do all these media sites get from angry viewers visiting their websites out of spite and expressing their displeasure? How many of us disappointed fans have been emotionally hooked into waiting for the next one, just for the slim hope of a redemption? Or maybe the producers/execs were so sure of this movie's success (and who wouldn't have been?) that they couldn't care less about the plagiarized plot and its glaring inconsistencies, among other issues. These days, it seems everybody in the media business is getting lazy off their well-established cash cows, and us consumers are only enabling them.",0
568,"This movie was horrendous. But let's just break it down:1. Almost no story. Really thinking about it, what exactly happened in over 2 hours was almost nothing.2. They just replaced Han Solo with this unknown girl.3. Luke Skywalker appeared only at the very end of the movie. Consistent with the Di$ney's moneywhoring with 1 star wars film until infinity. They will ruin the franchise forever. This is only the beginning.4. Another Death star lookalike. Just why?5. The main villain was ridiculous. Why would he wear the darth vader type of helmet when his face wasn't distorted. Makes no sense whatsoever.6. Piss poor acting.7. Really? A random black ""traitor"" just picks up the lightsaber and he almost defeats the main villain.Then the girl who has not been trained by any jedi or sith just totally decimates the main villain. It is just ridiculous.8. The events were so predictable. There was not a single event that was even remotely surprising.",0
569,"This movie is very well directed, the actors did a good job, nice battles and stuff but sadly the writing is MORE than childish. Before watching the force awakens, i saw all the positive reviews on the internet but after actually watching it my self i can say that it is a pretty bad movie. A copy-paste of the scenario of  ""A new Hope"", some outrageous plot holes, everyone and my aunt can decently wield a lightsaber (back in the day we thought that such a weapon needs you to be force sensitive and also have JEDI TRAINING in order to use it properly), the villain is just laughable (if Anakin in the prequels seems whiny to you, check out this guy..), the way that the shields of starkiller base go down is just hillarious-they just tell someone to lower them ahahahahahahah, the main character becomes an expert forcewielder in a very short amount of time and WITHOUT any training, the lightsaber duels are absolute crap...I could go on for hours :)",0
571,"It's a fun movie, but really REALLY uninspired.It's just episode 4 with different characters.Also there's some out of nowhere moments that really kills the tension, mostly about our resident mary sue main character.",0
573,"A huge disappointment. It recycles far too much material from the original trilogy, contains too many plot holes, and the story-telling is sloppy at times. In no way does the film advance the Star Ways mythology. It simply regurgitates it, into things we have seen before. There's another Death Star, there's  more father & son issues, and then we have cheap knock-offs of Yoda, Boba Fett and the Obi-Wan death scene. A huge missed opportunity to tell something fresh, or even offer an intelligent, thoughtful story. Thanks J.J. Abrams for ruining two of my favorite sci-fi franchises.",0
574,"Just a very uninspired rehash of the original three, left me feeling empty at the end. Save your money and wait for rental or just watch the original three. New bad guy is awful, his helmet is laughable looks like a child designed it. I had a hard time not laughing when he is having one of his tantrums. You could actually feel the hate coming from a character like Darth Maul or the Emperor. This character comes off as someone that has a mental illness like the crazies you hear about in the news. The new Sith Lord looks like Voldemort, or one the white orcs from the Hobbit really unimaginative in my opinion.Not one clap or cheer at the end from a large full theater if that tells you anything. Even the prequels when I went got applause at the end.",0
575,"Well, I sure didn't see this coming.  After remaining true to Star Wars through the awful Episodes 1 and 2, this monstrosity has finally done it.  I finally have no desire whatsoever to continue watching Star Wars.  The film was just terrible.  Ren is so strong with the force that he can stop and hold a lazer blast in mid-flight, but he can't even defeat a completely untrained newbie who just discovered the force that day like Rae?  It's worse.  He couldn't even defeat Fin who has no force ability whatsoever.  Another droid hunt on a desert planet?  Another creature cantina?  Another Death Star?  This movie was terrible on it's own and set's up nothing but terrible films to come.  I never thought it would happen, but I'm out.  There is just nothing to remain for.",0
576,"Someone is messing with the reviews on the most helpful page.  All the 10 reviews are old and the not helpful scores keep getting adjusted downward, thus not reflecting actual feedback.  Some of the fan-boys must be  resorting to cheating and hacking to keep the score from going down. They're in denial about how truly awful this movie is.  BTW, denial is the first stage of grief.  Star Wars is dead people!!!",0
577,"Cash grab. Rehash/Reboot. Corporate made fan fiction. Nostalgia Pandering. Unoriginal. Self Parody. These are the most common, but legitimate criticisms you'll most likely see against this movie, but for my review, I will for the most part, focus on the unoriginality and the fact that it feels like a parody. The Force Awakens starts off strong and promising, the first half hour is actually entertaining, but then things take a dramatic turn and it all starts going downhill.... Where do I begin? Wow, this is without a doubt the weakest story in the saga thus far. FIND LUKE SKYWALKER, BUT BEFORE YOU CAN DO THAT YOU HAVE TO BLOW UP ANOTHER DEATH STAR! It doesn't even explain WHY finding Luke is so important. In fact, NOTHING is explained in this film. Our new heroes are Rey, (who plays the Luke Skywalker role of A New Hope) and Finn, the co-star and basically our comedy relief character. If you stop and think about it you realize he's useless to the story, but for whatever reason he tags along for the adventure. Their main goal is, by the luxury of a string of endless coincidences in this poorly thought out movie; to stop the threat that is the First Order, (who's motives are unexplained, as well as the state of the galaxy) and their SUPER DEATH STAR PLANET THING, (wait for it.....) STARKILLER BASE! Oh, and also like I stated earlier, find that old hermit Luke. Seriously, there are so many instances where you'll stop and think, ""wow they're always there at the right time. How convenient"". Such as, finding the Millennium Falcon by chance, running into Han Solo by chance, finding Luke's old lightsaber by chance, and my favourite, R2D2 waking up from low-power mode for no apparent reason other than to MOVE THIS NONSENSICAL PLOT ALONG! (And these are only a few of the hillarious amount of coincidences. I hope someone makes a meme listing all of them.) The mystique and badassery of our new villian Kylo Ren, (Darth Vader 2.0) is ruined when he takes off his mask. You can't take him seriously anymore, he was a legit badass for the first hour of the movie, but that's all destroyed. Han Solo's death was the ONLY emotional part in the film. He dies by his son Kylo Ren's lightsaber, that everyone saw from a mile away was going to happen, very predictable but it was sad to see him die. HOWEVER, the way that he falls off the platform looks ridiculous and I actually laughed out loud at how stupid it looked. The last third of the film is where I realized I was watching a parody. It is literally beat for beat, Episode IV and VI combined. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A trench run to destroy Death Star 3 (the starkiller) and an underwhelming lightsaber duel between insta-Jedi Rey and Kylo Ren. As many others have said, if you've seen A New Hope, you've seen this movie, but that movie was actually good. And lastly, the ending... I cannot put into words how bad the ending is... It is so bad... It is easily the WORST ending in the saga. After all that, the movie ends with Rey eventually finding Luke on top of a mountain and she proceeds to hand over the lightsaber to Luke (who's green screened into the shot BTW, looks super fake) and the two engage in a cringe worthy awkward staring contest with no words being spoken... And it was at that moment where I laughed the hardest ever at a SW film. Was that a parody I just witnessed? In conclusion, it's good to see more and more people are WAKING UP (no pun intended) and seeing TFA for what it is; A heartless, corporate assembley line made fan-film that panders to the lowest common denominator. The Star Wars Saga (1977-2005) will live on forever. On the other hand, this piece of **** corporate made fan-fiction can go **** itself.",0
578,"Really, I had a bad feeling about this one even before sitting down in theatre. After 30 seconds I thought no, they are not going to tilt the camera down to show a planet. Well, they did. I felt like a 13 year old kid again, because that was my age when I first watched A New Hope. Either way, the first 15 or 20 minutes were actually quite entertaining, minus a few minor issues, such as the twin seat TIE fighter, Poe the pilot being ejected upon crash landing, but his jacket, which was ON him at the time, not having so much as a scratch, a storm trooper being able to just abduct a high profile prisoner on board of a star destroyer without his buddies even noticing, or the Millennium Falcon sitting in the desert for more than twenty years collecting dust and sand and still being fully functional.When Solo's cargo ship tractor beamed the Falcon, things started to get ugly. No, Han's boyish smirk just doesn't work anymore when the rest of his body has aged and now looks like the host of Wrinklemania.Anyway, too much of a coincidence for him to be there at that exact moment. And how the heck did the hooligans with heavy British accents get on his ship completely unnoticed ? By that time, I wanted J.J. Abrams to be eaten alive by one of the rathtars. But things got even worse when Leia showed up; that is what happens to post menopause aged women, nobody wants to see them anymore, especially not in numerous never ending close ups. We now also know why Carrie Fisher never had an acting career.How the heck did Kylo Ren get Darth Vader's helmet ? And why the heck was HE wearing a mask ? Vader needed it for life support, Kylo did not. That said, he should have never taken it off. Never take off a mask when you are the villain, especially if under that mask you look like a cheap porn actor in a gay movie.The most cringeworthy scene was the Nuremberg style space nazi gathering including the red and black wall decoration and the Adolf like speech with General Hux foaming at the mouth. Add to that Snoke, who came up with that ridiculous name ? Snoke, who looks like the mutated love child of E.T. and Gollum...he also looks sick. Fresh air and a few vitamin pills might help.To sum it up: a complete mess.",0
579,"Horrendous. An insult to our collective intelligence. Everyone has already said why it's so bad so I'll spare the details. This is one of the worst directed movies I have ever seen. The pacing is frantic. There is no coherence whatsoever. They couldn't have butchered it any more. JJ Abrams really has shown himself to be one of the worst, most forgettable directors in history. This movie is so bad that it actually makes you like the prequels a lot more. Because now you realize how important story telling and pace are in a movie. Lucas is and always has been the master. This is a cheap, hollywood ripoff that was sold as something being really genuine. Shame on you Disney and JJ. Also, is anyone else suspicious of some of the ""reviews"" on here? For example this one by ""Criticfer"": ""It has some things copied from the first trilogy , but what he did JJ Abrams with Star Wars is fantastic . The new characters will make you much pleasing (especially BB8), the action sequences, the comedy and the tragedy made ​​from classic to Star Wars. The villain is a bit queer , but looks better with his mask and his black suit. Star WarsThe Force Awankes delivers what it meets. It is not as extraordinary as episodes 4, 5 and 6, but is an excellent return to the galaxy"" There are several of these very short, 9/10 or 10/10 reviews that contain spelling mistakes--almost as if Disney is paying non-english speakers in other countries to write generic positive reviews and post them to the internet. The whole thing is just sketchy.",0

But what about these film critics?  There is nothing original in the film at all, and, even though the original movie material that Ep. 7 plagiarizes was great, this remake in disguise can't hold a candle to it.  JJ, you are in over your head, and, sadly, even if the next director is better, he's been set up for failure by the trajectory of this mess that you've left for him.  Near-universal critical acclaim?  Give me a break.",0
582,"Feminist Political Correct Garbage. Weak Villain, Illogical Fight Scene's, Broken Script that makes no sense. I don't even consider a STAR WARS film. Worst STAR WARS film, broken and a total lemon, I don't even know how they approved the script or who gave it approval of it being RELEASED! It's total garbage.",0
583,"If this movie vote was to consider the marketing and hype and compare to its value, the vote would be a huge negative.This is a poor remake of the early movies, though it's completely uninspired and forgettable, the plot predictable and uninspiring, the evil character is one of the lamest ever",0
584,"wow, just wow.  I can only echo other negative reviews. The movie is visually stunning, I watched it at a new Imax and it was great but damn its one empty movie. This is the worst Star Wars film yet. My main problem is with Ren, He is portrayed as a strong Sith, His early scenes he is shown as very powerful, holding a blaster shot in mid air while doing other stuff. He goes nuts and slashes up inside the ship and scares a guy then drags him across the room. These two scenes, specifically the first one in the village gave me shivers but after he took his mask off he simply came across as a character for a teenager to be viewing, not a star wars fan. I was left shocked and just gobsmacked that he had trouble dealing with an ex storm trooper who only wanted too run away and against ray without any light saber experience. it took other jedi's / sith's including Anakin Years to practice the force and light saber use, yet ray just uses special force powers just like that. the light saber duels are pathetic. the entire movie has no soul. It was nice to see the old cast. I can only echo another critics review in saying the best thing that can happen now is Luke is a psycho on his lonely island and chops Rey in two with the light saber, maybe then a story can get started. JJ needs hanging for what he has done to the franchise. Worst Star Wars movie yet. I'm giving it a 4 purely on its visuals, might have been less if I hadn't have been in a new fancy 3D Imax.",0
585,"This is a very mediocre action blockbuster movie, and typical JJ Abrams - sparse on character development, retreading old plot lines from the original series, plot holes you could drive a truck through and rush-rush-rush. As a result, the relationships in the movie ring false and there is no tension - especially since the pilot is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes, Leia in it for maybe five, Luke shows up for even less than that, and the main female protagonist doesn't seem to have much of any struggle as the story progresses. Still doubt my assessment? Do a search for reviews on YouTube. Check out the movie quotes on IMDB. If you think the prequels were turd sandwiches, well this is a vomit taco. Not really an improvement!",0
587,"Watching this movie is a sad affair and the good reviews for it are INSANE. Not just surprising, but completely insane. It is not a good movie, and really makes you wonder why people could give it good reviews. Have people given up on movies? Is this what we consider a passing grade? I understand having some allegiance to a movie franchise, but at some point we just have to be honest. Star Wars VII is crap made to sell you more crap. Maybe the toys are fun for your kids, but if you are older than 10 this movie will be (or should be) boring, repetitive, and cliche nonsense. Quick summary:Rey is crap, she runs like a fool, her accent is absurd, and how she ""acquires"" the force is absolutely ridiculous. These attempts at writing a powerful female character are laughable and actually insulting. The presentation and development of the First Order and Resistance is lazy. The world-building is also lazy. The Kylo Ren actor is laughably cast. He looks like a close-up magician who stole Snape's haircut. The references are pointless, because the movie just isn't good. Here's a tip: leave out all the cheap references to the previous films and just make a good movie instead. But that won't happen, because they have to sell this to millions around the world, so nuance or intelligence is thrown out the window before the movie is even made. The CG woman in the bar (you'll know her) is so bad - it looks like they just lifted the costume-making character from the Incredibles and plopped her into ""a galaxy far far away."" Anyway... on and on.. The movie is just...dumb. Chewie is good. No problems with Chewie.",0
588,"I'm a regular fan of star wars movies and games, with that being said here is my opinion. SWTFA is full of completely unbelievable coincidences. The characters find each other as if everyone is down the street or something. This movie is just way too much like the other star wars movies, like nothing else ever happens. The Bad people want to kill the good and innocent people for absolutely no reason at all. Kylo Ren ""the main bad guy of these films"" is a cry baby that gets his ass handed to him by a little girl that for some reason has gained great saber fighting and force abilities all within like a day, not even. Finn is literaly just some random guy. The first order attacks the resistance with all the characters in the movie all at the same place and all in the same day... None of this stuff is really believable. I enjoy the atmosphere of star wars movies, but this one had me thinking "" this feels like too many things are happening all at once that are very very unlikely to happen within a day or two"". The Strong female role is just tacked on just because. These movies are popular among white males most of all, but they have an interracial relationship development between a white female and a black male in this movie that just does not seem like its believable or fits in any way. These movies would be better off if they would just go many years in the future without ever mentioning anything about older star wars movies and just start with fresh new character and stories. J. J. Abrams is being replaced as director of episode 8 because they knew he screwed it up. Its worth watching just to see how a great franchise can be treated by uninspired money grabbing **** like disney.",0
589,"I have found it somewhat cathartic to see that many share a similar sentiment to my own. As someone whom, aside from the Soundtracks hadn't thought of Star Wars for a while, for sure I was skeptical. But make no mistake, the critics have failed us. Forget about Star Wars, this is quite frankly a poor work of fiction. Nonsense from head to foot. Like many others, I signed up because I needed to get this off my chest. The movie suffers from numerous sins; contrived plot/convenient happenstances, characters with no clear motivations, unnecessary characters, poorly defined conflict, illogical conceit, central premise pointless. That's some laundry list. Basically Stormtrooper deserter takes on mission to find Droid. After crash landing, the first thing he sees is Droid with this chick, how convenient. Joining forces and they escape in the Millenium Falcon which just happens to be Moored in this town for some reason. This Rae is some pilot too. After an escape featuring much derring-do it seems Han and Chewbacca basically run right into them. Obviously a Galaxy = small town. They had pretty much lost me at this point and it was made worse that this was followed up with the most dire scene in the movie. Oh, and that Light Sabre that Luke lost down that void in Cloud City, well they found the proverbial 'needle in a haystack'. There's no possible explanation for this anyway. It's dumb. The not-Empire and Darkside are treated like cartoon villains here. The general and Petulant Vader-Wannabee both have unparalled access to the not-Emporer Snoke. A CGI character named Snoke, oh dear. So this general and Kylo Ren are both twenty-somethings in charge of not-Empire operations despite being largely portrayed as incompetant, atleast when it counts. Young, inexperienced leaders in charge? Heirarchy, how does it work. Hey Snokey-babe how 'bout you hire some better goons. The Republic/not-Rebels somehow fare even worse. Basically this aspect is barely shown at all. I get the impression that the Republic has taken on a policy of pacivism. Eh, ok. So what is the central premise here? To find Luke? Well yeah, finding Luke could be a useful thing for both the Republic and not-Empire. You know what the republic needs? An army. Oh yeah, Death Star 3.0 suddenly turns up. Han quips about 'Taking out the Shields, that's what we do' or some such thing. The sad thing is that, that's exactly what happened. They couldn't have made it less climactic if they tried. Of course Death Star 3.0 blew up a few planets before going down, the Republic in the process. This ending is basically like a soccer match where both teams score an own goal at the end of the match. Maybe I missed something, but R2D2 basically delivered Luke's location anyway, making the whole preceding series of events, more or less pointless. I mean, what even is this? It sure as hell ain't a good movie. Too many characters, the not-Rebel pilot and Deserter Stormtrooper really add nothing worthwhile to the plot. None of the characters have realistic motivations or any motivations at all. Things I liked: Chewbacca, C3P0 and R2D2 really appeared 'as they were'. The score in isolation to the film. Although the music has some surprisingly clunky pieces and falls short of series best, it is still worth listening to. But the style just doesn't work with how the film is edited and the sound effects were raucious. Just more flaws. It's Banther Fodder. Maybe I missed something but R2D2 basically delivered the map",0
590,"Star Wars Episode VII: My Money Has Been TakenHow do we know the ending....when we haven't..seen the movie..wait stop the movie we have seen this before....unless they know..we were coming...evasive maneuvers regroup to holding sector 37..Admiral we have copycats in sector 37....ITS A TRAP!",0
591,"Well. I went and saw it with an open mind. And now having done so - I pose the following question: suppose you are handed the Star Wars license - a treasured and cherished world... the possibilities are endless... the implications without limit. The story-lines that you could pursue - the rich and varied canon upon which you could draw...  the menace you could conjure from the depths of deep space... the eternal struggle between the Dark and the Light sides of the Force... anything is possible. But instead, Disney and JJ give us an uninspired, derivative, soulless turkey. This movie is a train wreck from start to finish (aside from the first 15 minutes which aren't too bad and the last 2 minutes which was OK). The gaping holes in the plot, the lineup of weak and pointless villains, and the eerie sense of reverie for the classic films embodied in the returning cast recalls the ghosts of much better films in what, even in it's best moments, is a pale imitation without soul or substance. The new cast members are a mixed bag. Finn has no gravitas (and that's not because he's black - its because he's working with a crap script where he's given only comic relief and because he doesn't strike me as a very good actor), while Rey is passable but mired in feminist symbolism. Captain Phasma is completely superfluous - all the hubub about her was puzzling considering she gets about 2 lines and 1 minute of screen time... if she wasn't a female you wouldn't notice the character at all. The only standout was Poe Dameron but he doesn't get much screen time. The returning cast were nice to see - but they look old and tired - leaving the viewer pining for the classic films in more ways than one. But don't worry - the entire plot is pretty much Star Wars - A New Hope - and that's not an exaggeration - even down to disabling the shields so that the rebels (er... resistance) can destroy the Death Star (er... Star Killer). Then you have the climatic scene where one of the film's big moments occur - which essentially boils down to a domestic between parent and child that could play out in any suburban lounge room. It's a pathetic and silly end for a beloved character. And on top of the superficial lip service to adventure, we have to contend with a thick layer of political correctness. Seriously - it's beyond a joke. I didn't buy into whole 'white guys upset because of a black lead' stuff that was in the media before I saw the film... but having seen it - the Social Justice Brigade are out in force in this movie... and you know what... that wouldn't be so bad IF THE DIVERSITY ANGLE HAD A CONTEXTUAL PLACE in the story... if it made sense within the constraints of the narrative... and it doesn't. If you wanted too - you could note that the bad guys are all white Europeans (almost all male) with English accents - representative of those nasty white males who are responsible for every problem with the world ever conceived; while the 'resistance' are the Social Justice Inclusivity Brigade with lots of different cultures and genders represented - representative off all the 'oppressed' people who suffer so terribly with all those micro aggressions and first world 'issues' which a generation of pampered, self-entitled narcissistic millennials constantly whine about. It's pretty easy to see the sulky brat villain with his daddy issues pining after Darth Vader (i.e. patriarchy) easily put down by the strong feminist lead with her black guy sidekick - and a female Jedi is fine... but she's got no training, no nothing, but still kicks ass with the light sabre and force powers. Seems training isn't needed anymore, like a lot of other elements of Star Wars canon - it's just chucked out. All a bit pathetic. It will make a truckload of money because it's got the Star Wars label on it - but it's not Star Wars; just a cheap counterfeit, like bad fan fiction written by a first year Gender Studies millennial. Once the hype dies down, most will see it for what it is.",0
592,A shameless rip off of New Hope. Rey was a mary sue. Ren was butchered and looked like an incompetent loser at the end. A lot of bad quips too. At least the prequels tried something new.,0
594,"I cant express myself how I feel. Its about Pop culture, Dream, fantasy, Role models, Heroes, motivations, anything... it starts with religion, goes through a soccer match, also as a singer, etc.. same goes with the Star Wars World. as a hardcore fan i can accept anything, even the Episode I - III Movies.. but this.. this was just a Sci Fi Tv Movie.. 200 millon dollars? Oh my god, where is the money, not in the Movie... no real ships just x-wings, no b-wings, no A-wings, no Nebulan B Frigatte, Mon Calamari etc...NOTHING!!!! this was a cheap, heartless and artificial movie. I still can understand how some people may say it was a good movie, i think the psychology of the promotion made his work.. or even worse, the Reparation Departement from Disney assure that NO ONE would drop the ratings... well... the first day it has 9.6 points... now it has 7.6... and dropping... why? because the Hype is going away...They Destroyed Star Wars... They had no respect for the fans, for the pop culture, specially not to George Lucas... shame on you!!!! it was sad going out from the cinema, after entering with happyness...hugs from Spainfrom a lousy Filmmaker",0
596,"real ticks me off how much propaganda  there is in this film . it is such a farce of in your face “female empowerment” .For example this Captain Phasma. portrayed as an alpha badass, elusive and apparently capable of extraordinary combat feats. So someone please tell me: where in real life (and the military) are these sorts of women? One of the hallmarks of good fantasy is its ability to generate suspended disbelief. The story must be real and plausible enough in other areas that you can forgive the mind-boggling aspects (such as the Force in Star Wars).  Captain Phasma just doesn’t pass the sniff test.leave it to liberals to ruin starwars.",0
597,"This movie isn't just bad, it's shameful.  How can Disney take a franchise that has meant so much to so many people and pervert it into this ridiculous sham?  This is not the next episode of the Star Wars series.  It's not the next episode of anything.  It's a remake!  Are you kidding me?  You acquire the most successful movie franchise ever, and rather than take advantage of the possibilities that it presents to you, you decide to remake it instead?  Did you really think you could remake those movies better than they already were?  Talk about brainless!  Movie audiences fell for the hype this time.  We'll see what happens with episode 8 (or rather the remake of episode 5).  Unbelievable!",0
599,Welcome to Disney. This movie is nothing more than a big fat cash cow! Disney had reasons why they payed more than 4 billion $. They have their analysts and marketing researchers and the result is this movie. Why is Kylo Ren taking of his helmet? It totally ruined his badass aura. This movie was full of story parts that dont get explained. Its a marketing mess... There is no magical aura anymore. Disney will do the same as they did with all the marvel characters: bring into line for what is most salable.,0
600,"This movie and The Martian made me lose all respect toward official reviewers. A movie should not get a high score for including ”all” possible minorities. It should not effect the rating of a movie in any way. And still both movies got rave reviews, when The Martian is very average and Force Awakens is just plain bad. The latter of course benefits from the fact that it's super hyped SW film. Even on rotten tomatoes, my (ex) go to site, even the users review are overtly positive. Because of this I'm using Metacritics' user reviews as my guide for now on because here you can still find some common sense. Jar Jar Abrams has now remade A New Hope twice. It was ok when it was called ”Star Trek” but not in the case of TFA because it's in the same movie series.  It doesn't work when you watch them in order. How he is not ashamed to deliver a ”soft” reboot of one of all time classics?? On top of it being a completely lazy rehash, the plot and happenings in it don't have any weight in them. It's a super hollow movie ticking fanboy pleasing boxes: Desert planet, check. Falcon, check. X-wings, check. Tie fighters, check. Some new design please other than beginning's flying popsicle. In addition the planets and environments in this are so basic the movie is lacking any sense of scale except one speech scene. Most of these ”other worlds” could be shot by fanfilm makers near their homes. And yes, prequels had better story, scale and sense of wonder. One point comes from two original scenes/ideas in the movie that were quite nice. Those who say this is better than RotJ: Go take a look in the mirror, then slap yourself hard to wake up! Want to see a good recent space adventure? Watch Guardians of the Galaxy instead! I feel dirty paying money to see this.",0
601,"Worst villain of any star wars movie yet, rivaled only by Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader in Episode III and played by a terrible actor. The 'all angsty teenagers with anger management issues go to the dark side' theme didn't work in Episode III and it sure as hell doesn't work now. As a matter of fact, its even worse this time because at least in Episode III it was original. Half the story is taken directly from A New Hope. Originality fail - the movie is predictable and boring because of this. Too much time in the movie is spent dwelling on the point that women can do what men can too. I counted a solid 20min. I want to see Star Wars, not Gender Wars. I'm not sure what to think about the black stormtrooper - on one hand - its affirmative action nonsense yet on the other hand they've made the character as hateable as Jar Jar Binks - overly enthusiastic about everything, overacting everything and nonsensical attempts at comic relief. **Spoiler Alert** The only good character in the movie (Han Solo) who is played by a great actor gets killed off in the most predictable and unglamorous way. Stabbed in the front and thrown off a bridge, The next best character whose acting is great is not a human at all. Its BB-8. This is very sad. Not gonna bother spending time/money on the next one. JJ Abrams should return to Star Trek and not further tarnish his otherwise great reputation in Sci Fi with this nonsense.",0
602,"I'm literally baffled at the uniformly high reviews for Episode VII. The new Darth Vader is the child of Han Solo and Princess Leia! A tormented psychopath who only moments after participating in the annihilation of an entire planet, has this forlorn mother pleading with Han Solo to ""bring our boy home."" Good God, talk about failed parenting! The writing is atrocious-- particularly the second and third acts (the first ast was kind of fun!). Character actions often seem preposterous and totally unmotivated. And then there's the whole issue of harnessing the Force. No longer is this something that has to be earned and studied--no, that would be too hard and actually take some thought on the writers' behalf. Here the force is a birthright, something that if you merely grimace and groan will flood you with a host of supernatural powers. Oy, I could go on and on... I wanted to have a good time, I really did. I loved the original 3. I've got a pair of young boys who I'd love to share this with, but the writing here was appalling and the movie just plan old bad.",0
603,"In a galaxy far, far away, some folks have talent and a desire to make movies with texture.  Sadly, none were contacted in the making of this film. More to the point, it's pathetic - wooden acting, CFisher appears hunchback, HFord so old his role here seems eerily reminiscent of the last SConnery Bond movie in which his teeth whistled.  The notion one would be asked here to check if one revealed spoilers is, sadly, laughable: there's nothing fresh in this movie - and therefore nothing capable of spoilage.  If you've seen the first movie, you've seen this, though the former far more entertaining. Besides giving an honest opinion, though, my reason for writing was this - the discrepancy between the scores given by professional reviewer and everyday ""user"" on this site is overwhelming.  Good lord, it's tragic - is there no honesty left amongst you eaters of broken meat?",0

These days one man ruined my childhood memories his name is J.J. Abrams and he proved that he is mediocrity and talent less director and screenplay writer. J.J. Abrams desecrate G. Lucas lifework, masterpiece in SF genre, insult and humiliate generations of SW fans. This movie is simply nothing, this movie is trash or better this movie is nothing but the feminist propaganda and humiliation of man. J.J. Abrams I wish you never make any movie ever, go and direct soap opera or better go and grow vegetables if you are capable to do it.",0
606,"After first seeing this movie I thought it was good movie and a made a review giving it a 7 but every time I think about the plot the more ""mistakes"" I found. First of all the movie the movie is consider (even I consider it) ""too safe"" when actually it's just lazy writing and a cheap attempt to please the ""fans"" that hated the prequels to the point of making death threats. We have the plot, that for some reason they tried to adapt the old to the new one but now it doesn't work or make sense at all, we goes from searching Luke to destroying planets and fighting a new Death Star that doesn't make sense at all.The good guys group is call the resistance but actually the bad guys (The First Order) are not a command, so of we have more that one bad guys (which doesn't make sense because the first order destroy the current government without retaliation) or the name doesn't make sense. What also doesn't make sense is how they manage to build that weapon without drawing attention. We have the new characters, they are basically all the old character's characteristic we liked in the first SW spread in younger actors.We have also the new characters that does nothing like Captain Phasma and Snoke and essential character development that doesn't make sense or is not existing on screen like FN-2187 fighting against what he was taught and becoming Finn, how he and poe didn't die crashing in a space ship, how they became BFF in one scene(I understand that Finn save Poe, but owing =/= best friends, and more considering Finn used to be a Storm Trooper and you don't know nothing about him), how Rey pass from not knowing how to elevate the ship to do the best moves in the whole movie in just 1 minute, why Kylo Ren acts like a 3 yo boy having tantrums and can do a 180° turn stop a shot and a person in the same movement, reads mind and then sucks ass, to name a few (to be hones I got bored of arguing the lack of sense in the characters actions). We have the old characters, they are just here to merge the first trilogy with this new story and bring nostalgia, Leia could be replace by any kind of new general, Han Solo (I like him in this movie) had more purpose and Luke appears only to set the new movies. So this movie make no sense the more you think it, if I didn't like how gorgeous some scenes looked I would gave this a 1 without a doubt.",0
607,"This movie was a big disappointment. It seemed to rip off from all of the original Star Wars movies. I wanted to see more of Luke Skywalker, but instead, got a boring story about Han Solo and his son. I also cannot understand how the empire rebuilt itself so quickly after suffering such a huge defeat by the rebels. I would also like to know who the jedi was at the start of the movie was. I actually assumed that it was Luke because he had similar features to a young Mark Hamil. Instead, Luke was removed from the storyline, even though he was the main character in the movies that came before. Very disappointing.",0
612,"The Prequels were better at everything except Disney's Marketing Machine. Worse than Into Darkness.

The ""NO SPOILERS"" move by Disney was genius, otherwise everyone would've realized it was a New Hope retread with bigger plot holes and a bigger death star. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss Jar Jar.",0
613,"The movie sucked and I was in a very sad state that I had to write this review. Unlike the very shallow and biased reviews made by the top critics I will try to qualify this review so I can move along with my life with a clear conscience. This movie sucked because.1. This is a rehash. Copycats should never be rewarded. They are thrown out of universities for plagiarism.2. This is a reboot but they are are selling it as a continuation of the story. Are they saying history repeats itself?3. Bad acting. Han Solo and Leia seemed like they were FORCEd. No pun intended.4. No chemistry between Rey and Finn. The interracial love between the two looks FORCEd. No pun intended.5. The villain does not look intimidating. Just a self-absorbed brat.6. Sub-par action scenes not worthy of a blockbuster.7. Sub-par effects not worthy of a blockbuster.8. Lots of loopholes in the storyline. Sorry, too many to mention.9. No emotion. When planets were obliterated there was no sadness. When a major character dies there is not much grief.10. No heart. Uninspired (except perhaps by money).",0

Would've preferred the used the script from the books taking place after ROtJ. HUGE disappointment.",0

Not only was this just a remake of A New Hope, but... - How could Rey learn the Force in a few minutes when it took Luke years?- The bad guy isn't really that good at all.  I mean, two lowly people can hold their own in a lightsaber fight?- If you suck up all the energy from your star, won't you pretty much destroy your planet in the process?- I miss the storytelling of George.- Did not get the New Order v Republic v Resistance thing.  I mean, if there was a Republic, why would there need to be a resistance?  What are they resisting?  The Republic?- And, our biggest complaint - why kill Han?  Totally lost me after that.",0

Didn't we win? Didn't the empire get beaten? Then why is 7 back to episode 4? We, the people living now, have this 'nostalgia effect' dangling down on us, so we may give this movie high reviews.

There is tons of such mistakes i don't even want to continue",0
623,"If this hadn't had ""Star Wars"" attached to it, it would have been panned. As it is quite bad. This movie is a rehash of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. Star destroyer at start? Check. Attack on rebels resulting in capture of one rebel while droid escapes with important data on it? Check. Droid finds force-sensitive person (who is likely the child of another character) on a desert planet, who shows remarkable piloting ability? Check (heck, hasn't this happened three times now?). Rebel escapes from bad guys with help of reluctant ally? Check. Force sensitive person escapes desert planet on Millenium Falcon just ahead of the Empire? Check. The list goes on. And none of this is even a spoiler, really, because YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN STAR WARS. Seriously, that's how bad this movie is. Literally everything in it, from the new not-Death Star to the death of the old mentor, is just a rehash of the original. Yes, there are some differences... but the ways in which it differs actually makes it worse. The original cast returns, and Han, Leia, and Chewbacca are highlights of the movie. Han and Chewie play a major role and are main characters, even. I was kind of disappointed that Han was randomly off on his own again, as it was very jarring when he showed up and seemed to show little interest in the Resistance, but it made sense after a while. Well, a marginal amount of sense. Chewie was Chewie, and he worked just fine. Leia is okay, but something of a bit part, which is true of C3PO and R2D2 as well, both of whom play very marginal roles but get to show off their character. However, the new characters essentially all suck. Finn, the rebel stormtrooper, is inconsistently characterized, and while him being terrified and something of a coward is reasonable, he suggests that the reason he fled was that he wasn't willing to kill people... and then he instantly turns around and kills a ton of his former friends without any hesitation. He alternates between cowardice and killing lots of people for much of the movie, and it is terrible. He has no real depth of character, no particularly interesting speech patterns, nothing. He's just boring. Rey, the movie's Luke expy, is a worse character than Luke in every way. She more closely resembles Anakin Skywalker from The Phantom Menace, including in her bizarre ability to instantly do a ton of things that it took other characters a lot of training to learn how to do. This sucks and it makes no sense - Luke spent three movies learning how to become a Jedi, and was wary of the light saber, while Rey gets in a lightsaber duel the first time she picks it up (and Finn also uses it effectively, which seems questionable - how did a storm trooper learn how to use a light saber?). She is a whiner who is waiting for her parents to come back, even though it is obvious to everyone that she has been abandoned by her parents, and it seems likely she is Luke’s daughter. She is bland, boring, and often takes actions (like running away on a random planet) which makes no sense and feels redundant with Finn's own status as a reluctant hero. Poe is a resistance fighter who is the Rebel Alliance’s best pilot and who flies around an x-wing. He disappears for a good chunk of the film and seems very generic – he’s just a generic rebel pilot. I wasn’t surprised when he was killed off, I didn’t even recognize him when he showed back up again because he was so forgettable, and his personality, like the others’, was very bland and generic. He was no reluctant hero, but I am forced to wonder why he wasn’t with the other two characters for most of the movie – he could have served as a logical pilot versus Rey’s sudden ability to fly the Millenium Falcon, he could have gotten more characterization, and he could have served as more of a core to the team. His death didn’t incite any feelings in me, and when he doesn’t die after all, I didn’t care either. BB-8, the new droid, is, quite sadly, the most well-characterized of the new characters. This is sad because he has no actual ability to speak at all, and has to rely entirely on body language. He serves as comedic relief, but feels redundant when the other droids show up. And then there is the new villain, Kylo Ren, AKA Ben, a helmeted Darth Vader expy with a red lightsaber (with a hilt of sorts), a deep, menacing voice, and a Jedi who turned to the Dark Side of the Force. In the world’s most shocking moment, he turns out to be related to one of the heroes as well. Seriously. While there is some logic here – the character idolizes Darth Vader, and wants to be like him – the sad thing is that greatly damages him as a person. Darth Vader was awesome, but Kylo Ren ends up coming off as a wannabe. He’s violent and deadly, to be sure, but he’s more like a manchild than a cold, dark general. Indeed, the entire First Order comes off this way – a bunch of kids playing at being the Empire, rather than brutal dictators. It robs the film of gravitas.",0
624,"It's a good action film, but it is definitely a bad star wars film, the worst in fact.Actually there is almost no  story beside the story that has been taken from SW 4but executed in a bad way (there is no magic, the physics aren't respected, poor dialogues), the rest was absolute illogical crapwith no creativity or character develloping, seriously the characters couldn't be lessinteresting, between the villain who has no personallity and Rey that apparently needs no training tomaster every jedi technique and defeat the (supposedly) strong main (badass ?) sith lord.",0

Rylo Ken is a giant wuss bag that a little girl could beat up. The black guy's role was pretty much pointless. Seems like they added him in just to have a black guy in the movie. Movie was boring.  I nearly fell asleep. I really need to stop watching these hyped up movies. I keep giving Hollywood a reason to keep making them by giving them my money. I wait for DVD when the second part comes out in a year or two.",0
626,"Terrible movie was terrible. The storm troopers were always CLONES, but I get it this is a different story supposedly. What I did not like is that the characters felt hollow to me. I didn't really care all that much about most of them. The father and son reunion was EXTREMELY convenient.Conditioned storm trooper quits, and is reluctant to kill people (leader sees him, walks off...)Desert girl is an ace pilot and engineer when she pretty much only lived on a desert planet while being very poor...... She also learns the force in 3 seconds and completely wrecks the main villain.Masked Villain doesn't use the force very much and used it only to freeze people while being able to stop lasers with it. If he can do that he should be able to completely annihilate people with it....Saber fights - > barely any and all were very lame. (Slow mo saber fights... without slow mo effects. Like the fights were really slow and boring.)Movie felt super politically correct.Verdict -> Star Wars Battlefront was better movie.",0
627,"First off, I am not a Star Wars Fan Boy. I have no Bias. I just watched the entire 6 Star Wars films two years ago and thoroughly enjoyed them all, even the Prequels. Despite some of the Prequels shortfalls, the villains were still great, the Characters great, and the plot and character development excellent and very ""Star Wars"" The Force Awakens is not just the worst Star Wars Movie, it is one of the worst and most diluted movies I have ever seen. It is on my top 10 worst movies list (excluding ridiculous no-budget goof movies like CHUD etc). The villain is an absolute goofball. He is not scary or serious at all. We get no time to get to know the characters. Finn changes personalities way too fast. Not only that, but by the previews he seemed like a serious, emotional character. But it turns out he was just a goofball clown and an unlovable hero. Very disappointed with his Characters lack of power and presence. The plot. WTF? It jumps all over the place. One minute its on track going to find Luke where it could have taken us on a fun treasure hunt and many different places to find him and gather clues. Instead time was wasted on the most useless scenes that wasted screen time. Like when they find Han Solo and suddenly monsters are loose and that takes like 10-15 minutes.....I kept waiting for it to end so the Journey could start. The rest of the Characters and scenes were forgettable. Next thing you know suddenly all these planets blow up and there is a new Deathstar and the entire Resistance is about to be annihilated.......where the hell did that come from? WHAT IS GOING ON?? NOW GOLEM IS IN THE MOVIE??!??!?! WHERE ID GOLEM COME FROM?!?!?! I also have to point out how absolutely awful and outplayed their attempt was to make the Stormtroopers look like Nazis......really. **** ridiculous. It also really ruined the scary unsolved mystery the stormtroopers were. Even though we learned what they were, there was some mystery there. Han Solos death which should have been a massive massive moment was so predictable. It had no build up. It should have struck so much harder, but it was so rushed. I still wasn't even sure what the hell was going on at that point. No review got it more right than the Vatican associated newspaper. I am not religious, I am an ""Athiest"" (I just consider myself born neutral but ok). They tried to paint it out as a joke and religion influenced, but it is the most accurate, credible and unbiased review since Im pretty sure Disney wasnt advertising on their website and publication. If you haven't read it, go check it out. Too bad. So much could have been done and I LOVED JJ Abrams Star Trek Pictures. But man, What a FLOP this was. Top 10 worst movies I have EVER seen!!! The ONLY good thing in the movie was Rey. Not her Character, but her acting. She stole the show and that very very very last moment with her and Luke did get me to tingle a bit. Other than that, just absolutely awful. Thanks for reading.",0
629,"It's a welcome visit back to the Star Wars universe, satisfyingly filled with fan-service references. The plot, however, is somewhat weak (see below), and altogether made for an overall juvenile story. **spoilers** ... ... You'd think after having two death stars blown up, they'd stop making huge contraptions with fatal weak points. It's also nice to see the protagonist suddenly acquire skills and powers overwhelming, right in the nick of time. Twists feel somewhat overdone--more for edginess then for substance. In any case, I was disappointed, but entertained. **/spoilers**",0
630,"Though some new characters are underused and the plot retreads ANH slightly, The Force Awakens is a great start to this new trilogy due to the excellent acting from Daisy Ridely, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and the rest of the new and original cast, its insane final lightsabre battle, and the excellent practical effects used in place of overused CGI. A-",1
632,"Well, I broke my rule and saw SW-FA last night, having vowed after seeing the trailers I would wait until its on hbo! My suspicions were confirmed. The hard-to-ruin storyline was satisfying (I mean, really, even JJ Abrams couldn't completely derail a basically good story) but the three main new ""actors"": really? Were we all that hard up for a contemporary sequel that we accepted any body that Disney threw at us? Never mind the all too gratuitous casting, but c'mon, the bad- and overacting! Ok, now grimace (""I'm angry now""); now wide eyes (""I'm afraid now"") and now yell (""I'm intense now""); and the lackluster (lets be honest, crude) reading of dialogue makes for, well, very not only run-of-the-mill (read: bad) performances that were ""saved"" (read: marginally excusable) by 1. a huge interest in wanting the movie to be good; 2 the veteran actors (thankfully) that helped keep things together and 3. great special effects. Finn character was almost completely arbitrary; Poe was ancillary and I cant figure out for the life of me why he was inserted. Oh well...Disney. I understand the need for this generation to embrace and make their own a part of the Star Wars phenomenon(now approx. 35 years since); granted And, even the worst tourist restaurant stays in business for years because of the millions of one-timers who never return to that bad restaurant (but they still keep making money, right?:) ). Same here: the hype and anticipation and (in my case) curiosity created a $$ blockbuster that really wasn't all that good when you really look objectively at it as a movie.",0
633,"Characters:I’m OK with the 3 new characters on the light side:Rey was fantastic, I loved Daisy Ridley, she was outstanding in the role.Poe was equally engaging, I liked his snarky wit and enthusiasm.BB8 was magic, nice to see an advancement on the droid front since 1977! (And he now takes USB flash drives!)FiNn was decent as well.  I loved John Boyega and the enthusiasm he brought to the role.  They all bring their share of great acting moments, lighthearted jokes, and “humanize” the film.  I have many, many story related questions about these characters, and I think we’re supposed to after this film, but I enjoyed all of them.Having Han, Leia, Luke, 3PO, and R2 back feels like a warm sweater, although I have questions on Abrams’ treatment/usage of several characters as it relates to the story.  I’ll get to that in a bit, for now let’s just leave it as great to see those old friends.The neutral characters were largely forgettable, except for Maz, whom I enjoyed.  She was a good addition to the second act and added story elements to a very sparse landscape, and I appreciated that. (More on the story to come)Now onto the dark side:We’ll start with Supreme Leader Snoke, (or is this JJ’s version of his smoke monster from Lost?)  We never see him “in the flesh” and that was annoying to me.  There was no character depth for Snoke at all, no reasoning why he was the leader of the First Order, why he seduced Kylo Ren, how, when, etc.  He just felt like a cardboard character.Kylo Ren.  AKA, whiniest dark side character ever.  Not much story surrounding him, or why he was estranged from his parents.  No reason why, how, or when, or heck even “if” he was the Jedi seduced into destroying Luke’s Jedi Academy.  I’ll assume he was, having no other indication, coupled with the fact that Luke is his uncle and Leia saying that’s why she wanted Luke to train him.  I’m fairly certain he must be the one.  I’ll save more for the story part, but this character was the flimsiest bad guy we’ve encountered in Star Wars to date.  No story about why he is aligned with the First Order, he’s just a bad guy.Captain Phasma (Fasma?) I’ll have to be honest right here, I had to go look up her name.  That’s how little they spent even showing this character, not to mention developing any story about how or why she is a Captain in the First Order.  I found it very puzzling that the only character wearing chrome storm trooper gear was relegated to about 15 lines of dialogue, and apparently a garbage chute.General Hitler (I don’t remember his name either, and honestly just don’t care)  Things are different in JJ’s Star Wars universe, seemingly.  I saw several times that this character should have been force choked, and for some reason Kylo Ren seemed to cower to him.  Why was he allowed to facetime the Supreme Leader Smoke Monster with “Ben”?  No backstory on why he’s a General.  No story about his relationship with Snoke, why he’s with the First Order, seeing a pattern here?Characters are vital to a story.  Especially one as grandiose of a Space Opera as Star Wars.  Having cardboard cutout characters really cheapens the story for me, and I feel that justice was not done for any character other than FiNn and Rey. Pacing:I found the pacing of the film to be horrible.  There were no crescendos of emotion invoked at all like previous films.  90% of the movie I imagined that it was what an ADHD person experiences.  The other 10% was plodding and unnecessary.  For example, we had the scene of Han and Chewy capturing the Falcon adrift, and the ensuing dialogue and cgi monster brawl.  It was just all unnecessary.  It would have been better to have Han reintroduced playing a card game to win back the Falcon from the person who stole it from the person who stole it from the person who stole it from Han.  This gives more time to character development and storytelling rather than another unnecessary throw away action sequence.I also could have done without one of the three distinct dogfight scenes.  The one at Maz’s castle is the one I would remove, it’s also unnecessary.  Just have the First Order win the raid fight and retreat as overwhelming resistance is coming in with Rey in captivity, this would have served the same purpose, taken less time, and also opened up much needed dialogue between Han, FiNn, and “Ben”.The movie just felt like a starter’s gun went off at the start and it was just go, go, go for the whole thing. Story:I’ll be brutally honest to start this section.  The story of this movie was horrible, in my opinion.  I was a fan of the EU Thrawn trilogy, and felt it was a much stronger vehicle than what Lucasfilm and Disney presented to us in The Force Awakens.The crawl goes by and we learn that Luke is missing.  Some people called the First Order, and a resistance led by Leia are looking for him.  Leia sends a pilot on a spy mission. Um, OK, what?  Why would she send Poe?  That makes no sense.  Are there no longer any Bothans to die for this information?Next we meet a character named Lor San Tekka, a seemingly “in the know” character, who refers to Leia as royalty, not a General, and in short order reconfirms he is more than a village leader on a backwater planet by the knowing dialogue between Van Sydow and Kylo Ren.  Then he’s brutally murdered by Kylo Ren.  WTF?  And Kylo Ren can pause/freeze laser blasts in mid air.  Which is light, so my BS meter went off for the first time right here.And there’s a Storm Trooper with bloody fingerprints on his helmet, seeming losing his mind.  We meet an ominous Captain of Stormtroopers clad in shiny chrome, and surely this character will be integral to the story as it progresses.Next we see Rey scavenging, we find out scavenging doesn’t pay very well, and she’s been holed up in that AT-AT for a long time.  Or she just really sucks at tic-tac-toe.  We learn that a battle must have taken place here by all of the wreckage and debris, but nothing is made of it or explained.  OK… so, it’s all just scenery?  Oh, and she conveniently rescued BB8 a mere 10 feet from her AT-AT abode, and can apparently speak several languages, including droid beep-boop-bop.FiNn, the Stormtrooper losing his mind during the opening raid then rescues Poe, because he’s decided he needs to escape the First Order.  He quickly learns how to fire guns from a 2 seater TIE fighter, that are apparently swivel-turret mounted now.  There are problems with the escape, but I’ll suspend my disbelief about how easily they got out of a hanger full of troopers, as it’s been done before in the Star Wars Universe.FiNn then finds himself alone back on Jakka, and makes his way to meet Rey and BB8 conveniently.  He also knows BB8’s name without being told what it is.  A minor plot hole, but important foreshadowing into the rest of the movie.  BB8 fashion police’s the jacket he’s now wearing as belonging to Poe, just as a raid begins on the outpost causing them to hide, then flee once an airstrike begins.So let’s digest these opening scenes for a moment.  First, that’s a lot of coincidences.  All of these things happen to occur to put these characters together, but it’s a bit forced.  I would have had FiNn and Poe somehow escape the first raid in a more believable manner, rather than get back to the ship and escape, but that breaks the vehicle of introducing how powerful Kylo Ren is supposed to be, and him finding out the stolen death star plans are in a droid… er, I mean, the map to Luke Skywalker is in a droid.  Which is the second problem with how this opens.  Didn’t this all get done before, in a very similar fashion?  A New Hope had a droid with secret info that the rebellion needed, and the Empire looking for it.  Said droid then conveniently made his way to the protagonist, where they had to flee.  AND they fled in the same freaking vehicle!!!This was the first point in the movie that my mind started seriously yelling REBOOT! And sensing I wouldn’t enjoy this ride.So, OK we’ve met our heroes, they’re safely away in the Millennium Falcon, and next we get into the first of a few completely unnecessary scenes.  Han and Chewy show up, and 15 minutes of needless, non- story progressing banter ensues between the kids and old timers, then Han and some angry creditors.  Oh, and Han gave FiNn a blaster. (more on this later)  Squidward to the third power is released, another unnecessary monster to show how weird space is, and the whole gang loads up in the Millennium Van to leave.  Seriously, this whole scene could have happened way better and was completely unnecessary.  It wasn’t good, it contained no meaningful dialogue, and could have been cut to allow more story in to flesh out what happened in the past 10 years.We also see dialogue with General Hitler and Kylo Ren talking to the Smoke Monster, Supreme Leader Giant.  We learn that Kylo Ren is Han Solo’s son.  OK, kind of abrupt the way you laid that on us there JJ, but “we ain’t got no time” for developing a story with plot, more ‘splosions and dogfights!So the Millennium Van goes to visit Maz.  I enjoyed Maz’s character and the little bit of story elements we got here, as well as the foreshadowing of Rey touching the lightsaber.  Of course the First Order and Resistance BOTH have agents to report them arriving conveniently waiting, and the First Order commences another raid.  Kylo Ren captures Rey, and Han continues his bowcaster fetish.  FiNn also uses the lightsaber for the first time (after he returned to help from trying to get transport to the outer fringes, where Han told him to keep the blaster – more on the blaster later) in the battle scene, but gets beat up by a crowd control Stormtrooper before Han shoots the trooper with the bowcaster.  Oh, and Leia shows up, as well as “one hell of a pilot”.  So, I liked this location, the cantina and castle were great visually.  I liked Maz, I loved her dialogue with Han, FiNn, and Rey.  The battle here however, was completely unnecessary.  The only vehicle not accomplished was showing Poe’s flying ability by doing this scene differently.  Also, the crowd control trooper should have been Captain Phasma.So, we’re finally off to see the resistance.  FiNn and BB8 learn the pilot from the castle was Poe, and he’s alive and well.  Poe gives FiNn his jacket. (remember me mentioning the blaster earlier?)So, here’s a beef.  Why is everyone giving FiNn handouts?  I find it ironically juxtaposed to the beginning scenes with Rey scavenging for ¼ ration per item, and it really kind of put me off that there was some sort of underlying tone of a racial sort happening.  Probably not intentional, but I found it really suspicious that the movie went out of it’s way to give handouts to the black guy, while going out of it’s way to show the white girl working hard to survive.Some dialogue that is mostly forgettable happens down in the war bunker after witnessing a physically impossible weapon.  You see, the First Order has this super weapon, one that is a magnitude more powerful than the Death Stars.  It creates it’s energy by syphoning off energy from the Sun to an otherwise Icy planet.  So, it’s apparently far enough away from the sun to have ice, but not far enough to be too far to syphon off of the sun.  MmmKay.   After charging, it releases this energy as a massive laser.  This massive laser then defies the physical properties of light, bends and splits to destroy an entire solar system in one shot.  BS meter went haywire about now…So, OK it’s science fiction, let’s say in this universe physics is different than ours.  Fine, I’ll suspend my disbelief.  But you know what’s not different, or at least shouldn’t be?  BASIC FREAKING LOGIC!  The Empire already tried this tactic.  TWICE!  We already had 2 Death Star super weapons, this is the same thing on a larger scale!  Both of those plans/designs were exposed and destroyed.  Oh, I know.  Let’s do the same thing again, but if it’s on a planet it will be totally different!  This is about the time that my BS meter, and the reboot meter told me this movie was utter rehashed crap.Somewhere in here we also get to see Kylo Ren struggling with his inner demons.  He’s drawn to the light, a stark contrast to Luke’s journey and the pull of the dark side.  This was another WTF moment for me, however.  Did we just throw out Return of the Jedi?  Anakin was redeemed by killing the Emperor.  We don’t see a ghost of Darth Vader, we see a ghost of Hayden Christensen’s Anakin. (Another pet peeve I’ll spare everyone from reading)  Furthermore, the galaxy rejoiced the demise of the Empire, so how is it that the First Order has as much power as they do?  More BS alerts going off…Oh, and Rey is in the interrogation chair back at Super Weapon World.  (Or the equally stupid name STARKILLER BASE)  She’s restrained and guarded by a single Stormtrooper.  She decides to try to Jedi Mind Trick the guard into releasing her.Wait, what?  How does she know about this?  How to do this?  There is no vehicle introducing this ability to her and is a major plot hole that she even knows about the Jedi Mind Trick!So, a plan is designed to take out the super weapon, the resistance learns they are the new target, and they have a countdown clock.  Hmm, that sounds eerily familiar.1 Team goes to the planet to disable the shields, and another team takes to just X-Wing fighters to destroy the flaw in the design of the super weapon.  Didn’t we do this already?The ground team, led by Han does their stupid mission.  Along the way they decide to plant explosives that they conveniently brought to weaken the target that the X-Wings are ineffective against.  Do Y-Wings no longer exist?  B-Wings?  Han runs into Kylo Ren and confronts him by calling out his name.  He calls out….  “BEN!”Ben?  Han and Leia named their kid Ben?  Why?  Perhaps after Obi-Wan’s alias, but that makes no sense as Leia never met Obi Wan, and Han wasn’t terribly fond of that old wizard.  It’s a pretty un-ceremonial name compared to Rey, FiNn, Poe, Leia, Han, et-all.  I guess that’s why he goes by Kylo Ren now and hates his family, because his real name sucked!  Ben Solo, naw, he didn’t get ridiculed in Star Wars school at all…I’m fine with killing off Han Solo.  Not too fond of it coming at the hands of his son, but his kid is clearly a mental case.  And frankly by this point the movie is already a steaming pile to even really care about killing off a beloved rebel alliance family member.  I sincerely hope Ford decided to do the movie under the condition he could get killed off to not have to suffer the future of Disney Star Wars.And finally, we have FiNn and Rey facing off against Darth Crybaby (Kylo Ren) in the forest.  He sparks up his ridiculously designed lightsaber and FiNn begins to defend them.  FiNn, not at all showing any force sensitivity, or mentioned to have sword training, somehow holds his own against a wounded Kylo Ren, and manages to wound him further before getting severely injured.  Then Rey takes up the saber she swore she would never touch, and somehow musters the force to win a lightsaber duel against a wounded Kylo Ren.  OK, so 2 kids with no lightsaber training just each survived a lightsaber duel with the new big bad of Star Wars?  I don’t care that he was wounded by being shot by Chewy, this was just complete BS.And then in the span of 3 minutes, Rey goes to find Luke, climbs a bunch of steps, and offers his lightsaber back to him, The End. The whole map to Luke story was stupid.  They ripped everything else off from previous movies, why not plans to the Super Weapon?  Or a map to Supreme Giant Snoke?  It would have worked better.  Luke and R2 both could have just shown up from their sabbatical at the end after sensing the awakening and it would have worked better. Plot gaps:
When/How/why did the First Order start?  How do they have as much power as they do?

Why did we only see X-Wing’s?  Where are the A, B, and Y wings?
When did TIE fighters get a swiveling turret?  Why only one model?

634,"Pathetic. Really. Its disposable, has no ambition. Its SW for the PC/SJW audience. Tons of plotholes and tonally disonant quipping. Worst offender is the heroine who is an ultra Mary Sue. The characters have extremely weak unfleshed out motivations for doing what they do in the movie.",0
635,"I don't know how this film could have been much worse.  The story is an increasingly implausible sequence of absurd coincidences or scenes rehashed from other star wars movies.  Characters form relationships with each other instantaneously, and for no readily apparent reason.  What they say constantly contradicts what is going on around them.  If two characters are ""required"" by the ""plot"" to see each other, they literally just bump into each other.  Whether they are on the other side of a planet or the other side of the galaxy seems not to matter.  They may have been looking for a spaceship, waiting to reactivate in sitting in a box for 20 years without result, but when the moment comes, there they are.   At least the prequels had scope, scenes like the podrace, and some memorable new characters.  I seriously think this film is worse than the Phantom Menace (although not as bad as Attack of the Clones).  I cant call myself a Star Wars fan any more really.  So sad.",0
641,"This is just another film that JJ Abrams failed to cast. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are not interesting and it has nothing in comon with the orginal star wars.

645,Very generic. They basically took all the stories of the first three films and gave them new names and faces. Everything seemed rushed. Very little time or effort spend on character development.

651,"I admit I haven't read all the user reviews, but is there ANYONE who has had the insight to point out that this movie is just a re-imaging of the very first episode made, the one from 1977, the one they later called ""A New Hope""? Not a sequel, not a prequel, not a remake, just a RE-IMAGING. It is exactly the same story! Only this one has newer special effects and a sort of hipper 21st century vibe. What a disappointment! Thank goodness there are user reviews because enough people accurately saw this as mediocre or truly crappy, while virtually all the paid news-rag reviewers fell over themselves praising it. What a joke these people are. ""Force Awakens"" gets a ""3"" from me for being somewhat well-crafted and somewhat briskly paced (except for the mind-f*** scene with Kylo Ren and Rey -- how annoying). But cutting-edge imagination? Novel plot devices? Rich character development? Any kind of compelling dramatic tension? Because you could tell from the first moment it was a complete re-imaging there was nothing left to do but writhe through how they were going to do THAT part of the ""New Hope"" story again.

654,"For someone not knowing the previous Star Wars movies this movie might be ok but for the Star Wars fan who sat 38 years ago in the cinema watching Episode IV this movie is lame.To make it short: J. J. Abrams and Disney killed the Star Wars of George Lucas. And this totally uninspired.It was just a compilation of what we saw before, storywise mainly Episode IV with a bit Wall-E and other stuff.It's not that Han Solo died. All the actors of the first movie won't be available anymore in a few years so they had to find a way to pass on to the young actors. But instead of doing this, they just destroyed  what was. Uninspired.And as sideeffect they have put the death sentence on Kylo Ren/Ben. Killing his father this way he's not allowed to live anymore. And he was even just a confused boy until then, not a psycho.Coruscant had to die, too. Why ? In critics before this movie was released you could read about ""Episode VII"" going back to old movies filming in real locations and using less computer animation and more models again. It was said that George Lucas made a mistake by using CGI too much. Why is Episode III the most favorite Episode then ? (And will stay it, btw.)Now it's clear, Disney wants to save money. With Coruscant destroyed they don't have to render it anymore. Congratulations, misson succeeded by copying the story from Episode IV ! J.J. Abrams made lotsa mistakes, too:- Rey is a real autodidact learning the force. I wonder now: why did the Jedis need a teacher then ? (and a Sith a master)- An X-wing is shooting three TIEs in a row. Must be Poe Dameron, hell of a pilot, you think. Of course he is. But why did Finn had to tell that to the audience. Seems like J.J. Abrams didn't find a way to let the pictures and sound act on the audience.- Lowest level flying of the TIEs, X-Wings and Millennium Falcon was impressive at the beginning but overused- The camera travelling through the cantina. Yes, nice coustumes. Muppet show - but different. When George Lukas did this, the travelling camera still had another purpose than just showing costumes.- Kylo Ren is no real villain, just a confused psycho. Not the fault of the actor.- General Hux: also weak- Captain Phasma: I'm confused about that character. Had absolutely no meaning and was not a bit convincing. Oh, she looked a bit like Boba Fett. That's all. I'll stop here as it would be a repetition of what was written already. The highlight of this movie are the characters of Ray and Poe (a mix of Han Solo and Wedge), also Finn and some action sequences. And the 3D quality was good. Poor Ryan Johnson has to take over this mess. He has Wall-E but the waste J.J. Abrams left in his wake will be too much to be removed in two years. To make it clear to everyone: the credit for the world record goes to George Lucas. Not to Disney, not to J.J. Abrams and also not to this movie !",0

656,Horrible movie. It's the idea of Star Wars without the spirit (originality). This is by far the worst of the 7 Star Wars movies. Actually as far as I'm concerned there is still only 6. This is not worthy of being the sequel to episode 6.,0
657,"This move is a garbage. A copy of episode IV. A full lack of heroes or good performances at last. The Star Wars is over now for me.Certainly there is a plot for the internet show only positive feedbacks. The critics of all journals vote positive. The film is a copy and a joke for me.",0
658,"I am not going to go into detail because my english isn't that good, but i will try to go into the basic points. First of all I am an old Star Wars fan, I've watched all the movies and I even liked the prequel. Unfortunately from my point of view, this movie is something completely else....it's like giving to a small kid a Da Vinci drawing and letting it draw on top of it. From start to finish I felt that this movie was only there to make money, nothing else. The story is completely cliche, its like watching a remake of episode 4 but accomplished in a complete brain damaged fashion. In this context I can clearly say that episode 1 was a far more interesting movie than this one.The director had great tools in his hands, million dollar resources and ideas to be precise and he used them in the most terrible way imaginable. The old characters were butchered and their story was completely destroyed (no respect to Han solo a legendary character, he was killed in a matter of seconds and 2 minutes after his death everyone was happy, and even princess lea was laughing...), the concept of Force has completely lost its value and meaning. The main female character with no training suddenly wields the sword better than Luke and Master Yoda combined and puts down the bad guys with complete ease even though all these skills take years to master.... I was wondering the whole time, why are they searching for the old Luke Skywalker when they have this ""perfect"" emotionless super girl in their arsenal?? All in all acting was terrible on this movie, Finn was a somewhat decent character and had some potential but his role was too feminine in my opinion. Rey was the ""man"" in this movie (feminist crap detected)....",0
659,"WORST STAR WARS EVER! Star Wars got old and killed like one of its former heroes, and that was the ONLY enlightening insight within this patchwork of a failed remake attempt. Especially this particular death scene was so badly executed and foreseeable, that I didn't even give a cent about it.It's Han Solo. In fact, he was actually already dead after about 2 minutes into his first appearance, because it's just an old Harrison Ford satirizing his former character in a Saturday Night Live style. The plot and the characters in general are shallow, their motivation probably ""clouded by the dark side"" which is lazy writing, IMO.Imagine the Infinite-Monkey-Theorem just without any results whatsoever: ""And they all typed happily ever after"".The acting is bad, simply bad compared to the original trilogy. The dialogues are filled with stupid reference jokes and endless citations of former trademark lines of the old trilogy.The first time I actually heard face palms in a theater! (Yes, you can hear them if they accumulate)Every character feels like the comic relief, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER (!), not one serious character except maybe for Max von Sydow, but he dies very early and quickly. The evil master of the First Order is almost an exact visual copy of Grendel from Zemeckis' Beowulf, I AM NOT KIDDING YOU! Even when a planet gets blown up (which happens two times), it evokes no emotion whatsoever! I have never before witnessed such anti-climactic climaxes, it is totally beyond me. The composition is bad most of the time. It feels like watching a home video or something made for TV. I have no idea how an experienced director can realize something like this with film.For example it has the very first Star Wars opening scene that does not work at all. Not one bit. And sadly, it's just the first of many, many compositions in this movie which do not work. Even the Soundtrack has almost nothing of Star Wars in it: Every time you start to recognize the original score it suddenly turns into something totally indistinctive, like someone humming the first two notes of the Imperial March, not knowing how to continue and instead switching over to Bye Bye Birdie ( In case you don't know it, indulge yourself on youtube)And no better way to sum it up: The Force Awakens makes you cringe as Ann-Margret's vocals do in this song, and once seen, it can not be unseen!",0
660,"If you've viewed Episode IV recently, then this movie will show you nothing new. It's basically the technically best fan movie ever made - with all its flaws like the lack of depth, character development and the latter. Taking in regard I watched the movie on release day and I've already forgotten most of the contents, having seen not a single memorable moment in the entire movie, it's nothing but nice action cinema. Sadly Star Wars was always more than that....but it has been hollowed-out as it seems. Why the hype? I don't get it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great as well. Mediocre, that's what it is.",0
661,"It  makes me sick seeing the truth about this movie. We wanted a continuation of an epic story, not a reboot/remake just to make money. I also can't believe people are praising the fact that is is a reboot/remake. People think they can slap the Star Wars name on things and rake in the cash. Is that all that matters to you, Jar Jar Abrams? Money?",0
664,"A big disappointment. The good feelings and anticipation were there as the classic text crawl made its way up the screen. I felt the movie started off fairly well, and had some excellent scenes on Jakku. But as the movie progressed, the lack of imagination and force fed story line eroded the happiness that I started with. The special effects were good, the camera angles were (mostly) on point, and the action was consistent but not overbearing. It's already been mentioned, but it is basically A New Hope repackaged. Finn, Rey, and BB-8 were wonderful characters, but the dark side was underdeveloped and there was nothing to keep my interest. I ended up not caring what happened, which is the exact opposite of what every other Star Wars movie made me feel. When the supreme leader Snoke showed up, I felt like I was suddenly watching a character ripped off of Guardians of the Galaxy. So much of this movie is not Star Wars material. Abrams and Disney made sure there were plenty of familiar faces and references to tug at the heart (and bring in the cash), but that couldn't make up for the rehashed story line, Han Solo's rushed, cheap death, the least intimidating villain I've seen in quite a while, and lack of intrigue / mystery. By the time the movie was over I felt like I still hadn't seen the new Star Wars movie. This movie is to 'Star Wars' as ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is to 'Indiana Jones'. The silver lining is still there, as Rey and Finn are great characters that can be developed fully as the episodes progress. Hopefully the next installment will right the wrongs.",0

670,"I was saddened by how disappointing this movie was.  Don't get me wrong.  It was somewhat enjoyable, and I will probably see it again, but it was disappointing. One of the things that I believe is frequently overlooked with the original trilogy is how solid the writing actually was.  This was where I felt ""The Force Awakening"" failed.  In the original trilogy, we have a very clear character arc with Luke Skywalker.  While some may knit pick over the speed of his development and proficiency, he develops as character and force user over each episode.  We do not actually see Luke overtly use the force until ESB.  I can recall only two examples within ANH where he uses the force.  The first is while Obi-Wan is training him on the Millennium Falcon with the floating ball.  While we the audience realize he is using the force, it is not so overt that Han Solo can't dismiss it as luck.  The second instance is when he destroys the Deathstar by making the impossible shot without his targeting computer.  Again, we know what is going on even if the other characters do not.  Luke is learning to use the force.  It is the beginning of his journey to becoming a Jedi.  We know what much of what he will be capable of as we've seen Obi-Wan and Darth Vader use the force. I want to emphasize that point.  We know the outcome of the original trilogy maybe 30-45 minutes into ANH.  We're going to have a show down between Luke, as a Jedi, and Darth Vader.  What we don't know is how that's going to happen.  That is essentially what the whole original trilogy is about- how Luke develops into a character that can defeat Vader. Kylo Ren starts as an extremely promising antagonist.  Like Vader, he is not going to be the ultimate villain.  The ultimate villain in the original trilogy is the Emperor.  The ultimate villain in this trilogy appears to be Supreme Leader Snoke.  However, that is unimportant.  The purpose of the antagonist is to provide opposition to the protagonist.  Right from the start, we see Kylo Ren as a powerful opposition figure.  Within the first 10 minutes or so, we see him sense a laser blast and stop it mid air.  This is great.  This is a powerful scene.  Our antagonist is not weak.  He's strong.  Our protagonist, our hero is going to have to overcome this?  No easy task. But no... This is not the case.  Our hero after being told that the force does exist, suddenly turns into a Master Jedi for all practical purposes.  While Luke trains for years (there are three years between ANH and ESB) before being able to pull his light saber out of ice, Ren figures this out literally within days of learning of the existence of the force.  And... Luke began his training under Obi-Wan.  He didn't start cold.  Additionally, she's able to use the force to persuade a guard to release her.  Luke did not demonstrate this ability until RotJ which is another year of training. The antagonist is defeated by the protagonist... at the outset of the trilogy.  This is radically different than ANH.  While the Rebellion wins that round, Vader doesn't lose.  The only reason that Luke lives is because Han Solo returns at the last second and clips one of Vader's wingmen thus securing Luke time to make the shot at the exhaust port.  The Empire loses this round.  Vader simply does not win.  In contrast, Kylo Ren loses.  Rey systematically dismantles him.  She slashes his leg, stabs his shoulder, and slashes his face nearly killing him.  All done with contemptuous ease.  The first direct confrontation Luke has with Darth Vader is radically different.  Luke is beaten relentlessly by Vader's use of the force, has his hand cut off, and then attempts suicide rather than join Vader only to be rescued by the thinnest of margins. While the comparisons are being drawn to ANH and TFA has been labeled ANH 2.0 by many, this is resembles ESB more than anything only with the roles reversed.  The ""Resistance"" dominates all confrontations in this movie.  The only time the First Order ever gains any traction is when they launch a surprise attack against inept opposition.  They successfully attack a defenseless village.  They successfully attack a defenseless bar.  They successfully destroy five planets with a sneak attack from a super weapon.  When the Resistance arrives at the ""bar,"" they route the First Order.  They attack the Starkiller with a handful of ships and a three man strike force, they blow up the most powerful weapon the galaxy has ever seen.  In the original trilogy, destroying the Deathstar is accomplished by a fleet and, in RotJ, a real ground invasion, and of course, luck. While it does have the appearance of a ""real"" Star Wars movie (AKA the original trilogy), it's mere window dressing from one liners, the presence of Han Solo, and special effects style.  The original trilogy was an epic designed along the concept of the Hero's Journey.  We do not have any elements of that here.",0
671,Please for gods sake do not believe what other reviewers have said about how great this movie is...IT IS A FLOP....there are so many plot holes in this show. Light saber duels and fights....in your dreams u get to see a storm trooper kill a fake sith lord. OMG this show is so crap. JJ abrams just copied of the previous episodes and just made a bigger death star unprotected. GOD This movie is not STAR WARS. They only used their name for branding and putting in han solo and the old crew in for the sake of it. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HYPE AND MARKETING OF THIS MOVIE. True star wars fans are appalled by it as u can see from the user reviews. This show is worst than transformers and their plot holes are just ridiculous. JJ JUST GIVE ALL THE STORM TROOPERS LIGHT SABERS AND U WIN!!! F$$$ U JJ disney and marvel for ruining star wars for the future generations.,0
678,It's a new Star Wars film that everyone has been waiting wait for and it didn't disappoint. It's very superior compared to any of the prequel films and the first of an epic sequel trilogy. J.J. Abrams's directing has helped rejuvenate the film series.,1
681,"to many convienient consequences required to move the story forward indicative of lazy writing and NO originallity in the story. Found myself waiting for the movie to end, disapointed by Disney and Abrams",0
682,"As someone who saw all the previous Star War movies, and enjoyed each one of them, my impression of Force Awakens is mostly negative.  This is by far the least original movie in the Star Wars series.  There are zero surprises or suspense in The Force Awakens.  Every plot twist (if it can be even called that) is telegraphed with an unusual lack of subtlety.  You can say what you want about Lucas, but even the harshest critic of prequels has to acknowledge that every one of those movies, while perhaps containing some wooden acting and a few unfortunate characters (e.g. Jar Jar) also introduced new awesome goose-bump-producing characters (e.g. Qui Gon, Darth Maul), new plot twists, and genuine surprises.  The Force Awakens simply has none of that.  Instead it has the feeling of a made-for-TV Star Wars reunion special.  A big problem for The Force Awakens are its villains.  Kylo-Ren could not scare a 5-year old, the store-brand Voldemort (pardon me Supreme Leader Snoke) reminded me mostly of an elderly Ent,  General Hux is is a drama queen in a 1950's flight-attendant hat, and Captain Phasma mostly has the role of an obedient and disciplined hostage.  Darth Vader would **** each on one of those with his little finger while drinking his morning tea gazing in the distance.  If you are looking for something scary in this movie, Carrie Fisher's acting is it.  Anticipating whether she will be able to keep it together in her scenes provides some nervous suspense.  The battle scenes are surprisingly short and taking place mostly on earth as far as I can tell.  Space is simply not a big part of this movie.   I could go on and, on but you get the gist.  I watched each on the previous Star Wars movies at least 10 times and they remain one of my guilty-pleasures and time-wasters.  I will continue to watch the newly made Star Wars movies, but probably each one of them just once.",0
684,"I hate to say this, but I was left wanting. Seems like they tried to tie it so much to the original movies that they ran out of space to develop any real new or interesting plot. The old characters seemed like they had not been acting for the past 30 years - they were stale.  Sad. This one will not sell well. Has nothing to grab folks for repeat sales. I don't understand all the high scoring reviews. Must be a sign of the times. PC police have wrecked our collective ability to think critically. If something is hyped in the news or media, it must be supported. I won't support this crap just because it is supported by a mega media push. I will admit that Rey was a better actor than Anikan was in episodes 1-3, but her development as a character was simply stupid. I mean really. She's like 20 or something like that and seems to be poor. Where does she learn how to fly, how to be a mechanic of a spaceship, how to mind-control, how to light saber dual with the best of the best. I'm not sure I would know how to turn the thing on. Let alone dominate someone who has his own special brand of light saber. And Rey is just the tip of the iceberg. The rest of the movie is just as full of logic gaps and embarrassing pandering. Just because you copy scenes from old SW movies doesn't mean you are writing a new one. I imagine the next movie will actually follow a new train of thought. But seeing how silly they were when developing Rey, I see no hope for the future of this series.  By copying old Star Wars scenes, they were able to associate the name of Star Wars with this work. My guess is that's the last we see of similarities. Unless that is the MO of this project. Write or imagine as little as possible and cut and paste as much as you can. Why else buy the rights for $4B?  Not as a platform to spring from, but as a black box to reach in and grab random intellectual property and align in such a manner as to pass for new writing (assuming changing the color and sex of your protagonists is considered writing). JJ Abrams deserves a ""participation"" trophy for this effort. So please, stop all the high praise of this crap. High praise of this shoddy effort only proves that there is an extreme dumbing down of society going on.",0
685,"im not that big of a star wars fan, but the movie just wasnt very good. it started out great, and the action scenes were exciting, but then theres these dull performances and arcs in storytelling that was just making me wish the movie was over and it just kept on going.",0
686,"Contains Spoilers (actually, the whole movie is a spoiler) Empty spectacle No originality. So boring  – I could have genuinely left before the end without any concern. An uncomfortable clash of tired old characters & re-hashed storylines against new and feisty characters. Unfortunately, these new characters were mired in a treacly re-telling of Episode IV. I’m not a big Star Wars fan anyway – the prequels were dreadful, even Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are stodgy and over-regarded – yet I expected better of this. I liked Abrams’ reboot of Star Trek. I was sure he would make a better job of it than Lucas.BUT now I’m really not so sure. Whereas, Lucas populated his prequels with irritating cartoon characters, at least the plots were original. Poor, but original. The Force Awakens did not have a single original element.And whilst Anakin’s journey into the darkside was woefully unconvincing – at least, we saw the process. With the latest villain, we just have to accept he used to be a good boy & now he’s bad – for no apparent reason. I remained un-moved throughout :- Han & Chewie: so what ; Leia – so what; ooh, a big death – so painfully setup, there was no surprise. Like the most of the movie, it just felt inevitable. It was just a lazy re-creation of the original movies :- another deathstar; another attack by x-wings; another illogical weak-spot; the Empire has fallen, but there is another indistinguishable First Order in its place; the Emperor is dead, but there is another “Supreme Leader”; another beeping droid; another cantina; another Tattooine home planet; the resistance still hiding in secret bases; another sword fight ; another orphan, who will no doubt turn out to be related to one of the old cast …. The only divergence from the originals was the villain – albeit unintentionally. He was different from Vader, but only in that he was crap.  Once he removed his mask to reveal a long-haired fop, all menace was lost. And the relentless “big reveals” – it worked the first time with the Millennium Falcon, but then it was “oh, it’s Han!” ; “Chewie” ; “Leia”; “C3-PO” ; “R2-D2” – then “gee, who’s that guy at the top of that hill? Oh, it’s Luke. What a surprise.” - each time with a little swell of the music. Long lingering looks. Like Downton Abbey in Space.The thing is, none of it was about surprise – it was all about providing comforting familiarity to the fans. How insipid. Abrams really should have made a new story with the new characters – and left the old crusty’s and all the tedious sickly self-referencing alone. Ah well, at least I can save a few quid by not bothering with the rest of the franchise.",0
687,"I don't even know where to begin. A lot of the negative reviews here are spot on. You will read the common view that this movie ""plays it safe"". Well, guess what, it takes what SHOULD be a safe repeat jumble of plot points from E4 and manages to make it completely boring and lifeless. It is paced wrong. Every scene feels rushed, just waiting for the next scene where something improbable happens because the plot or director requires it. Characters seem to acquire skills for complex tasks instantly. Oh, you jump aboard the falcon, get in the cockpit and moments later you are pulling complex aerial maneuvers and shooting down tie fighters? Really? One moment you're digging junk out of the sand, the next you're an ace pilot? Nearly every scene is a copy from some other movie. Yet another death star clone base. I think its called something silly like 'super destroyer base' or something. Literally. In the first 30 minutes, stuff just happens without explanation. Han just ""shows up"" on the falcon in space. Gee that was easy. Just appear.Somehow the resistance, lead by Lea, had no clue about this nearby death star pointed at them. No problem. We'll just send the rusty old falcon and about 5 or 6 X wings to take care of it. Oh, can't forget about lowering the shields first. Got to do that. And of course, there's a ""bullseye"" shaped cooling system or some other made-up thing that, if destroyed, would cause a chain reaction. This target is right there in the open for all to see. In between the actual plot related events (and there weren't many), the filler scenes were pointless and distracting. The relationship between Finn and Rey is even more awkward and unnatural than E2-3, which I didn't think was even possible. And the empire apparently has become an equal opportunity employer and ditched its fascist ways. The stormtroopers are no longer clones, but actual humans presumably abducted. So its ok to kill them now? No one cared about killing clone stormtroopers but now they're real people, more like slaves of the empire, so we just kill them along the way. That's messed up. I could go on, but to mad. Or maybe sad. Can't decide which. I give it a 1 for the few chewbacca lines that made me laugh. The rest was a complete waste.",0
688,"While The Force Awakens is certainly derivative of the first Star Wars movie, now known as Episode 4: A New Hope, there are many things to love about it.  The effects are amazing.  It is wonderful that the main protagonist is a young woman.  It was a joy to see the original characters again.  It ended leaving me anxious about the next film.  But the main villain is weak,  There are a too many Nazi overtones of the bad guys for my taste.  One of the best new characters (who clearly is the Yoda of this film) is not given enough screen time or enough to do.  So it is at least an inconsistent movie.  The first movie came out when I was a kid and I loved it.  There had never been anything like it before, ever.  The Force Awakens is not that film.  But it is entertaining and fun, albeit not particularly original.",1

699,"Let me say a few things here that other reviews haven't mentioned! Apparently an old Han Solo could ""time when to break out of light speed/warp"" - in order to perfectly land just past the defenses of the First Order but also not crash into the planet. Come on now, this is fantasy, but its called ""science-fiction"" for a reason - its suppose to be at least logical. How is it Kylo Ren has such a powerful wielding of the force that he can indefinitely pause blaster beams in mid air(the very beginning of the movie).... but then when he locks arms with young girl he is overpowered by her? I mean, I know he had a grievous wound - how the hell was he able to run in front of them so quickly then? Force walk? You come to find that the ""force"" is now just a convenient excuse used by this movie to string the plot together and explain unbalanced character powers to get them out of situations they shouldn't be able to. WHY is there a ""map to find Luke Skywalker""... does he never leave this planet? And then when he is finally found, why is it so absolutely uninteresting? No great jedi temple, no ancient ruins - no encampment, absolutely no signs of ""hiding here for decades"". How is it that the Milennium Falcon happens to be junk on the same planet as all these events - and right when they power it up and fly it after ""possibly years and years"" - it is found by Han Solo within ""hours""? Of it's launch? Was there a homing beacon inside it which alerted him when it was turned on - why wasn't this explained in the movie? WHY DO NONE OF THEM EVER CHANGE THEIR CLOTHES? THEY ARE ALL WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES THROUGH-OUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE. And this is what confuses me the most - how long ""fiction time"" does the movie actually take place over? I can't tell how many days it was - there never seems to be any ""rest"" - except when maybe travelling to the rebel planet on the millennium falcon - and then maybe rescuing Rey. I think its because none of them change their clothes, or ever seem to find a ""point of rest"", I don't understand how fast everything in the movie is occurring in movie-time. Also - like someone said before - THIRD DEATHSTAR WITH SAME EXACT VULNERABILITY? I MEAN - you have enough construction capital to build massive planet-sized weapons but they can be destroyed by 1 common fighter ship - not once - but three times? What the hell happened to the republic after the fall of the emperor? Did I miss this in the prologue? Why are the ""rebels"" still ""rebels"" or the ""resistance"" if the empire fell? Who are they resisting? The First Order? How did that reconstitute itself so quickly - and why hasn't it been challenged by anything else? WHY did they make the bad guys so explicitly Nazi - even with the Heil Hitler thing. Its just bad taste - especially because it superficializes fascism - it takes the ""ostentatious staging"" - but not of the underlying passions for that in the first place. AND WHY were all the highest officers younger than 25 years old? General Hux is how old? Kyle Ren is how old? And the people that report to them are also college age? The last thing I say - the holographic supreme leader Snoke - so they built an enormous hanger inside a star destroyer(or I'm assuming Star killer) - with all those strange ruins - just for a projector of him? I have to say there were some really cool/creative action scenes, some really funny and cute moments - but the whole thing was soulless.",0
700,"Not a single new idea, nostalgia baiting, recycles ""A New Hope""'s story, and feels like it was written by a fan who misinterpreted what made the originals so good (sorry, light sabers, force powers,x-wings, death stars, AT-AT walkers were not why IV-VI were good...the story and depth/growth of the characters were). 1) Spends too much time patting itself on the back for bringing back all the old cast2) Writing for the story was so poor that they had to TELL US HOW TO FEEL during scenes.3) Excessive use of flashy star wars stuff (light sabers, X-wings, blaster fights,...).

The new characters seem pathetically unfulfilled because so much screen time was given over to familiar faces, telling the same story as IV again.  Like Finn, who decides he can't kill for the First Order.  He says it in his own words, he can't kill FOR THEM.  He's fine with killing.  Somehow, he finds it in him to blow away hordes of his colleagues, who he has apparently been training and working with since childhood.  Somehow that's okay with him, but shooting the villagers who were already shooting at him, and killed his friend right in front of him was out of the question.  He's also the biggest blabbermouth in the galaxy, constantly telling everyone within earshot that he's on a super-secret important mission.  Ren is a completely unredeemable nemesis, too annoying to be taken seriously.  It feels like there is no real archenemy at all really.  This ""Snokes"" is bad I guess, but who really knows what's up with that?  The Storm Trooper lady in the silver armor...she's somebody, I don't know who but she exists, or existed anyway, she probably blew up and now I'll never know why she was important anyway.  And how is it the rebels couldn't figure out where Skywalker was after having the map fragment that looked like an eighth of the entire galaxy ""uncharted"".  Don't you have any astronomers?  Has anyone ever looked at that huge segment of the galaxy before?  Why do you need the rest of the map to figure this out, and why is your only copy of a galactic map being stored in a comatose droid?  I could go on and on...3 is what I'm giving it.",0

A three year old girl doesn't cry as much as that whiny emo dumbo eared imitation Darth Vader. Numerous characters seemed to be added for toy sales, because they served nothing to the movie.

The plot and story are identical to that of A New Hope and the whole film was basically just one replacement movie in terms of characters. All of the old characters and their roles were replaced by the new characters in this. There was really nothing that separated this film from the others. It just felt like one giant remake of the original trilogy!,0
708,"When Disney take a good movie franchise and convert it in a comedy-drama-action (in that order).This new movie lost all essence of the first and even, the second trilogy, by the hand of jar jar abrams. Poor plot twist, almost the same argument line of the old movies, no context of any type, it's the first order vs the resistance aaaand the end.In conclusion, if you like the effects and explosion everywhere (like transformers, etc) this is your movie. But if you are a true fan of SW, don't even go to watch it because is a disney crap.",0
709,Star wars the force awakens was an nostalgic action packed awakening to my childhood hence the name. First off the new comers to the franchise were amazing. Daisy ridley as Rey was fantastic John boyega was excellent as finn and Oscar Issac was great as Poe dameron. Adam driver was fantastic as the villain. Many people complain he was a taper throwing sith lord who could never kkeep his cool like Darth Vader could. What do I have to say to that? well yes your right but honestly who can live up to one of the most infamous movie villains of all time. I liked Kylo ren's  struggle between the dark and the light side. To me It felt compelling and real and never came across as cheesy. However i do have but one gripe and that is i feel Carrie fisher did not get enough to do unlike her counter part that is the one and only Han Solo also excellently played by Harrison Ford. This movie excellently bend the old cast and new cast to make one of the best star wars movies movies sense the empire strikes back. Mr.J.J. abrhams you never fail to amaze me.,1
710,"""So this is what happens when Disney buys a franchise - Cut out the best parts of the previous parts, clue them together somehow, put a lot of state of the art CGI on top of it, then sell it as a ""rejuvenation / fresh start"". In fact, its just all the same stuff all over again. "" Agree. Plus I feel like it's a Star Wars for teenager. What a **** bad script..",0
711,"Bland and boring. Perhaps fitting giving our generation of formulaic super hero movies - and not the space opera star wars is at its heart. Dialogue is poor, little understanding is conveyed, characters are unconvincing and the cinematography is as basic as can be. This movie also has a curious relationship with the past - references are shoehorned in with reckless abandon, but expect any aspect of deeper star wars knowledge into how things 'worked' to be violated. It frankly felt dumb. I expect that the critical reviews will start to fade once the sheen of nostalgia wears thin - like they did for Phantom. I also expect this movie to go largely the way of Abrams' Star Trek remake. Decent for the casual fan, destined to fade to irrelevance.",0
712,"I was excited about this movie, but it's really disappointing. 1. The plot is a copy and paste of Episode IV. Droid is abandoned on desert planet with important plans, finds protagonist, leaves planet in Millennium Falcon. Another planet destroying ""Death Star"" is on the loose and must be stopped. Except in this movie, the plans aren't the weakness to this weapon. It's the location of missing Luke Skywalker. Because he's just hanging out near a cliff somewhere and can't be bothered by any of this. It's like he's a location now, because you need a map to find him and he can't move on his own. Nobody ever explains why it's a priority that both sides find Luke. As if bringing him back or killing him would do anything to influence the planet killing plot. 2. Zero character development. The two new characters have a development arc that is a flat line. I didn't feel connected to either of them. They didn't mature or flesh out their reason for fighting. With Luke, you had him go to Obi-won's hut where he was intrigued by the story of his father being a legendary Jedi. Here, the characters continue onto the next phase of the story because...reasons. The plot just demands it. Nothing else. The drama is all forced. Finn's defection isn't very believable. Maybe if it had built up over time and he had been a part of a few more massacres, I could see that, but otherwise this feels like a spur of the moment thing. And the Sith don't have a very compelling reason for fighting either. None of the differences between the protaganists and antagonists are ever explored. For all we know, this war was over which color everyone's lightsaber should be. 3. I know this is science fiction, but this is now at the point where it is a parody of itself. Want to take off a ship at lightspeed? Sure, go for it. Why not? Want to land it at lightspeed too? Go for it. We're not even trying to add a sense of realism here. And let's suck up an entire star into our superweapon while we're at it. 4. Boring combat. The Resistance fleet consisted of 12 X-wings. That's it! And there were no Star Destroyers guarding 'Death Star III'. They show up once or twice, but have no role in any battles beyond Finn's escape. Say what you will about the prequels, but Episode III had a real space battle worthy of Star Wars history. So to sum up Cons:-weak, copied story from Episode IV-forced drama and flat character arcs-zero political context or motivation for why anyone is doing anything-scaled down spaceship battles to dogfights only Pros:-nice special effects The unfortunate march of Hollywood to prize eye candy over substantive plots continues. There is nothing in this movie that wasn't already done in the previous movies better.",0
714,"Alright so the simalarities between this movie and episode IV (and a little of V) goes WAY beyond good vs evil trying to blow up a big space station. Lets start from the beginning. We see secret data being handed to a droid who will henceforth be called R2D8. Storm Troopers come in looking for the plans killing many people. We get our first look at the bad guy who will now be called Darth Ren. The bad guys posse who will now be called the Fempire...ok... the Emporder take the original owner of the data hostage for questioning. R2D8 now has to trek through the desert (on a planet that is basically Tatooine) before eventually being found by our protagonist who will now be called Reuk (although Ray also has some of the role that Leia had). R2D8 asks Reuk to bring it back to its original owner who will bring the data to the Resistance (who we will call the resistance because its basically the same thing as rebellion). We have a scene where we see someone being interrogated for the data, an escape from a military ship, a chase scene where a star destroyer shoots at a smaller ship and a crash landing in the desert (yes, all of that happens in both movies just in slightly different orders). Instead of the Data being brought back to its original owner we have the Millennium Falcon being brought back to Han who in this movie takes the place of Obi Wan as the mentor who gets killed at the end by Darth Ren who he has a history with, so we will just call him Obi Han because I think that is funny. There are issues with the hyper drive and we eventually warp to a verdant planet. The giant space weapon which I'm not going to rename from Death Star because Star Killer Base or whatever is **** stupid as hell (even more so than Death Star somehow) gets its first use and destroys an important planet. We see a dangerous bar where the Emporder is alerted to the presence of the protagonist. (I think the owner of the bar is supposed to be Han, but I don't know). We have a fight with the Emporder and we see Darth Ren again. The location of the Resistance base is found out and female character is taken to the death star (out of order a little but still). At the rebel base the plans are analyzed. Friends meet (luke had a fighter piolet friend in episode IV who no one remembers that he greets at the base on Yavin) and the Death Star prepares to destroy the base. Darth Ren interrogates female main character and she resists him. Rescue operation begins for female. Assault on the Death Star begins. The assault is literally identical with the trench scene and an identically shaped weak spot that (just like everything else) has to be bigger than in IV because then its cooler. We have an encounter between Darth Ren and Obi Han where Obi Han basically willingly walks to his death. The Death Star explodes and Darth Ren (as well as Grand Moff Ginger which is different) escape. Then they go on to set up Reuk to be trained by a hidden Jedi Master Luda. Darth Ren is obviously going to be redeemed and kill mega emperor (again bigger is cooler) in the future. Some of the ordering is out of place with the Death Star rescue sequence split in two in TFA but pretty much everything else is there. There is a lot of other smaller imagery things and scenes that I'm sure I'm missing because i've only seen it once, but its there. Its the same damn movie and that REALLY makes me mad. Its not just a bate and switch for the fans, its not just a money making sham, but its lazy and safe. I would so much prefer an original script even if it wasn't exactly ""star wars"" that did the one thing this movie failed to do that episode IV did: Be envelope pushing and memorable.",0
716,"Rehashed story, plot holes, unrelatable actors, JJ Abrams; wouldn't see again.  The constant barrage of flashy lights and loud noises attempts to distract from faults.",0
717,"I dont know was it the acting or plot that was bad, but Im leaning on the plot. Plot was just horrible and the moments that the characters had just didnt fit in because the plot didnt do the ground-work for the actors. Also the bad guys are just big wussies. I tought that Anakin was bad, but Kylo Ren was not the charismatic evil I was expecting from Star Wars. Also what the heck is Voldemort doing in Star Wars?",0
719,"Worst Episode Ever!!Even Worst of the phantom menace!This movie is a collection of pieces taken from the old episodes, linked in a terrible way.The main characters are taken directly from Disney Channel.And with all respect to the old characters, it would have been better if they were killed in an untold battle!This is an example how to destroy a multimillionaire brand",0
720,"SPOILERS INSIDEAnother disappointed french fan here !Scenario is incredibly messy and exclude any form of subtelty (the fact that Kylo Ren is Han solo son is announced straight away, and he is close to call Darth Vador grandaddy at some point). Same scenario as episode IV with 0 suspense concerning the battle (no problem to walk in the bad guys station, 1 fighter can make the whole planet explode, useless captain phasma, Finn moral problems only during first 5 minutes etc.)Rey can defeat a sith without any training, both in term of lightsaber and force mastery, which is just ridiculous knowing it took Luke 3 episodes to achieve same results.New characters lack any form of charism and the old ones are linked in a stupid way to the plot (though Han solo/ Chewbacca save the day) or completely useless (Hello Princ.. General Leia).Finally, production is messy, with all the usual boring JJ abrams visual effects, and even the soundtrack is **** up (new musics adds nothing, bad use of classic themes)So guys go watch the movie and make your own opinion, for my part I will wait for the dvd to give it another shot",0
721,"We had a choice between seeing “Sisters” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”. I didn’t want to see the former because I know though being sold as a comedy I would cringe as Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, talented writers, directors, actresses and comediennes would tell penis, fart, vagina, crass, crude and rude jokes showing they could get as low as men which seems to be the fad among woman comediennes in movies today.I did a bunch of calls regarding availability of seats at the many theatres showing “Star Wars” and I was surprised to find out that quite a few said ‘no problem’ so off we went.I do believe in Santa—that should count for something with sci-fi fans—so I don’t want to get any bad marks with only a week to go. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is a movie 2 hour and 25 minutes long and I can honestly say I wasn’t bored for a total of 5 minutes! Seeing it in 3D didn’t help.It was fun seeing Harrison Ford in his Han Solo/Indiana Jones mode though more of the latter than the former and having a few funny lines. I was impressed with John Boyega as a storm trooper and Daisy Ridley as a desert scavenger but there was a big misstep when it came to showing their growing relationship and they will, obviously, be in future sequels. Does the director realize it isn’t shocking for a Black man and a White woman to kiss? (That’s not a spoiler—if you don’t see that story line coming you will probably enjoy the episode of “Star Wars”.)Oscar Iassac as a hot shot pilot, Adam Driver as a Darth Vadar junior, Max von Sydow in a cameo and Carrie Fisher in not much more than a cameo all offered something but I don’t know what! Domhnall Gleeson as a fiery General Hux acted with more facial expressions than Chewbacca (Peter Mayhem), R2-D2 (Henry Baker) or C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) but after doing some research I can’t say who ‘voiced’ BB8.One stunner in the movie was that I had no idea what role Lupita Nyong’o played until I got home and googled the cast to find out she played Maz Kanata and that’s all I’ll tell you!It was great hearing John Williams score but it seems the director J. J. Abrams and writers Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Arndt were following the original Star Wars films, including ‘the best of…’ from the complete series but they did forget Yoda though not the bar.I don’t want to think I would have enjoyed “Sisters” more but maybe?????",0
724,"With all the hype and buzz surrounding this film, I was a little too excited about rekindling the joys I found in the original trilogy. My expectations were not to match the original films in terms of old characters or nostalgia, but in terms of a good solid story and new characters development. After the opening sequence had finished, you are met with the usual camera panning observation of a capital ship. Things looked good - straight into the action - storm troopers and the main villain land searching for a missing map leading to the elusive Luke Skywalker. This is where we are introduced to the first of our characters, Kylo Ren and Finn. After the battle is over, we find ourselves in the grips of yet another action sequence aboard the ship after Poe is captured. Having eluded the new ""First Order"" and returned to the planet to retrieve the BB droid, we find ourselves yet again 2 minutes later in another action sequence almost identical to the first. This is where this review takes a sharp turn to the dark side. The reason the Star Wars films were so successful is because the story took time to develop, and we were slowly introduced to the characters; Luke, Obi Wan, Princess Leia and Han Solo. Each one given the limelight for a certain amount of time over the first hour of A New Hope. The Force Awakens decides that character development can be made in the first 15 mins for all the main characters of this new franchise. It feels rushed and poorly delivered. In addition to the characters feeling fairly hollow was the need to jump in action sequences every 4-5 minutes without fail. Although this film is not unique in it's approach, I can't help but feel I had action sequences rammed down my throat at every opportunity. With all the hype, it's easy to overlook massive oversights with characters and plot too. The chrome storm trooper who asserts Finn must put his helmet on is all but forgotten 2 minutes afterwards, only to reappear half way through to quickly disable the shields for the mega-death-star-planet. Are we meant to despise this character or care she is there? When the crew arrive on the leafy forest planet, we are introduced to yet another character. The small yellow goblin character felt like a Yoda stand-in, which is quickly brushed over and given little to no explanation - which is (you guessed it) interrupted by another action sequence. Why bother introducing half of these characters and putting any emphasis on them if they are gone within 3 minutes of meeting them? I could gloss over the smaller characters irrelevance if the villain had been stronger. This is where the whole movie falls apart. The original villain (Darth Vadar) burst out to our screen in a New Hope with mystery surrounding him. Within minutes he had broken the neck of a rebellion soldier and made his presence known. With our new villain, he begins as an all powerful Sith lord whos abilities allow him to stop blaster shots and read minds. Half way through he is revealed to be the whiney teenager of Han and Leia - corrupted by the Dark Side. At this point, any mystery has gone, along with the intimidation factor (which is fairly evident in the closing fight of the movie - in which Rey manages to win, despite no training or knowledge of the force). In addition, the main First Order officer was also a weak performance in comparison to the original officers aboard the Star Destroyers. He felt more of an angry Oxford graduate rather than an intimidating Imperial officer. Furthermore, the new emperor looks like something from Lord of the Rings rather than the Star Wars franchise. I understand Andy had to do something, but this character felt shoe-horned in like the rest. The death of a major character was brushed over within seconds, the music was average throughout (perhaps I feel bias with this opinion - I wanted more of the original soundtrack), the characters we're fairly hollow, many of the scenes had little to no bearing on the overall plot and the plot itself was based around one that has existed since the 70's. The ending was utterly terrible - staring blankly into the eyes of Luke with no dialogue whatsoever. I am devastated writing this review, as my hopes were very high. I was lead to believe this would be a story like the originals, and a fresh start to the franchise. I feel the reasons this movie has been so highly rated is because it surpasses the huge disappointment of Episode One. However, I hope that in time, others will take one step back and realise what an average movie The Force Awakens is.",0
725,"Zero is the score for a clone of Star Wars. No ideas, bad acting, ridiculous story development, worst characters ever. The only positive aspect is that, after this movie, also the prequel trilogy will look better. I will not pay to see the end of this.",0
726,"This is my first review of any movie. But presumably the Force awakened in me, and drove me to create an account on metacritic and share my view on the latest SW movie. I grew up in the communist block, where life was grey and dull- somewhat like Tatooine. And then one day, end of the 80-s, when I was probably 2-3 years old, I entered the room where my brother watched TV. And I saw these two droids walking through the desert. And I fell under a spell. After a few years I rented the VHS each weekend, and knew the roles by heart. The love for SW was implemented into my hard, ""Inception""-style, that day when I was a little kid. And then came the dark times... Of the prequels. Although Ep. III somehow made up for the previous two, like the prodigal son.And after years of waiting in anticipation for a new beginning, after a series of trailers sheding a ray of hope the force will again awaken in my heart... came this smoking pile of bull**** by Disney Inc. The first 20 mins. of the movie I was like ""wow"". The bad-ass Sith who can freeze a laser beam in flight?! Can obviously read ones heart (like the FN-something trooper) just looking at him?! Nice! Then it's Rey. Living on a planet like Tatooine. Just with 1 sun. And the humidity-collecting-thingos are still there (maybe they saved $ as they were left in Tunisia? and they shot that place again?). But OK- let's wait and see what happens. A droid escapes the Empire with some plan. OK- also seen this somewhere before. Two guys escape a Star Destroyer... Again- been there, done that already (just they were 2 droids). Just why do they escape in a 1-person ship (TIE)? Without any suits (there is no atmosphere in there)? OK- maybe some new design- let's wait... But there is nothing original to wait for! Half of the movie I looked at my watch, because I already seen it all! Never ever done such a blasphemy on a SW movie premiere (even if it were Attack of the Clones)! A big-*** panet-size space station (Death Star v 3.0 by Disney) built by a bunch of teenagers who are the whatever remains of the old EMPIRE (capitals, as it was grand- the entire galaxy under their reign)? The EMPIRE had problems with building a 5x smaller station. It took them years. And tons of slave work. Which the New Order clearly does not have (stormtroopers built it and know all about its build details- all weak pints- even those from ""sanitation""). Entering hyper-speed in a hangar-bay with some monster on your windshield? Exiting light-speed 100m from a planet?! WTF- you serious? This is not how it was explained before! This is again some bull**** out of the canon of SW! There was a tear in my eye when Han stepped onto the screen. But when Leia came out of that ship... I though they took her straight out of an old-people's home! She could barely walk straight. Thought she will have a heart-attack in a moment! Her mimics (or the lack of any) resembled ones of a person who had a stroke. That was aheartbreaking (in a bad way) scene- Han and Leia's reunion... And the bad-*** Sith I liked at the beginning of the movie? Also a character spoiled. Why did he take that mask off like ever? After he took it off, I was sad for him. I would have given him a spanking if I were Han and Chewie, with that Indiana Jones whip or whatever artifact he had aboard the Falcon. What little sissy he turned out to be. But the movie's all ""politically-correct/up-to-date with today's leftist views"" so no spanking of shildren could be shown (could have been PG-18 or whatever stupid the rating is in the US- so would make less $$$). In terms of spanking: I though this was what a pupil got in the good-ol-days, when caught doing ""bad things"". Like plagiarism. That is ""baaad""- especially in the US. And the entire story-line is a big plagiarism by JJ. He should get a spanking from Darth V. But hey- Disney (who in some way owns JJ- paid him a heap of money) owns the rights to the movie! So there is no plagiarism per se... We just f***** the fans by emptying their pockets. That what the movie is for. I would like to say I am waiting for E VIII to set it all right and restore balance to the force. But when I read an article recently in which Disney say ""they're going to make a new SW move each year until the fans are willing to pay for the tickets"". So i know where this is going. You give us money=we make a sh** of a movie=you have to pay to see it=we make another... A vicious circle. Why a 0? After leaving the cinema I though the personell played a trick on me and projected some amateur SW flick. So I went to see once more. I wanted to leave half way! I would rate the movie a 3/10. But I got a strange feeling Disney is paying people to give 10s on the Internet so others are lured to go to the cinema. So I give a 0 to make up for that fact. Mr Lucas: please make a fund so fans can donate to purchase the SW franchise back and make it right. You were the Master-creator! Please!",0
729,"Disney has ruined another beautiful epic story by turning it into pile of tacky, unoriginal slop with a poorly written plot. It is hilarious that the newspapers who gave it a positive review, only did so because they were paid...shame on you guys. The original characters' integrity is ruined by being represented as old, and mentally rusty. The new characters represent the political garbage being shoved down our throats by popular culture. ( only the girl makes sense!) I know a lot of companies  think we are blind dependable sheep now, but there are still independent thinkers out there who realize a good work of art when they see it. Star wars is a classic that should NEVER be touched. With all of the money Disney makes with its shallow tv shows and movies sexualizing our youth and shorting their attention spans,  one would think they could hire a decent writer to carry on the magical vision that Lucas wrote...but our education is so poor in this country, it is hard to find someone who can speak and write proper English. For this reason, it affected the acting, it wasn't very good. As a fellow performer, if the story stinks, then the cast and the show will suffer too.The only highlights I enjoyed were the effects, the family lineage continuing with the dark and the light forces, the appropriate use of The Falcon coming back as well as some of the original characters. The huge shocker in the movie which was spilled by some jack-hole online, completely ruined the story. Anyone who values the depth that Lucus created, will see right away what utter crap this movie is. Disney must think the fans are retarded because they claimed this movie was ""for the fans"". This movie is to marketed to a less intelligent audience... We all know who...sigh...Right after viewing the movie,  my boyfriend turned to me and said, "" My childhood has been ruined"". Thanks disney for **** all over this masterpiece!",0
731,"Let me start out by saying I love Star Wars, I love what JJ Abrams did with the new Star Trek. I had very high hopes for this film. I also would have forgiven pretty much anything if it was just a decent movie (logical script, decent acting). But JJ you broke my heart.The prequels were better, and I hated the prequels. Phantom Menace was yes (cringe, I really hate saying this) better than this film.Here is why the prequels were better1. Prequels had more respect for what a Jedi is, to a be Jedi you had to be gifted in the force and most importantly train for years to be one. In Star Wars the Force Awakens this is thrown out the window, if you all of a sudden find out you have the force you can a) resist a Sith Lords interrogation b) you know and can use Jedi mind tricks on storm troopers c) defeat a Sith who was previously a Jedi trained by Luke Skywalker.2. As much as it pains me to say this, the prequels had better plots and better acting. The prequels had original plots that were not completely obvious. Liam Neeson had a presence that nobody in this new film had. Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid were much better villains and even worse Hayden Christensen was better than Adam Driver (I think I am going to cry now, I didn't think there could be a worse performance in a Star Wars film and I like Adam Driver). Adam Drivers Kylo Ren started out really good, that first scene was good, but then he proceeds to have temper tantrums where he slashes computers. As bad as Adam Drivers Kylo Ren was the worst was Domhall Gleeson, who I also have loved in other films (ex machina), his General Hux was so bad it was hard to watch. When he screemed out as the Starkiller sent out the killer beams it was reminiscent of a highschool senior giving a graduation speech. He was really poorly cast, the general of the first order should have been cast with someone with more gravitas. Just think if they had used someone like Ian McKellen, or Ian McShane or anyone older than 50. That part really needed an older actor.3. The prequels had much better lightsaber battles. As much as I loved the new red lightsaber that Kylo Ren had and my god the lightsabers looked so cool, but no one knew how to use them. The lightsaber battles were reminiscent of watching the fake battles at a medieval fair.  The last lightsaber battle scene had such potential, a lightsaber battle in the snow, think of the possibilities (snow flakes sizzling off of a lightsaber). What is worse is that they could have been better, sooo much better (Genndy Tartakovsky's ""The Clone Wars"" but live action). A couple other final pointsA new deathstar call a starkiller, really? How did the first order manage to hide this from the rebels and the republic for so long? Why didn't the rebels take it out earlier?You are really going to kill Han Solo in the first movie? I know every one is following the game of thrones theme of anyone can die, but this was a terrible choice. This really didn't work, if I was supposed to hate Kylo Ren for this I didn't, I hated Kylo Ren because he was a terrible character. Words cant describe how disappointed I am with the new film. I'm done with you Star Wars, I thought there was a new hope but my hope has been destroyed.",0
732,"A totally miss opportunity, dumb lines, boring character especially Finn and Poe, weak villains and the plot basically is a rehash of A New Hope, a complete recycling movie, truly the prequels are masterpiece in comparison with this one.Bad start for the new franchise.",0
733,"I've never written a review before, I just felt the need to create account just for this movie.  By now you've probably seen the complaints other people have had, so I don't feel the need to reiterate them.  They are all valid.  The reviews for this movie are only positive because of the hype and nostalgia blinding people.  This is not a well put together film.  And trust me, I wasn't set on hating this film, I came in with high expectations, assuring myself it would be great.  But seriously it is garbage and doesn't feel like a Star Wars film.  Ya know, everyone loved The Phantom Menace upon its release, and now look at its reception.  I cannot wait for the same thing to happen to this film, when people are no longer blinded by their own stupidity.",0
734,"What a tremendous  fraud!!!Is people getting money for writing good reviews or they are that brainwashed to not see its one of the worst movies ever?.The force awakens is a movie made with the only intention of grabbing money. No artistic interest on this film whatsoever. There is nothing new to add to the SW universe. No new weapons, spaceships, jakku is tattoine, everything is generic.Storytelling is bad and cheating all the time. Everything that happens is based on baffling coincidences, everything is illogical. The climactic scenes are terrible and shallow. What a waste of time. The best thing of tfa was the trailer.",0
735,"Before seeing it, I was very disappointed to hear how Abrams rehashed a bunch of nostalgic stuff and basically followed plotlines from the older movies. Another **** Deathstar plot? Why? Is this all Star Wars is about? A handful of fighters heroically blowing up a big ball? So I went in to the theater expecting to be disappointed but not terribly so. I actually ended up leaving the theater hating the movie more than I could imagine and basically feeling like SW as it currently stands is pretty much dead to me. To sum it up, almost everything about the movie was just incompetent or flat out stupid. Let's go back to the Death Star 3 / ""Starkiller Base"" - OK so apparently this thing which would have taken hundreds of millions if not billions of workers to build (the scale of which is not even remotely hinted at in the movie - the most troops we ever see was in a relatively small Nazi-esque rally later on), operates on the concept that it sucks up all a star's energy into itself and unleashes it in a super-awesome barrage of red lasers that individually target planets. A lot of Star Wars appeal came from the fact it was very believable. It looked realistic, at least to me - there was nothing that looks like ""UFO"" or alien concept art from the 50s. There was some cheesy stuff for sure, but gun props were made from real guns, there was at least some pseudo-engineering going on with the ships, etc. Even ""The Force"" was somewhat believable (before Lucas went with the whole midichlorians thing). This is just flat out stupid. So this machine sucks all the energy from a star before it is considered fully charged. Nevermind that stars vary greatly in individual size. It allll has to get vacuumed up. Now Abrams also likes to go ahead and ignore the fact that concentrating this huge amount of mass in a much smaller area would probably stand a good chance of hitting the schwarzschild radius of the material and invoking a black hole, or at last drastically changing the gravity on the ""Death Star 3"" into flattening everyone immediately. But it doesn't, because here at Disney (TM), using our imaginations and ignoring science is fun. Then of course it has a huge weakness exposed at the surface for easy attack. And the rebels don't know about it this time because they deciphered the blueprints for the base - but because a 'janitorial' Stormtrooper also apparently happens to be a high-level engineer and knows all the weak spots and stuff. That's just kickin' rad for the rebels. Then there's the issue with that particular stormtrooper. His story could have been so much more intriguing. Like others have said, he basically decides not to be a stormtrooper anymore in about 20 seconds. Someone that was supposedly brainwashed since a child into being a stormtrooper all his life and we are expected to believe he could just all the sudden decide that killing people is bad. Nevermind the fact that he ends up killing quite a few of his stromtrooper bros pretty mercilessly and doesn't seem to mind. This could have been one of the absolute best parts of the movie and this plot line should have been fully fleshed out and the process of going from trooper to rebel should have taken a decent portion of the movie. And of course Disney made sure to let us know the fight where Finn turns was his first ""battle"" and he never killed anyone of course, no prior murderings for this future role model! He was also just a ""sanitation"" stormtrooper so it's like he wasn't even bad at all. Also, he was abducted from a young age so he had no choice in being a cold killer. Yep, you can't help but love Finn! What a great guy. I'll just go ahead and skip over all the absolutely retarded scenes of Finn using a lightsaber and the fact Finn's dialogue is nothing like it should be from an actual soldier who was brainwashed all his life. Finn's speech is full of all sorts of great pop-culture idiosyncrasies and expressions. Despite that, I had no problems with the actor himself. Moving on and going back to that believability thing - in the original movies, all the bad guy officers and generals tended to look the part. For one, they were usually older than their 20s. In this movie, pretty much every bridge officer or command officer is basically a hipster that just got done trading in his fedora for that cool Imperial hat. It's just dumb. I am almost out of review space and I barely got going. Can't even touch on Kylo Ren's pussification or how huge of a mistake bringing back Carrie Fisher was, or Rey's apparently sudden expert level sabering skills. Why and how was the Falcon stolen? Phasma seemed a well-portrayed and an intriguing character but was pretty much ignored. Why and how did Solo get this apparently pretty large freighter when he was apparently completely in-love with the Falcon? This didn't feel like Star Wars in the least. The fans are kind of propping it up right now but in time people will realize how much this one sucks.",0
736,"As a fan Abrams could have fixed alot of things.Boba Fette could have flew out of the sarlaac pit, Darth Maul could have made an appearance , he could have cloned a new vader.Instead he played it as safe as he could, no creativity , there isnt one Holy **** I cant wait till they see this moment! in the movie.Remember when Kenobi trained Luke or when Yoda trained Luke? None of that magic is here , now apparently an untraineded jedi Rey can defeat a trained jedi Ren.This move is even more disapointing than the prequels because I expected as a fan Abrams would fix what Lucas broke , instead he failed more miserably than I ever imagined.",0
737,"This version of Star Wars made me sick to my stomach, like a spiral down nightmare with that empty sinking feeling.  I felt like I just bought snake oil from JJ Disney Corp. I was begging for Jar Jar Binks to save the day as a means to validate an enormous joke.",0
738,"The movie is a pure rip off of the first episode squced with pie es from the other movies of the first trilogy. Though those are poorly connected with senseless events in the plot that really make no sense to the smart spectator. Unfortunately the movie was just a big cash cow from Disney to sell to childs and rehash the serie in order to sell more merchandise and products like that . Its really a bad movie , bad script , bad sequel and terrible product .",0
739,"An incredibly lazy rehash of A New Hope. Terminator Genisys-tier casting. Getting the old actors back was clearly a mistake. The whole movie reeks of fanservice, hence the old actors who barely do anything and Han gets killed, for **** sake. The acting is barely noticeable, Rey can't act. The new actors don't have any charisma compared to the Original Trilogy - hell, even the Prequel Trilogy actors had some. Everything not explained is shifted over to the next episodes, and they'll be even worse. **** Disney, **** J.J., **** everything.",0
740,"It is remarkably evident the effect the loss of Lucas is going to have on the Starwars movies going forward. This recent episode was essentially a lazy remake of IV sadly leaving out the spirit of Starwars. The scope and spirit of the original movies has been lost. Rather than making a feeble attempt to appease the noisy rabble, the Starwars stories would have been better served with independent thinking. Extremely disappointed.",0
741,"Extremely recycled to the point of obscenity, with nostalgic nods in such frequency and magnitude its hard to not feel like some of the main characters of the film aren't just extended cameos!

742,"i don't like factories that make movies like they were canned food...the only thing that matters is to make money and not the most important thing , cinema...",0
743,"From the opening of the movie there is a clear lack of magic.  This is not a movie worth traveling to the cinema and shelling out hard earned money for.    Its forced, wooden, rushed and completely lacks any emotion or details to meld it all together. Its a typical JJ Abrams disaster. Too much flash too little substance.  Every second feels like a fake movie set. It lacks the soul of the original 3.  Its just never there.   All of the ships are flying too fast and turning too tight.  All the air to air combat is just Xwings and Tie fighters. The length they went to to introduce any differential to the ""resistance"" Xwings was to give them different colored decal accents. Its laughable.   They lead you to believe that the Fempire takes all their stormtroopers as children, so of course Finn is a poor African child stolen from his family. Another death star?  Really JJ you did not foresee you would be lamb basted for this abomination?  The acting of the original characters is nothing short of disturbing.  Carrie fishers face and teeth are all jacked up and not moving right and her voice is trashed from I am presuming cigarettes. She looks like a thousand miles of dirt road and whatever they did to try and prop her up as presentable borders on CGI.  People there is a reason you don't see Carrie Fisher in movies.  Shes not an actor.  Shes a burnout that got one lucky break. Many camera shots are tight and wide.  Lots of planet surface looks that probably saved some money. Very little of anything involves space.  No space battles. One over the top clash of odd tie fighters and xwings. Sorry anyone with a brain, Awings, Bwings, Ywings, Tie Interceptor, Tie Bomber Etc. No where to be found.  They need them in the movies but just pretend Xwings do everything.  All the blasters have been messed with and many shoot and sound like Star Trek. The CGI creatures on board the falcon are clearly the jump the shark moment. That entire scene on the falcon makes me want to vomit.  Nobody can find these ships and people in the vast galaxy yet they find them no problem on a ship he should not be on board in an area they have no idea that hes there. The movie is one string of things happening that are loosely stuck together. You are watching a movie that plays out like a story board.   Too much unexplained, everything has been done before, better than this. I simply do not like anything JJ Abrams does. Its as simple as that. I hate the current modern Star Trek movies they just defecate out. Han = ObiLuke = YodaLeia = Is just Carrie Fisher after 3 strokesRey = luke allowed to dress as a girl on Tatooine/JakuPoe = Red 4,5,6,7 cuz hes just that good at what he does ""YYYAAAAAAHOOOOOOO""Finn = A bad acting guy trying to escape the movie from the first moment we see him. We too wish he escaped.",0
744,"Recycled crap, what was the point of Captain Phasma character? She did literally NOTHING!! Why didn't Kylo Ren just kill Finn with his force powers??? He could have force choked him to death without ever lifting his light saber... They basically just rereleased Star Wars A New Hope with a female character playing Luke Skywalker... totally unoriginal or interesting in any way.",0
748,They could have went so many places with the new star wars films but JJ decided to rehash the same old crap and at the same time force politically correct bullcrap down peoples throats.,0
749,"The Force Awakens could just as well have been a reboot of A New Hope seeing that it has almost the same plot. Fanboys may whine all they want about the prequels, but at least there Lucas failed while trying to do new things and expand the universe. You can see that The Force Awakens has no other reason to exist than make Disney money, that is why they hired Abrams, the ""safest"" director in Hollywood, who thinks that just by casting a girl and a black guy in major roles means taking chances. And what we ultimmatelly get is another bland, generic action movie, no different than Abram's Star Trek films or most of the superhero crap that comes out these days. So, as I said, the plot is pretty much the same as A New Hope, only this time Luke is a ""stronk, independent womyn who is also vulnerable""(you know, just like 99% of female characters in movies these days), Han Solo is now some bland mexican, the real Han Solo replaced Obi Wan as the mentor/father figure and Darth Vader is now Kylo Ren, an angsty teenager who was seduced by the edgyness of the Dark Side. Ren is by far the worst character in the movie, he whines all the time, he throws tantrums, he seems more like the kind of character that would be in a Twilight fanfic, even Darth Maul was a lot better as an antagonist, let alone Darth Vader. But I guess all those fat teenage girls who like Loki from the Avengers need someone to have wet dreams over in Star Wars as well. The only new character that is likeble(and also not based on anyone from the OT) is Finn, the stormtrooper with a conscience, his scenes with Harrison Ford are one of the few reasons to watch this. Also, one othar aspect that makes this flick a little more berable is the return of humor. It doesn't always work, but at least now not every character is talking like in a Bible movie. Overall it's not a horible movie, but also not any better than the average blockbuster that comes every year. Personally, I would take the more flawed, yet more creative and ambitious prequels over this cashgrab any day.",0
750,"The conveyer awakens and the death of the good old Star Wars. Disney just destroyed almost all for what i love that franchise. Disney, please resell the franchise to anyone else.",0
751,"I had really high hopes for this one. As a long time SW fan, I was so hyped up, I stood in line for about 3 hours at the premiere just to get good seats. By the end of the first 30 minutes I was already looking at my watch. I will write my review in list form. -The whole movie feels like a cheap ripoff of episode 4. The plot devices used are almost identical, watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. Teen in the desert, droid that needs to get something to someone, finding a mentor, that mentor dies, the destruction of a death star like weapon at the hands of shooting down a tunnel with an X-wing. -Boyenga's character (Finn) decides he doesn't wanna be a storm trooper withing the first 5 minutes of the movie. We didn't see any depth or conflict within himself before he decides to turn good leaving me not really caring for him at all -Rey is probably the worst excuse for a protagonist in any film. Throughout the whole movie she doesn't have a single heroic deed. She's basically useless until the fight with Kylo Ren (which has a whole lot of flaws on its own but we'll get to that) She isn't built up in any way and her character development is completely absent. All we get is like a 10 second flash back into her childhood. All this leaves me not caring for her at all either. -Poe was advertised as the third part of the new trio of heroes but he only has like 15 minutes of screen time, he ends up destroying the new death star like thing (do i smell episode 4?) but you really don't care because there's no reason to care for him in the first place because he has no development whatsoever and you hardly know a thing about him. -Kylo Ren first appears to be this menacing Vader-like antagonist but ends up being a huge sissy who throws light saber tantrums every time his plans are foiled (literally light saber tantrums) He was also horribly miscast, Adam driver fails to deliver any real depth or sense of struggle to the audience. This brings me to my next point.... -Stop here if you haven't seen the movie cause spoilers, but then again this movie sucks so you shouldn't care. Han Solo's death scene was probably one of the worst acted scenes in the whole film. Not only do you see it coming a mile away there was no sense of tension or really any sense of struggle within Kylo. The movie tries to sell you that he's having this man vs. self conflict but his acting says otherwise. If you didn't already know, Kylo is Han and Leia's kid. This to me felt like a cheap plot-device to try and give Kylo some depth but I barley met him so I don't really give a **** also no back story as to why he hates Han is given so I give less of a **** This could have been saved for episode 8, maybe if we knew more about Kylo and the circumstances of his birth, him killing his dads would've had more of an impact. -The final fight between Kylo and Rey is laughable. The movie first looks like it's trying to tell you that Finn is our jedi (see movie poster) because he wields a light saber midway through the movie and looks like he's doing pretty well for never having handled one before. Then at the end he puts up a small fight against Kylo. Which just adds to your belief that he might be the Jedi because I really doubt that a trained dark sider like Kylo would have any trouble with some average Joe wielding a saber like Finn is but I guess he does... for some reason....? Anyway, Finn gets knocked out and Rey pulls the light saber to her using the force (despite never even having prior knowledge to the force) and duels Kylo Ren and beats him. Yes, she beats him. A person who has never held a saber prior to this moment BEATS A TRAINED JEDI. Imagine if Luke in episode 4 tried to fight Vader... he'd get beat in like 2 seconds. I know Kylo isn't Vader but the movie tells you he was trained by Luke which gives the impression that he was probably pretty good. There you go, no character development. - The whole movie after the first act just seems rushed, as soon as they get to the rebel base they hatch the plan to go destroy the new death star within like 3 minutes, and then 5 minutes later they're already bombing it. All the important things that really move the plot along as a whole happen in the third act - JJ Abrams wasn't the right man for the job, Cloverfield, Super 8, and Mission Impossible 3.... all those movies are garbage. With a track record like that it leaves you wondering how he got the job.",0
752,"Star wars the feminism awakens! Welcome to Star Wars with: A bad whiny male lead who will be Han Solo 2 in the future! An even more whiny Kylo ren who will be Darth Vader 2 in the future! ( He even lost the same parts of his body as Darth Vader...oh come on!) Rey who is Lukine 2 in the future. She can beat a full trained Sith warrior even without the force, but the power of feminism. Because a black guy is not strong enough. It must be the strong white femina girl! A pilot who died and who was not dead in the end (Oh come on....!) So much things which are completely brainless. (Why Finn and Rey are crying about Han´s death. They only knew him for an hour....) And i predict this for the second movie: Luke will die in the first 30 minutes like Obi Wan.  Rey will be the sister of Kylo. ( Do not ask me how, this is Star Wars there is no logic there) Finn will learn how to pilot an X Wing and will become the greatest pilot of the alliance. And the leader of the Alliance, because Leia will die too. And we will hear the sentence "" I am your sister"" Oh god please no -.- PS: Kylo will look like Darth Vader only with a new armor. And the white pure feminist female lead will purge the Kylo (snape) and build up the new Jedi order under the one and only truth. The feminist matriarchy. Oh god no -.-",0
753,"One of the few interesting things about ""The Force Awakens"" is witnessing how a massive entertainment corporation co-opts talented writers, producers and actors, pulverizes their contributions into a shallow, incoherent pulp, and yet still succeeds financially through a massive cross-promotion campaign. As for the movie, there's not much good to say. Coincidence is the storytellers' choice for connecting scenes and plot developments: the Millennium Falcon just happens to be rusting away with the keys in the ignition for the protagonists to steal. Han and Chewie just happen to be cruising by as our heroes flee their planet. Luke's light saber just happens to be lying around in the basement of a pub where Rey finds it. Rey suddenly displays the same force powers that every other Jedi acquired through rigorous training. R2D2, dormant for years, inexplicably awakens to provide the map everyone is looking for, etc., etc., ad nauseam. Honestly, if you had just cut up the script from ""A New Hope"" and given the pieces to a barrel of monkeys, they could have rearranged them to produce a story of similar quality, since there was nothing to connect the plot elements, anyway. For all the talk about practical effects by Kathleen Kennedy, the movie was mostly the same CGI garbage you find in other Hollywood films these days. As much as I resent the failings of the prequels, George Lucas' creative absence was deeply felt here. The creatures, costumes, and models, perhaps the chief strength of the original film, were cliched and ordinary in this one. The ""supreme leader"" character (I couldn't tell you who he was even if I wanted to since, like everything else, it was never explained) was eerily similar to the Last Engineer from ""Prometheus,"" a sure sign of the film makers' fecklessness and missed opportunities. The acting was an aspect I would argue surpassed the prequel trilogy, though admittedly I'm hunting for compliments. The new trio added plausibility to the porous script. On the other hand, casting Harrison Ford to reprise a central role was a mistake, though hardly an unforeseen one given his string of uninspired performances over the last decade. Repeating errors somehow rarely seems to matter to the film industry. All in all, my takeaway is that George Lucas comes away smelling like roses after this debacle. I never thought anyone could make his maligned prequels look savvy by comparison, but at least he knew the difference between a story and a gimmick. There truly has been a disturbance in the Force.",0
754,"Dear Disney i have no clu about making films, and probably would my version of sw 7 be bad, but at least it wouldnt be as bad as this one. Who ask to make a poor clone of the previous ones and why did someone listen to that person?Well in a reboot you can cheep at least the first 20 minutes, but trash the rest. Is it true that you fired the guy who sad he would need 18 month for a script and hired one who made it in 6 month?Quantity instead of quality and you can see that in the whole movie.",0
755,"Re-skinned  Episode IV with lens flares. Kinda wish Lucas would of made VII, even after II and III, I would of like to see him redeem himself.

757,"Hi, I'll start spoiler free! This movie is objectively a (bad) rip-off of Ep. 4-6. If you go scene by scene there will perhaps be 10 minutes of original, new screen time. I've never seen such a shameless reuse of old scripts. It feels, like the producers sat down and assembled all scenes they deemed iconic for SW and just put them together again somehow with a slightly different (worse mostly) look and style. The result is a story totally unbelievable, filled with scenes that seem out of place and full of big plot holes and random events. The way this plagiarism is done is so crude, they didn't even try to hide their lack of creativity. Almost every scene feels like a deja-vu and those are not even connected properly throughout the movie. Additionaly they often got the essence of those scenes they tried to copy wrong and even failed at bringing nostalgic feelings then. Instead those scenes seem twisted and feel just wrong somehow. It's not nostalgia anymore. It's way too overdone for that. It's not even a reboot - just a lazy rip-off without it's own spirit! I like little nostalgic hints in a movie, but this movie is just that in proportions never seen before. A giant easter-egg! I'll try to make it short and clear by several topics, which were not mentioned before and are not too obvious (which is where the SPOILERS start): - The new Order: They exactly copied the regime from the game Wolfenstein: The new Order and even dared to steal the exact name!! I can't believe it! Do you know that game? Even the supreme leader Snug(oh, c'mon...) is a copy of Deathshead. Yes, they really do look the same! It's ridiculous! Same with every other aspect of The new Orders style right down to the speech on Starkiller Base. It's so obvious anddirect, that I wouldn't be surprised if Bethesda sued them about it. - Addionaly I think the Nazi symbolism is overdone for SW this time. I mean what do you think supreme leader translates to in German? Isn't that a bit too crude, even for Disney? (btw I'm German, but watched theoriginal language version in cinema.) Did they really translate it to ""Führer""? If they did, it will seem most strange to German viewers to encounter this in a SW movie. - Spaceships and assets: Why are there only X-Wings/TIEs and no capital ships of the resistance or any ground vehicles? They forgot about A-, B- and Y -Wings, TIE-Bombers, Walkers and such completely. I have the strong feeling, that if you count the different models of spaceships and other assets shown, this movie has by far the fewest variety of all SW movies including Ep. 4 . - Battles are quite small scale throughout the movie. They lack in variety, intensity and numbers of combatants compared to SW standards. What they are is just fast paced. Lightsaber duels are a joke -especially concerning authenticity and believability. - Relations between Republic, Resistance and New Order aren't explained enough in the movie, but in novels and dictionaries. So basically you have no idea what's really going on the whole time, if haven't readthose before. - Starkiller Base. What? Can it move? Does it fire through hyperspace? If it can't move, how to get new suns for ammunition? ... it's just ridiculous - a 3rd sun sucking Mega Death Star. The idea of a genius! And I think I know it from somewhere already... - Planets were boring, no sights to behold, no fancy creatures, very Earth-like and not very SW-like. Starkiller Base was optically interesting, though. Jakku is just a Tatooine copy, with too few distinctive features between the two. Exotic plants and creatures seem scarce on any of the shown planets. If I wanted to list every scene they just simply copied exactly, I would be recapping the whole movie. People did that prior to me and it's obvious so I skip that part. When the film is released on DVD/Internet surely someone will analyze this by the numbers, but I think it's over 75% reused content for sure. You can find acorresponding scene from Ep. 4-6 to nearly every Ep. 7 scene, I'm sure. Just altered a little tiny bit and in the ""new"" context of Ep. 7. P.S.: I'm writing this as a long time SW fan, movies and games alike. I wanted to like this really, but I just can't. I'm in the late 30s and even managed to watch and like Clone Wars, but this is just unbearable. Consider copying and J.J. Abrams (it's the LOST guy!) and Voldemort (Kylo) a No-Go for Ep. 8 and you can still do this! -lol",0
758,"What a crock. I feel like Ralphie in A Christmas Story when he finally gets his decoder pin and decodes a secret message only to find its a ""crummy commercial"". I love Star Wars. This ""film"" is not Star Wars. The plot is garbage. It is riddled with holes and uses simply ridiculous devices to bring characters together and move things forward. The pacing is hyperactive and clunky. There is no character development at all. Relationships are hastily propped up and splinter like a mast made of toothpicks and Elmer's glue on the Bering Sea. Any intended emotional impact falls utterly flat. If this movie made you cry, you are delusional and numb to real feeling, I'm sorry. Star Wars The Force Awakens joins the ranks of Avengers, the X-men films etc etc by being flashy, trite, drivel that Hollywood bigshots know fans will gobble up in a hype induced stupor. Star Wars should be better than that, far better. JJ Abrams is laughing at you from atop his gargantuan pile of money. What I find most frustrating and disheartening is the fan reaction or at least the perceived fan reaction at this time. We're in the honeymoon phase. Somehow ""Star Wars fans"" are managing to pull down their Kylo Ren underpants and pluck a 10/10 review out of their ass for this travesty. Some ""fans"" are such douchebags that they make a point of thanking George Lucas for not being involved in the making of the film. How low and disrespectful. History will remember George Lucas and his innovations, creations and contributions far more fondly and profoundly than JJ Abrams' flash in the pan nonsense. Wake up people, free yourself from the carbonite of flash and hype, you're being dooped by Abrams and Disney. They're laughing all the way to the bank. I'm not some closed minded hater. I went into this film like most Star Wars fans, hoping for something fresh, something to bring back the original spark and excitement of Star Wars after the lackluster prequels. I sat down in the theatre with an open heart and mind, gushing with excitement and optimism. I left feeling like a cruel trick had been played on me. I left actually appreciating the prequel films and missing the genuine heart and love for these characters and this saga, admittedly not always with the most finesse and appeal, that George Lucas always displayed. This is a high budget fan film at best. At worst it's an exploitation of something many people hold near and dear to their hearts and that's simply a shame.",0
759,"I'm sad to say but this movie is not good. Everything is recycled. Not one single bit of creativity or original thinking went into this flick.

760,"The power of the Star Wars franchise is so absolute that it continues to let film makers get away with murder. I mean, I get it. The first couple movies were awesome and the lightsaber is pretty much the coolest weapon that's ever been. But how much more are you going to take before it all comes crashing down under the sheer pressure of reality? The murder for which these pesky, living insults to creativity must answer to, is that of their own franchise. I understand the laziness starts to settle in deep when most of your revenue comes from toys sale, and I realize the glee one must feel with reaching a new target audience after minimal effort (you didn't really think that Rey was a PC equality statement, did you?), but at some point some of these people will remember why they came into this industry in the first place. Maybe after they've spent enough dirty money to get bored with a high standard of living, maybe when they take a second after getting loaded on  d'Ambonnay poured onto their stupid Riedel bar-set pieces, I hope they realize they traded a shot at eternal artistic expression in turn for some shallow immediate pay offs. In true synergy with this title by the way - shallow. The real irony of this once great franchise is that its owners and creators have all become what their stories advert against - tools of the Dark Side. In this analogy, the Dark Side represents profit maximization, the most twisted of its forms being the short-term one. I mean, we all know George Lucas went insane midway through the writing for ""Return of the Jedi"", probably waking up in a cold sweat with Palpatine's voice screaming in his head during his first withdrawal episode. This was ultimately confirmed with those abominations labeled as ""the Prequels"" that only purpose was to make the fans' minds juggle when re-watching the originals, in an attempt to forget that the overall quality of the whole thing had just been chopped down a few good pegs. But after this once great film maker decided to cash it in (and hopefully spend at least some of it making amends for his sins) the general consensus was that this would turn a new page. Dead wrong. The profit maximization runs deep within, their fears and angers all leading to the Dark Side, with no redemption in sight. The entire movie plot moves through coincidence. There is no character development. No connection to the protagonists. The tension is non-existent to the point of the actual characters in the movie making jokes about it (Just use the Force, right?). By the end of this movie you're cringing at how fragile the villains look. Dialogue is so forced and direct that I'm willing to bet their preview audiences were children. There is barely any scope, any feeling of vastness and of how rich this universe is (the prequels actually did this better, which is unbelievable). The story is insulting, both to the viewers intelligence and to decades of lore that got destroyed in another toy commercial. But the worst thing about this movie, and which confirms that we truly can not trust any system of rating available to a wide range of people (like this website), for how dosed off and content with shallow entertainment most of us are, is how this is being labeled as a space opera. This is not a space opera. It is a bland action flick that happens to be branded as a Star Wars movie. But the feeling of Star Wars is not present. There is no magic left (or Force, for that matter). All that's left now is to determine how long will the mass hysteria last for this disaster to get its deserved recognition. This review does not contain spoilers.",0
761,"Nostalgia aside... it wasn't that good. *SPOILERS AHEAD* We all love Star Wars *except most of our girlfriends and wife's* but i was quite dissapointed with this new Di$ney Ver$ion and here are the reasons. First off some characters sucked. Snoke came out of nowhere as a villain *I was hoping at one point that it was Palpatine since we never saw him die* and the way he was presented...his character..doesn't convince at all.  Kylo Ren started awesome until he removed his mask for no major plot reason and started acting weak *They Should've wait for that last scene with Han Solo so that the fact that he still had some unstable humanity left would've impact more*aside from the fact that he gets beats up by Rey who had JEDI POWERS AND KNEW HOW TO USE THEM NOT EVEN BEING TRAINED BY A JEDI OR EVER MEETING ONE IN PERSON. Aside from that the other ones were OK. Next comes the SUPER WEAK PLOT. Everyone is looking for Luke Skywalker...thats the plot..and is solved in the mos **** way possible *The r2d2 part*. I always say that a simple plot can be good if its well detailed but this one left more questions than aswers which made the movie feel more like a teaser for the next film$$$. Some characters didnt even had any type of development...Captain Phasma for instance... And finally there was nothing new brought to the table ....Destroy a weapon *A new hope* Family issues *empire strikes back*.The only new thing about a Storm trooper realizing his wrong ways was very poorly focused.*Specially when after watching a comrade die he was killing 20 more trying to escape*. Overall lets just hope that the next two directors give us a better representation of what they consider Star Wars to be.Until then; may the force be with you.",0

There was no one at the theater when I went to see the 7:30 pm showing on opening day. I really do believe that the execs at Disney have underestimated the intellect of their customers. I really hope this movie tanks and forces them to do the next movie correctly.",0
765,"Star Wars is one of my favorite universes I've always liked to go back to the galaxy far far away being it through the movies, books or gamesThat's why i am so disappointed with this movie, it's not good Star wars movie it's not even good movie period My main problem with it is- galaxy far far away doesn't seem to be so far far away after all, hate all you like on prequel trilogy but at least the 3 movies have this going on for them beautiful places beautiful costumes lots of different species- Rebellion  which consist of 10 x-wings because i haven't seen anything more, makes me wonder why First Order is so scared of them- this secret super weapon is laughable, who builds a  weapon which can fire twice??? looking how dark it got when they were charging it second time, not to mention what would happen with the star - white dwarf , go supernova , black hole??-forget about training it's enough to have the Force u can mind control and beat anyone as shown by Rey, the last fight was just boring prequels had betterThis is definitely the worst SW movie",0
766,"I study marketing and thus whenever i see so much hype and so much marketing **** I try to keep my expectations low but with this movie , a star wars , somewhere beneath all my sarcasm and realism a new hope arose. Needless to say J.J Abrahms took that little glitter of hope and ran it over with a freaking cargo-train.This movie is just like the monster Frankenstein made but worse: : it's made out of scavenged parts from the prequels but all those parts are assembled in such a way that they have created a monstrosity , it lacks any kind of personality and context, the characters are bland and boring and have little to no background or development (except Han Solo) and the plot is totally predictable and bad.... If you think the Phantom Manace was bad wait till you see this one ....",0
767,It's a long time ago in Déja vu Galaxy ... Good for a reboot ... The monney is writing the script. Lost in the old memmory this space opera is like a Star Wars but it's an illusion.,0
770,"Without exaggeration I can say that The Force Awakens is probably the worst movie I've ever watched. It completely befouls and murder the Star Wars legacy. I love the original trilogy and though the prequels were weak and disappointing, The Force Awakens make all the prequels look like masterpieces in comparison. Virtually nothing in this movie makes any sense or is consistent with what we know about the Star Wars universe. Many reviewers have pointed out the many gaping plot holes and the stupidness of this movie, so I won't waist time repeating that and going into too many details here. But the movie is basically a crappy ripoff of the first Star Wars movie. Even though episode 6 ends with the empire being defeated and everyone celebrating, The Force Awakens starts with everything being exactly the same as in Episode 4! The Empire is somehow stronger than ever and the republic is just a bunch of rag tag rebels. Ridiculous. And there is no explanation of how that is supposed to have happened. And even more ridiculous: Han Solo (a war victorious war hero and general at the end of the original trilogy) has now gone back to being a simple smuggler here... This makes no sense. Luke Skywalker is not in this movie (contrary to what the advertisement did suggest) except for in a pointless awkward and weird staring contest the last 30 seconds of the movie. The role of Luke in this movie is instead played by a young woman called Rey. It's of course totally fine to have a woman in this role (though of course it would have been nice of Jar Jar Abrams to give her an original story and not just put her in the EXACT same situation as Luke Skywalker in episode 4). But apparently Jar Jar Abrams is a radical feminist, so he gives Rey superpowers. She is literally perfect in every single way. And I mean every way. She becomes the strongest master of every aspect of the force in a matter of minutes. She masters jedi mind control to perfection and she can beat a jedi master in a light sabre fight, even though she has no training whatsoever. So ridiculous. What's more - she is better than everyone else in the universe at fighting, she seems to know all kinds languages and although she has never flown a spaceship, she is also the best pilot in the universe. She even knows the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo, just by sitting in it for a couple of minutes. All this after growing up alone, with no education and collecting trash for a living. It's totally ridiculous. How can anyone relate to a character like that? And then there is the main bad guy: Kylo Ren who is just a winy emo teenager who throws temper tantrums all the time... So pathetic. Seriously, this movie is like something out of the Disney channels morning shows for kindergarten kids. Actually all male characters in this movie are basically pathetic, cowardly losers - while Rey is courageous and perfect in every single way. It's just stupid. And what's up with all the lame jokes and like 10 000 explosions? Ugh. Horrible, horrible movie. In fact calling it a movie is being way to nice to this piece of junk.",0
772,"Most of my life I had been looking forward to this movie. After all the struggle I went through to obtain the tickets, I can't believe all that was for this. The major plot is just a rip-off of the original movies. The original actors barely had any screen time.There was no character development at all. Why should we care about the two major characters (Rey and Finn) I really didn't understand. We saw very little of Poe. The movie plot was rushed, nothing original, nothing intriguing. I am sad and extremely disappointed.",0
773,"I'm not usually a hater, but I have to say this is the second series of my youth, JJ Abrams has destroyed. First of all, the acting is absolutely terrible. Secondly, the plot is practically a rehash of two of the oldest Star Wars movie. Seriously? Can you find a new writer please. Third, without spoiling anything, certain things made absolutely no sense, like how quickly certain people learn new skills. Fourth, I love how the empire doesn't have anyone over 25 in their command structure. Seriously? I know you want to make it young and hip, but battleships typically aren't commanded by children. This is not only by far the worst of all star wars movies, it's one of the worst movies I ever saw. Phantom Menace was better. No I'm not kidding. At least Liam Neeson carried his parts. Oh and btw, I thought Revenge of the Sith was the best of the all 7, so I'm not opposed to giving the new movies a fair shake (yes, the chemistry between Christensen and Portman was terrible, but everyone else was a superb actor, the movie was so much fun, and the plot was excellent).",0
774,"There are many things to like about the new Star Wars movie, strong female characters, visual effects which are stunning but not over the top, strong acting performances, and a multitude of varied locations which expand the SW universe.  Unfortunately these do not overcome the short comings in the plot or the story telling.   It is very difficult to take a hugely successful franchise and create new engaging story lines.  Abrams fails again as he did with Star Trek ( another where the cast did fantastic despite Abrams ).   Save your money and catch this one on Redbox.",0
775,"EPISODE IV Sorry for anyone who has just read the first two words of my review, because I just spoiled this entire movie just by saying those two words! This is by far the most disappointing movie I have ever seen; I would even go as far as saying it is the second-worst Star Wars film to date (the worst being, of course, Episode II). What was advertised as a sequel and a continuation of the Star Wars universe turns out to actually be a copy+paste remake of the first Star Wars movie. I cannot believe Disney and J.J. Abrams would stoop this low just to make a lot of money. But besides this movie being completely unoriginal, it does so much more wrong that makes this movie a 1.5/5 Star film... For starters, the character development is far too quick and shallow. Why does Finn suddenly decide to join the good side? Meh, who cares.... Why does Rae know how to use the Force? Meh, who cares... How do Finn and Rae master any weapon/vehicle she touches? Meh, who cares... Why are Finn and Poe suddenly butt buddies? Meh, who cares... Secondly, the development of the story is based on pure coincidence and luck! Finn and Rae happen to find the Millennium Falcon and happen to fly it better than Han ever could and happen to fly it to where Chewie and Han are hiding who happen to know where the rebel base is where it so happens that Luke's lightsaber is there and Rae happens to find it and remember to past... I could continue, but I think you get the point by now... Third, the villains are absolutely horrible! Kylo Ren is just a discount Darth Vader whose just full of hot gas and Captain Phasma is just a chrome spray-painted Stormtrooper who does absolutely nothing but give the good guys what they want (she doesn't even get that much screen-time). Their costumes are also completely unoriginal. Heck, even the Bounty Hunters who were shown on screen for 5 seconds in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had more effort put into their costumes than the main villains of this movie! In conclusion, the writing of this movie is literally a copy+paste of a fan fiction written by J.J. Abrams, and is far from being a proper Star Wars film. Yet it is because Disney advertised this film to be an ""original continuation"" is why I truly despise this film.",0
776,"So my guess is that people who are giving this movie a great review have only seen the Phantom Menace? By all means... it is a much better movie than that one. However, the reality is that this is just A New Hope with different characters. The film critics wouldn't dare give it a bad review because it is certainly more diverse than the old movies and so they wont do that... but its a really the same plot as A New Hope just with worse actors. The whole thing makes no sense and SPOILER ALERT: How does someone who has never used the force destroy someone who studied under Luke Skywalker? This is your Darth Vader? Your Evil Lord? This? Heck, he was more like Lord Helmet from Space Balls than anything. Wow... I am sure glad I got so excited to see that. I could have just stayed home and watched New Hope. I would have been more entertained! Say what you will about the Prequels... at least they had a new story to tell. Cant believe anyone who actually saw it (other than critics) actually giving it high praise. The fact that the critics liked it should have made everyone run away fast!  Its probably a 5 out of 10 but because of all the hype for the last few years I give it a 2.",0
777,"Disappointing movie.  Too many coincidences.  ""Sith Lord"" was a complete joke.  Started out as a badass, but ended as a whiny baby who got beat by untrained people swinging lightsabers blindly. Atleast the prequels had a story and ominous villians. This movie was basically a PC rehash of episode IV with no character development or believable human interaction.  Don't me wrong.  I don't mind progressive elements in a movie, but I don't want to feel like I am watching a checklist being shoved down my throat despite how forced or unnatural it feels. -Grrrrl power ""i dont need no man to hold my hand"" lady picks up a light saber for the first time and instantly knows how to use the force to beat the ""sith"" lord.  She somehow magically goes from zero to hero in 5 minutes without any kind of explanation.  So not only is she the most powerful fighter, but she is the best pilot, and mechanic in the movie without any formal backstory or training. This would essentially be the same as Jake Lloyd picking up a lightsaber in Episode 1 and somehow beating Darth Maul.  Totally ridiculous.  Anakin was also supposed to be the ""child of the force"" and the ""chosen one"" and it would have still been  nonsense.  Atleast my feminist friend who went to the movie with me was beaming afterwards. -Forced interracial romance with no believable setup or backstory.  I come from an interracial family, but this just felt like some PC checklist.  Stale and unbelievable with no chemistry.",0
778,"This was not the worst episode of the Star Wars but it is nothing when compared to the old saga. Some things were done right - particularly the special effects, but most were just wrong - the enemy lacks character, the main characters are not really interesting, there is no mentor like Yoda or Obi-Wan who would teach their apprentice and the New Order is simply too inspired by the Nazi regime (not as subtly as in the Old Trilogy). There are no memorable enemies and the main villain should really keep his mask on and especially fight in it, his facial expressions were laughable at times. There is no-one who even remotely matches Darth Vader, Emperor or Wilhuff Tarkin. This, combined with an awful open ending, makes it a very bad movie.",0
779,"As a fan of Star Wars and JJ Abrams (especially Mission Impossible 3), I really wanted to like this movie, but it just got worse and worse with every turn.  Anybody who says different is either paid to say so or a total idiot.  It was a total replay of the first (episode 4), but with poor acting, directing, editing, music, everything was just garbage.  If you want to see Star Wars done well, watch Clone Wars.  I know, it's a cartoon, but it is leagues better than this pandering crap.  Affirmative action put each minority in place, but nobody cared about acting. or story, or anything.  Carrie Fisher looks like she's had 1 too many facelifts.  The only bright spot was Harrison Ford, as wonderful as ever.  The villain was a joke (part 50 shades, part brat-a whiny product of corporate feminism).  The heroine was a product of corporate feminism (not real feminism, but where emotions and condescending **** replace discipline, training and experience).   It stunk so bad, I would pay again to have the memory of it washed away.  1 lousy lightsaber fight, and it sucked-how is a girl who has never held a lightsaber supposed to convincingly duel?  Gah! I hated it soooo much.",0
780,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, is the most boring movie I ever watched! Warning you will fall asleep or get frustrated in this film.

Overall, this movie sucks and people that are giving it 10/10 that's just sad.  Rating: 0/10",0
781,"I honestly didn't think it was possible to be more disappointed in a Star Wars movie than the prequels. Star Wars has always been about the characters, and J. J. Abrams manages to butcher every new character and kill off the only memorable one.",0
782,"A lazy, fan service reboot. I´m sad that TFA is such a letdown. It´s a safe movie, made for the fans with little new to offer. The real tragedy here is the missed opportunity to take the original trilogy to a new path with a fresh perspective. Instead it uses too many nostalgia elements with the same ANH story arc with a couple of miscasts (Adam Driver? Really?) to bring you something that you already saw. The film score is as poor and lazy as the plot, probably the worst of all SW movies This is a sad backwards step.",0
783,"If Metacritic existed in a vacuum, one might think that Star Wars: The Force Awakens generated so much nerd rage that it is almost as divisive as the Prequel Trilogy. It's not, nor should it be. JJ Abrams, an extremely gifted storyteller who has proven himself on both the small screen and the large screen, executed Disney's plan for rebooting the Star Wars franchise at an incredibly high level. The new characters were the emotional engine that moved the story, and their performances were more elevated than any performers' in the other six Star Wars films. The Force Awakens, first and foremost, establishes a new set of characters worth caring about. Beyond that, the cinematography and effects in The Force Awakens are simply stunning. They far eclipse the cinematography of the previous films, to the point where some shots are truly pieces of art, while taking the heart of the original trilogy's special effects and bringing them to a modern day level of execution. Finally, the film acts as a successful bridge to direct the audience's view of the Star Wars franchise forward and into the future. Sure, there are some similarities to the original movie. Those plot devices, the Ultimate Weapon, the hero's journey and discovery of untapped power, they weren't invented in A New Hope: those have been archtypes in fantasy storytelling for thousands of years. There is just enough mystery (Who is Snoke? Who is Rey? What really happened with Luke?) to hook us into future installations, just enough new ideas and elements that they can be expanded on, while a good portion of the movie is (necessarily) focused on bringing old characters together with the new, of reminding of us of what we loved in the original trilogy to prove to fans that they will be getting the Star Wars that they deserve. It's a great sci-fi film. It might even be the best of the Star Wars franchise when you judge it on its own merits alone, though I still rank The Empire Strikes Back as the series' heaviest hitter. But, in many ways, The Force Awakens' characters are more intriguing, its villain more dynamic and frightening, its dialogue more natural, its comedic moments sharper, and its potential reach with future stories greater and more original than all of the Star Wars films that came before it. And with all of that said, I fully expect the films to come to be even better. This was the ""bridge"" that was necessary for Star Wars to return to everyone's lives. Most films serving that purpose would be terrible. It is only via the absolute joy on the part of the young actors, JJ Abrams, and everyone involved with this project (except for, perhaps, Harrison Ford) that a transition tale such as this one ended up being so damn good.",1
785,"This is not a movie: it's the combination of a far left, degenerate social agenda, brand marketing and a lot of gimmicky nostalgia. The sheen will quickly fade, even for the true believers, but they'll fall for it all over again when the next episode comes around.",0

I saw it in the first possible showing. I could not connect with the movie because 80% of the movie is just a tour a nostalgia. Its not even the fact that they had nearly identical plots (I didn't even mind the similarities), its just that they made jokes at every character and it makes them hard to believe  weakens their character. I'll see every star wars movie, but so far I'm not really a fan.",0
791,"Speechless: Fears Confirmed, fans deserve better! I have rated this a 0, for 1 reason: Fans deserve better! I have read many comments, detailing in a far more literate way, and at far greater length the issues with this film.

798,"THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.  The movie does a good enough job spoiling itself.  Let's just say, you've seen this plot before, within the Star Wars franchise, no less.  There is very little that is actually good about this movie and this is coming from a long time Star Wars and JJ Abrams fan who had nothing but positive expectations coming into this flick.  This movie is NOT as bad as Episode 1, but that is about all you can say.  Even if a certain, hated, Gungan had lost his head to our new lightsaber wielding bad guy, it still would have been a bad movie (but that certainly would have helped!  hint, hint, Disney when you consider digitally re-editing these movies in the future...)  There are soooo many holes in the plot because, clearly, while we repeat the past in this movie, nobody has ever learned from it.",0

808,"This was the first Star Wars movie without George Lucas and it is an uninspired part of the Star Wars saga. It seems to be the new American Dream that an average movie maker like JJ Abrams will get his chance to ruin everything other people build up. Once he revived Star Trek (2009) only to destroy it with STID (2013). There are countless plagiarism in the movie and when you have seen the old Star Wars movie there are not many new in this part. You have the same dialogues and the same plot as in the other Star Wars movies. But wait one thing is new the villain has a new lightsaber – yeah great. But his representation as villain is pitiful and his martial arts are ridiculous. Han Solo is the new Jar Jar Binks – at the end of the movie I missed Jar Jar for the first time in my life – because his one-liner are annoying with the time. And I can’t believe that Lawrence Kasdan (Episode V+VI) and Michael Arndt (Oblivion) are responsible for the script. George Lucas is still a genius and I think he is really disappointed what Disney made with his legacy.",0

I dunno where it went wrong perhaps Disney should have never been involved in making a SW movie also the director JJ abrams messed up pretty bad. It's an entire rip off of the 4th episode i kinda felt like they copy pasted the entire movie xD really for A star wars fan I really left the theatres with a feeling of WTF did I just witnessed?The movie had no depth , no stable storyline just a dozen pieces being thrown in a mixxer and I guess they were like lets see what pops out.. Kylo Ren is in my opinion the most disapointing character what kind of Sissy dude did they take for this ? They might as well could have used ''king geoffrey (GOT) haha Ren looked like a queer crying baby. they should have used an actor with actual bad ass face impressions someone like jai Courtney or Cam Gigandet.

If you like all the Clone Wars garbage on TV, then you may like this film. One of the biggest disappointments, instead of coming up with an original story or any story, this film suffers from lack of character development, poor direction, no tension in any scenes. This film was about as good as Indy 4. When I IMDB'd J.J., I saw that all his film are garbage. He was the wrong director for this job. He's not even a director. If anything a director of being mediocre. Shame on everyone involved in this project. The prequels set the bar so low, it wouldn't take a lot of thought to make this better. Somehow you managed to make this suck. How much time did they actually spend on thinking about the script and story? One week? The only thing I liked about this film was the opening crawl.",0

Not every leader has to be a white male!"" In my opinion, I think to be thats the notion they are trying to give and its hollow and eye rolling. Im honestly more amused than impressed. I support equality. But not if it comes off as desperate and is enforced in my favorite sci fi franchise.",0

I don't want to repeat what everybody else is saying about why it stinks but just google ""40 major plot holes in the force awakens"" by Abramson of the Huffington Post. It nails it perfectly as to why this is one of the worst films ever made and adds to the growing evidence that JJ Abrams is the worst directer in the history of film making.",0

I so sad to realize that I will never see another SW movie in the theater again. It's just gonna get worse I fear.",0
825,"Since I know Star Wars mostly from books (6 films vs ~150 books), this movie completely ruins the universe that i was fan of for over 20 years. Since this movie doesn't follow continuity established by expanded universe, it's no more than an fan fiction movie with a huge budget.",0

Darth vader 2, deathstars, shields that need to be deactivated basically just a ripoff from previous starwars films. Surely they could have come up with something more original than that. The new dark vader kylo ren was pretty cheesy aswell. Having said all this there where some really good points in this movie that where unbelievably emotional and visually impressive. Just seeing all the old characters come back to life was quite emotional. The final skywalker scene had most of the cinema in tears I think.",1
830,"It's a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. I grew up having my dad show me the movies he loved as a kid, I grew up with episodes 1, 2 and 3, but I highly respect the originals and think they are the best (although I think the third is quite good) When I show Star Wars to my kids I'm going to act like Disney's movies don't exist, because to me they don't. This is what happens when people want to revive something that was good and squeeze every last drop of pulp out of it. Maybe George Lucas could have pulled it off, but Disney massacred it. The movie starts off good, the jet pilot guy is cool and likable. The black guy is also cool. Then from there it takes a nosedive. The villains aren't explained at all, and the new Vader turns out to be a teen with emo problems. This guy couldn't even wipe Darth Vader's shoes. Few things are as iconical and intimidating as Vader's breathing through his mask. There is no creativity in the movie, nothing new is introduced. It's a nostalgia trip and a bad one at that. Really the whole movie doesn't 'feel' like Star Wars. Maybe it's the camera angles or the CGI,I don't know, but it is extremely obvious the series has a new director. I could go on and on, but the worst part of all is when a freaking girl who has never used a lightsaber before beats a fully trained sith lord in a duel. That's f*cking insane. Plus she exhibits force capabilities that take jedi's years of rigorous training to learn. Disney just has no respect for the greatness of Star Wars and is only in this for the cash grab. But by far the worst part of this movies was those snarky little 'jokes' You know the dumb jokes that make the nerds in the movie theater bust out laughing? Yeah they are everywhere in this movie. The originals were CHARMING, they didn't have to say these cheesy lines to get a laugh, they were just naturally witty and entertaining. Well that's all I have, to me this movie doesn't exist.

833,"Perhaps Star Wars: The Force Re-boots would be a more apt title. A lot has, and will be, written/said over the weeks/months/years of this films release, attitudes adjusting accordingly once the Disney train really gets rolling - so I'll be brief. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a solid film, designed to appease, tasked with introducing a fresh set of characters into a familiar structure, and coating the resulting recipe with a heavy dose of comforting nostalgia. Mission accomplished and box office records, probably, broken. You will be entertained - great cast, practical effects, fantastic looks. What is uncertain is whether you'll actually care much beyond your first viewing, as it treads the same good vs evil , soap-opera style storyline we've already seen, particularly in A New Hope. No new insights into the force, Jedis or existing characters. If plot holes are your thing then fear not, plenty of ammunition here to fire back at star wars fans/apologists. Ironically, as a non-stars fan, I found a wealth of interesting, nuanced stories buried within the lore of Wookiepedia - all ignored in favour of continuing to circle around the same characters, worlds and themes. I have high hopes that a Rian Johnson Star Wars will invest more heavily in expanding, exploring or pushing in a new direction - we'll see. When the trailers began to appear, I remember watching them several times, moved close to tears by a heady mix of visuals, sound and possibility - sadly, during the film, I only felt discomfort from a full bladder. So, again, a solid start to the Disney-approved series, safely filed away from the prequels but lacking a distinct voice of it's own - happy to keep one foot firmly in the past and another desperately seeking surer footing in front.",1
834,"Let me declare at first.  The problem is not coming from nature of Star Wars itself, nor the reason why they have decided to create another movie of the series. It's WORSE. The cause of my disappointment is that, the story line of this film is not following the basic rules of fiction writings. In another words, THIS MOVIE DOESN'T HAVE ANY CLEAR VISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO GO.I don't want to give EVEN a 0 score, I am completely honest, nor to call this thing a fiction tale, IT'S JUST A -FAN-APPEALING-VIDEO-WITH-A-BIG-SCREEN, I'd rather say. At least its not worth to pay for watching it.I don't really understand why there are so many of them who are yelling this ""greatest ever!"" or something like that.",0

836,"Felt like I was watching Episode 4 for the first time again. Pros: It got the extremely bad taste of the prequels out of my head. No Jar Jar. Scenes that definitely weren't for younger kids. Good start to a new trilogy. Liked how the Republic was finally wiped out and the weapon had multiple beams for multiple planet destruction. The ginger General did a good job motivating the hate while the weapon fired. Cons: Kylo Ren I thought at the beginning would be a good Sith Lord and then he turned into a whiny college grad with career issues over the light and dark side. The new Supreme Leader I have no clue where he came from but all the Star Wars characters seemed to had issues with him. Really confused how a Storm trooper training since he was in diapers suddenly has compassion. It was way too easy to destroy the Death Planet and trenches were reintroduced again like in Episode 4. Even had a guy who resembled Porkins. Gwendoline Christie's character I was disappointed she had very little screen time, how easy it was to have her drop shields, and never took her helmet off. She looked sexy with all that chrome. Han getting killed was a shocker but again his son was extremely whiny. Plus the mourning period was incredibly short. Well Han died so you can take the Millennium Falcon girl I hardly know -Said Leia. Finally I was uneasy about  Daisy Ridley, she did a great job, but looked almost identical to my ex wife. The planet blows because once again another obvious exhaust port that wasn't well defended. The ginger General flees the planet along with Ren (didn't show that part), and did Gwendoline Christie survive or was she killed in the planet's explosion? The ending where Daisy Ridley pulls out the light saber and Mark Hamill stands there thinking how the hell did you find me.  Finally they tried to put too much information into the movie.",1
837,"Not 10 out of 10 by far. It's a decent Star Wars movie, with plenty of faults which anybody who sees it will pick up on if they're not just hyped fanbois; Basically it tries to be too much episode 4-6 to the degree where you come out with the ""Haven't I seen this before"" feeling.Right from the 'droid with the secret plans on a desert planet found by the hero who doesn't realise her powers, to the death star 3 with the design flaws and the I am your father speech on a walkway..... and so many other similarities.Basically - fast forward through 4 to 6 and you'll have seen a large part of 7. The movie is better than EP:1 to 3 simply because it's better cast. The actors carry the story and if they do EP 8 right, it will lift this one. It does seem more like a build up to episode 8 with half shelled out characters but with good potential. 7 out of 10.",1

Plan to blow up mechanised planet before said planet blows up Rebel Headquarters. One of the few things going for this movie is the rehashed plot from A New Hope. The lack of originality does not stop there. Scenes from VII look as though they have been lifted straight out of Saving Private Ryan, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Leni Riefenstahl, Lord of the Rings and, finally, Crouching Tiger. The father-son theme, so integral to IV, V and VI, appears contrived in VII. Nevertheless, VII deserves two points: one for Harrison Ford reprising his Han Solo role, albeit older and slower; another for Daisy Ridley, the only other actor possessing charisma. The Saga was born and died with Darth Vader.",0

It's tiring and it's removing All Credibility from the User Reviews, which is the Main reason I keep coming to this site.

845,"This movie is not better than ""A New Hope"" and it is not better than ""The Phantom Menace"" either even with JarJar Binks. ""The Force Awakens"" feels formulaic, it doesn't introduce any new elements to the series and it plays it safe from start to finish by emulating A New Hope. The movie's full of beautiful special effects and there are some amazing action scenes at the beginning and some at the end but seeing how high critics are rating the movie it seems such shallow crap was enough to satisfy them.

And to add further insult, this retelling is an inferior product of the laziest type of storytelling.

However, the worst thing is that the majority of us out there just can't see we've all been had.",0

I think this movie made me hate Star Wars even more...",0
848,"A new hope for star wars? Well, the question pretty much sums up The Force Awakens. If you were hoping for something new then you will sadly be disappointed. The main story was done in A new hope. Even so the movie is saved by a combination of old characters and new warm characters who are easy to love. The movie sure has its flaws, but its star wars and let's face it even the old movies had their flaws. So if you hoped for a masterpiece, this isn't it. The things done right in this movie are:The sound made me feel like the movie was alive.Good new characters, bb-8 a lovely new robot.A few mysteries to maintain my interest in the new trilogy. This movie is nothing else than slightly better than average. For the hardcore fans of Star Wars this will be a disappointment. For everyone else it's an okay movie that will generate a huge buzz because it's part of the Star Wars universe.",1
849,"The Force Awakens is a COMPLETE disaster as a film. How anyone can even pretend it's good genuinely baffles me. Here's the short version of why this film sucks: 1) Leia is not a Jedi. Really? Does it make sense that a force-sensitive person would walk away from the power to be a Jedi? Especially when she saw 1st hand how dark Jedis can almost take over the galaxy. Does it make sense that she'd let Luke teach all the Jedi alone? No. I get we dont want to see a cgi Carrie Fisher with a lightsaber, but story-wise, it makes no sense. 2) Luke Skywalker is a running coward. Seriously? Kylo Ren made the last Jedi run away and hide? Kylo doesn't seem that bad ass to me, but whatever, he made Luke hide for an entire film... 3) Kylo Ren is a **** Like a GIANT **** This Skywalker trained dark Jedi can barely take out stormtroopers (Finn) and gets his ass kicked by someone who has NEVER once held an ignited lightsaber before the moment of the duel? LOL 4) Finn is Jar Jar Binks. I went into this film wanting to like Finn the best. Why? Cause he's on the poster holding Luke's Lightsaber. That leads you to believe that he's a Jedi. They've never before shown someone on a Star Wars poster with a lightsaber who wasn't a Jedi. Until now. Had they put Rey on the poster holding the lightsaber, I'd have no problem with Finn losing EVERYTIME he touches the thing. But as it stands, they did put Finn on that poster holding the lightsaber and ALL he ever did with that lightsaber was get his ass kicked with it. One of his losses was to an un-named character... LOL 5) Rey is god. I don't mind my make believe tales of fantasy having a female lead. I do however mind when that female lead is vastly overpowered without trying. Rey is more powerful than Luke was in Empire Strikes Back. With ZERO training. She can fly as good as Han/Lando with no experience flying the Falcon, she's as strong as Luke, and she can even translate every language like C3P0. I love that we have a female lead. I hate that she is a Mary Sue. 6) Han Solo's death held no emotion. I went into this film with no spoilers, but I saw Han Solo's death coming from an hour and a half away. Then when the actual scene is setup, its insanely obvious what's about to happen. They may as well have had a neon sign in the background that read: ""Han solo dies in this scene! don't go for popcorn!"" This is the kind of thing that pulls people out of movies. Then the actual death happened and I was like, ""meh"". The problem with me seeing the death coming from so far away is, I'll see the death in my head 1st. And it was cooler in my head. 7) Chewie and Leia walk past each other after Han dies. This is a film breaking error on the part of JJ (Jar Jar) Abrams. It makes absolutely ZERO sense that 2 old friends and comrades would simply walk right past each other after the death of someone so important to both of them. They walked past each other without SO MUCH AS A GLANCE BETWEEN THEM. If they aren't ready to talk or if Leia wants to talk to Rey, fine, but you have to show SOMETHING. A simple nod. Anything. As it stands, these 2 characters are broken until its explained why they behaved as if they'd never met before. It's Star Wars. I get the need to want to love this. And it's also trailblazing for girls and women everywhere and that's a great thing. I get why it's hard to say its a bad movie when you want to like it so bad. But this is a JJ Abrams film. And it's a very bad film. And as a die hard Star Wars fan it causes me physical pain to admit that.",0
850,"The movie has much more issues than just feeling like a ""not-realised-alternative-screenplay-of-episode-IV"". Basically, there are three major flaws of the movie, which make it an utter c*ap :-( First, there is not ONE new idea. Everything is just stolen from George Lucas' movies. This movie or that, that does not matter. Problem is that I was looking forward to see a story. Any star wars story would do. But there was no new story to tell at all. Where Lucas invented new story arcs about Trade federation, about Count Dooku and showed how democracy can be easily undermined by propaganda and warmongering, JJ Abrams did - nothing. Invented nothing. Came with nothing. He had NO story to tell and yet, he shot a Star Wars movie. What a bold move! :-) Second, as there was obviously nobody overseeing the script, it has major logical flaws. I will not enumerate them, but anyone who has seen the movie knows about them. It is far too obvious that the ""script"" was written like this: Abrams chose what scenes he wanted to shoot (reunion of old characters, sword fight, etc.) and only AFTER THAT they tried to figure out how to connect those scenes by some kind of ""story"". The result is pathetic, because, obviously, this is not how you create a good story. This is not how you really create a movie. Third, JJ Abrams completely disregards any given laws of the Star Wars universum. The fans went furious when Lucas put midichlorians into the prequels. But that was just a small detail compared to what Abrams did to the ""Star Wars"" world. It is obvious that Abrams just wrote some scenes without even knowing if they fit into the universum. He wanted two people in Tie Fighter, one shooting from rear cannon and trying to enter hyperspace - well NO PROBLEM! The fact that there was never any two seated Tie Fighter, nor one with rear cannon and of course no T/F can have hyperspace engines just did not bother him. And WTF moments like this are like everywhere in the movie! Abrams basically showed a finger to Lucas and his carefully over-the-years built universum. This arrogance and complete lack of knowledge of basic Star Wars mechanics is what bothers me most. Abrams should have never been allowed to put his ""dirty"" hands on something like this. PS: Simon Pegg supposedly is a ""fan"" of Star Wars and he supposedly acted as ""consultant""for Abrams. Seeing the outcome I believe Simon Pegg never saw any SW movie.",0
851,"Abrams does it again. As if butchering Star Trek and turning it into a Hollywood flashy flashy bang bang wasn't enough to keep Mr Abrams content, he has now decided to move onto the Star Wars franchise. My initial thought was he would be far more suited to this, given that Star Wars has always been for the, how shall we say, simpletons of the sci-fi world as opposed to the thinking man's Star Trek, however it now seems Mr Abrams purpose in media is actually to destroy beloved franchises and alienate its fans. For a start the two protagonists are insufferably dull (the casting throughout is quite awful but let's focus on these two). They have absolutely no personality or life to them, boring boring boring! I have no idea how this can manage to occur when they've likely spent millions of dollars on casting alone, it's baffling. They are so bad they are a detriment to the film, many scenes are made particularly painful or eye rolling due to them. But even taking these two out of the equation, the movie itself is just ""been there, done that"". There is nothing new, it's more like an (unecessary and inferior) homage than anything else, created by film graduates who've been given a blank check to go wild. It's a pointless addition to the Star Wars universe, I would actually rather sit and watch the prequels than this shapeless pile of trash held together by lens flares and blowing the bank on aesthetics. Do yourself a favor and avoid this, you'll thank me for the few hours of life you saved to do something entertaining.",0

853,"Like many others, I went into The Force Awakens with skeptical optimism that it the dialogue and acting would be better than the prequels. Not only was I not disappointed, but the the movie far surpassed my expectations and I felt like Star Wars was back. Bravo!",1
854,"This was a difficult movie to rate.  The movie is well made, the action sequences are thrilling, and it was fun to see all the characters from the original trilogy.  But ultimately, the movie is a carbon copy of the first Star Wars film (episode 4), and was almost jaw dropping how it completely stole the story line from that film.  It was so predictable throughout that it ruined the scene where Han confronts his son, because you knew what was going to happen.  Ultimately I left the theater feeling disappointed.  I'm hoping the next one has an original plot.",1
855,"I am a huge Star Wars fan. I'm 40 years old and have been looking forward to the true sequels since I heard rumors back in the early 80's that Lucas envisioned this as a 9 part epic. I must say that after seeing The Force Awakens, I'm slightly disappointed. This was promised as a homage to the fans of the original films and excitement for seeing the old cast was (it turns out) just impossible to match on screen. Anyone hoping to see Luke, Han, Lea, and even Lando making up the bulk of this film will be sorely disappointed and in that I must admit that I feel slightly betrayed. Granted the new characters are likeable and exciting, but they just don't hold a candle to the originals. Even the new droid just seems a little too cheesy and contrived to me. Chewy seems to have been delegated to a giant version of Scooby Doo, and the main villain Kylo is weaker than weak. In fact, there are several villains in this film that had great potential but were let down by poor writing and directing. Captain Phasma is the most robbed of all the characters. There are some scenes that pay dangerous homage to WWII Germany which just felt really out of place. It almost felt like they were trying to reboot ""A New Hope"" rather than try something new and exciting with the amazing access to the original cast. What a blown opportunity in my opinion. Sure there are some great fight scenes and I loved seeing the millennium Falcon back in action (excellent space shooting sequences), but the plot was just so weak that the thrilling moments only seem like they were layered on as an afterthought. I also can't believe the fate of one of the most beloved characters in scifi history. What were they thinking? Perhaps in episode 9 it would've made sense but certainly not 7! And a young inexperienced girl being more powerful in the force than a trained emissary of the Dark Side? Even Luke needed training to develop into a Jedi. He was no phenom right off the bat. Ugh. Overall, this was an enjoyable night at the movies, but this was Star Wars! This has to be done right and I just don't feel that it was. I seriously and sincerely hope I'm in the minority with this viewpoint as it saddens me that I am:(",1
856,"I'm not really a Star Wars fan, so I can't say I highlight the first six that much because it's not my thing. Personal tastes, and everything. But episode 7 is a good movie for me not because it's Star Wars, but because it's overall a really good movie. Had great story, great characters, an excellent pace, and overall I loved it!",1
857,Overall the film was great. There are definitely some valid criticisms but overall the good heavily outweighed the bad. It's a fantastic way to start off a new trilogy.,1
858,"Weird to watch the negative user reviews grow for this movie. With a movie this anticipated, bad reviews aren't going to stop anyone from seeing it. They only serve to lower our expectations, and therefore increase our enjoyment when we finally see the film. I read several of the angry reviews and heard countless people explain that it's a shameless rehash of Star Wars IV. So when I saw it I was surprised how much it DIDN'T feel like a rehash. It felt like new people entering an old story we knew, picking up decades later. Familiar faces and ships, but now a new story. And it IS a story that circles round and round (Palpatine killed Vader's dad, Vader's son inspires Vader to kill Palpatine and his daughter is a key fighter in the Rebellion, Obiwan trains Anakin and eventually has to kill him but doesn't, Anakin becomes Vader and kills Obiwan - but not before Obiwan begins Luke's training, etc.). Why complain when there's more similar storyline? It wasn't a perfect movie but it WAS a new Star Wars movie - and it was rich and spectacular. It was a labor of love by all who worked on it and a gift to the rest of us fans. Enjoy it for what it is. Sounds like a 2nd viewing is even more enjoyable (now you know what to expect).",1
862,"Lets just start by congratulating Disney and the whole team, writers, casting, directing, and the graphics division, they have all done something to dwarf any achievement in human history, to make a film this bad when everything is laid out on a plate for them when a newborn child could of been far more creative, the story is rubbish, cast and acting was very poor (would put their abilities alongside Brookside's talents) the characters where to begin, A sith the son of Han & Leia so weak and wet and dare i say camp, having a paddy like a baby attacking a computer console because he's been told to go to his room, Rey, (not much to say about her really, only in the film to try and add eye candy to numb brained viewers, failed again)and finally Finn, OMG a coward ex storm trooper who worked in sanitation, no character at all, tried to be comical, manages to pick up a light saber and with no training whatsoever is somehow a match for a Sith in a saber fight, he would of been killed quicker than Achilles fighting Boagrius in the Troy Movie, i have been a massive fan of Star Wars my whole life and just dont understand how it could of been made so badly, im genuinely upset, i would of rather watched a film of lots of Jar Jar Binks's fighting each other with bamboo sticks.

865,"Saw this about an hour ago, found it pretty underwhelming. The good parts; better than prequels, good acting by the two new leads (especially Daisy Ridley), excellent effects. Bad; plot is basically a reboot of ""A New Hope"". Too many wtf plot points and coincidences to mention. Very few original ideas; the wistful loner unaware of their force powers living a backwater desert planet. The droid containing secret plans. The trench attack on the death star. Trying to bring down the planet shield. The bad guy with the black mask (but this time he doesn't actually need to wear it). The hissing emperor. The cantina. Seen it all before. Harrison Ford was doing his best Harrison ford impression. Carrie Fisher is like a grandmother who hasn't aged well, she sounds like she smokes 100 cigarettes per day. The prequels may have been disappointing but at least the plots tried something new. In this film everything feels very small; no massive space battles here; it's 30 x wings versus 30 tie-fighters, like playing the battlefront video game. Abrams basically copied ""Wrath of Khan"" to make ""Star Trek : Into darkness"" and ended up making a poor photocopy of a much better film. He's done the same with ""Star Wars : The force awakens"". Don't get me wrong; it's a good film. It just isn't all that. All this hassle just to give an old guy his sword back.",1

This is the first ... but, excuse the expression, broke the whole logical chain in the history of pollutants. Sucked from the finger alternate version of the events in Star Wars galaxy in the ribbon, just treacherously false and banal, one can see that Abrams absolutely could not experience the world Star Wars !!! In my opinion, to make a film could be trusted only real fan of Star Wars! It's a shame for the Proceedings of the dozens of authors who contributed to the creation of the soul of this great and unique stories! Game actors through false, cheap commonplace hackneyed jokes and funny! The main villain - ""Hu.lo Ren"" like a whiny little girl, not adept at ""dark reversal""! Newfound heroine - almost a ""steeper Yoda"" in five minutes I realized that holds power and a minute has learned to manipulate the minds of people (that Jedi true pollutants learned to do over the years), skills of fencing lightsaber, too, appeared suddenly, and her opponent in a fight with her completely forgot about the ability to manage power, showing signified the beginning of the film. Desire to watch this nonsense again, there is no absolutely !!! I'm sure if it was filmed adaptation of Yuuzhan Vongskotsy war, or any of other events described in the books, with the participation of the director - a real fan of Star Wars, the picture would be tucked in his belt avatar (at the box office), maximum a week!",0

Case in point - the most anticipated movie of the last decade did not last long in the theaters - not even a couple months. End of story.",0
874,"I will start off by saying even though I believed it would be horrible I came in hoping I was completely wrong! I knew from looking at the poster that this was going to be another lets-make-the-main-characters-younger movie because its better this way. Unfortunate as has been proven time and time again this isn't the case. The main characters were horrid to say the least as each and every emotion from the younger cast was either never apparent or was over emphasized. Can we really blame the characters completely though? Probably not. I assume the bad directing of the bad director had something to do with this as the entire story was so out of place that it felt like the director did little to even understand the SW Universe and its canonical features. In the case of the story online, it was bland, boring, unexciting, unoriginal & just about every other negativething you can think of. Sure we all loved Darth Vader but the main villian, who is basically just an over-emotional toddler with a lightsaber was just plain hard to watch. The Sith Lord guiding our toddler is just as bad, as he is just an aspect of Smeagel, wanting his precious Jedi.Another question is, why did they give the Stormtrooper boy the lightsaber? Was it just to show that they were somehow being racist? A Stormtrooper uses Blasters, its that simple as they are trained in its use. If they wanted him to use a lightsaber make him a Jedi. The bad, bad, bad directing, non-story driven movie made this a horrible watch & does not deserve to be classed among the other SW movies. Even Episode I did slightly better at keeping in-line with the story line & that is horrible to be classed less than E1. I will never recommend this movie & can only hope that Abrams actually pays attention to what he is doing for the next movie otherwise we can all consider the SW ended until someone who lives SW actually takes it over & adapts a proper movie into the SW universe.",0

We have another deathstar, another robots with the deathstar architecture, another meaningless tunnel that can blow the whole deathstar (like they didn't learn from last time), same resistance without anything new, epicly dumb wanna be sith, epicly dumb dialogues between Han Solo and Leia.I imagine that after reading the script, Han Solo asked ""please kill me in the movie"".To people, who are not so familiar with the old Star Wars it might be fine. But for me, this movie was an offence. I didn't expect the new Star Wars to be just a plagiarism of one of the old movies.. Such a dissapointment. But when I heard that Disney were the creators, I didn't have high hope.. Typical Disney stuff. good guy, bad guy, make-up, I felt the movie more like an indian soap opera, than a sequel of the Star Wars Franchise. Not going to any of the next movies in theatre.",0
879,"Acredito que seja o melhor Star Wars desde 1983, mantendo-se sempre dentro da linha sem criar algo que não pertença ao universo do filme. Usar alguns personagens do antigo elenco foi genial, ficando a sensação de ""passar o bastão"" para uma nova era Star Wars... Acredito que o episodio VIII nos trara mais detalhes desta nova trama... Parabéns a Disney e aos envolvidos.",1
880,"Really loved this film... I went in wanting to see the original cast and I came out wanting to see more of the new cast.  The characters in it were so well developed I really can't wait for episode VIII now.  Yes there were definitely some flaws and things I didn't really like about the film e.g. The way Rey keeps telling Finn not to hold her hand (all I could see was Kathleen Kennedy shouting ""LOOK! LOOK! We have a female protagonist who doesn't need a MAN to look after her!""), and a few other minor niggles that don't really detract from the overall experience.  Also loved Kylo Ren was convinced he was just going to be a Vader clone but he's a properly fleshed out character with his own insecurities etc which was a pleasant surprise. Great movie and I can't wait to see again",1
881,"~~20min into the movie and I couldn't watch it any longer. What a piece of crap.It lost the Star Wars feeling completely.The voices of the actors are horrible... the girl is annoying and the Sith laughable.Over everything is a Disney sugar coat.It is illogical (as in, doesn't care about any Star Wars logic).Enough to go. Don't wast your time and watch this insult if you are a fan of the old Star Wars movies.",0
883,"What a wonderful, long awaited return for our dear friends from Star Wars. The movie does a great job of reminding you of the older movies, while feeling new and surviving on it's own. There was action, adventure, new friends and old friends. There's so much I loved about this movie. Any one giving less then a 8 are just being asses.",1
884,"I find it amazing that people are giving this film such high marks? The plot is so full of holes that it makes swiss cheese look like a solid block of Monterey Jack! I have come to the conclusion that Disney had no chance of failure in making this film. All they did was recycle the plot of ""A New Hope"" with some other elements of the other Star Wars movies mixed in. That in and of it self I could have overlooked if there werent so many f*****g plot holes throughout the film. I understand that Star Wars is more a space fantasy than science fiction but unfortunately the writers can't seem to make up their mind which it is??? Take the Star Killer base for example: Here is a planet sized base that essentially sucks the mass of it's sun into it and in turn spits said mass out to destroy multiple planets anywhere in the galaxy. Okay, I can go along with that because this is a space fantasy but then the movie tries to explain some of the science behind it creating a occillator thingy that somehow can contain the mass of a star within the space of a planet. This presents all kinds of logistical problems that the movie just completely ignors. Like what happens to the planet as the mass of it's sun is steadily being consumed? Where are the quakes and other tidal forces that would be surely present on a planet that is in orbit around a rapidly disappearing stellar mass? With the suns output being rapidly diminished how is it that the weather on the planet isn't also adversely affected? How is planet able to suck up its sun while maintaining a force field around it? How is the planet able to suck up it's sun in the first place? Why does it have to absorb all its sun to fire? A star is just a huge nuclear reactor that produces energy by turning hydrogen into helium...nuclear fusion in other words. The immense gravity of a star makes this possible so when Poe states they have until the sun goes dark before the weapon is charged just doesnt make any sense since it is just hot matter (or plasma but still matter) the Star Killer base is syphoning off. So what does it mean when the sun goes dark? The sun is gone, all used up? The sun's mass has been lessened to the degree that fusion is no longer possible? I am a science nerd and when the writers try to explain science behind a film they need to make it make sense or it just throws me out of the film! Why not just make the star some kind of dark force star that the Star Killer base is sucking up? Forget the science and just stay with the fantasy and satisfy nerds and non nerds alike??? There is so much wrong with this film that I could write 10,000 words and not get through a quarter of the film so I am going to stay with the Star Killer base sequence. Here are some further examples of plot holes or conveniences concerning the Star Killer base. 1. How was it possible that the New Republic/Resistance not even know about it's contruction given the fact the entire galaxy is easily traveled thru hyperspace?2. Such an endeavor would have made that particular solar system heavily traveled and no one noticed?3. The base appears to have no fleet protecting it and minimal ground forces which is very odd for such a huge undertaking?4. The base's shields can be compromised if a ship comes out of hyperspace into it's atmosphere. Han thought of it within 10 minutes of film time and no one on the First Order side thought of it at all during all the time it was being constructed?5. The shield could be disabled by a single person who has access codes but there were no fail safes put into place to prevent this or at least alarm the base that the shields were about to be disabled?6. Captain Phasma put up no fight or alarm when disabling the shields. I would think Snoke or General Hux would have her head for that if she survived the base's distruction?7. This base was the size of a planet yet all the key people in the movie were all conveniently in the same area?8. The base seemed largely a ghost town except for the firing control room and some random storm troopers placed as blaster fodder!9. Han & Co. just so happen to see Rey climbing the wall of some huge trench but there isnt enough of a  presence on the base for anyone else to notice! Hence the ghost town analogy.10. Han & Co. are able to conveniently cross this huge trench and pick the exact spot when Rey decides to reenter the structure at the exact same time!11. The occillator is lightly defended (apparantly useless gun turrets and a few storm troopers). One would think that after two previous failed attempts the engineers of these death stars/star killer bases would recognize their design flaw and make it impossible for x-wings to be able to conveniently blow it up. Rnning out of space but to be fair could have overlooked a lot of the above however, when sloppy writing gives way to convenience after convenience...I say enough is enough! I give this film a 0 to offset those who gave it a 10 which it doesn't deserve!",0
885,"This is what a modern Star Wars movie is supposed to be. Although, the plot closely follows the structure of Episode IV: The New Hope, the movie delivers fantastically. This is a tribute to long time Star Wars fans, from the small details carefully and tactically built up and placed, to the reveal of classic characters , which felt organic and not forced (No Pun intended). The action and duels are more grounded compared to the awful and ostentatious CGI-filled prequels. The newer characters have interesting depth especially Kylo Ren, who has an interesting emotional dichotomy comparable to Anakin and Luke but with a different take. If you're a long time Star Wars fan, this is a MUST see.",1
888,"I went in with unreasonably high expectations. The movie still blew them away. Never in my life did I imagine that any Star Wars movie could reach the heights of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" but this movie somehow manages it. I nearly started crying with happiness when the opening crawl came on. It was great to see all the old characters again and the new ones were great too. Kylo Ren, although he isn't as awesome as Darth Vader, is a great villain and Rey is a great hero. I don't get all the complaints about it being a ""remake"". Sure, it's got a lot of similarities to episode 4, but what else could you ask for from a Star Wars movie? Han Solo is still the loveable rogue we all know and love and Oscar Isaacs was great though I thought his character was underused. Still, it was a great movie that corrects pretty much every mistake made by the prequels. A dream come true for Star Wars fans.",1
889,"Its like expected, some hate it cause its ""so near old movies (but otherwise they would hate it because its to far away from old movies)"" some hate it because they dont like jj abrams movies, and some hate it just cause they glorify the old moviesfor me its a solid 8,9 and so its the 2nd best starwars movie for me after empire strikes backit gives everything a good space fantasy opra has to give and some people just have to come over their ""the expensed universe is dead"" trauma",1
890,"While the Force Awakens has a few very minor problems, the rest of this film is absolutely fantastic. All of the characters, especially Rey and Kylo Ren, are extremely well-developed and very well-acted. The film is also easily the best shot film of the Star Wars franchise and the practical and CG effects are outstanding (deserves some Oscars for that). The action and emotion are intense and the underlying themes are amazing as well. Throw in some shocking plot twists and you have a Star Wars movie, in my honest opinion, comparable to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Definitely a must see for this year.",1
891,"Star Wars is back! What else can you say about this film? Well, you can say a lot! It is 100 times better than the prequels but for me, 2nd to Empire Strikes Back.I felt excited when sitting with my friend in the cinema, hoping the movie would do Star Wars justice after the terrible films by George Lucas and EA's poor Star Wars Battlefront. When I saw the the classic lines before it started and suddenly a loud noise played and the Star Wars logo appeared...slowly fading out. I was already hooked and excited!What this film does so well which is right off the bat, cast and acting. Words cannot described the amazing performances that these young and highly talented actors/actresses have! You see them in fear, being happy, sad or angry, no words are needed to show their feelings and it just connects to me. However them speaking is like hearing your favourite song, just fantastic dialog and interactions. You can feel they're enthusiastic while doing their performances and makes the characters like real people, believable and establishing themselves within the Star Wars Universe. But in my opinion, Daisy Ridley who plays as Rey who is so brilliant! She is strong willed, determined, kind when she needs to be and is a helluva woman! Easily the best actress Star Wars has to offer. The others perform excellent as well, Boyega is great playing Finn, a young man who a good heart but a troubled life. Han and Chewy....godlike....the memories and emotions just pour in!The camera shots are far superior, JJ Abram is a brilliant director who done Star Trek that translate to Star Wars, the wide shots, the long shots, panning. This is something George Lucas would NEVER of done.The story is simple and yes, it does borrow elements of the original trilogy, but in my opinion it doesn't matter, there is enough original content that is well suited for establishment for future films.However I have some issues with some uses of CGI, it can sometimes feel out of place when it's in a practical effects world. But it doesn't ruin the experience, just a minor annoyance,Some things in the movie advanced too quickly, which I thought should of been implemented in future films for better character and story development.The villain besides Kylo Ren feel less established, I would love to explain why and who but I don't want to spoil a movie like this. Some acting can feel out of place when trying to be serious in his/her role which can make the wrong impression for us. Or may only have 5 minutes of appearing in the entire film, saying that we have to see the next film for more information. But overall, this is a great comeback for Star Wars and the force is strong with this one! I can see a big future for the series. My only hope is that they don't make this into something it's not.",1
892,"Although the world seems to be worshiping the new movie Star Wars VII – The Force Awakens, I left the movie feeling as if I was cheated out of the Star Wars experience.  The film has made over two billion dollars worldwide,  heck, I went to go see the movie twice myself due to my love for the George Lucas Star Wars.  Nevertheless, the film has some deep flaws that are unforgivable which me even angrier the second time seeing the movie.  The film had many errors but most of them boil down into two main issues - the director/writer is a fanboy, not a creator and many logical fallacies including how the main protagonist became so ridiculously powerful in the Force within the week that the movie takes place.  That said, it doesn’t mean that the movie didn’t have some good qualities, but when it comes down to it, Star Wars VII The Force Awakens is just a J. J. Abrams fanboy reboot, nothing more.The new Star Wars did have some admirable qualities.  I would give the special effects an 11 out of 10.  The realistic, physical set effects gave the movie the feel of the Star Wars universe.   Additionally, The Force Awakens did manage to pull off Disney’s number one goal - to use this episode VII as a handoff from the old generation of characters and actors to a new generation of character and actors.Other than these “successes”, the movie was not the amazing movie true fans expected. The plot was so similar to the plotline of The New Hope with a couple pieces of Return of the Jedi’s plotline thrown in that the whole thing was a cut-copy-paste job.  Starts on a desert planet, hero(s) receive secret information that must be delivered to the rebels/resistance, they run into a planet-destroying superweapon, so they join the rebels to destroy it.  Does the storyline sound familiar?  J. J. Abrams created The Force Awakens not as a legitimate creator of the Star Wars universe, but as a fan boy, nothing more.The Force Awakens has another glaring issue – the movie is riddled with logical fallacies.  Why does R2 suddenly awaken for no reason? At the end of Episode VI Palpatine and Vader die, the master and the apprentice are gone, and since there are only ever two Sith, where did this Supreme Commander Snoke come from?  Kylo turns on Luke and wrecks Luke’s Jedi academy, so Luke gives up and becomes a recluse…  since when did Luke become a quitter?  Finn was a sanitation worker, so how does he not die to Kylo Ren in a lightsaber battle on the second strike without the Force or sword training?  The biggest logical fallacy of them all is how does Rey go from believing the Force is a myth to mastering several advanced Force tactics like the Jedi mind trick and beating a training Kylo Ren without any training in the Force all in about a week’s time.  All of these instances of logical fallacies make The Force Awakens unbelievable and breaks the rules of the universe the same story created.Star Wars VII The Force Awakens had great potential, has even been put up on a pedestal, yet the delivery fell short.  Between J. J. Abrams writing and directing it as a fanboy and all the logical fallacies in the story, the movie from the perspective of a true fan of Star Wars, is an embarrassment.  Star Wars: The Force Awakens was just a fanboy reboot, nothing more.",0
893,Really enjoyed the movie.  As good as the original 3 with a massive upgrade in special effects.  A few annoying bits but only enough to drop one star. With an open mind a 9 out of 10. If you want to pick holes still a solid 7.5 out of 10.,1
894,"Disappointing! The Disney guys got it right - no matter how bad the script is, as long it is called Star Wars, it will be a blockbuster. Besides the nostalgia (due to the original characters)  for the ""star wars"" and really great effects, the film is even more childish than the audience it aims for. It totally missed the potential !l!2 bad that guys like Nolan or Scott are not producing this.Story line is even worse then in Jar Jar Wars saga. New characters are flat and undeveloped . A girl without any training gets to the point where she defeats a Sith Lord. It took Luc 3 series to do it....Storm trooper Jedi character says one thing and does other, then contradicts himself all over again - this is not reliable and an utter insult to the intelligence of the viewers. The bad guys - the remains of Space Fuhrers from the Iron Sky are even worse then droids from the prequel.I think that it is the second worse film in the series so far, slightly better then ""A Phantom Menace"". Abrams did far better job in Star Trek reboot.",0
895,"Follows a similar plot structure to A New Hope but done in a way where it's not all that noticeable. I really enjoyed Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the new leads but felt the relationship of their characters became too much too quickly. Would be nice to see them tone it down a bit in future films. Adam Driver is pretty enjoyable as Kylo Ren, the new Sith Lord of the series. Can't wait to see more of him as well. As for the movie, It's a bit predictable at times but still enjoyable to watch. Plenty of humorous scenes through out that will make you burst out laughing. The whole film looks absolutely stunning and I love the way that J.J. Abrams directed it. It was great to see cast members from the original trilogy back again too. Overall, Force Awakens is a fantastic movie and I could honestly say that I would totally pay to see it again. There is very little fault in it and it's nothing that can't be fixed in future films.",1
896,A film that will satisfy the fans while providing pure entertainment to the rest. Not a masterpiece or something that hasn't been seen before but Star Wars: The Force Awakens was enjoyable throughout with great action and a convincing score.,1
897,"Well not perfect, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a return to form for one of the greatest Franchises of all time.  To be sucked into this world once again was an experience like none other.  All the new characters were extremely interesting and in some cases you are really intrigued about where they go from here.  In the end this is exactly what fans have been waiting for.  A",1
898,"""The Force Awakens"" was a galloping disappointment. I probably won't bother seeing the next two movies because this one had me squirming with boredom. With very little variation, it is a scene-by-scene, plot-point by plot point retelling of ""A New Hope"" and a little bit of ""Empire"". The movie opens with the image of a Star Destroyer crossing the sky. A masked villain at the head of an army of storm troopers is looking for a messenger. The messenger is caught but the message is hidden in a droid which lands on a desert planet. It is found by a poor hero, who rescues it from a small, unintelligible scavenger. Meanwhile, the messenger is rescued from the enemy ship by an unexpected party. The unexpected party and the hero meet and escape on the Millennium Falcon after having a shootout against tie fighters. They meet Han and Chewie. Han is confronted by bounty hunters because he owes money. They have to blast their way out. Han, the mentor, introduces the hero to the ways of the Force. The masked villain seeks counsel from his dark master. The heroes meet up with the rebellion. Their immediate threat is from a spheroid doomsday device which can destroy entire planets, but it has a single weakness which can be used to blow it up. There is a ticking clock as the doomsday weapon has to charge from the sun. (In the original, it had to come around a planet.) Han, the hero’s mentor figure, is slain by the masked villain while the hero looks on. Han is also the former mentor (father) of the masked figure. The hero has an inconclusive fight with the masked villain. The hero is then sent on a quest to find the only living Jedi master. Ho hum. It's also insulting how easily the female protagonist taps into the Force. She stands her ground against the masked villain in a light saber fight even though she has never touched one before. She also uses the Jedi mind-control trick successfully the very first time she attempts it. But that's to be expected since girls have to be superior to boys in every way in Hollywood films. The last three films were all superior to this one. At least they were original.",0
899,"the only thing that could have made this movie more annoying.....is the girl ...its like why would a girl be trying to take down the government....i don't even understand......women can't even relate to being in that underdog position.....if anything positive comes from this one maybe this movie might make women see that they are next to black guys on the list...and rappers or black guys always like women so theres no surprise there that hes helping her...with only a half hour left i really don't care if  napolean dynomite gets new world order girl to the reptilian so that she can lose to its dark side ....if i wanted to see a girls face worshiped like its the second coming i would have watched anything else.......i would have killed my dad too if a girl I was in charge of killing escaped too......how dare the world not realize that woman are terrible  overpopulaters drawing everyone in..how dare you all conspire against me How DAarre Youuu...there might has well have been a graphic sex scene....that actually sounds pretty good seeing how a black guy with a regular saber is holding his own against a guy with training and crucifix saber...wow dynomite can't do the first thing luke learned to do "" get his saber from the snow with the force""....did they just already blow up the new death star? someone behind this movie has to know that there are people in the audience like me or else i've never been so pissed....im glad i waited to watch this online.....I would never go to the theater even to watch catcher in the rye....it would just ruin it especially now seeing how  everyone alive is a phony...........Ok... maybe the next one won't have girl face in it or at the very least no rebel  N",0
900,"This is not a film, it's just a commercial product made for people who haven't seen the previous films. I can find any scene in the film that is worthy. I can't understand how anybody who loves Star Wars can say anything positive about this charade. They twisted and raped the story just for a few bucks more. Shame on you Jar Jar Abrams and Disney. Look what you've done George Lucas, this is going to be your legacy, you let this happen.",0
901,"This is remake which have aspirations to be Bigger and Better and they tried to achieve that by ridiculously overgrown and overpower some elements, in my opinion result was shallow and funny, it feel now like cheap sci-fi movie. I have no idea why i would even want to watch it if this would have no connection to fame title. In overall it feel like some lazy production or almost SW parody, in my opinion they should risk new story, instead repeat everything, its seriously not any better, and its amazing with best modern effects it look much worst from predecessor, attack on Death Star was so F shallow and not exciting whatsoever. normally am expect to see score about 3,5 because there is not much new content in it and this old content which repeat is much worst from predecessor.",0
902,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an amazing but not original film but shines so brightly that made us realize that J.J Abrams did it right. This film is funny as hell which is great, it's probably the funniest of the series, and it caught me by surprised because even though the film was funny, it had a very dark tone to it which also caught me by surprise because the first thing you get a real good look at is the new villain Kylo Ren who has quite the story you have to see for yourself. That's another great thing about this film, the cast, the clash with the old school cast of the original trilogy and the rise of the new cast for the new trilogy. The interesting new female lead star Daisy Ridley who plays Rey, a scavenger on Jakku who runs into a BB-8 droid who belongs to a Resistance fighter pilot, and Rey can be related to being a female Luke Skywalker, and that is where the originality really disappears in the film. Then there is the new male lead star who plays Finn a rouge Stormtrooper who runs into Rey and BB-8 on Jakku after crash landing in a Tie Fighter with the Resistance Fighter Pilot named Poe. Finn is played by British actor John Boyega,   and Poe is played by Ex Machina star Oscar Issac. Kylo Ren is played by This is where I leave You star Adam Driver. Then here we have the classic cast of Harrison Ford reprising his role as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, and lets not forget Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker (SPOILER: Don't expect Skywalker to have very much screen time). The performance of the entire cast was amazing, I was surprised that the cast gave a very comical performance with great jokes and great emotion. The last thing that makes this film amazing are the beautiful sound effects and the bright and life-like CGI was quite the eye catcher which is not surprising but in a sense that was one of the things that caught you by surprise, I mean I was very impressed how the film looked and sounded, I was glad to here the sounds of the blasters. Overall I was very impressed by J.J Abrams by resurrecting the essence of the original trilogy with the birth of the 3rd trilogy in the series. Even though J.J will not be directing episodes 8 & 9, he was the right choice for the birth of this trilogy, I can't wait for Episode VIII in 2017 because The Force Awakens is a movie to remember.",1
903,"Awful movie being in essence a poorly made clone of Episode IV except woo looks its a girl. This movie has its head so far up its own ass that the main characters gush like little children when meeting really are just cameos from the originals. Poorly connected series of events and poorly executed. Well done to Disney for pouring $200m into supplicating to the feminists. *Spoiler* And the end? Thats right, they'll kill one of your favourite cameos then try to make you feel better with a Luke cookie. Expectations weren't particularly high since I only saw the trailers.",0
904,"More Mickey Mouse than Darth Vader. JJ Abrams seems to be absolutely the right guy to kill every franchise. Except the old ones there are no  credible characters that fit the Star Wars universe presented in this movie. Again that talentless director doesn't care a second of existing story lines of the franchise and so tossing the fans blatantly into the face, once more he shows that he is only able to make terribly childish remakes of existing movies - just like at Star Trek. I'm glad I didn't pay a dime for that. Get LOST!",0
905,"I loved Star Wars The Force Awakens.  The kindest thing George Lucas could have done was stay well away from the franchise and let other people take over his creation and it’s very much to the films benefit.  It’s great, fresh new and sets up the future trilogy brilliantly.  I loved the action scenes, the acting was great with the cast delivering excellent performances.  The plot is unbelievably engaging and a treat to Star Wars fans and I loved the new leads Rey and Finn and the film pretty much belongs to them.  If there’s one thing I can say, however, it’s that it’s not for newcomers.  You really should at last see the original trilogy prior to seeing this film if nothing else because I think anything less than that you will probably find yourself alienated from the story.",1
906,"Just a money spinner held up by the successful formula of the original star wars saga. The film offers nothing new really... Except for whiney nonce of a villain who despite training of the dark side from a CGI alien he gets beaten by Rey with 0 training in the force. Rey is simply too over powered in this film. Yet another example of feminism in films. I can guess whats going to happen in the next films.. Rey just slowly kills the entire generic evil force similar to the empire led by a 20 year old general who's as intimidating as your average potato. Same old death star routine except this ones more powerful and easier to destroy (LOL) Please try make something original Abrams please. At least Lucas tried new things instead of just copying a working story like 'a new hope' as we all know Abrams can't create a decent story himself without messing it all up. Lost anyone?",0
907,"Luke Shywalker: disgusting coward. Having faced down Darth Vader twice, walking into Jabba's Palace and facing down the Rancor, and refusing to give in to the dark side and the Emperor on the second Death Star, the gutless Luke Shywalker shows his true colors and makes a complete hash of training his padawan - another recycled plot point - and runs and hides instead of dealing to the weak and confused teenager & his handful of 'Knights of Ren' - a grandiose title for a pack of angsty wannabe sith. Luke - far from being a strong and true Jedi - is the kind of muppet who would flee to the other side of the galaxy rather than deal with the new crisis, leaving a bizzare and obscure map as some sort of desperately inadequate cry for help. Having allowed the New Order to destroy 3 planets + their own planet (4 planets in total) now he's going to front up and stop being a ****Also a comment on the Republic. From a seeming position of overwhelming strength after ROTJ they have allowed the New Order to construct a sun sucking base which has the power to destroy 3 planets simultaneously but the energy being sucked in doesn't seem to destroy Starkiller planet......what a joke.It used to be that Botham spies had to deliver plans to the Death Star into rebel hands. Now the resistance have all the plans they need.....more deux ex machine.But this movie is really all about Luke Shywalker. Run and hide Luke! Run and hide!",0
908,"I never thought I would say this, but I miss Lucas. This has to be one of the biggest let-downs of a movie I can remember. I really had high hopes, but everything is just wrong. JJ Abrams is a horrible and laconic director. The story is a literal rip-off. And the characters are so imbued with SJWisms that it's virtually unwatchable. I can't wait for someone to do the Soderbergh-esque cut of this, like he did for 2001. Perhaps a truly talented director can put some lipstick on this pig.",0
909,"I was born around the time that the Star Wars Prequels were being made so unlike a lot of people who saw Episode 4 back in the theater in 1977, I don't have that feeling of disappointment towards the prequels. So, instead the Star Wars movie that disappointed me like a punch to the gut was this, The Force Awakens. Going into the movie on opening day, I already knew that the movie was going to suck. I went in hoping that Disney was lying about the original timeline not being canon. Turns out Jacen and Jaina Solo are in the movie but instead of being cool or even likable, one is a Mary Sue who can do anything, and the other in a little punk and goes from being the Dark Lord to just a puppet. And even still, where is Mara Jade, Thrawn, Ben Skywalker, or the Yuuzhan Zong? Instead of using those awesome characters to create an awesome original story, Disney threw them all out the window, and made a clone of Episode 4. What?! What else went wrong. Oh, Finn has an inconsistent personality, Max Von Sydow and Gwendoline Christie are both wasted in less than 5 minutes of screentime, Starkiller Base is another Death Star, it retcons the prequels, and worst of all, it betrays the original trilogy. Luke is now a hermit who abandons his family and friends, Han and Leia broke up, and Chewbacca doesn't seem to mind the fact that his best friend died. The Force Awakens is a rip-off, a cash grab, and a bad Star Wars movie all at the same time. Star Wars is the most important multimedia franchise I have ever experience, and Disney turned it all into a whole bunch of bantha fodder. And this road isn't going to get any better, because the movie has an 8.3 on iMDB, and has grossed over $2 billion. George Lucas and every true Star Wars fan should be ashamed of this over glorified fanfiction. It is as Luke put it ""a piece of junk"".",0
910,"This is not a flawless movie, people will say it is but it does have it's flaws. That being said, so does every star wars film. And this one is my joint favourite. My god...what a rebirth of franchise once left for dead, the charisma between old and new folk alike is exceptional and the humour has been reinvigorated as well as the acting once dry in the prequels. Make no mistake, there were a few things I had issues with. The look of snoke was ehhh, not too menacing in my opinion (CGI was a tad off, he looked moderately fragile which I did particularly like) and there were a few major things taken from previous films. However this burst of nostalgia along with some of the best character work I've ever seen in a film gives it pure life. The starship battles being fun and heart-pounding alike, and a brand new charm from BB-8 makes this one of the best Star Wars film along with Empire Strikes Back. Watch this film, again and again and again...",1
911,"Disappointing. Lost opportunity to stand on shoulders of the original trilogy (4-5-6), which was great story-telling (even though a sequel was not originally planned, and Lucas had to regroup). In contrast, this was better technologically, but a story that seemed more slapped together, with an immature villain, a shallow fighter pilot with an unrealistic bond with a former storm trooper, and a protagonist with powers that suddenly appear out of nowhere.",0
912,"I'm not a big fan of the franchise, but an admirer, I can say that this film is fantastic, exciting, fun and exciting. For those most avid fans, either new or old is a full plate full of nostalgia and memorable moments ... One of the best films of the year",1
913,"Probably one of the best movies I have seen all year and definitely so much better than the prequels. When I saw the crawl text pop up again, I couldn't believe it was finally here. Got goosebumps. Great acting, great action, great everything really. Looking forward to the next one.",1
914,"I have nothing to say about this movie that hasn't already been said, other than that this film actually managed to turn me *off* of future Star Wars productions.

915,"As the saga moves forward, this one harkens back to the days of the original trilogy with simple plot lines, snappy pacing, safe creatures, organic effects and a few comic exchanges. Although the original trio of stars has a few moments, this one sets up a compelling new group of players to continue the franchise. The storytelling is solid and the battles are OK, but there's nothing especially original or innovative about this new world (even the popular BB-8 is a re-imagining of R2D2). Still, it's fun to enjoy the legacy, while anticipating where it'll go next.",1

918,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is everything we could have wanted and more, and feels like a return to glory for the franchise that needed redemption the most. Going into the film, the hype was insane, but whether or not the film would live up to it was to be determined. The Force Awakens is surprisingly funny, filled with stunning visuals, and features a lot of surprises in an age when spoilers rule. Some may have issues with decisions of the writers, but the filmmakers deserve credit for their devotion to the story.The most surprising aspect of The Force Awakens was the sense of humor, something the original trilogy and prequels had struggled with in different ways. The actors have a great chemistry, which helps the humor, especially between Chewbacca and Han Solo. The humor is brilliant, because it blends with the tone of the film, is very subtle, and is littered throughout the entire film. However, humor is not a trademark of Star Wars, at least not like visual effects are.The entire look of the film is gorgeous, this is because of various things, but the most important was J.J. Abrams and Disney’s devotion to honoring the approach of the original films. The film was shot on film, while there’s some debate, my opinion is that film looks far better than digital, and the film accentuates my point. Another decision that helped the film was the use of practical effects, which always look more real than digitally created creatures. The perfect mixture of CGI and Practical, along with the use of film makes The Force Awakens beautiful, and stunning to look at.The last element that stuck out to me, was the plot. I refuse to give away any elements, as I agree with Disney that this film should be viewed knowing as little as possible, but I will say there are tons of surprises in the film. While the plot did recycle some elements from earlier films, it did feel original in a lot of ways as well, and the few cliched moments are forgivable in the grand scheme of things.The Force Awakens does the job many had hoped The Phantom Menace would do in 1999, and it does it well. It is truly subjective about what Star Wars film is your favorite, but for me The Force Awakens rivals that of the original, and even putting it in the same category is a compliment all it’s own. Considering the fanbase for this film, and it’s franchise it’s good to see that Star Wars has finally gotten back to the quality we all knew it could.",1
919,"""Jar Jar Abrams & The Disney Clan: Making lots of Spam"" was a fantastic addition to the 'Space Nazi's' series, the iconic mouse-eared megalith is known for. Personally, I really enjoyed how sleepy and lightly nauseated I felt after the first 20 minutes of struggling to immerse myself. After one gives up, a luminescent glow descends upon your being, you won't care if you died right there in the theater. I recommend reading Goethe's ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" for similar experiences. All of this talk of Jar Jar Abrams not having the capacity or vision to create such movies, is totally without foundation. He has the lineage of a great AAA movie creator, he moved freely from writer to actor to composer to SFX/VFX to director; ALL without relying on nepotism. A true nexus and catch-all of talent, Jar Jar Abrams was the perfect choice to direct this masterpiece. His decision to delegate all editing to the same marketing division of Ford that developed the iconic ""Focus"" and ""Focus Trend"", was a featherstroke of genius. It played out in the solid pacing that always left me asking questions like: **** was that - that **** from 'Girls' - are you ****ing serious?, I'm going back to sleep...""",0
920,"EXTRA WARNING DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE YET. I HAD THE MISFOURTUNE OF HAVING ONE OF THE MAIN TWISTS SPOILED FOR ME AND DO NOT WISH TO DO SO FOR SOMEONE ELSE. Star Wars Episode VII is 100% worth all the hype. I had stressed myself out over this film for the whole year of 2015 and it pulled through. I spent countless hours thinking and worrying about this film and it turns out the franchise was left in good hands. The Star Wars golden age has returned. JJ Abrams, a man who I did not envy, managed to make a film that the fans wanted that also stayed true to the original trilogy. In my opinion he has finally reached his potential, like many other people involved with this film. The film is not completely original of course as we do get another death star like weapon but it seems to be less of a part of the story. It'll be interesting to see what Abrams next move will be now that he will not be directing episode 8 or 9. The new cast in this film is incredible. Daisy Ridley is a star. No questions asked, there is no questioning why this young lady is now the face of the franchise going forward. Rey is a lovely character that is well developed, we go on a full journey with her much like we did with Luke Skywalker in 1977. I am very intrigued to see how much Ridley can improve as the story continues as well as her character. She's also a strong capable woman, and we can never get enough of them in film. John Boyega is also a force to be reckoned with. The chemistry between Ridley and Boyega is great and its lovely to see them grow together throughout the film. Both young actors also fit in very well with the more recognizable faces from the original trilogy. Kylo Ren is the best villain in Star Wars since Darth Vader. Kylo Ren seems to have become more experimental with the force which was a must for this movie. We needed to know that the force itself had grown over thirty years and it did. Adam Driver finally shows that he was worth waiting for as he has stood in most of his recent movie roles but really needed one big part that would demonstrate his talent to the world. Kylo Ren draws inspiration from Vader, which was apparent by his appearance, but he is easier to empathise with than Vader was in his first film. Kylo Ren is the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia, which is revealed fairly early in the film which makes him even more appealing to the audience. I also like the fact that they are looking to ride Driver for at least another film. One of the things I always disliked about the prequels was that it seemed like they were getting rid of their villains too quickly. Then when Disney bought the franchise I was worried that Star Wars would begin taking more of a ""Marvel approach"" with villains, but Kylo Ren seems to be sticking around. Then we have the old cast. Han Solo is the member of the original cast that gets the most screen time outside of maybe Chewbacca who is once again on point like he always has been. Han Solo managed to age beautifully as a character but he also maintained those elements that you will never forget. Harrison Ford will always be Han Solo and his performance in this film is as good as it was in any of the originals. He also contributed a lot of humour. Leia gets a bit less attention and I'm okay with that, but I think there is going to be more involvement from her later on. Now to the hot topic among everyone who has seen this film already. Han Solo's death at the hands of Kylo Ren (which I had spoiled for me). I think it was perfect. It did not come without warning which I think works because it gives the viewer enough time to come to terms with what it about to happen. I believe that Harrison Ford chose to sign on for The Force Awakens on the condition that Solo got the death Ford wanted back in Return of the Jedi. I think that a death of a old cast member had to happen just to prove that they were not invincible. Solo's death has an impact on the characters kind of like Obi-Wan Kenobi's death in Episode IV. I thought the lightsabre duel between Finn, Rey and Kylo Ren was great. It showed that Kylo Ren is still learning to master the dark side and that he will likely come back even stronger for episode VIII. As a fan I wanted to see Luke Skywalker pop in to save the day, but I think that leaving him out did better for the story overall and it completed Rey's arc. Finally the film ends with Rey coming into contact with Luke. It results in a cliffhanger that really doesn't both me that much. Empire Strikes back left a huge cliffhanger and that only made the film better. Luke's in the film for essentially 10 seconds but getting a look at that character for the first time in 30 years gave me chills. Luke's involvement in the next film will almost be certainly bigger and I already can't wait. The Force Awakens gives you enough of the new and the old as well as the surprises of the original trilogy. Episode VII is certainly better than the prequels.",1
921,"Way better than A New Hope. I'm sorry, dedicated fans, but this one just has MUCH more story, humour and focuses more on what the fans want to see, like Han Solo and Kylo Ren. What didn't work: While this was a fantastic movie, there was a scene or two I would cut out, such as Han Solo's introductory scene. I think Han needed a better introduction back into Star Wars. Also, Oscar Isaac's character Poe Dameron is great from what we see, but just doesn't get enough screen time. I look forward to seeing him in future films. It's also a little weird that Domhnall Gleeson has a British accent when he's Irish. Either get a real British actor or make him Irish. What's up with that? Finally, Gwendoline Christie's character Captain Phasma is very underdeveloped. She just kind of walks around and looks cool. What worked: This film is like a remake of A New Hope, but that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's like J.J. took A New Hope and emphasised all our favourite things, like Han Solo, the bad guys, and the quips, while also minimising the things that didn't work. Daisy Ridley's Rey is a brilliant character; the best Star Wars girl since Leia. She's got a career ahead of her! And Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is also brilliant. Andy Serkis portrays Supreme Leader Snoke superbly, and I certainly can't wait to see more of him in future episodes. In short, The Force Awakens is the best Star Wars film since Empire, and I would definitely recommend to all fans of the Star Wars saga, and indeed the sci-fi genre.",1
922,"It's definitely not flawless, but then again, no Star Wars movie (or any movie for that manner) is. What's important is that Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not just a return to form. This not only includes the imagination, excitement, and wonder from the previous movies. Rather, it promises a bright future. These new characters are the most interesting that Star Wars has ever seen, the action sequences and visuals are as stunning as ever, and the movie does a great job of balancing the old and the new, especially surprising considering that JJ Abrams has had a habit of relying too heavily on references. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a classic Star Wars film, and it easily ranks as one of the top 2 best movies in the series. And if the series continues on this path of greatness, we could potentially see something pass up Empire Strikes Back in quality. As it stands, second best will do just fine. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the most thrilling and satisfying movies of the year, especially amazing considering the ridiculous hype.",1
924,"Worst Star Wars ever, in fact possibly the worst movie of the decade. JJ Abrams is not a director, hes a corporate shill who makes a living off doing FX driven reboots of beloved franchises. He hires **** actors, throws together a script and then just drowns the thing in special effects. Then he rather cleverly throws in minority leads and presents it as political progress to naturalize critics, and it works. The man has no vision, no story to tell and absolutely no talent. This isnt just a bad movie, its a violation of a masterpiece. This movie is the scat of sci fi. George Lucas was paid 8 billion for Star wars and in an interview he gave recently he indicates that it was a mistake to sell it. Thats how bad this movie is. Laws need to be made to keep JJ Abrams away from video cameras in future. If i could give this movie lower than 0 i would.",0

935,"If this was a generic netflix sci-fi film, i'd probably be more generous. But this is Star Wars, and what did they do? Played it super safe and just remade the first film. It's not even as good either, it's layered with JJ's desire to dump his regressive left politics all over it (him and disney). I'm all for strong female characters, but the main character is a Mary Sue. She has no flaws, hence there will be no growth. She's already a badass that can do everything, even take down sith. Again, a star wars movie made by people who don't understand what made star wars so great in the first place. The other thing that pisses me off, is the total bait and switch with the trailers. The trailer made this movie look like it was going to be dark and gritty. Instead we got a cheesy adventure film.",0
936,"Really wanted to like it, but it was really safe and did little to expand the Star Wars universe in any creative or risky way. Largely a copy of the story of A New Hope. A lot of nonsensical scenes, like Rey and Finn being able to contend with a Sith Lord in Kylo Ren.",0
937,"The tantrums of Kylo Ren pretty much resume the whole movie: this is intended for teenagers and children mature enough to be accompanied by their parents to watch this 2 hour long ad. Apart from these aspects, the direction by JJA is good enough to avoid the potholes (and not plotholes) of episodes 1-3 but it falls short of being able to deliver any sensible experience to the adult viewer. The plot holes however are an other story: any decent sci-fi buff will be seriously annoyed: the planet destroyer could not have any atmosphere, neither vegetation. The key characters could/should never have met (it was nearly inconceivable in episodes 4-6 but in this universe it is worse). The key characters are evolving from scene to scene: i.e. the non violent stormtrooper suddenly have not a single regret killing many of his ex-comrades (when they are sharing a similar enrollment). For the brain-equipped individuals, watching this production is a painful experience, for the others... well I cannot speak for them but it looks like they enjoy IT.",0
939,"Rating this a 3, because it deserves to see red...for it is after all, IMO a distinctly average rehash. Had there been an original story-line that was cleverly written, which truly felt like a continuation of the saga, then it would deserve high praise. But that was beyond the scope of the writers and director....and that's probably why JJ Abrams has walked, he couldn't possibly get away with rehashing Empire for Episode VIII.....I mean, you can't fool all of the people all of the time, can you? I honestly felt like walking out when Death Star III was revealed. Old characters were doing the same old thing or go missing and are shown little respect, but I was more than willing to see the new characters take center stage. But what of them? Finn (droid, please!) was just annoying (think human Jar Jar);Poe 'Starbuck' Dameron decides to go AWOL for most of the film; Rey was okay, nicely cast...but her story pales in comparison to Luke's in Episode IV. Kylo Ren whose motivations still baffle me , is just a poor man's Vader...if that's good enough for you, then fair enough. There's less CGI here than in the prequels. That's a good thing, but there's still a synthetic, plasticky feel to things and some of the environments look a little too bland. Abrams direction feels closed in and the cinematography isn't as grand or effective as other films in the saga.The pace was too fast, just bashing you from one action scene to another with little time to digest events. In comparison to the poorly executed prequels, the acting is better, the plot is less convoluted, there's less talky bits, more action, faster pace and less CGI. Its the anti-prequel film that they thought everyone wanted to see, but as a continuation of the saga I found it unsatisfying and underwhelmed. We know Star Wars can be great, we have the original trilogy look back on; we don't need a rehash to remind us of that.",0

Check out the end credits for the hundreds of DIGITAL artists having worked on this Michael Bay parody. But I digress.So why, for crying out loud, are professional film critics too blind to see this? If it wasn't Star Wars, they would be tearing this self-plagiarism to shreds.

I bet he was bored silly watching his original trilogy being replicated rather than built on. Pros:  Daisy & the impressively haunting giant Star Destroyer & AT-AT relics. Cons: Everything else. PS  Just adding a few new spacecraft would've help heighten the interest but I guess they want to sell out of the current models first before inventing new stuff for the next movie-cum-merchandising opportunity. Sure, such a brazen, greedy cash grab was expected, and a lot of flashy uninspirational 'sound & fury, meaning nothing' from JJ was par for the course, but it wasn't the New Hope it aspired to be - which let's face it, wasn't a hugely ambitious target in the first place, considering the time & money expended. Summed up:  'Meh' & *sigh* :-(",0

I walked out of that theater in December 2015 exploding with eccentricity. My mind raced over every possible string of events, all the potential that Star Wars had now in the current generation. I couldn't withhold my excitement as I discussed the possible outcomes of our favorite characters and new ones, ignoring the nagging doubts that built underneath.I hate this movie because it is a testament to how low we will sink as fans. They cheapened the Star Wars experience, watered it down with safe, lazy writing and overuse of our favorite imagery. They played our desires and made off with two billion dollars by reselling to us what we'd already cultivated for three decades. We ate it up for all its worth and then some like rabid starved dogs, applying our own theories and projecting our hopes onto the story or characters in an effort to make up for what they didn't tell us, to pick something, anything out of the pile so we could keep believing. Just look at what it's become; Dead in the water not even two years later, stuffed with generic, bland characters whose fates we could care less about. Unremarkable copy-cat locales, forgettable or non-existent world building. Overzealous, blatant political messages and themes, creators who don't give a **** about us or our relation with the universe and its denizens, just our damn money. Ruined legacies of characters we grew up idolizing and pretending to be because they inspired us. We thought we'd seen it all with the Prequels. But even those movies understood the difference between Star Wars and other films, the elusive quality that they lacked and the majesty of the setting. But when you need to have more films to explain the ones you've just watched, they've already won. That's the game. Episode Nine is only going to drive this nail deeper than ever before, one movie can't fix this mess we helped create.This series used to mean something because it took risks. George had little faith in Star Wars before it was called A New Hope; There never were supposed to be any sequels or prequels, but he and all those involved took a chance on us and it worked. It carried a depth and weight that shook the foundations of our popular culture to its core. Even if you didn't care about the underlying themes of galactic conflict, family, hopeful optimism, the timeless tales & lessons etc you could just take it as it was, a silly but charming movie perfect for all ages, simply enjoyable to sit down and watch. But you just can't replicate genius. Not when a big business takes the reigns over a cultural icon.Three points is all I can muster to give. The Force Awakens will forever remain a painful reminder of what could have been, what was traded away in favor of an assembly line constantly spitting out worse and worse movies every year.

Please, don't even mention the 5 planets destroyed by starkiller (yeah, status quo, another death star). All of this made the original trilogy completely POINTLESS.

In episode 6, the rebels defeated the empire and became the ruling force in the galaxy. How did it happen that the rebels were still the rebels and the empire became even stronger ?! It sends in the trash, the plot of past films!Characters are ridiculous in their behavior, inappropriate dialogues and dubious motives. The transformation of the imperial storm trooper Finn into the emotional humanist and anti-militarist from being trained to kill since childhood seems unthinkable. Next Luke Skywalker.Just think one of his pupils became bad. Why not continue to rebuild the Order of the Jedi Luke fled to the edge of the universe to feel sorry for himself. Yes, so that relatives and most loyal people do not know where he is. And this is the moment when peace and tranquility collapse again in the galaxy?This is the ""brilliant revelation of the legendary Luke Skywalker.""Why Kylo Ren worshiping Darth Vader? After all, he stood on the bright side in episode 6. More logical to Kylo Ren worshiped cloak or photo Darth Sidious.Kylo Ren  an adherent of the dark side,wielding Force,trained by Luke Skywalker and he unable to defeat former storm trooper Finn and scavenger Rey who takes the lightsaber for the first time in they hands?! Stupid plot, stupid characters. Worst star wars movie.",0
962,"This Star Wars movie was pretty meh.It had an uninspired main character with no flaws. It relied too heavily on nostalgia on one hand and failed to give OT fans the only thing they wanted on the other (a reunion). It retold A New Hope except poorly. The visuals were nice and there were some nice moments, mostly involving X-Wings.The thing that fails it, that turns it from a 7/10 (for me) into a 3/10 is The Last Jedi. To be clear, I don't think 7/10 is good enough for a Star Wars movie...Nothing that had potential to become interesting from this movie (Knights of Ren, Snoke, seeing Luke again, etc) amounted to anything at all in The Last Jedi, which seems to have existed only for the purpose of destroying Star Wars. Unable to touch the almighty OT, it has had a devastating effect on other movies in its own trilogy.So since this is a trilogy, not a standalone movie, a 3/10 it gets and TFA is lucky to get that. Throw out your BluRays, this movie is hot garbage.",0

Not sure what happened here (well, Disney happened) but this is not a good Star Wars movie, and new Rey character is plain unlikable.

Ladies and gentlemen: Politically correct wars, the social justice warriors awaken (to ruin another great franchise)    And just to make this clear: the female protagonist is not the reason why I dislike the film, neither is the black guy.

985,"Ok. I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 8. I've obsessed over it through my teenage years and into early adulthood. It's my life and is the reason I'm a screenwriter. But this just let me down. When I heard Abrams was directing, I was thrilled, but really all this is is a re-hash of A New Hope.The story is almost a carbon (no pun intended) copy of A New Hope. The Death St--Starkiller Base actually ruins the film for me. How did they pull this off? Like really what is this thing?! The ""Nazi"" Stormtroopers were cliched and humorous if anything. There was no ability to find a connection to Hosnian Prime because I didn't even know what that was until after the film. There are so many questions and not in an inquisitive manner either. Like, why do we need to descend back into complete galactic chaos again? What was the point of the original trilogies because it seems like this just completely undoes the whole plot of the previous six films. The story is the massive drawback of this film because everything else is just so strong; it's disappointing.The cinematography saves the weak story, really. The practical effects are gorgeous and a throwback to the original trilogy. It was refreshing. The production team deserves all the praise in the world for this damn-near masterpiece.The acting is ambitious and strong. Daisey Ridley is a little unconvincing at times and shrinks in comparison to the greats around her, like Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and even Oscar Isaac. However, she has promise and I believe she will steal the spotlight by the of the trilogy. Worth nothing, Adam Driver is the best part of this movie. He does a stunning job. His character is almost exactly what I wish Anakin was in Revenge of the Sith or even Attack of the Clones. Much praise to Driver.I do expect very great things going forward, despite the rocky start. 7.25/10",1
986,"JJ Abrams is by far and away, the worst Star Wars director and writer (so far). Every movie adds some thing new to the Saga, except for the 2 movies by JJ Abrams. I would credit the things that work towards Lawrence Kasdan, the talented actors, and the VFX people, and all all work entirely despite Abrams being involved, rather than.  Because of... Which is The first act is good. The part where Rey is ascaravenger on the ruins of a Star Destroyer, and Finn rescues Poe. And Poe, heroically dies.But the movie akwardly falls apart at the moment where Rey and Finn find and pilot the Millennium Falcon. Plot contrivance much?. Sure one plot contrivance is almost harmless, but a thousand plot contrivances turn the whole film into a giant Chesse Swiss of plotholes. BB-8 carries the map to Luke Skywalker, what are the odds of fondint the Millennium Falcon within 30 meters?And then Han Solo randomly shows up, and he has regressed into his young adult-self doing small ilegal jobs for criminal gangsters. His arc is basically doing an encore of his best moments from A New Hope (except he is fused with Obi-wan in said film, but without being a Jedi). So is the rest of the movie, except everything else gets a new name The Empire is now called First Order, Darth Vader is Kylo Ren, Rey is Luke, the Death Star is Starkiller Base. Finn is Han Solo. Poe is a blend between Leia and Wedge Antilles. And the worst character in the film, and worst stormtrooper in all Star Wars overall, is Captain Phasma, she just gives up without a fight, what a waste.Part of the problem wit the Millennium Falcon Rey pilots it  at the level of Han Solo. Despite being a rookie pilot that has never left Jakuu, and only piloted in simulations. This is why people criticize the character as too powerful (and makes Han Solo feel less necessary). So many would had been fixed had they just left Poe there to pilot the ship or at least by having Finn and Rey, find Han Solo piloting the Falcon himself (they could still have found the gangsters regardless).Poe's resurection, feels cheap and unexplained. If they really wanted to keep Oscar Isaac, as a pilot they should had said the Poe in the Resistance was his twin brother. That would had worked better, it would had been hockey in true Star Wars style, while keeping the stakes and sense of loss. (instead Poe's resurection, only foreshadows every single poorly conceived character resurection that Abrams would return in 9  Rise of Skywalker, the worst received in the film  series).Despite good new and classic actors, good VFX. It is disssapointing to see Star Wars return without a single new meaningful thing to say. This is the movie that Lucas so badly feared. He spent decades delaying it , until he could find something new to say. Then this movie comes and says nothing, reinforcing his view that it would had been a wasted of time. And that he shouldn't had sold it.Then the movie doest work on it's own because it lefts too much unexplained, who is Snoke? And where he got the money to finance an army? Why is Rey so powerful? (And then JJ Abrams ruined those answers by saying Palpatine, so it retroactively made The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, worse). The answer in The Last Jedi was far better, Kylo Ren was weak because Luke was a pacifist, so he never trained him to kill.",0
987,"The uniqueness of Star Wars is that it all comes from the mind of one, incredibly creative, kind of quirky man. Episodes 1-6 are the official Star Wars story as told by the man who created it. Any other story is, by definition, an imitation. Lucasfilm can try all they like to make these new movies look and feel like the real deal, but the truth of the matter is, they will never be the genuine article. Lucas' touch is what makes Star Wars special.",0
988,"Might as well of watched a new hope. No imagination in the story, from pretty much the same trench run to finding a Jedi on a sand planet that's poor. Wouldn't watch again. A disappointment from Disneys first attempt at the Star Wars films(not including any animated ones)",0
997,"The world building is absent and the rise of the First Order is unexplained and it defies all logic that a galactic republic wouldn't have an army. The most compelling narrative going into the movie is the ""sentience"" of the Storm Trooper but it is conveniently forgotten and the most interesting character concept is turned into a buffoon.The movie is entertaining if you do not want to rewatch it or think about what happened in the movie, so in that sense, it's better than the prequels but it fails to be a Star Wars movie.",0
998,Total failed. I thought that it would be something new and interesting... eh.. one word: Starkiller .... How it can destroy planets so fast from the static point in the galaxy!! ok SW not about real science BUT every child knows how long it takes light to reach the Earth from the other stars: hundreds of years.... ohhhh JJ and KK pls leave the star wars universe because now it's so empty and poor,0

1001,"This movie was the least enjoyable of the sequels. It was rarely bad but it was never good and far from every being great. While both of the other parts of the trilogy had moments that didn't make sense in-universe (and should have been cut), they also had moments that were rather great and actually felt like authentic Star Wars. This movie, on the other hand, had none of that, also featuring little to no original plot (most of it was taken from other Star Wars movies and a few other things), and for some reason, Rey actually felt strongest in this movie relative to other characters (and later parts don't actually fix this at all if one actually thinks about it).",0

That memory was wrong, every star wars movie all had seriously flaws. Was The first trilogy epic for the time? Yes. Is it dated and simple (not the good way) by any measure of science fiction the last 20 years? Yes. All that being said, this was a good movie.

1019,"Flashy film without substance.None of the plot follows logically the previous SW films, its obvious Disney is just rehashing the original trilogy to milk the franchise. Some solid character performances (Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, etc).Also if you know JJ Abrams and what he produces, you can imagine what this film is.JJ Abrams takes amazing franchises, like the Star Trek franchise, and makes a visually impressive film (lots of boom boom, special effects, etc) hiding what is essentially crap in terms of substance (weak plot, weak writing, etc) and ruining franchises. This is a director essentially without creative drive. He shouldn't be a director. Some call him an ""engineer"" and not a creative, which I would agree with. He ""engineers"" great packages/films, he just doesnt create anything new.In Force Awakens you have the superficial effects. Great lightsaber sounds, great lightsaber and blaster effects, great explosions, great flying sequences, etc. All better than anything Lucas made before. But hiding behind that is a crappy storyline that makes no sense, and essentially a huge spitting in the face of what Star Wars represent. It's hollywood at its finest: ""Come come B movie crowd, pay for the ticket, buy the merchandise. Doesnt matter if we produce crap as long as it sells"".My only hope is the second and third film. That they somehow salvage this giant pile of *** *** and take a minimum of artistic risk.",0
1020,"A great cast that were totally let down by the poor plotting and terrible retconning that Disney is desperately trying to do to Star Wars.  Star Wars have always been very brand aware, but this film took it to new heights. It was a rehash of the original three films, with completely irrational character motivations meaning that I can't take any of the new characters or the old ones seriously. Han Solo is so poorly written that I can imagine that J.J. Abrams basically thought ""I loved it when Harrison Ford went off-script in the original trilogy, so I'm just going to let him wing every line in this film"". John Boyega's character switches sides in a conflict because he sees his fellow stormtroopers dying for no reason, then proceeds to murder a bunch when he escapes. Then he decides to hinge his entire fate to a girl he just meets because, you know, she's a girl. Such garbage.",0
1021,"This movie is a disgrace to legacy of star wars.  Nothing original, just theme park, nostalgia,  recycling.  Also whats with Rey using the force untrained? Anakin was born from the force but didn't have the kinds of abilities she did.  So a mediocre money grab on a billion dollar brand name.",0
1022,Hoping that the next instalment can be a bit more original but this was a pretty much perfect launch pad for the next generation of Srar Wars movies. It achieves exactly what it needed to and with great aplomb. The foundations are now there for a deeper exploration of the characters and themes with Ep8. If Rian Johnson can deliver then Force Awakens will be viewed kindly by history as the introduction to these cool new characters. But Abrams definitely planted some promising seeds.,1
1023,"This movie was good. Good was not what I was anticipating, I wanted something as great as the original trilogy. So this movie was disappointing for me, but after re watching it a couple times I must admit it had a lot of good stuff going on. For starters, I'll point out the things I disliked the most. It tried to feel like the originals but it didn't, at all. The practical effects were good, but the overall tone was very different. Another problem is the fact that whenever they introduced a CGI character was way too noticeable, specially Snoke. Perhaps my biggest issue is how studied every single aspect of the movie seemed to be, it felt as it was developed by a committee instead of one person's artistic vision. Appart from all those negatives, the movie was overall enjoyable. The new characters are pretty memorable, the old ones still seem relevant and the story builds up a lot of possibilities for the new trilogy. Let's wait and see how this movie fits on the big picture of the saga. For now it gets a 7.",1

This movie is almost a complete copy paste of the original Starwars movie, from beginning to end. Completely unoriginal in everything that it attempts to do. Now for the ""Spoiler"" section. Harrison Ford returns to the Starwars franchise, but I feel he hated his role/didn't care, which really came across on screen.  Also a complete newbie in spacecraft completely schools him in how the Milliniel Falcon works because ""Reasons"". The Main villain Kylo Ren is a walking joke, he comes across as a 10 year old throwing a temper tantrum over Xbox live, he was trained by Luke Skywalker and Snoke, but somehow manages to get over powered and his a** kicked by again complete ""Newbies"" to the force/lightsabers.  I consider this movie ""Decent"", the Nostalgia factor really boosts this movies score, but once the Nostalgia is gone/ignored this movie does very little to hold it's own compared to the vast universe George Lucas originally created.",0

1045,"I enjoyed myself. The movie was competent, by today's standards, if a little tone-deaf and riddled with plot holes (albeit mostly forgivable ones). The creators appear not to have understood why the Empire was menacing in the original trilogy. It was a subtle, bureaucratic evil, teetering on the edge of total control. There's nothing subtle about the First Order. They're just evil and stupid because it's convenient for the plot. You get no sense that they are in charge, as the Empire was. They just go murder stuff until their short-term goal-of-the-day is achieved, then fly back to base and watch some more Nazi propaganda films. The film makes little effort to humanize anyone on the bad guys' team. The best we get is ""I'm not going to listen to you anymore, because I don't want to die."" I guess the dehumanization is convenient, since it would be uncomfortable for the audience to have to think about how a bunch of brainwashed children and young adults get massacred. The faceless, impenetrable, inexplicable evil of the antagonists greatly weakens the movie. I thought the new cast members were great, and I look forward to seeing them in the next ones. Their inexperience shows, but most actors need time to develop. Good things should be in store here. The script could have used a few extra days of brainstorming and focus groups before they started writing. The central McGuffin, the map, makes no sense whatsoever. You can't make a map to a person. People move. Everybody and his dog has access to a spaceship in the Star Wars universe. It's essentially a super-high-budget fan film. Good, but not great. Maybe cutting George out of the planning stage wasn't such a splendid idea after all... He seemed to have a pretty good sense of what feels Star Wars-y. You just need to keep him out of the director's chair and far, far away from the script's dialogue. Then make sure everyone on the planning team knows they are allowed, nay, encouraged, to disagree with him when he's excited about a bad idea. Bam! George Lucas gold. Let's bring him back for at least one or two of the follow-ups. I bet he could elevate their game.",1
1046,"I Felt like the main heroine had the Mother of Dragons treatment:They got everything handed down.She deserved nothing she came by, she is uninteresting until the end of the movie.The ""Force is strong in her"" is more an excuse than a reason for her to have every single ability better than everyone else.All the characters revolved around her and her actions only, every other character personalities changed or were modified to fit this one void character of heroine.Kylo Ren sucks ass.Old characters were there just to past the torch to bland awfull new characters stating ""This new guys are awesome"", but they're not.The one Stormtrooper with a melee weapon had more interesting background and things to say than the main heroine, and this trooper says just one line and appears 8 seconds in the movie.",0
1047,"IS THE FORCE AWAKENS A REMAKE OF A NEW HOPE?

Han Solo the cocky renegade with an attitude and badass pilot skills? replaced by Poe at the beginning as a seemingly retro-Han Solo successor, who crashes and dies in the first 15 minutes, but inexplicably shows up in the end, indicating he flaked and quit the most important mission in the entire movie to go chill somewhere until later.-The funny looking tiny green alien everyone loves for being the ultimate wise sage? replaced by Moz, the new yellow yoda with a vagina, hepatitis-yellow skin and dual anuses for eye-sockets who alerts everyone when Solo arrives at a cantina full of bounty hunters and a shady crowd (thousand-year old my arce) who also claims Chewbacca as her boyfriend, because interspecies lovin' is OK in this misguidedly 'progressive' movie (despite the absolute sexlessness and lack of chemistry amonst all actors). Kylo Ren, a bratty tantrum-trowing wannabe goth poseur, undisciplined and irrational a-hole with zero tactical skills (except Neo's I-can-stop-bullets-with-my-mind (but won't use the force for sh1te over the course of this movie) and also SATAN SABER) who gets nearly owned by Finn and destroyed by Rey in her first day knowing about the force and the very first instance wielding a saber. This dude removes his helmet as soon as he starts interrogating a female prisoner in a humiliating attempt to be liked or something (Imagine Darth Vader removing his helmet the first time he met Leia in Episode IV). Kylo is everything Darth Vader wasn't and apparently knew nothing about grandpa who killed Palpatine, saved the galaxy and redeemed himself to live as a ghost next to yoda and Obi Wan; he could actually be right there by his side to slap some sense into him.-And then we have new characters like Snoke as the new emperor, except this time a silly CG gollum caricature giant who turns out to be a bizarrely oversized hologram just because he looks …more evil? more menacing? who's he trying to intimidate? his pupil? Then we have Finn, the utterly dumb, useless, compulsive liar who is magically capable of light-sabering around despite being a janitor for the starkiller, who magically knows the single most important weakness of the single most important weapon the first order possesses …but dude is black and this movie is all about multi-race pandering —so he gets a pass. Phasma, the first female storm trooper who does absolutely nothing in the entire movie except being a woman and chickening out to commit the highest treason by selling out the first order in a matter of seconds and being responsible for the death of all her friends, coworkers and literally millions starkiller dwellers.-Finally we have the senile-squad. Luke cashing the easiest paycheck ever for simply frowning and looking flabbergasted for a few seconds. Leia reprising Leia, except instead of being a strong female badass is now a useless sexagenarian repeating her roll as a rebel, with the same clothes, for the same resistance that overthrew the empire and thus became the status quo/government ruling over the galaxy for the past 30 years. A shameful worthless parent who abandoned her son for no reason whatsoever. Solo as Solo, except now a laughable geriatric caricature of himself who was a war-hero by the end of the episode VI, but went back to smuggling because nothing makes sense in this turd of a movie. Best thing he did was die penetrated by his emo kid. Solo also utters the single most patronizing line in the entire script: ""Women always figure out the truth"" (you know, because this movie is so politically correct, somebody had to assert that women are naturally wise and know everything, and who better than previously badboy womanizer Han Solo).-TL;DR The force awakens featured the most boring, unimaginative, unrelatable, unlikeable and badly written characters not only of any Star Wars film but any science fiction or fantasy film ever. Everything about it reeked of fan-service and worst of all: Jar Jar Abrams raped and plundered A New Hope et al while managing to be a bland, cheap and shlocky copy in it's self-referential writing and fan boyish direction. This movie is so bad, the prequels are suddenly better!",0
1049,The Force Awakens is a return to form for Star Wars. While I never hated the prequel trilogy; the original trilogy is still the best in my eyes. The plot in the Force Awakens moves at a brisk pace. Perhaps its the pacing that hides one of the biggest underlying issues the Force Awakens has. Upon reflecting on the film you will start to wonder about some notable plot holes that aren't quite explained in the movie. This is all the more evident in that the Force Awakens follows many of the same story beats from A New Hope. The end result feels a bit copy/paste but it doesn't make it a bad film. In some ways perhaps its appropriate that it draws inspiration from a New Hope. That is ultimately what Force Awakens is for the Star Wars franchise. Its a new hope for Star Wars Fans young and old.,1
1050,"I had a feeling I won't be disappointed by this movie and I'm glad I was right.While the plot moved really fast, within the time frame of the movie, I think most of the plot elements and characters were greatly handled. I'm glad to see Star Wars back in full force. People have gotten used to hate, I suppose that feeling is easier to spread than appreciation for the effort and love that went into the movie. ( Yes Yes, I'm aware that it was about the money,bla,bla). But to be honest, I think that this movie delivered some justice and it deserves to be Episode VII. Could've it been better? Perhaps...Does the plot seem forced? A bit.Is it a bad movie? Hell no. I'm looking forward to Episode VIII.",1
1051,"An incredibly disappointing movie, I felt definitely betrayed just by watching this nostalgia-driven attempt to grab cash from an hype accumulated in more than a decade. I'm not going into details because already a lot of people explained the amount of plot holes, lack of characterisation, and in general, lack of originality. Too sad Lucas decided to sell his own creature just because it was tired of hearing fans whining – I was never one of them, but in a certain way I'm happy to see that the only creative force behind Star Wars was Lucas himself.",0
1052,"the movie was a two hour chase sequence and it ended in the same place it began - with the thing you actually wanted to see. all it did was set up sequels, and hell, maybe prequels, too. it burnt down exposition because, well, the first star wars didn't have any, and everyone hated all the excess of boring political talk in the prequels. like iron man 2 or batman v superman, it served as a 2+ hour advertisement for future movies like Skywalker's Severed Hand: A Star Wars Story.despite being a sequel, i have no idea what the hell the first order or a kylo or a snoke or anyone is or why there are a trillion stormtroopers. why the hell did luke skywalker's absence lead to a reversal in power that allowed someone to build a friggin death star? the whole rebellion and its armies of soldiers just fell sideways because one guy left? in the last movie he wasn't in charge of squat.why would someone build a death star again? why doesn't anyone in star wars have email? everything is communicated by shipping droids across the galaxy.",0
1053,"Film was watchable and entertaining from beginning to the end. It keeps the original star wars style which is quite unique The acting was good. I like the choice of actors. I been reading bad critics on this board but luckily most bad mentioned was not seen/detected by me...""..are we sometimes imagine negative aspects of the films or is this a ghost in our head cheating us this is bad this is bad..."". However film is watchable and enjoyable.",1
1054,"Force Awakens was the best movie of last year with great acting, writing and has the soul of Star Wars. This movie has the heart of Star Wars which i wanted to see. And BB-8 is the best droid ever!",1
1055,"Better than prequels and slightly better than Return of the Jedi, but this film lacks the re-watchability of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. It doesn't stick with you the way the first two films did, and the further I get away from the first time I saw it, the more things about the movie bother me--for example, Starkiller Base, and no space battles in a movie called Star Wars",1
1056,"The new trilogy excels at the level of inconsistencies, scripting facilities, in superficiality, with a deafening absence of a quality soundtrack.No captivating narration, characters little charismatic, this film brings nothing good to the universe.I have to put a bad note to alert Disney.I hope they will think about their scenario for the next longer.",0
1058,This movie is compete trash and has no doubt taken the core of star wars and beat it with a bat. The movie is a space format screw you disney,0
1060,"The new and old characters make this one of the best movies in the series. Kylo Ren is a character that wants to be like Darth Vader, and Rey doesn't want to be a Jedi, or at least didn't. Those two feel like the perfect hero and villain. The story is amazing and feels like a real Star Wars movie, and it is.",1
1061,I anticpated this movie more than almost any movie before it however it was probably the most unoriginal conservative movie ever made.  No new ideas just a remake of a new hope without calling it one.  I could make a list but it would be too long of the similarities. Also the main character Rey her skills in flying and lightsaber fighting just werent believeable she had basically no training and was able to beat kylo ren. Come on luke didnt beat vader right away he had to train and then lose to vader first. As for kylo ren he was just such a lousy bad guy so weak. The less important things were good effects etc but this movie doesnt deserve the good reviews its gotten just based on the lack of originality alone.,0
1062,"The bad, horrible, no good, dirty rotten Star Wars begins. A copy and paste modern reboot remake of the original Star Wars film, sold to us on pure nostalgia.",0
1063,"This movie isn't Star Wars.. It's Disney, It's Kathleen Kennedy's sjw garbage. It's full of dumb comedy. It felt like a bad Marvel film. The characters are terrible. Rey is boring and a Mary Sue. Kylo is a weak villain who cant beat a girl who never trained.. The first scene he was in got destroyed by the dumb dialogue. Poe killed the mood of the scene when talking to Kylo. ""Who talks first?"" I have an idea.. How about neither.. Finn is another annoying character. His character is lame and meant for comic relief. I don't want comic relief in a Star Wars movie. This isn't a Marvel film Disney! So much other stuff I hate but in order to say I would have to watch the movie again. And I'm not doing that. This is what I would've done. I would've made Kylo actually intimidating and good at fighting. The scene with Poe would end with the death of Poe. My version of Kylo wouldn't mess around. He would kill on the spot. I would make a very dark movie. Rey would fight Kylo on Mustafar. The same lava planet Anakin fought Obi Wan. Rey being untrained would lose and suffer bad injuries. She would have a arm cut off just like Luke and Anakin. Kylo would try to convince her to join the dark side. She refuses in pain. He hits her with force lightning. But force ghost Anakin appears to protect his granddaughter. He reflects the force lightning back at Kylo. And he creates a hole in the force that transports Rey to Luke. Luke is now with her and gives her his mechanical arm. He tells her who she is. The End",0
1064,It's A New Hope all over again. I don't know exactly why it annoys me so much but you can equate basically every character and story development with the original example from A New hope.,0
1065,Its just a rehash and reboot played safe by Disney so as to make some money. mediocre at best. It was nice to see old characters reanimated though.,0
1066,"JJ really know the way of old Star Wars and created a new world of Star Wars, but I didn't really feel the feeling when I watched old Star Wars. Old characters put breath into this film. The ending scene was like a miracle to me(but the Last Jedi broke it).",1
1067,Complete recycle of ideas from the classic trilogy with inferior plot and unlikable characters. Leaves too many questions in a very negative way unlike the classic and overall it is an complete bootleg version and therefore there is no compelling reason to watch this movie if you have the classic trilogy which is absolutely superior in every way.,0
1068,"While I had fun when I first watched it, every single time I think about this movie it gets worse and worse. In the context of the other films it makes absolutely no sense. Rey is inexplicably the most powerful force user in existence without any hint that there might be more to her than what is readily apparent.The new villains are a flanderized Empire fan-club with inexplicably more resources than the Galaxy-spanning tyranny they intend to revive. Meanwhile the New Republic is barely mentioned, seemingly powerless and only appearing once on screen when the capital is destroyed by the bad guys Planet-Sized Death Star with a big laser somehow visible from all parts of the galaxy.The characters a mixed bag with returning fan favorites underwhelming and new characters underdeveloped. All of Han Solo's development from the original trilogy completely undone with no explanation. Leia leads a supposedly Republic-backed ""Resistance"" force against the new bad guys, the First Order lead by a new totally-not-Emperor shadowy villain.The movie was not without promise though. All of its mistakes could have been undone if Episode 8 had repaired the damage done to the setting (instead of doubling down and making everything infinitely worse) The new Darth Vader -type character, Kylo Ren was an interesting concept, a villain who was unstable due to constantly comparing himself to a far greater evil he's trying to emulate. Even the First Order itself could have been very interesting if they were portrayed more as an insurgent force with the bereaucratically-entangled Republic attempting to hunt them down ineffectually.As it stands this film is just a hollow soft-reboot that undoes everything accomplished in the Original Trilogy while wearing its skin to fool people into thinking they're watching the 1977 classic again. What a wasted opportunity...",0
1069,Not a fan of the ‘mistery box’ style with an IOU where the protagonist back story should be.  Also when the film was promoted they claimed it has more diversity than the Lucas 1-6 but took its only black character and had him as a Janitor where the plot would have been more believable if he was an Architect or Engineer.  Disney will be churning one of these out per year more like how iPhone operates hence this film will be called ‘Disney 1.0’.,0
1070,Disney has China so far up their ass that they removed John Boyega from the Chinese poster. Really? Removing a black man from a movie poster Disney?Worst part? Boyega brushes it off cause he knows he wont be in the next movie if he speaks up about it.,0
1072,"A really weak movie.  Acting is good, special effects are good, plot is terrible, writing is terrible, characters are terrible.  There are plot holes every couple of minutes.  Main character is a Mary Sue - she is perfect at everything she tries in the movie, better than people who have spent years and decades training.  Just because.  Better than all the Jedi in all other movies, since she just ""got"" everything within seconds or minutes. Don't get me started on the DS3.  JJ is a moron who doesn't understand basic science - IMHO that should disqualify him from the genre of sci-fi altogether - he should not be allowed to make sci-fi movies.  If you blow up a planet at one end of the galaxy, then other planets in the galaxy won't see that for tens and hundreds of thousands of years!  Speed of light - galaxies are big! I was willing to give parts of the movie a pass right until I saw that - it makes it look like the entire movie is happening in just one solar system.  Because that's the only way other planets could be seen blowing up in anywhere near real time (even though it should have taken them minutes). Not to mention that the method of attacking the DS3 was retarded - if anyone could just fly through the shields at FTL, why not load a couple of dozen freighters with nukes and send them in on autopilot? This is besides all the smaller plot holes.  Like the main bad guy being a total weenie who couldn't defeat a regular storm trooper.  Or Phasma being useless in the extreme.  Or the weak interaction between Han and Leia.  Or the fact that with the magnitude and relative sizes of two or three stars (like what they had in the map) you could pinpoint the coordinates in seconds using a modern laptop (if not a cell phone). This movie was badly written, had a bad and nonsensical plot, major plot holes, bad character design and dialog, and was not good in general.  Despite all of their problems, prequels made FAR more sense than this movie.",0
1073,"Heavy on fanservice and nostalgia-bait, but forgets to tell a story we can actually get into. Who are the Resistance? Who is Snoke? What is Rey's story? Why did Luke disappear? This kind of teasing was really annoying in Lost (another Abrams joint) and I'm totally sick of it now.",0
1077,"it is Re-shoot of ""A new hope"" With Unknown faces and One of the SINGULARITY-hyped director (J.J Lens flare) The script is a miserable with huge plot-holes HOW did that character get off that planet and how did he even get separated from the other one in the first place. ETC. Well the CGI was better than in EP1",0
1078,"This movie is absolute disgrace to all star wars canons! And we scrapped EU for this **** Complete ripoff of fourth episode, except for being bad, very bad. New death star, new same old **** Originality is lost forever!",0

1085,"Thanks to this movie I found out that the world is crazy. This movie is not star wars at all. Its a cheap chinese copy. The movie does not expand the star wars universe nor také from the endless lore already created. This movie tries to play on the nostalgy note so hard, that it broke all strings. Sci-fi always creates amazing fairytales, but those fairytales tries at least a little bit hold one hand in reality to make yourself beleavable. But this movie is just complete mess full of nonsense. It is pure rollycoaster ride which tries to throw at you even the sink. I really dont understand how so many people can hate the prequel trilogy and adore this abomination. Prequel trilogy is a masterpiece compared to this. I do not understand that even critics gave this movie such a high score while in contrast they torn to pieces warcraft. like what???? what??? crazy this world is crazy",0
1087,"Hugely disappointing, but predictably so. By far the worst Star Wars film ever made that no serious Star Wars fan could ever enjoy. Let me just say, I am a massive Star Wars fan; not so much of the movies as most are a mess but I love the lore and the world that has been created. The movies often do not tell the story that a universe as vast as Star Wars deserve and this rubbish is no different. The first thing I noticed was the acting of the two 'newcomers' - it really is awful, not helped by a terrible script. The chap who plays Finn is particularly laughable with his supremely stupid reactions to everything that happens around him - there is a noise 'what was that?', someone comes into a room 'who just came in?' it really is ridiculous. This can in part be papered over by the fact his character has been raised as a stormtrooper and knows nothing else blah, blah, blah, but really it's just awful acting and writing. These two really were unknown for a reason. The heroine Rey, is only marginally better but again, suffers from the writing,  with her character being possibly the most stereotypical ever conceived. Angry, down on her luck etc etc and then predictably 'blossoms' throughout the movie to get behind the cause, all very tired and has been done countless times before. The 'plot', if it can even be called that,  again, is laughably bad, an almost exact copy of A New Hope but not as good. It really makes you wonder where they got the guys to write this, my guess is that they must have been 'unknowns' as well. If you hadn't seen this movie you really wouldn't believe the plot was so close to the first film - Empire creates super weapon but has plans stolen by rebels who at the end of the movie manage to exploit the weakness they found in said plans, all the while a young nobody from a backwater planet becomes a large part of the rebellion unexpectedly' - it really is the EXACT same! It also cannot be saved by the side plot involving the search for Luke Skywalker, the stolen plans revealing his location the only real difference in the stories. There is also a quite frankly, disgusting amount of fan service in the movie which I'm sure has been included just as much for the service as it has to save the writers from coming up with anything remotely original. Han and Chewie, the Falcon, a planet very closely resembling Tatooine, it all becomes a bit of a bore. Finally I come to the most irritating thing about the whole movie - the duel at the end between Rey and Kylo Ren, and it's lead up. Yes, there are lore destroying, stupid moments in other Star Wars movies (Padme's age, how easy Palpatine kills 3 Jedi, the stupidness of how Anakin becomes Vader) but this one might trump them all. Unlike any other Star Wars film or any lore, both Rey and Finn become proficient in lightsaber combat the second they pick one up! Yes, apparently no training is required, contrary to absolutely everything we've read or seen in any other Star Wars material. This is ridiculous enough, but it comes to a ludicrous head when Rey, with absolutely zero training, manages to defeat Kylo Ren, a Sith Lord trained for years in lightsaber combat. If I didn't watch it on a plane I would have walked out right there. The only good points were Kylo Ren, by a country mile the most interesting character and the one with the most potential and depth. Supreme leader Snoke, although basically playing the part of the Emperor also interested me and I'm eager to see more of them both. To sum up, I really find it hard to believe any true Star Wars fan could actually say this movie is anything but awful. A huge disappointment and basically a lore destroying, ridiculous remake of a New Hope, that, despite the special effects, is nowhere near as good.",0
1100,"There is a difference between a movie that mirrors others, and a movie that has a completely stolen and predictable plot. Watching episode 4 would be considered as much of a spoiler for episode 7 as if you were told that Han Solo dies.",0
1101,"Yo esta pelicula, cuando salió los teasers, fue como, esto no es Star Wars, esto no tiene alma, no tiene ese encanto. Pero pensaba en mis adentros, a lo mejor, es una pelicula de Star Wars decente, respeta al universo, tiene una nueva perspectiva, mas atrevida, esta JJ Abrams, que hizo dos putos peliculones como son las 2 pelis ultimas de Star Trek, tenía un material que el amaba con toda su alma. El resultado no podia ser mas....deprimente, desolador, decepcionante, viniendo de alguien que iba con las expectativas bajas. Es increible que me sienta como si hubiese muerto alguien cercano a mi, ese pequeño niño agradable que conociste en el colegio, encontrarterlo muerto de sobredosis en un parque con una jeringuilla clavada en su brazo 30 años después. Vayamos por partes: Primero tenemos el guión, un guión que han cogido la estructura y situaciones episodio IV y lo calcan descaradamente. Persona especial que vive en un planeta desierto? Listo. Malos que buscan un robot con unos planos valiosos? Listo. Un Darth Vader? Listo. Una cantina? Listo. Una secuencia calcada a la secuencia final de la estrella de la muerte? Listo, Otra estrella de la muerte?.Listo Stormtroopers? Listo La fuerza? Listo. JJ es muy listo, en efecto, sabía perfectamente que esto era un refrito o un remake de la IV y lo ha ocultado muchísimo, porque sabría que los fans, se sentirian decepcionados y tanto. Una aventura epica, tan artificial, tan superficial, tan intrascendente, no interesa, no llama, no arranca. ¿Como demonios una historia de Star Wars no tiene ese gancho? tios, teneis un puto material rico, que os podeis expandir por mil cosas. La historia original enganchaba por concepto de la fuerza, la lucha del bien contra el mal cierto, aquí todo funciona a golpe de calzador, situaciones de calzador, personajes metidos con calzador, que habia momentos, que parecian Sketches de SNL, que solo faltaban los falsos gritos y aplausos, no...el fan no es imbécil, no es retrasado, que tienes que presentarlos de esas maneras tan cutres y tan artificial. La parte narrativa, es un totalmente errática, la trama avanza lentamente mientras intentan desarrollarte a unos personajes planos y algunos los desarrollan demasiado, que le quitan la gracia de las sorpresas....Hacia falta descubrir que Kylo Ren es el hijo de Han Solo a los 30-40 minutos de pelicula?o sacar de golpe a Snoke no una, ni dos sino hasta 3 veces? y encima ni contar que leches ha pasado?. Y cuentas nada, de lo que le pasó a los Jedi (otra vez) con la Nueva República? o un poco de trasfondo?...han pasado 30 años, no 2 horas después de la batalla de Endor. Los villanos, en serio, pesimamente elaborados, La Primera Orden que son? Fachas Nostalgicos con un fondo fiduciario del copón? Kylo Ren, un desgraciado llorón que le hicieron falta dos bofetones en su juventud? En serio? Y sobre las batallas, Aloys acierta y mucho. En Star Trek esos planos funcionaban, porque eran 3 naves malcontadas, pero aquí queda fatal, parecia eso un gameplay del nuevo Battlefront. Y ese humor? en serio? las clásicas tenían tantos gags? No lo creo. La conclusión a Abrams le ha pasado lo de ""Las croquetas de mi madre están ricas, pero las mías no saben igual"" porque esto no tiene alma ni encanto que tenia las de Lucas, hasta las precuelas, o que ese enano judío NO tiene alma y el señor Kasdan que le encierren en un puto asilo y que tiren la llave. PD: Creo que me sigo quedando con el Legends, al menos tiene mas coherecia.",0

1107,"I love Star Wars. I grew up watching the original trilogy on VHS, I suffered through the prequels, and I had never been more hyped for a movie than I was for The Force Awakens.Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is the single best movie going experience I have ever had. The movie lived up to and surpassed every expectation I had. Not only is this a great Star Wars movie, this is a great MOVIE that I think we will be coming back to time and time again.",1
1108,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens continues the famous tale of the Skywalker family 30 years after the original trilogy left off. It didn’t have to be good to make money, they could have just put the name Star Wars on it and would’ve easily made several hundred million dollars, but it wasn’t just good, it was amazing. The movie takes place 30 years after the explosion of the second death star. The movie lead roles are Finn and Rey who meet on a desert planet similar to Tatooine. The first order seems to have taken the place of the empire with few differences between the two. The resistance has also taken the place of the rebels, which also have many similarities. Luke is missing and both the first order and the resistance are looking for him. The two fight over the missing piece of the map that leads to Luke. The first order later reveals their death star-like star killer base that blows up the small planets the growing new republic are located on. Something that I have appreciated about the Star Wars franchise is that they bring in actors whose careers have just begun or those who have not had big enough roles to be well known (excluding the prequels). The two leads, Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) and Finn (played by John Boyega) did a superb job on their first major role. I personally like that they do this because I get tired of seeing the same faces in every movie. It’s good for the studio because it is cheaper for them to hire lesser known actors. It is also good for the actors because once they are done acting for Star Wars, the experience will likely boost their careers like it did for Harrison Ford. The movie also had a good balance of practical effects (special effects that are physically produced) and CGI (special effects created digitally using computers). An example would be how they created an actual BB-8 droid instead of adding it in later digitally. But at the same time the CGI helped add detail to the background and allows the director to add big things without having to make it themselves for a lot of money. The one thing that made the movie even somewhat bad is how much they copied from Star Wars: A New Hope. From the death star to the characters to the planets, it’s almost as if they've rebuilt the original movie but with fresh paint. Some of the characters are literally the same people. Such as Han Solo and Leia Organa. Both still play their same roles: Han is still smuggling, then he gives the main characters a ride to where they need to go and ends up helping the resistance group; and Leia being the leader of the resistance group. The balance of practical effects and CGI was great and the use of lesser known actors for the leads is awesome to me.Even with how much it copied from the first movie it is still a welcomed addition to the saga. All in all it was an excellent movie and I can't wait for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.",1
1109,Star Wars VII was just what the dictor ordered - a fun and exciting blast of a movie very much in the mold of the original movie. The best thing to come out of this is new villain Kylo Ren who i found very intruiging...his weakness and faults an unexpected twist on the Star Wars villain. Im very much looking forward to seeing where Kylo Ren goes from here. I have a feeling Rian Johnson has something special up his sleeve for episode VIII. Characters are the strong pointof this movie and all the actors are brimming with charisma. Thoroughly enjoyable.,1
1110,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a great film for newcomers to the series, but an overly familiar one for returning fans. Consistent action made for an entertaining experience from start to finish. With epic moments such as planet destruction, family betrayal, and Jedi genocide, there wasn't a dull moment. However, the film could almost be considered a remake of episode IV. The plot, the characters, and even individual scenes were so similar to the original film that the whole film felt like deja vu. There was Deathstar V2.0, R2D2 V2.0, Luke Skywalker V2.0, and even hopeless robot stroll through the desert 2.0. The new characters were decent with a variety of personalities and backstories. However, the only truely fresh character was Finn. Everyone else simply felt like past personas resurrected with a subtle twist. In the end, the movie was great fun, but nothing struck me as truly exceptional aside from the visuals and special effects.",1

1118,"There is more to Star Wars than characters, location, and special effects. There is mythos, iconic scenes and characters, symbolism, etc.  This film had none of those.  This is for Disney to milk a cash cow for all its worth. There is no explanation for anything that happens. The cinematography was amateurish. And the plot was amazingly bad. Everything is a facade, there is no DEPTH to anything or anyone. Any previous established Star Wars logic and lore is thrown to the wind for sake of 'cool stuff'. This is a poorly made, big budget fanfic.  The worst ""Star Wars"" movie I've ever seen, bar none.",0
1120,"Failed Cash In.  I created an account because when I googled this piece of garbage movie I saw it had an 81 rating. LOLOLOL. Now I realize they just show you the critics review(critics who were paid money to give a positive review I might add). Well no matter how much lipstick you put on this pig the end result is that they are killing a franchise. Disney paid 6 billion dollars for the rights to own this golden goose then proceeded to strangle it immediately. I could go on and on about the giant plotholes, or how it just rehashes the original film, or how its a bunch of pc garbage built for mass appeal and a secondary world market(China most notably being such a huge cash cow). When the end result is that it failed in all of these attempts. Its one true success was isolating itself from its core target market and die hard fans. Its reach exceeded its grasp. At the end of the day this movie ticked me and all my friends off so much that we returned all the merchandise that the stores would take back. I went to a midnight viewing with the crew, planning on taking my kids the next day. Well my kids ""were"" die hard star wars fans but I refused to take them to see this atrocity to try and rekindle their interest. Their mom could take them if she wanted to but as far as I am concerned this movie doesn't exist and neither will any of the sequels. You can spout off about how much money it grossed but when you strip mine a franchise and destroy all the good will that has been built up since 1977 in one fell swoop its hard not to make money. The damage that was done will only be seen in the poor revenue generation of the movies/merchandising/games to come. Speaking of which look at how poor the merchandising has done. The fact that there was not even a game released with it. Truly this was a failure on every level. I don't care about them pushing the inter-racial relationship the way most of my friends did, that's just modern Hollywood doing what it does. I didn't care about a strong female protagonist the way most of my friends did(I actually have all daughters so lean towards movies with these themes, but my daughters grew out of star wars at age 10 as I imagine most girls do, so who is this movie for?), and finally I don't care about the way that all the charactors instantly master everything they do. Its how unoriginal it was, how weak the charactors were in the first place, the way that episode 6 ends with a happily ever after and then 7 comes in and takes a dump on that. I mean 6 ends with them walking into the sunset. 7 comes along and says NOOOO. Han and Leia get divorced and they have a pyscho son who goes on a school shooting rampage and Luke becomes an agoraphobic recluse. If you are going to make a terrible movie. Don't drag the other fantastic films down the drain with you. That's what really irks me. They have to taint the originals with this piece of garbage by taking all that was sacred to the die hard fans and then just crap all over it.  I and most of the people I know are boycotting the rest of these films and I being such a huge fanboy have no problem with the boycott. I am one of those adults who has star wars paraphernalia all over his mancave. I will not be buying anything from these new films because I will not reward them for what they have done to such an amazing franchise. I used to love J.J. Abrahms. Now I realize that he is a terrible director who got lucky and made a few good films early in his career and has been riding that wave for waayyyyyy to long. That is very evident in his newest star trek #3",0
1124,"The force awakens is like a new hope but it doesn't copy everything. This movie has alot of action, a but too much. It is for the first hour, a fight followed by talking followed by more fighting. It's not that bad but because of the overuse of fight scenes, the lackluster 5 minutes of Captain Phasma it is realy new hope with a shine and polish.",1
1125,"Conservatives and Anti-Liberals, why do y'all blame every bad movie that features a female/homosexual/person of color lead on Liberals?  How is a movie sucking OUR fault?  Next time a **** movie with a straight white Christian male comes out, we'll blame the Conservatives. Back to the review.... This movie actually wasn't bad if judging it as a random movie; it would honestly rate a 7 out of 10 on my list.  It's mediocre considering it's a Star Wars movie though. THE BAD People saying this is a Liberal's wet dream are wrong.  This is a nightmare.  Black guy as useless comic relief who might as well be a sidekick, white woman being an OP Mary Sue (I hate weak women, but OP people in general annoy me), and a non-existent guy who's sexually is ambiguous. Finn, the black guy, only seems to be there to hush people of color up and to make the other white characters look good.  There were hardly any Asian people, which is weird because they are the majority of the world's population.  Hardly any black people, or any other people of color.  They pretty much put Finn as lead, pitiful one at that, just to say, ""there's your diversity! Now stop your yapping!""  He sucks at fighting, which is weird since he was trained at a military academy. The woman was OP, being a good pilot, using the force, kicking ass, etc; keep in mind she never had any training.  I could buy her being good at fighting, if she's all alone then those skills are required, but good at flying a ship and using the force?  I don't think so. The pilot with an ambiguous sexuality was non-existent. THE GOOD It was an engaging action movie, it didn't disappoint with the action.  It had several hilarious moments.  The characters were unique in personality, and weren't obvious copies of the characters in the previous franchise.  The effects were great, and that little robot was adorable.  It came out to be a solid movie in of itself.  Though I still wanted more considering that it was a Star Wars movie.",1
1128,"This is the most unispired peace of plagiarism i have ever seen! How could you come up with a Star Wars movie that is completely out of new ideas!? I felt zero excitement during the whole movie because i allways knew what will happen. Then you get the worst and most unimpressive bad guys in movie history, then cheaply kill one of the most beloved characters because the script has zero emotion and you are done with this movie!! Everything this movie does, does Episode IV even today a hundred times better, more exciting and more emotional. I loved Episode I-III because they were different and fresh in comparison to IV-VI. Star Wars was always brave, innovative and rose the bar for science fiction movies. The Force Awakens is just a cowardly, uninspired joke! SHAME ON YOU Abrams and Disney!",0
1129,"A deep betrayal that with infinite resources available, Disney has undone years of expanded universe. Ignored all of those collected works (from which it ought to have pulled inspiration) and instead created A New Hope again with a less plausible explanation of how we got here. I get it. I do. The books explain that the New Republic largely de-militarized and thus left the Resistence a rag-tag team of fringe fighters unequiped to identify the bigger badder death star being constructed... somewhere... and with... resources? But look. It's been 25 years since the battle of Jakku. Even if we are putting the galactic civil war on par with World War One and could therefore explain the second rise of a defeated super power in two decades, the rest of the galaxy would never, WOULD NEVER, plausibly have demilitarized as quickly as to have left a handful of ships in the hand of resistence fighters and gathered around only one system (which the starkiller promptly destroys). Never would a literal planet have had the opportunity to be constructed with all eyes on military development (especially that coming from the First Order being a remnant of the Empire). Even in WW2, historians agree the signs were all there that Germany was mounting a war time economy. Also, the other world powers were similarly still well equipped for combat arguably, even better equipped given the war time technologies like planes and radar and all that. To premise a film on blindly missing the remains of an evil war power constructing the exact same super weapon, but bigger, than before with an actual weaker flaw (just fly in and shoot some things no mega specific one in a million shot required) is insane. To see this come from Disney is inexcusable. They had the resources. They had the material. And what sucks the most is they had the actors (Rey and Finn and Kylo are all amazing). I'm writing this after the Last Jedi has come out because I had hoped that there would be some explanation. Like the StarForge (a device that could have arguably created the Starkiller base and fleet of star destroyers) could have been introduced and we could have all said oh, sure, that makes sense but no. We have this explanation that people just ignored them as the First Order became the dominant military force in the galaxy less than a century after one of the most wide spread conflicts in galactic history. I don't buy it. I wanted to like star wars. Hell I wanted to love star wars but this new series is an ambling, soulless imitation of Lucas's vision. I wish these movies had never been made and it makes me reconsider the Disney brand as a whole. There's do and do not, Disney tried. Disney Failed.",0
1131,"It's like New Hope all over again just... worse. I'm a big Star Wars fan and watching this episode made me cringe inside every 10 minutes. Story is just revamped story from New Hope, The Big Baddie - Kylo Ren - is a wuss, not even possible to compare him to Darth Vader. Do not have big expectations after this one it's just another money grab. Star Wars saga ended after episode VI and Rouge One.",0

1134,"This movie is fantastic. It introduces new characters that are written beautifly as well as the old. John Boyega (Finn) and Daisy Ridley (Rey) knock it out of the park. The new baddie Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver is a very complex interesting villain. This movie has a wonderful story even though it does seem similar to episode IV, V, and VI it doesn't take away from the enjoyment and is a great setup to the next two films in the trilogy. All the old cast does a great job and the use of practical FX are great. The only problem I have with this movie is StarKiller Base. Even though the name is awesome it's basically a third Death Star which is getting old. Also the Rathtars weren't that great but no movie is without flaws. This movie brought Star Wars back and made the old and new fans happy",1
1135,"This is a Series that was continuous from book to book, movie to movie; until this movie.  Disney decided to completely destroy everything that made this Universe.  I feel bad that we won't see the True Star Wars Universe, the Twins (Jacen and Jaina Solo), Anakin Solo and Ben Skywalker.  Yes, Ben Skywalker, the son of Luke and Mara Jade (who they also seem to have gotten rid of).  This movie literally took names and places and then just rehashed Episode 4.  I would have rather them have done the clones of Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker; or jump forward to the Yuuzhan Vong War (though many would be WAY too lost to follow it).This film will never be in my collection, nor will I buy any merchandise from this film series.  Disney needs to slap themselves and redo the whole film and just admit that they messed up.This film is on par with DragonBall: Evolution and Avatar: The Last Airbender.  Tell those fans to accept the crap movies that were made of the popular Anime and see what happens.  Disney took a popular series that didn't have any alternate universe (which was the great thing about it) and decided to slam it in the mud and keep it there.I hope they decide to fix this.  By the way, luckily my Star Wars faith was restored with Rogue One; however, if Disney keeps on the path of Ep. 7 I feel bad for the future of the franchise.",0
1136,"I couldn't take the movie seriously as hard as i tried. The soundtrack was bland, the characters were shallow and forgettable, the story was pathetic i feel sorry for you if you actually thought starkiller base wasn't laughable, but most importantly the writing in the movie was the utter worst i have seen in a movie with such budget.",0
1137,"I didn't expect much from this, and i was right. They took some things from all of the previous Star Wars movies and tried to pretend it was a completely new and unique movie, while they of course made sure it was 100 % political correct. It's such an overrated movie because really it's silly how bad both the writing and the acting is. Rey is apparently this amazing wonderchild that beats every opponent without any practice whatsoever. She defeats Kylo Ren who is a sith student basicly the first time she uses a lightsaber. The movie is dumb, i don't think i need to say much else.",0

1140,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is the seventh installment in the Star Wars film series directed by J. J. Abrams. It stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis and Domhnall Gleeson.This movie is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi and follows Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron's search for Luke Skywalker. They also fight alongside the Resistance as the galaxy faces a new threat from the evil Kylo Ren and the First Order.I really LOVED this movie and every single thing in it. Daisy Ridley is perfect as Rey in the leading role. She was really, really good and showed perfect emotion throughout. She's also awesome in the action sequences and she really sold it. John Boyega is great too, a totally stand out performance from him. Also, Oscar Isaac is very good as he is in every role he's been in so far in his acting career, he was really likable and felt like the new Han Solo. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are good too, especially in the scenes between them that were very touching and through them you felt like there was a history and remorse behind.Kylo Ren is brilliant as the main villain in the movie. Adam Driver did a wonderful job as his performance was very haunting and even tho it is not explained perfectly, I still found his backstory very interesting too. Plus the final fight with lightsabers is greatly done and the cinematography is what takes it to a whole new level.The visuals are eye popping, and I loved that they used practical effects mostly. When they used CGI characters it was noticeable but it didn't take me out of it at all. The score, composed by the legendary composer John Williams, it is as great as you'd except and very good-feel like.Unfortunately, many people have given this movie a bad review simply because of it having many throwbacks to the first original movie, as honestly it does have some plot points that do feel déjà vu here and there but then again those scenes are what make a great Star Wars movie and I am thankful that this movie brought us back to the glorious time and wiped out the bad taste of the prequels.",1
1141,"So according to the user reviews here, this is either the best film of all time or the worst film of all time. Clearly, The Force Awakens is not a great film. Equally this is very obviously not a '0 out of 10' film. These user reviews are being posted by people with agendas. If someone gives this film zero out of ten, they are not reviewing the film. They are likely EU fan devastated that Disney wiped 30 years of content off the map. To award this movie zero is a protest. Many of those awarding the movie 10 is a reaction to that. In reality, this is a good movie, not a great one. For the truth, look to the IMDB score, the Flixster score and the fact that this movie won best movie at the Empire and MTV movie awards, voted by the public. Look to the Most active user reviews on this site. Bad movies cant get to $2b box office however well they are marketed (look at BvS).The people have spoken.

1146,"Just amazing.A movie aimed at fans of canon.The plot continues the tradition of poetry , however it soon goes into its own unique direction.Every single ''plot hole'' that is mentioned online is by ''fans'' who dont read up about canon and dont understand the basics of the SW canon (not EU , canon)All the hate this movie gets is unfair.Its the best movie IMHO since ESB.I understand if some dont like it , but RoTJ was ''safe'' and a ''copy'' of ANH and yet it was seen as good.I think the hate is just a mix of ''special snowflakes'' and the ''need to hate''If you feel betrayed by StarWars being good again , then its a shameAs for details on the production : -Lighting is perfect , nothing feels fake-FX the blend of CGI and practical is amazing , however there is one exception the rathtar (it looks less impressive than the rest)-script its close to perfect with only a few lines that felt forced from lor san tekka at the start. -Plot is great deals with classic themes but goes in new directions with it-Lore the most important part of a SW production IMHO the lore is great and will show many intresting subplot for those who like to read into itMy only issues with the movie is the battle for starkiller base , I love that battle and its visuals and its subplot in genral. but the xwing battle could be removed from the plot and would not change anything.In fact apart from removing the new republic and its fleet and showing how advanced the first order is it could be removed and saved for a different movie (or be a one use only weapon)As for the hate towards the movie , most of it is pure band waggoning.Yes like all movies it has flaws , and indeed its not as good as ESB but its better than the prequels and better than ROTJ in my mind.Its not that close to ANH as remeber than in ANH the outline plot is : save the princess , kill the deathstar.However in TFA its find luke and stop the first order.Starkiller base is a subplot , the meat of the story is about luke and finding him.As for the rest of the complaints I have read a lot of them are valid of course but ignore lore and other information such as : -All the planets in TFA are close to one and another thats why it feels ''small''-The falcon was being tracked and has a unique ID , its hard to miss it-Rey is force sensetive and had to fight all her life to stay alive (and in her spare time she played a space training program she found on a downed ISD)-General hux speach is actualy realistic if you look at dictatorships and terrorist groups , something the first order is-Kylo ren is NOT a sith. the sith are gone , luke and anakin removed them. they are nothing but a shadow of that way of life , maybe they are more of a threat , maybe they are less of a threat but they are not sith-Kylo ren is not fully trainedAnyway , if you hate the movie its fine. all the power to you.If you like the movie but dont agree with me , all the power to you.I like all StarWars movies but only love 4 (V , IV , VII , R1) but I dont hate the prequels but I see the flaws in them and have done from the very start (got me a lot of hate in the day)",1
1148,"Im a 40 year old SW fan and this was pretty much exactly what i wanted - nothing particularly new (apart from maybe Kylo Ren who was a fascinating and unusual twist on the SW villain) but 100% true to the spirit of the originals.

1149,A fabulous return to everything that was great about Star Wars! This kicks things off brilliantly and most importantly with LIKEABLE CHARACTERS!

Force Awakens is a knockout that gets everything right.,1
1150,"17 months later still sucks It's almost been a year since I saw this movie and I'm still butthurt. This movie is so bad I'm going to point out why I hate it - Racism and holocaust theme. There's no doubt that Finn is a racial stereotype for a black slave in the civil war. His whole motives of running and wanting to escape and be free of the first order is loud and clear to these themes. To add to this there's a scene where Finn is whipped on the back (which should of killed him) by the big nosed emo. Also why is there a Nazi scene where that red head looks like his on drugs - Completely unoriginal. It's disappointing that they had three years to write a new story and they couldn't think of anything. There's no way this story is original so how the 'beep' is this a continuous story from Return Of The Jedi. Why not make a reboot like you did to Star Trek you lazy f*** -Terrible acting and characters. Ok the acting was bad in A New Hope but everyone was likeable in that film. I can't support any of the new characters in this film because they are either without flaws, annoying or just plain weird. Why the hell is there a weird interracial relationship between Finn and Rey? this isn't STAR TREK!! I'm sorry but this is the worst movie I've ever seen I don't understand how this got 80 on this site and I don't care about the story or what's going to happen next.",0
1152,"This movie certainly has its share of flaws, the main one being that it's plot is almost an exact mirror of Episode IV, as well as a few questionable casting choices (yes, I'm looking at you General Hux), but overall, this film made it exiting to be a Star Wars fan again. The two leads were amazing, the cinematography and special effects were spot on, and it had a few  twists and mysteries  that do a great job setting up Episode 8. Its certainly not the best Star Wars has to offer, but its still worth watching and hopefully, a bit more creativity and some better villains will make for an outstanding Episode 8.",1

1163,"When sizing up a movie like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, you have to go back to what made the original trilogy so special.  Each was an original film built on a foundation of legend any mythological archetypes.  If the stories had not been so enchanting, there would have been no merchandising juggernaut.  Return of the Jedi -- though flawed by ewoks -- was presented and ended in a terrific finale with the Emperor, Vader, and Luke followed by a mind-blowing battle sequence that is all the more technically impressive given the lack of CGI. In other words, the story came first. This is the primary sin of SW: TFA; it has no purpose other than to serve as a naked commercial for conspicuous progressive ""right-thinking"" and selling crappy toys. One of the most iconic things about the storm-troopers in A New Hope was the mechanical sameness of them.  It was better not seeing what was under their mask, and we never did unless Luke and Han were wearing the costumes.  As the Empire were naked ""Space Nazis,"" it was absurd to introduce a black stormtrooper.  Lando was a far better character that was true to thematic form and actually was consequential to the story!  All we have in Boyega's character  is a runaway ""Tom"" straight out of Huck Finn...(probably where the screenwriter got the idea.) The film simply doesn't work. Star Wars worked because it was like nothing anyone had ever seen up to that point.  This film fails because it is exactly what we have seen before, and done better to boot. Time will ultimately be unkind to this movie, and deservedly so.  It is the work of a hack.  It will pay the bills for now, but it will not stand the test of time and will be an embarrassment to an otherwise impressive trilogy.",0
1167,"As a Star Wars fan, I would sit through every one from beginning to end, no questions asked. I loved the acting to this film, the plot, and the direction in the stand alone movie was great. When it was said and done at the end, I was more underwhelmed with the experience than I was optimistic and that is why it received a 7. I was more 'meh' at the end movie than when I went into it excited, thinking I could have probably waited until a few weeks later, regardless of the spoilers. I think J.J. Abrams left me more disappointed than anything.",1
1169,I have never really been a star wars fanatic but I surprisingly enjoyed this film. There is a fair amount of action that at times keeps you on the edge of your seat.  There is both the classic characters as well as a host of new characters that I think works well. I wouldn't go as far as saying this is one of the best films I have ever seen but I would recommend this film. This might sound obvious to some but I would recommend watching past star war films in order to get this one. Overall a good film but not in my all time top 10.,1
1170,"I loved the Star Wars films when I was a kid. You know, the real ones, the first ones: Phantom Menace... Got you! Well, probably not. After the sequence of contrivances kicked off by The Phantom Menace, I had no hope - new or otherwise - that this film would be worth watching. DIGRESSIONS! It turned out that the stormtroopers were all Boba Fett clones because everybody loved Boba Fett - I mean, for ligitimate plot reasons. It also turned out that 500 Jedi all got exterminated at one Jedi meeting of Jedis because they all needed to be nearly extinct for episode IV - it made complete sense: one Jedi can normally destroy 500 robots on his own (or her own) (or robot own), but as we know, a Jedi's strength is inversely proportional to the number of Jedi around him, therefore, 500 robots cannot destroy one Jedi but can easily despatch 500 Jedi together, within a few minutes. Turns out, as well, that Darth Vader could fly over lava, and did just so for a scene that went on for at least three hours, until he got low blood sugar, the poor lad, and then just jumped in. So it made perfect sense that he had no legs and a special suit for episode IV, turns out. Completely irrelevant and unhelpful digressions aside, I really liked this new film. The story was pretty well-structured, the action was exciting, the cameos were great and it had plenty of funny moments. It was, however, kind of an episode IV pastiche. It was almost like they were saying: ""Hey, guys. We know the other films took too many liberties with the mythology from the originals. Don't worry. We, are basically just going to use stuff taken directly from them, and use that stuff in the same way. With extra nods to other stuff from those same movies, in case you don't think we are using that same stuff enough, or in a similar enough way. Thanks."" I really enjoyed this film and thought it was well done. I'm willing to label it a pastiche rather than a rip-off; I will give team Disney the benefit of the doubt. But it's the next film that will determine if the Star Wars magic in this film was stolen or taken directly from The Force itself.",1
1171,"Meh, it's just another generic JJ Abrams action movie, with a bunch of Millennials running around in a constant frenzy as the camera spastically twirls. Even though it's obsessed with recreating the look of the classics, it has none of the heart.

1183,"Is this Palpatines new robe?  Its been interesting to sit back and read the plethora of reviews lauding this as a cinematic masterpiece as though people are scared to deviate from the party line.  I'll say up front, its good fun as a film and a massive improvement over the prequels, a huge, star-killing improvement...but its really not in the same league as IV, V, and VI in terms of story telling. In essence, there is practically no story at all.  There is no background whatsoever to what happened after VI other than things appear to have gone galacitcally pear-shaped.  I am guessing that it was Coruscant that got blasted by the Starkiller but its not explicitly stated....nor are the origins of the First Order, their leaders, why they are not using clones, why there is a Resistance and what they are resisting (is the FO actually in charge, was the Republic in charge...is the Resistance fighting the Republic or someone else?). Then we get onto the need to suspend disbelief in all known laws of physics and human behaviour; now I know SW is not known for worrying about these trivialities, but seriously - the Rebel, I mean Resistance, base could tell instantly that Coruscant(?) had been destroyed...and never mind Rei seeing the Starkillers blast in the sky of whatever planet she was on (seriously, I've forgotten already).  We also have to believe that bad-ass Briene, sorry I mean Capt Phasma, would lower the shields to the entire planet without putting up the slightest hint of resistance thus allowing about 12 (probably fewer) x-wings to destroy the whole place after only setting off 10 mins earlier?  And that every storm trooper in the galaxy personally knows Fin is a traitor?  Small world indeed.  There are many more examples of this, but you get the picture. People criticized Lucas a lot for the prequels and rightly so; they were dreadful on every level.  But put those to one side, and how many 40 year olds today spent....basically there whole lives quoting star wars lines....I dont recall a single quote-worthy line from this film and that is one of the big let-downs, its all spectacle and no substance.  The baddies are particularly wimpy, with Supreme Leader Snoke looking very digital and comical in appearance....Palpatine would use him as a pinata. Having said all that, I did enjoy it.  I will get the blue-ray collectors edition when its out, I have a BB-8 rolling around on my desk, Santa will be delivering several SW toys to my kids this year.....and I can't say this enough, its a MONUMENTAL improvement over the prequels; the return to physical environments instead of the sterile, digital worlds we saw last time has an imeasurable impact on what we experience and the assembled cast all excel except possibly for Kylo Ren who really needs to man-up a bit more. If its done one thing its re-affirmed just how amazing IV, V, and VI were in their day and although its left me feeling fairly entertained, its also left me feeling more than a little bit let down in terms of what it could have been if just a little bit more time was spent on the script and a little bit less time spent on hype.",1
1184,"It's a recycled plot from episode IV and the first half of episode V, the use of a Mary Sue character, filling the feminist agenda, lame dark side counterpart, cheap jokes from the secondary character called Finn.Just a money grabbing movie, an excuse to eat pop corn and a soda.",0

Instead they gave us the story of Episode IV again.They were just trying to play on nostalgia and hoped it would get the votes...well it did. It got a lot of votes.I, for one, would have preferred a more original approach.The action was great and there were some awesome moments, but the plot parts that weren't exactly that of ep IV were just so predictable.I'd score it lower if it weren't for the actors that did such great jobs.",0
1190,"Entertaining, but woefully bad. Bad scriptwriting, cheesy and hammy. every cliche in the book was thrown at this NON Lucas re-hash. It really is a tragedy, and a ludicrous one with characters that were instantly forgettable, in a style of a cheap US sitcom. Let's face it, the stormtroopers in the beginning set the stage, more like stormpoopers out of a fan exhibition at a convention. The only good thing was the ending, and I can't help but feel a slower film paced, gritty approach would have been far better, you never really get to know any of the new characters as we did in the original films, jj abrams doesn't have what it takes give it to David Twoohy next time. TLDR; bad scriptwriting comparable to an 8 year old childbad acting by forgettable unknown actorsgenerally overall bad. I gave it a 2, because i got a laugh out of it.",0
1193,"Great fun addition to the Star Wars canon, this movie isn't breaking new ground but it achieves what it sets out to spectaculary well lays down an enticing blueprint for what's to come. Just a blast all the way.",1
1196,"This movie achieves what it needed to. It  restores faith in the franchise by returning to it's roots and sets up a compelling story for the sequels to develop. But to be fair, it doesn't aim high. It plays things very, very safe. Far too safe to ever be considered a great movie. Big chunks of the film will feel very familiar to anyone who has seen the original movie (ie.nearly everybody in the world). If your new to this, prepare to be blown away. Everyone else will likely find this satisfactory but all too familiar.",1
1197,"(Re-review) Rating - 8.0/10The Force Awakens, directed by J.J. Abrams, is a terrific return to form for the Star Wars Saga (after the prequels, that is). The film, which centers around the characters of Rey (portrayed by a fantastic Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) as the resistance tries to destroy the rising First Order, and stop them from taking full control over the galaxy. First off, the performances in the film are simply much better than the original trilogy (especially Mark Hamill in A New Hope). Each character is given their own special twist by their performers, who all fit their character's personality and charisma extremely well. We grow to care for these characters, especially Rey, who, as we learn through flashbacks, has a tragic past that she cannot let go of. Even though we learn very little about each new character, we can understand their pain, and can easily feel emotional towards them by the end of the film. Many old characters from the original trilogy, most notably Han Solo and Chewbacca, appear in the film, and even serve as main protagonists. Even though The Force Awakens is mainly centered on Rey and her journey, we get to spend some time with the older characters, which is a different approach when it comes to Star Wars in general.John Williams is back at it again with another fantastic score (as always). Its great mix between new themes and classic elements makes the film so unique when compared to the prequels (which still had fantastic music, by the way). The story and even the characters wouldn't feel the same without Williams' music. One of the biggest problems with The Force Awakens is its story. It is almost a perfect copy of A New Hope, and follows the same basic structure. Heck, they even added another Death Star (Starkiller Base)! If the film had more original story elements and plot points, it would have been a lot more interesting. It would've also helped if the characters visited some of the same planets that existed in the original trilogy, or even the prequels. The fact that the planets in the film are almost all new to the Universe makes it harder to feel connected to the story.The CGI, which makes up a large part of the film, is definitely a highlight. The magnificent action sequences, as well as the wonderful new creatures, make the film worthwhile, and help in adding that ""Star Wars Magic"". Some motion-capture characters are seemingly plastic, though, and can be distracting during some key scenes.All things considered, The Force Awakens is a great first installment in the deemed ""Sequel Trilogy"", and is sure to excite and entertain fans of the Saga and regular film-goers.",1
1198,"I don't normally review movies but here goes, the plot of this movie is explained in one sentence: Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope, the whole plot is the same as said movie, the villain (Kylo Ren) is a bland and stupid Darth Vader Rip-Off (Albeit without the scars) with a dumb as **** lightsaber, Abrams is so stupid he couldn't come up with an original storyline so he just remade Episode IV although ill give a big thumbs up to Simon Pegg's Character. The death of Han Solo was expected but handled poorly, Kylo Ren develops a new super weapon (which is just a bigger version of the Death Star) only upside to this disaster of a movie was the original cast its pretty sad when the prequel trilogy is better than this crap, do yourself a favor and save your money and don't buy this movie I did and I regret it",0
1199,"Star Wars: Episode VII was a good movie for which many mopped with that movie and that publicity so winded , but I dared and was very good, I liked the new characters , and the ancient characters, what i missed them , and scenes and special effects were incredible , pity who have not won any Academy Award, but it was very good.",1
1200,Boyega Ridley Driver and Issac elevate this movie it goes to show how far a bit of charisma can go JJ Abrams shows his gift for casting once again.  Good movie I think history will be kind to this because this introduced these brilliant characters.,1
1202,"The poverty, insult the entire series !!!J.J. Abrams  - remove Star Trek, it's better to get you ((((Where Richard Marquand, why he did not shoot a sequel!?!?!Studio as always regretted money!?!?Here, I received full gov..no rather than a continuation !!",0
1203,"The technical side is really made great, it's up to date for todays movies but the rest....Watch once, nice entertainment for the evening, and then it's done! Sorry Mr. Abrams, but your Star Trek Movies are much more better and worth re-watching them! My Opinion as a SciFi-Fan.",1
1204,I go to the movies to be entertained and I was entertained.  Introducing new characters and mixing in the old ones bring back a bit of nostalgia.  Popcorn movie at its finest.,1
1205,"After the long, long wait, I honestly expected JJ Abraham's entry in the legendary science-fiction series to be a bit like Halo 4 - good game, but not a true Halo in the sense of atmosphere & that big presence you feel when playing. But this sci-fi blockbuster NAILED the atmosphere. The sheer nostalgia I felt at the end(which I won't mention any specific bits of, since if you're reading this you probably haven't seen the film) made me remember my childhood, watching Episode V over and over & playing with toy lightsabres and OH MY GOD, so much nostalgia. While I was upset by the death of a certain someone, the villain made up for it. He had something I'd never seen before in a bad guy - being torn apart & slowly driven insane by the dark and the light. Now I only have to wait until 2017 for Episode VIII..... dammit.",1
1206,"Outstanding return to form and the best SW movie since Empire, the Force Awakens gets the franchise back to its roots and back in the public consciousness. Whether Disney can maintain quality control with a film each year is another matter entirely.",1
1207,"Im a massive Star Wars fan and this totally hit the mark for me. In fact im not ashamed to say that i like the prequels they have lots of good bits on them but this had a better story and characters and felt more like Star Wars should than those prequels did. The Force Awakens gets back to basics and delivers 100%. The action is well directed its exciting and fast moving, and the dialogue is emotional and funny. The best movie of last year.",1
1208,"A bad remake of ANH with a bit of ROTJ thrown in, with plotholes big enough to drive a star destroyer through, a Mary Sue as main character and a setting destroying everthing gained in the original trilogy.",0
1209,"Unfortunately for all of us, Star Wars has always been a franchise with more promise (enormous galaxy with ridiculous amount of races and cultures, a central concept tying it together) than the actual ability to execute it. The prequels are rightly maligned for their utter mismanaging of the series' tone in their attempts to be ""child-friendly"", as well as poor performances, often horrific dialogue and the way literally every single ""exciting"" action scene in them was utterly fake, which had less to do with the weak CGI then the utter ridiculousness of every action on screen (Coruscant chase in Attack of the Clones being the primary example). However, many of the same problems were also present in Revenge of the Sith, a fact remembered less often than it deserves. Sure, Vader's ultimate redemption was a great twist: sadly, everything else was simply ridiculous, and you can't escape the feeling Rebellion triumph is owed entirely to their enemies' incompetence. Ewoks are the ultimate incarnation of this, but even before that, the ease with which Stormtroopers get tricked into being captured, or indeed, their pathetic willingness to give Solo & others a chance to surrender when they are HOURS away from winning it all, is no better. Why did I just give you all of this history? It's simple: Force Awakens might now be often called a remake of New Hope, but that description is far too kind. In practice, it's far closer to a remake of Revenge of the Sith, and shares the exact same problems, coupled with weaker new cast. Finn doesn't even have his own name at first, and was trained up to be a Stormtrooper from birth. Yet, he goes from being shocked at the death of a fellow stormtrooper, to helping Poe Dameron, WHO KILLED THAT VERY SAME STORMTROOPER, escape, killing more Stormtroopers in process. Afterwards, this upbringing of his is utterly irrelevant: he never questions others' methods, and gleefully partakes in killing of those who were like him until very recently. The only catalyst for this was seeing some civilians he knew before get executed. He never thinks back on this, though, and nor does anyone care, when halfway through the film, Death Star MK III (sorry, Starkiller Base), is activated, and kills literally billions of people; everyone forgets it soon after. By the end of the film, the death toll is in the billions on one side, and millions for the other; yet the conclusion is still ""cheerful"" in a way that's utterly infuriating. In New Hope, you genuinely felt like a massive threat to Rebellion was averted at the end, and they received a lease of life. Here, though, we know this happened twice before, and there's no one to say another Death Star won't be built again, because apparently no-one learnt anything since then. It feels pointless, much like the entire movie.",0
1210,"This was a solid Star Wars movie, that perhaps works better as a soft reboot rather than a continuation of the old story. This will likely bring in lots of new fans but perhaps alienate some of the older fan base who grew up with the Expanded Universe",1
1211,"This movie is trash, but all is forgiven in Rogue One. Seriously, watch that instead! It's a crime against humanity that it is currently rated lower than this.",0
1212,"JJ did a very fine job. The movie is pleasant, filled with every kind of action sequence, from a breathtaking chase through a giant junkyard, to a very dramatic duel in a dark snowy forest, but unlike the prequels, there is heart in moving characters througout the story, in making them care about each other. A very well done piece of entertainment.",1
1213,"Good fun movie with a bit of heart and soul, totally lacking originality, plays it safe but it works. John Williams score isnt as noticeable as previous entries but a few listens and it really is very beautiful in parts.",1
1214,"Overall, it was a great watch. Highly recommended. The only issue I will always have is when Ray just randomly inherited her powers. She was never trained, but somehow overpowers Kylo Ren when the two were in the woods during winter (Fin was unconscious). Kylo is a trained Sith and Ray intercepts Kylo from summoning Luke Skywalkers light saber using the force. If Ray had a smidge of training I would be totally okay with it, but the only thing she literally has going for her at this point is Han Solo told her the Force and Luke are real, not myths.",1
1215,"Loved it! Loved all the actors (such great chemistry with Rey and Finn), loved the throwbacks to the old trilogy, thought the villain was a hoot and BB-8 is a contender for my favourite droid - no mean feat considering the awesomeness of Artoo. If i had an issue its perhaps that Artoo gets a bit short changed in this. More Artoo next time please. Other than that, a worthy sequel.",1
1216,Great fun and entirely in the spirit of Star Wars...one can see why the safe creative decisions made in this film allowed bolder choices to be made in the spin off Rogue One. An absolute delighthe from start to finish.,1
1217,A decent re-introduction to the Star Wars universe. Strong in character and humour but somewhat lacking in the story department.  But certainly a good starting point for more inventive stories to come (hopefully),1
1218,"I absolutely love Star Wars and have been a fan for as long as I can remember and sadly this film was a massive disappointment to me. Not just because it didn't live up to my hopes but because IMO it just isn't a very good film.The plot is basically plagiarised from A New Hope (young hero from a desert planet gets sucked into a conflict in which an evil super power has built a terrifying weapon with a critical weakness etc.) except that nothing in this film makes any sense. Why is the empire now a super powerful terrorist organisation? How are they so powerful with no real resources? Why is the new Republic separate from the political leaders of the Rebellion and why does it not have its own army?Why is Luke sulking in some corner of the galaxy and if he's so important, why do they just send Rae for him in the end?Why is Kylo (mopey Anakin clone) Ren so desperately trying to be evil when he clearly doesn't want to be?I could go on and on. Not only does this film completely re-write the post Emperor Star Wars epoch for no reason, it does so incredibly badly. I just don't get why they didn't simply create the screen play based on some of the amazing Star Wars novels that already cover this period in time. Don't get me wrong, the re-writing part isn't a problem in itself. I just think it was done incredibly badly.And to top it all off, the film is just riddled with teasers and cliff hangers that make you feel as if you watched half a movie, rather than a complete one.To me, The Force Awakens is the weakest film of the Star Wars series. A bad movie with lazy script writing where almost everything is tied together with convenient and unbelievable coincidences.",0
1219,Love the older Star Wars movie.  Did not care for this.  It seems like they modeled it after the original.  How about some originality folks!  My kids and I enjoy the Clone Wars series on Netflix much more than the main movies.,0
1220,"One of the worst Star Wars films ever. Boring, boring, and boring. In complete contrast to Rogue One, this has nothing that makes the other film great. The story didn't grip me in any shape or form, it has childish drawn-out scenes, the villains are pathetic (one is CGI and the lead villain is a geeky, lanky college student who cannot hold a lightsaber correctly), and there is no tension. The lead female is not particularly likeable either.Blows my mind how people have rated this so highly when, to me, it's a clearly a poorly balanced and executed film. Avoid the disappointment and watch Rogue One.",0
1221,"I feel vindicated by The Last Jedi. Some had optimistically assumed that all of the open questions left by this film were by design, but it's now clear that the mystery box was empty all along.",0
1222,"Many of the aspects of this film that annoyed some Star Wars 'fans' I actually appreciated. The familarity of the story (yet with many twists), Starkiller Base (this is what these evil types do), Kylo's weakness (a genuinely great and fascinating villain), the reveal of Luke (makes me incredibly excited to see him in action next year). There were issues that stopped the movie being great....Rey's mind trick was a step too far, the introdution of Han and Chewie was far too coincidental. But they didn't spoil the fun of this return to the magic of Star Wars.",1
1223,"Great movie....loved it as much as I love all the other Star Wars movies (prequels included). This feels more like Star Wars than the prequels, it feels like a homage to Star Wars rather than an attempt to do something new, this is what was required as the prequels didn't go down so well with many. They were different movies that tried something different, this sticks to the formula and the execution from JJ Abrams is perfect.",1
1224,"Awesome movie with great characters, action and special effects. It was also funny and sad. In fact I think I like Rey more than whiney Luke Skywalker. And Harrison Ford is at his best as Han Solo this time, after disappointment of RotJ. Carrie Fisher not do much. All in all I really loved this movie",1
1225,"I’d say this was a good movie but with faults – I’m not bothered about the usual complaints that people have about this, i.e. the similarity to A New Hope, Rey being over-powered, the new Death Star…..tbh I was fine with all that. I found the CGI monsters in the Rathtar scenes to be jarring, although I thought the CGI Maz Kanata was handled rather well. We should have been introduced to some new fighters in the space combat sequences, even as bit part players to the X-Wings and Tie Fighters (in a similar way we saw A-Wings and B-Wings in Jedi). We should see some new environments that we haven’t seen before in a Star Wars. Other than that it’s a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and I was impressed with the casting, the acting, the visual effects and, most importantly, the replication of the Star Wars magic. The set up for the future instalments is intriguing.",1
1226,"This was one of my favourite movies of all time. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have such great chemistry it's a joy to watch, as is the chemistry with Harrison Ford and the new actors and Poe with Finn. That's why this movie is so great it feels like everyone is having a blast and the results are reflected on the screen. So much fun but also sad moments this movie has it all.",1
1227,"The Force Awakens was magnificent.  It was exactly what I wanted. You can nitpick all day but it doesn't change the fact that this movie has the heart and soul of Star Wars. And for this old fan, that's pretty much perfect.",1
1229,"This represents a return to form for the franchise and is a whole lot of fun as a standalone movie. Fun heroes we can root for and an interesting villain, topped off with a beautiful John Williams score and some gorgeous visuals. Very much in the spirit of the Star Wars I grew up with",1

1236,"O despertar das forças é um filme que tenta obviamente trazer Star Wars de novo aos grandes palcos do cinema. Trazendo 2 icones das antigas sagas, onde Vader volta na pele de um moço e Luke na pele de uma rapariga o filme é carismático e bem construído e traz momentos de excelência em relação aos efeitos especiais. Gostei deste regresso de Star Wars e agora é aguardar para ver o que nos traz os proximos filmes.",1

1238,"A rehash of episode 4. It ads nothing worthwhile to the canon and it’s an insult to the expanded universe. The force awakens stretched the lore in an unnatural kind of way only to make it like a new hope. It only ruined the achievements of the previous trilogy. Han, a war hero, leaves his family to become a smuggler again; Leia doesn’t get trained in the force and sits around in a basement again; Luke, instead of forming a new Jedi order, fails to train Kylo properly and let the order get destroyed by him, becoming then a hermit on some hidden planet. The empire2.0 is back and for some reason its stronger than the new republic and had the resources to build a bigger death star. And instead of a strong republic to fight the new thread we get some puny rebels. And why are they called resistance anyways? It’s also stupid that about 30 years after the formation of the new republic they lazily kill the senate just to get rid of politics. It feels to much like the original trilogy and the new fractions could easily be swapped by the rebels or empire because they are almost the same. It would be forgivable for a standalone film, but not a sequel. It hurts the entire trilogy by creating a scenario like we already have seen before.",0
1239,I enjoyed this very much. The strong point of this entry into the saga is definitely the new characters created by Abrams and Kasden – here we have characters I can see going on to become icons like those of the original trilogy. The special effects (mostly) have real weight to them and the film looks beautifully crafted. It sags a bit in the middle but finishes with a flourish.,1
1240,"This movie felt less like a separate Star Wars episode but more like an unrevealing pilot episode. It works well for television shows, but it works to a lesser extent for feature-length, big-budget, sci-fi action films. You can call the installments of a franchise 'episodes', but you can't write them like one. The characters are mostly dumb and unoriginal, and the returning players aren't used to their greatest potential. The writing in terms of the story is mostly predictable, with the biggest twists in the movie not being that revealing (I could guess pretty much all of them).However, the characters are brought up by talented actors that give charisma to their at-first boring roles. The director heightens the dull sequences of the movie and fills them with interesting shots and colors. The score brings up both the characters and the script, giving themes and memorability to otherwise bleh writing.It's good. Good enough that it is good, but good nonetheless.",1

Dennoch wird sich kaum ein Besucher Star Wars – Das Erwachen der Macht emotional nüchtern ansehen. Ist aber auch egal – denn J.J. Abrams’ Franchise-Fortsetzung ist gut genug, um es allen recht zu machen: Der schematische Plot geht zwar dank Disney voll auf Nummer sicher und die Charaktere bleiben eher flach, dafür macht Abrams sonst alles richtig: Dazu verzichtet er klug auf den Glossy-Lensflare-Look seines Star Trek-Reboots und macht eine audiovisuell authentische Star Wars-Ästhetik zur Basis seines extrem kurzweiligen Sci-Fi-Actionfilms. Die sympathischen Neudarsteller treffen in perfekt inszenierten Kulissen auf ihre gealterten Vorgänger – und spätestens dann sind Fans ohnehin verloren.

I think the movie will hold up and bring a sense of nostalgia years to come (which will be like a nostalgia inception type deal) because of the stellar performance from most of the cast (Carrie Fisher's performance was a little stiff being the exception) and the visuals being true to the original three Star Wars films. I docked it a point because I felt like there were too many beats taken from 'A New Hope' but it didn't detract from my enjoying the film. With so many questions left on the table I can't wait to see the next entry in the saga.",1

1262,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is the most disappointing thing since my son. Every thing in this movie looks like it was written and produced by a 10 year old. I don't evn know how to begin. The Story:Someone force sensetive lives on a desert planet where he/she meets an old man. Who they later see die later in the story by someone they knew. But we'll get to that in a second. A Droid carries highly sensetive information. The bad guys goes looking for the droid. The force sensetive character meets the droid. The bad guys goes after him/her. He/she boards the Millenium Falcon and escapes the desert planet to deliver the information the droid has to rebel bases on a forest planet. The bad guys destroyes the planet. Escapes to another plant to destroy the Superweapon. Sounds familliar? That's right, It's the same exact story has A New Hope. Only this one is full of plotholes. I'll get to that later. The Plotholes:I'm too lazy to write them down. But I probably  won't leave a Youtube link naming them all so I'll just name one. If the rebels already the plans for the Superweapon (I can't remember it's name). Then why diden't they just destroy it way before Han, Finn and Rey arrive? It doesn't make any sense. Anyways let's move on to the characters. The characters:Rey: Who is a bad characters. I mean, she learned how to fix ships, take down Siths who's spent years training with a Jedi Master. It doesn't make sense and destroys the immersionFinn: A black Stormtrooper who takes off him helmet 20 minutes into the movie. Another character who ruins the immersionPoe: A character who ""dies"" 30 minutes into the movie and comes back in the last hour of the movie. It's just confusingKylo Ren: A badly written characters who tries too hard to be Lord Vader. But he's just annoying.Captain Phasma: She could actually could have been a cool character. But she just had 5/6 lines in the entire movie and dies in the end. And you got the old characters. Who's actually interesting and aren't annoying and ruins the immersion. But I have to credit J.J for putting CGI in every scene. Atleast they aren't terrible. But even George Lucas diden't do that. And he directed 6 Star Wars movies. Now I'd like to discuss further... hold on it's a pack of angry TFA fanboys. I'll end the review here I rate TFA a 2/10 it has annoying characters, too many plotholes and the same story as A New Hope.",0

I can't believe they really did it. Apprentices who, in less than 25 minutes of the movie, become Jedi and perfect swordsmen. Excellent the music, the action scenes and the special effects, but not enough to save a movie with a poor plot and a mediocre spirit. Really really disappointed.",0

Like the other movies in the series, I won't go out of my way to watch it. There are some good action scenes I might stick around to watch, but the whole movie is, although action packed and fast paced, boring.",1
1286,"I think for what JJ Abrams and Disney had to do (which was bridge the end of a saga and introduce new characters, good and bad) they did a good job. The similarities to the 4th episode ( A New Hope) are explained in the 1 hour long ""Making of"" documentary. Some things, like the new Cantina, they felt they had to put in to make the film feel Star Wars-y. The visuals are amazing, the actors are great, and Han departs with significant emotional weight. If he had died without any sacrifice it would have felt lame. I think the movie feels like it does because it is a bridge. 8 may be the film we have always wanted....",1
1288,"The Force Awakens improves with multiple viewings. I must admit I was slightly underwhelmed the first time I saw it back in December - not enough Luke Skywalker and a over-familiar story. However since then its gained in stature and there is much to enjoy - the wonderful new characters, the old gang returning and back on form,  the well staged action scenes, the complex new villain and the use of real props, sets and droids.",1
1289,"Star Wars the Force Awakens is a horrible waste of time and money. It was made as a cash-in on what little love was left from the original episodes iv, v, and vi. All of the charm, humour, and complexity of the prequels is gone in this attempt at a revival of Star Wars. Save your money and avoid this film.",0
1290,"JJ has done it. It was the thing we all thought was impossible, but he did it. Star Wars is back! Practical effects, real sets, an amazing script, great dialogue, great cinematography, amazing music, great special effects, great action, and amazing performances from the new and old cast make this one of my favourite Star Wars movies. The Force Awakens plays it a bit safe in terms of plot structure but that is quickly forgotten once looking at how amazingly crafted the movie is. I can rest peacefully at night knowing Star Wars is in good hands. Now I just have to wait until Episode 8, it can't come soon enough.",1
1291,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is an amazing revival to the franchise that captured my imagination all those years ago and is great for the new and old generations. The story continues where the last one left off and introduces a few new characters while working them in alongside the old characters played by there original actors. The story is amazing, it's quite obvious that J.J Abrams grew up with Star Wars and it shows in this film. A lot of effort was put in to make this as good as the films from the original trilogy from the practical effects and real sets you can see how much the crew and production team at Disney care about what they are bringing up to the table. To say that I loved this movie would be an understatement as this is the best film in Disney's line up for 2015 and to say the least, it's a masterpiece!",1
1292,"commercialism + recycled, predictable, and banal storytelling. The film introduces no real emotion or connection and levies a foolish amount of shallow comic relief in moments that otherwise could have benefited from taking themselves more seriously to create some tension. Abrams filmmaking ruins everything, give us back the real star wars.",0
1294,"A silly, childish movie which isn't fit to be part of the Star Wars history. I can't believe I'm going to say this, but even the second trio was better then this. At least it had creativity and fresh ideas. This was just a sad rehash. When exiting the cinema I heard a 12 year old say to his big sister: ""A death star? Again?"" - kinda sums it up...",0

1303,"There is a clear difference between George Lucas and J.J. Abrams: while the first generated Star Wars, one of the greatest hits that popular culture experienced in the last four decades, but was sabotaged by exploring too much the commercial potential of his creation (see the expendables remastered versions of Episodes IV, V and VI, the release of the hideous animation The Clone Wars in movie theaters and, of course, the disappointing prequels, that at least counted on a good conclusion), the second is admittedly fanatical about the revolution caused by the trilogy composed of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. And just as he did in 2009 with the great Star Trek, the filmmaker turns Star Wars - Episode VII: The Force Awakens in a fabulous and emotionally rewarding experience for all audiences, highlighting the past with the same skill that faces the present and the future.... REVIEW: hqehd.blogspot.com.br/2015/12/star-wars-episodio-vii-o-despertar-da-forca-critica.htmlREVIEW: hqehd.blogspot.com.br/2015/12/star-wars-episodio-vii-o-despertar-da-forca-critica.htmlREVIEW: hqehd.blogspot.com.br/2015/12/star-wars-episodio-vii-o-despertar-da-forca-critica.html",1

1313,"Anybody that gives this movie a good review is either ignorant, unintelligent, paid by Disney, pleased by the forceful P.C. themes, or stubbornly wants to like it. Sounds harsh, right? Like other negative reviews, simply put, this is a unimaginative remake of Episode IV with a few elements of Episodes V & VI sprinkled in. The plot holes are HUGE. I could write an elaborate description of at least 10, but they are mostly covered by other negative reviews. Kylo is a disappointment as a spoiled brat, temper tantrum throwing, excuse for a villan that gets defeated easily after making an impressive entrance. Rey is a likeable person that against common sense and Star Wars mythos, gains knowledge and skill without any effort, which makes her either unlikeable, or impossible to relate to by the end of the movie. Finn is a cool dude that has an unrealistic attack of conscience, given his circumstances and history. Seeing Han and Leia was nice, but not necessary. Luke has no lines in the movie, which was a disappointment. The political ""correct"" themes are annoying, unrealistic, and untrue to the continuity of the Star Wars universe. The lack of female or minority characters in the previous films may not be excusable, but we're talking about a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, right? J.J. Abrams did well with Star Trek, but this is not Star Trek. George Lucas should have been consulted as  he wished to be.",0
1314,"I think this was a decent addition to the SW's universe but I did have some problems with it that I felt made it fall short in some ways.  First off, I loved the new characters of Poe, Rey, Kylo Ren, and Finn.  I think each of the new actors brought something fresh, there was a ton of on screen chemistry, and they were all entertaining to watch.  I absolutely loved early scene with tie fighters and I just love some of the shots JJ did with them.  Throughout the movie the practical and cgi scenes were balanced out and were executed very well.  It was great seeing the original cast as well. On to the negatives.  My negatives were pretty much with the movie having way too much in common with the original trilogy films and with  J.J. playing it safe in a lot of regards.  I understand why he does it (to avoid backlash from fans), but it didn't feel like he brought anything new to the sw universe.  Also, he had amazing action stars like Iko Uwais (Raid: Redemption) and Yayan Ruhian, and he didn't utilize them at all.  If I had those two...immediately i'm making one (or both) of them part of Kylo Ren's underlings that are hunting our new heroes or I'm putting one on each side and letting those two duke it out (they have plenty of youtube vids where they spar and choreograph fights, so you can see what these two can do and you'll understand what i'm saying).  That was a wasted opportunity.   Also, while I like Kylo i didn't feel as if he were anywhere as threatening as Vader, Maul, Thrawn, Tarkin or any other villain from any SW's work...and that's a problem (in his defense, he did do this cool force move that is pretty legit but a scary villain for me is calm, strategically superior, and who has the ability to be ruthless for a cause they believe in...a wall that cannot be climbed as easily as they made it seem).  Also, another Death Star?!?! C'mon guys...you can do better than that Sorry if I spoiled anything, I tried to avoid too many details.  This movie is definitely worth a watch.  I think people over hyped it a bit much, but it is definitely better than hearing a jar jar binks say ""Me sa help yas I will"" or a young anakin saying ""Now, this is pod racing"".",1
1316,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have ever had.  Star Wars is back!  And the hype couldn't be more real, but luckily J.J. Abrams has crafted the best Star Wars movie in 32 years.  This was easily my most anticipated film of all time, as it was for many other Star Wars fans like myself.  But watching this movie I instantly fell back into this universe and seeing all the old characters was like reuniting with old friends who have been gone a while.  But what surprised me was how much I loved all the new characters and they almost instantly felt like they belonged in Star Wars.  I loved Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, as she was truly a great heroine who might've stole the entire show.  Daisy Ridley's sweet, rough, and emotional performance has cemented her in Star Wars for me and I cannot wait to see her in the future of films.  Finn, played by John Boyega, was a fantastic new character and had a heart of gold.  John Boyega's performance had heart, humor and was overall a grand addition to this great cast of characters.  Poe Dameron was another new character that I also really loved, as he was a wisecracking badass pilot who felt similar to Han Solo in the original Star Wars.  I wish we had gotten to see more of him, but thats what sequels are for.  Oscar Isaac plays Poe and brings a great performance to the film and shows once again why he is one of the best rising stars in Hollywood.  Kylo Ren was, along with Rey, my favorite new addition to the Star Wars characters.  He was scary, mysterious, complex and he is a brilliant pressence on screen that's similar to Darth Vader.  Adam Driver does a fantastic job as the character and handling his dark and tragic character.  BB-8 was also a great new droid and I quickly loved him for his humor and personality that we learn through his interactions.  He really captures the essence of droids with how while we can't understand their language, we know exactly who they are and what they are saying.  Harrison Ford returns as the legendary Han Solo, and boy what a return it is.  Han Solo was always one of my favorite characters of all time, and watching him kick ass and make smartass comments with Chewbacca at his side made me feel like a kid again.  Ford brings everything he has to the role and I commend him for his unforgettable performance in this film.  Seeing the entire old crew back was just indescribable.  Seeing Leia, C3PO, Chewbacca, Han was like the greatest family reunion ever.  It felt like we were finally home.  J.J. Abrams has accomplished what many of us thought was the impossible, he has made Star Wars great again.  I realize many people enjoy the prequels, which is fine of course, but for me it didn't have the magic of the original trilogy.  This film captured the feel and fun of the original trilogy, without sacrificing the dark elements.  The great cinematography was also something I noticed, as it made the emotional scenes and action sequences look and feel beautiful.  Many people have said the film is very similar to the original Star Wars from 1977 and while there are definitely similarities, it still is very much its own film with its own identity. To me this was a great tribute to the original trilogy while maintaining its superb story and brilliant characters.  J.J. Abrams wanted to bring that experience back to life for both old and new generations and it paid off.  I loved this film so much.  Of course it had small flaws, which can be found in the original trilogy as well if you look hard enough, but I had the highest expectations ever for this film and as someone who has loved Star Wars all his life I can say that its the best film since Return of the Jedi all those 32 years ago.  Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an indescribable cinematic experience that was everything I wanted it to be.  It was emotional, funny, exciting, occasionally scary, and it did a perfect job at mixing the old and the new.  The wait for Episode VIII cannot come fast enough.",1
1317,"Being a star wars fan, I was a little disappointed,   the acting was good teh new actors are a fresh bit of air, but the story just sucked..  No new ground breaking here, to keep it spoiler free it looks familiar... Harrison Ford, stole the show, and it even appeared he was the pinnacle to keep this movie going, without him this rerun would not work.... I liked the revamp of star trek better, and I hope the next star wars grows some balls... It was not a waste of my time, but it also was not something I felt changed my life...  The story really sucked.. It is worth a 7 I wont be rude, but the next move better be more original.....",1
1318,"Amazing movie all round, loved pretty much everything about it - what's more it gets better each time I've watched it. Kylo Ren is a compelling villain and I'm fascinated to see where the series takes him next. The heros are worthy additions to the mythology. An easy 10/10.",1
1319,"The Force Awakens relies on cheap nostalgia, flashy and fast effects to wow the audience. The worst part is it pretends to be a Star Wars film when it damages the franchise many times worse than the prequels every did. it ruins Han, Leia, and even Luke with their actions and new occupations.The landscape of the galaxy's factions are unclear for someone who doesn't read the new books, and even then the layout of the factions doesn't make any sense and have no relevance to the previous six films.For example the First order which is basically a reformed fragment of Empire seems to have 100 times the resources then the Empire did when they are just a fragment of the Empire that was all but wiped out 29 years before. they create a planet sized super weapon that can magically suck in a star that is hundreds of millions if not billions of times bigger than it and fire it out at another solar system. This super weapon is absurd and childish where as the previous super weapons Death Star andthe Death Star II which each took at least 10 years to build and are 100 times smaller than this hollowed out planet super weapon and they (the Death Stars) had an Empire that controlled over 1,000 planets that was needed to build them. On top of all that how would this planet move to the next star? the Death Stars could move because they were much small and were space stations not planets with atmosphere's. The Resistance which is basically a cheap, illogical, rehash of the Rebels seem to have a fleet that is made up of about15 X-Wings the reason for this? cheap nostalgia and simplicity for the new bandwagon fans and in doing this it disregards all the military realism that Star Wars has always had even in the first space battle ever in Star Wars the Rebels had Y-Wings and X-Wings and at that time they were a tiny organization. At this point in the film they were trying to destroy a facility on the planet that kept the planet from imploding so just using dog fighting fighters which is what X-Wings are was stupidThe final faction is the New Republic which is just destroyed by the First Order's absurd super weapon.I felt like I was in a board room meeting with Disney and they just thought that because the prequels were not the best (but at least they are star wars story's)  and the prequels had a Republic that they should just destroy the New Republic's capital which is called Hosnian Prime so that they can fight the Resistance upon first viewing I didn't know what planet they were destroying or why or why destroying one system would make 1,000 other systems bow to the First Order as they say in the film.The Resistance and The New Republic should have been combined to form a new faction called The New Republic because the Resistance makes no sense other than the fact they wanted to make it extremely dumb down to make it more conceivable to the new bandwagon fans I guess.On top of all this the movie has no moments like when Luke looks out longingly into the sunset and you never get a chance to enjoy the John Williams score which is lacking besides a few themes.The Story is a frame for frame copy of A New Hope with bits of The Empire Strikes Back which I would have no problems with if the issues I stated in this review were addressed.The one scene that was good was Han Solo's death when his son Ben Solo now Kylo Ren kills him on the bridge in the facility that keeps the planet from imploding.Rey is a cool character but here ability to basically become a Jedi Knight in 10 minutes will be another huge disregard for the Star Wars Universe unless she was trained before and is a recreation of someone powerful from the pastFinn is a character that serves no purpose other than to tell Han who to point a gun at tell to lower the shields and takes a shot to the back from a lightsaber that would kill anyone else, overall he should have died right then.Poe isn't in the movie much he is a great pilot and has potential.Kylo Ren had some bad dialogue and took off his mask a little to early, overall he isn't very commanding, intimidating, or cool but could have been very cool, him getting hurt by Finn who is a clumsy, defective stormtrooper makes him even less intimidating.Han Solo is just as bad ass and rogue as he was in the orignal films with and addition of a wise man side, he is the one right point in this film.Overall the movie isn't much more than a quick cash grab for Disney to continue milky the Star Wars cash cow till it is dry. This is sad but true.",0
1321,"The movie is very good. But I find it kind of disappointing for a big STAR WARS fan like me ! Although, the movie rating was for me 8/10. So anyways, for those who haven't watch the movie yet, I hope you enjoy !!! BYE",1
1322,"This was an ABSOLUTE disjointed and dis-service to the Star Wars Franchise!  It completely ignored 20 years of written lore (Which Disney decided to basically make disappear) and went with the ridiculous ideas of: 1. NEW and Improved Death Star (When the original destruction was so important that they started the new calendar after it  (Year 1 AY ""After the Battle of Yavin"")  As if the New Empire miraculously found got the funds to build ANOTHER one...ridiculous 2. A untrained Force User defeating a trained Sith... And whole host of other plot-holes and hackney ideas made this one of the worst films I have ever watched.",0
1323,"Star Wars died at the moment when Lucas decided to sell them to the white slavers. Force Awakens is just pointless ripoff of previous movies. This is basically a Disney channel type of movie, with a Star Wars logo.",0

1325,"Uninspired. Just a bad remake of Star Wars 4. Only Kylo is an interesting character. All old character feel odd and old. This movie could have been named, Star Wars : The Fan service. Still, I'm giving one more point for the death of Han which is the only scene worth watching. Nice Visual but nothing more.",0
1326,"If you look past the explosions expensive cgi and the other special effects you can see that this might be the worst movie of all time, even the prequels are better. this is just an anticlimatic femenist wet dream movie. No one makes any sense and the amount of stupid **** and coincidenses that are used to make the plot go forward is absurd. Even if you like this movie you can't deny that you were taken out of the movie to say: ''what the **** a couple of times. for example. When kylo ren takes of his mask or when rey became a demigod mary sue all of the sudden.",0
1328,"JJ Abrams deserves credit for preserving much of the cinematic feel the original trilogy had. The scene composure, pacing, and special effects all capture the important feel of the star wars universe that was lacking in EP I-III. While I won't spoil the twist(s), when you sit through the movie they become fairly apparent if you're paying attention... but the effect is powerful nonetheless. I'm not afraid to admit I teared up a few times... from nostalgia, from happiness, from sadness... sometimes all at once. I think the plot could have been more original at its core, but putting that aside, it was still a triumph. The Star Wars ""nerd"" in me took issues on some of the near instant character progression (you'll see what I mean), but I think that's to be expected in today's instant gratification society I think. In the end, it is a success, it is fun, and it was great to continue the story. My hope is that this is a launching pad for the franchise, and that there will be more complicated and innovative plots in movies to  come.",1

If you think this is THE WORST FILM YOU HAVE EVER SEEN then I can only assume you have only seen a select few films. There is absolutely NOTHING here that would qualify it being remotely close to THE WORST FILM EVER. Not the acting, the plot, the SFX, the design. Its all top notch, admittedly derivative but for gods sake its FUN! Star Wars is, you know, actually meant to be fun? For those angry personas who were expciting the Vujon Ving War (or whatever the heck called) or a blue guy with a snake around his neck, remember, anger leads to hate and hate leads to SUFFERING.",1
1337,"I have been hyped before i saw this movie. I am a Star Wars fan and i love the Star Wars universe. When the intro-text began i have been close to tears of joy. Same when the old characters appeared on screen. It was just epic to see ""the old ones"" back in action. The animations are great, they get a solid 9.5/10, with a minus of 0.5 because there where just approx. five 3D Effects if you went into the 3D version of the movie -> classic 3D-scam. The sound was epic, same goes for the overall design. Dont miss this movie, its real good entertainment  ! *SPOILERs FOLLOWING* The story was a bit of a turn down for me because it is again with a, now bigger, death star, which could be destroyed if you turn its shields down and, you might guess it, destroy its powercore. Its like they just recycled this part of the story. One single person has to push one button and the multi-billion-bazillion credit Death Star is unprotected and free to destroy by one single superpilot... Kylo Ren is like a spoiled kid, trying to be darth vader. They recycled the Anakin/Darth Vader story for him. He ended similar to Anakin and maybe we will see his version of Darth Vader in the next Episode... Luke Skywalkers daughter (or not ?) made a huge cliffhanger at the end. I guess in the next episode an artificial modified half cyborg Kylo Ren will try to take revenge on the returned jedis (Luke&daughter) and Kylo Ren and his master will build a mega-ulti-giant-deathstar which could be destroyed by one single fighter while its shields are down. Nevertheless it was good action, with some funny moments and i recommend to watch it for every science fiction fan.",1
1338,"WOOOOOOHOOOOOO! The Force Awakens is the best comeback since Lazarus. Watching it now again at home and love it more each time. Acting, dialogue, action - all  top notch. THIS is what Star Wars should be about. TFA f*****g rocks!",1
1339,"Great fun. Almost feels like a Star Wars reboot of sorts, and I mean that in a more positive than negative way. Superb acting by the lead actors, plus great sound and visual design. Probably the funniest Star Wars movie to date, I actually laughed out loud quite a few times. The biggest let-down for me was the lack of innovation, J.J. Abrams seems to have realised the recipe for Star Wars magic and doesn't try to mix it up too much. The movie relies heavily on nostalgia, but thankfully not so much it would feel too overbearing.",1
1341,"After boycotting the cinema being woefully unimpressed by the trailer also after the destruction of the last Star Trek film I didn't think it could get worse, so I decided to give the rental a shot. But after watching 50 minutes, maybe I can stuggle to continue if my brain can remain intact if my remaining braincells haven't imploded. The scriptwriters have made a rat's arse out of this film. Why is this film's dialogue so offensively childish? When I was 12, I was reading Ian Flemming and Stephen King, and most 12 year olds I know today have a Harry Potter collection. So why is this film made for 6 year olds assuming that they are made out of the internet's text speech generation of today. They understand you if you give them a role model. But I suppose it wasn't made for them, it was made for every other language as well and there wasn't any specific age group. This dialogue often included OMG OMG ain't it cool, it was until you told me it wasn't. Why are you holding my hand, no take hold of my hand. Pass the tool, what tool, not that tool, I dunno what tool. I can do it, yes I can do it. We will see, we will see. A desert scavenger scrub has no need for an elegant posh accent despite of what force powers they haven't become, and that jersey accent on the other resistance fighter? Aside from the above mind numbing dialogue everywhere. It was full of really blatant errors. Why does a stroomtrooper have a mid life crisis, don't they have a chip monitoring their behaviour fitted with a killswitch preventing re-education. Why has their education included history, when isn't that was has caused him to rebel, I gree their training included combat and a base language? Why is a tie fighter auto locked, I suppose they don't trust their stormtroopers to use the disengage. The tie fighter doesn't have countermeasures, because it's lazer quest the space torpedoes. A droid does not need coddling it is a piece of metal, not a pet. The tremour put a worm in, because no sinkhole farts not even in space, maybe that was building, I didn't find out. A stroomtrooper's armour would have been fitted with a hydration system for desert warfare, not wear a leather jacket in dark fatigue instead. If your gonna share a drink with an alien cow, then you have probably got your foot in your mouth. After witnessing somebody smash up two robbers and then have your own ass kicked, why are you going to grab their hand? The knee jerk reaction from combat training when under enemy fire is to get the F out of there separately, because a double target is easier to hit. But turning off a spaceship in mid flight? Kylo smashing computers and graffiting his walls I mean seriously force grab the underling ripping the information from his brain like Vader would have done. Ask Hans about cryo stasis that is the normal protocol for tentacle monsters. There was no need for lengthy conversation if you are going to try and rob the ship. The emperor or master? We will see, we will see, of course we will see we are watching a f'ing movie. And then my brain imploded. There is probably another list if only I can remember that information from off my other braincells. This film needed credible dialogue, presenting a more thoughtful story taking some time to dive into more detail in better preparing its backgrounds. Instead of rusing from one scene into the next adding a lot of nostagila where some of it was recycled into fan fiction, but so much of it was repeated, infact many scenes seemed like a copy and paste from their previous models.",0
1343,"Before I begin, I see a lot of 0s, 1s. 2s, and 3s along with a lot of 10s. I'm sorry but no matter how you shake it, those are unjustifiable number ratings. I know that movies are subjective and we call come from different cultures and experiences, but at the same time we all know that a ham sandwich tastes better than one filled with dog poop. So, all ratings have to be within reason. With that being said this movie is a solid 7 (maybe an 8 on a good day). I'll as brief as possible. PROS:1. Felt like Star Wars.2. Entertaining and fun.3. Great acting, dialogue, scenery, special effects, pace, etc. CONS:1. Vague on the details of the situation with too many unanswered questions (ex: What happened to the Empire? Did the rebels start a new government?) You can find some of these answers in other places but you shouldn't have to..2. Another Death Star...ugghh...which wouldn't be too bad since it's extremely powerful, but it also gets destroyed in a similar fashion like the previous two.3. Captain Phasma is not only under used but a wimp that costs the first order the Starkiller base. She lowers the shield with barely any resistance. She should have fought back in that scene and the good guys had to figure out another way to lower the shields. In fact, the explosions that Han and Chewbacca could have been to destroy the shields instead of weakening the base. There you have it. It's a solid 7. Not a 10 or a 1, but a 7. Looks like the User score is pretty on par with my rating as well.",1
1344,"As a huge Star Wars fan, I enjoyed this movie. Yes it has its flaws, but Abrams managed to bring back the nostalgia while still having new faces and moving forward to future films. I get that people say it felt like a new version of A New Hope, but it still continued the story and I'm anxious for the next chapter.",1
1345,"A solid, confident start to the new saga, the Force Awakens is thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end - it drops a point for playing too safe with the story. Special mention to BB-8, the adorable ball droid that is destined to become a pop culture icon",1
1351,"I rewatched this recently, what a mess it is. So many narrative holes:- Why is the New Republic's army called ""The Resistance""?- How did the small remnant of the Empire manage to build a weapon much bigger and more powerful than the Death Star?- Who is Rey? How can she exhibit full Jedi powers just a few hours after learning that the Force exists?- Why did Luke run and hide, but leave an obnxiously coy trail of breadcrumbs to help find him?- Who is Max von Sydow and why does he have the all-important map?- Why are both sides so hot and bothered to find Luke? Yes he's a powerful Jedi, but he's still just one man, hardly the key to winning the war- What exactly happened with Luke's Jedi academy?- So Han has been looking for the Falcon for years, and then ACCIDENTALLY stumbles into it literally minutes after Rey flies it off Tatooine?- Who is Snoke? If he's an old and powerful Sith lord why have we never heard of him before?- How did Maz Kanata get Luke's lightsaber? Why does she leave it in a place where any rando can walk in and take it?- How did Poe survive the crash and escape the wreckage without leaving any tracks IN THE MIDDLE OF A DESERT? Why did he abandon Finn in doing so?- Why does fanatical soldier Captain Phasma agree to lower the Starkiller's shields just because someone waved a blaster in her face? Why would she even have the knowledge/access to be able do that singlehandedly?- Why does Daisy Ridley think ""acting"" means ""making googly eyes and letting your mouth hang open""? Why did no one teach her otherwise?In short, it's a terrible movie that leans 100% on fanservice and pandering to the cheap seats, but totally fails on its own terms. Even worse than the prequels IMO, at least they took some narrative risks and tried to expand the franchise, even if they mostly screwed it up. Disney is just cranking out safe Happy Meal corporate product, what a slap in the face to true fans of Star Wars.",0
1352,"First and foremost this is pure entertainment,  with memorable characters and a propulsive story. We are introduced to new heroes worthy of the original trilogy and a new villain who surpasses expectations.  The involvement of the old cast is sensitively handled. Familiar designs are subtly reworked. The story feels like classic Star Wars. Pretty much exactly what I wanted from this movie.",1
1353,"I don't get why people hate this movie so much. Yes, I agree, it was overhyped but I still had a lot of fun while watching this movie. In my opinion, it is the best Star Wars film ever. It was incredibly well shot, the actions scenes were spectacular, the end was tragic, the CGI was good, the story was super and the characters finally got more developement then ""Oooh, I have a double lightsaber"" Easily the best flick of 2015",1
1354,I gave it 1 instead of 0 because it is so much better than the VIII episode,0
1355,"Not much character development, a lack of drama and too fast-paced for it's own good, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is saved by the engaging action and good performances to make up for the narrative flaws.Plus i want to mention how this movie is essentially a New Hope remake, it follows the same basic structure and it feels like you have seen it already.",1
1356,"The film is cotton candy - tasty, but not filling.  This movie is an 8.25 if you look at it stand-alone and blank-out that anything else related came before it.  That said, I watched 2 trailers and saw the movie poster and wrote what I thought would be the plot  -  Sometimes I even amazing myself...Unfortunately :( If you have watched Episodes 4-6, and are a FILM connoisseur  - you will give it a 4 or lower, because of the lack of originality. IF you are a Star Wars fan and not a film connoisseur you'll give it a 9. I'll average them and call it a solid 7. The Good:-Main two characters are great - Great job by the actors.-Sound is excellent.-Opening 25 min is strong and fresh.-Mandatory ""Hidden Fortress"" sidekick BB8 is better that C3PO and equal to R2.-Han Solo continues to be a good supporting character.-Pretty locations that are not purely CGI. The Bad:- Recycled plot - Carrion birds don't pick at corpses the way this film gores itself on the plot of Episode 4, while dining on the best bits of Episode 5 and 6 too.- Missed opportunities to tell more about the state of the galaxy, 30 years since Episode 6.- A few bad edits and weird changes in depth of field.- I think could tell which scenes were filmed first with Leia, because I think she had ""acting rust"" she had to rid herself of.- A few bad choices in CGI usage...- Bad Guy is angsty; which not scary or intimidating - and his motivations are a complete mystery. (Well acted though)- Lead character is improbably good at everything - AKA Mary Sue. The Ugly:- Plot holes...- Disney corporatism.- JJ Abrams’ ability to always leave a project feeling unfinished. Final thoughts:Imagine - there was a theme park with awesome rollercoaster you visited frequently as kid.   Now, a large corporation bought out the theme park and opened up a new area of the park.  The first coaster they built they copied the designs of the coasters you loved as a kid, but scaled it down a bit and took out some the twists – leaving you to feel like it was unfinished.  Why?  Because they wanted to play it safe, because if they made it too different, they might not profit as much and not make that All Important and Singular Driving Force in their industry (as they see it) ROI. Sorry I had a lot to say...",1
1357,"We're home Chewie! J.J Abramsie dziękuje. Przywróciłeś Star warsom ich dawną chwałę.Największe wrażenie zrobiło na mnie użycie tak dużej ilości efektów specjalnych, ale nie komputerowych. około 90% kosmitów nie jest CGI (wyglądają genialnie), a co jeszcze bardziej zaskakujące - wiele sporych eksplozji nie jest efektem komputerowym. Brawo! Z pewnością Przebudzenie mocy czerpie garściami od Nowej nadziei, ale nie jest to jego wadą. Historia wydaje się być świeża dzięki nowym bohaterom. Moim zdaniem wszyscy dali z siebie wszystko i z niecierpliwością czekam na ciąg dalszy. Jest jedna rzecz, której bardzo mi brakowało. Jest to muzyka. Niestety, ale w części VII nie uświadczymy tak epickiego soundtracku jaki był w poprzednich 6 częściach. Film rekompensuje to wspaniałymi walkami i nareszcie nie sztucznie wyglądającymi walkami na miecze świetlne. Polecam każdemu, kto lubi dobre kino.",1

1359,"It has some things copied from the first trilogy , but what he did JJ Abrams with Star Wars is fantastic . The new characters will make you much pleasing (especially BB8), the action sequences, the comedy and the tragedy made ​​from classic to Star Wars. The villain is a bit queer , but looks better with his mask and his black suit. Star WarsThe Force Awankes delivers what it meets. It is not as extraordinary as episodes 4, 5 and 6, but is an excellent return to the galaxy.",1
1363,"Very average. It was exactly the same as the original story - a Death Star (but bigger and called something slightly different). The Good Guys have to get through the protective force-field, which is exactly the same story-line; a small squad of fighters have to destroy the force-field generator (which they manage to do right at the last second); the whole thing blows up, the Good Guys win, Bad Guys all dead, except one which allows a sequel.Also, they had to bring in EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER from the first movie. This is great for the actors, but felt completely artificial and unnecessary. C3P0 always was an irrelevance, and was still so in this film. Boooorrrrring bands in the bar, AGAIN. The action was good, the CGI excellent, the Bad Guys very good. Han's son was good as a Bad Guy, and I think the Supreme Leader Bad Guy is going to be very good in the next one, but I'd like to see a new story-line. This whole movie was simply a copy. Better action and CGI, but no new ideas.",0
1364,"This is mostly a copy+paste from the originals.  Another death star, older mentor dies, we find out a father/son relationship on opposite sides, droid carrying secret message, main character doesn't know about the force and lives in the desert, the list goes on.  So my biggest problem is with originality.  The second problem is the storyline.  Characters are just not developed and instead ex machina'd through situations.  I understand the desire to have a strong female lead, and I'm fine with that.  But when she has no idea of The Force early in the movie, then suddenly (and without training) can ""Jedi mind trick"" storm troopers and defeat Kylo Ren in a light saber fight, that's a little too much.  There's also no backstory to the rise of the First Order, or the New Republic.  Not that you need to spend much time on it.  For a movie that's just over 2hrs long, you could spend 15 minutes on what happened the last 30 years.  Kylo Ren is not an intimidating bad guy, and my guess is that he will be converted to the good side eventually.  Overall, it is worth seeing.  The action is great, and I look forward to seeing the next 2.",1
1365,"Star Wars The Force Awakens has enormous expectations.  There was tremendous hype with this movie from most, if not all people, across the United States and the globe.  With the recent underwhelming prequels and lackluster acting performances, my expectations were minimal at best and I was surprised to see a solid performance from J.J. Abrams and new cast of characters. The movie spends a great deal of time being (nearly) a remake of A New Hope, accept with some differences. Rey,is waiting for someone (family?) to return, which is in direct contrast to Luke, and Finn is a stormtrooper defecting from the First Order.  They meet with Han, Chewie, and other familiar faces from the episodes IV, V, VI.  Most of the plot focuses around the disappearance of Luke Skywalker.  The backstory of what actually occurs to make Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) turn to the dark side and join the Knights of Ren is one of the most intriguing aspects of this movie.  The flashback scene of Rey viewing the Knights of Ren and a young girl screaming, is most likely, if played right, may have a huge twist, comparable to the ""I am your father"" scene from V.  Looking closely, I did notice that Han and Maz may have purposefully put Rey into that place for a reason.  Hopefully, the background on Snoke, Kylo, Luke, and a younger Rey will be explained thoroughly in Episode VIII.  Some will think that Rey is a Mary Sue, but my guess is that Rey was the only survivor of the a Jedi massacre and the trauma caused Luke to erase her mind, when she was a child.  However, the abandonment could speak to something much darker. The death of Han Solo was tragic and its a shame to see that there was chemistry being developed between Harrison and John Boyega.  His death at the hands of his son was short lived and created an emotional impact.  He is stabbed and falls down a shaft, touching his son's face.  Something, tells me that Kylo's emotional instability will cause him to be replaced by Snoke, proving Han right.   For Han, this was great character development and this was a far cry from the lovable rogue performance in the original trilogy.  I suspect that his death drove Luke out of hiding and he did something to activate R2D2.  At the end of the movie, Luke looks incredibly forlorn and sad.  You can sense that he has gone through something reaaallllllyyyyy baaaadddd.  This was the same man, who thought his father was still redeemable and well this doesn't work out for Han :( Possibly, Luke  might have fought (wounded/killed) his own students that were seduced by the dark side and maybe, spared Kylo. The amount of possible scenarios, regarding this issue is what (I think) is going to make or break this new sequel trilogy. Now, with the bad.  The pacing of this movie at times felt too rushed.  Personally, I thought the pacing was better in A New Hope.   It delivers for the fans, but most of the plot are recycled from previous movies, as in (Luke=Yoda, Rey=Luke on desert planet, Starkiller=deathstar, Obi Wan=Han death, Father=son twist)...you get it.  So in some ways it isn't breaking new ground.  The plot seems to be thin at times, with so much being put in for its running time.  It does make me wonder if 10-30 years from now, we will see the same type of formula used again for the next set of sequels.  So I do hope it takes some risks with the next sequels.  My greatest fear is that Disney will milk this franchise completely dry every six months to a year. I don't know.  Han being himself for 30 years and Luke disappearing.  This seems to be a very weak plot point, but will see how this holds up in later movies. Some questions.  Who is Snoke? (Plageuis)?  Is there another above him? (A hidden Sith) Who was the screaming young girl in the flashback scene?  Why did Luke leave?  What is up with Rey?  How will the death of Han impact Leia, Luke, and lastly, Kylo (Ben).  And oh my, Kylo's temper tantrums and EMOtional angst was completely like Anakin. Overall, solid movie 7.5/10 stars.  Worth a watch.",1
1368,"Very good movie. Exciting action and funny, good graphics and easy to watch for people who aren't Star Wars fan. This will be the start of many good Star Wars movies with these actors.",1
1369,"I'm glad I waited till it came out on DVD. I knew it would stink, good reviews from critics are so meaningless these days. The writing is soooo bad. Half of its childish and the other half is all these explanatory statements to try and cover for all the crazy coincidences that drive the plot. Also, Kylo Ren is an aweful villain. He seems like he should be a character in the Office or some other cringe type comedy. He can't even win a light saber fight with a first timer? Really? It got hilariously bad at the end when the main character is learning the force on the run. Hadn't done it her whole life and then Kylo's concerned she's going to figure it all out before they can catch her. And I guess she did - she scrunches up her face, says ""oh yeah, the force"", and flys right over him winning the day! My god, how do they invest this much money with scripts this bad!? I guess with enough advertising and complacent critics.",0
1370,"Imdb review by: sonofhades""Sad but true. When the opening credits filled the screen (Episode VII... blah blah) I was already grinding my teeth because the plot sounded idiotic. Then the huge star destroyer filled the screen. The fun bit is that the star destroyer had some sort of antenna or whatever at the front and it looked liked the ship was showing the middle finger towards the viewers. I have to congratulate the film makers as that was pretty much how the film worked from that point forward. 1) A droid has important information that must be delivered to the good guys (Episode IV, anyone?) 2) so the bad guys hunt for the droid on a desert planet (IV) 3) Storm troopers raid a village, killing everyone (IV) 4) A girl is captured by the bad guys and the good guys rush to the base to the rescue. (IV) 5) The girl and the boy have a friend zone relationship through the film (Ep IV, Luke & Leia, wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are siblings in Episode IX) 6) The stormtroopers, elite soldiers of the bad guys, still can't hit a barn door. On the other hand, the good guys always hit, even when they use a weapon for the first time in their life 7) Supreme Leader Snoke = Emperor with a silly name 8) The bad guys have a magnificent new weapon that can destroy planets (Ep IV) 9) They use it to destroy a planet loyal to the rebels (IV) 10) The weapon has shields that can be destroyed by going down on the planet and disabling the shield generator (VI) 11) The epic villain wears a mask that distorts his voice (IV) and sadly, looks better with the mask on than without it. 12) The good guys can only destroy the weapon with an attack by X-Wings on the exact target (IV) 13) The X-Wings have to fly in a tight trench in order to reach their target (IV) The screen writers had absolutely no new ideas to show for their money. A bunch of monkeys could have written better dialogue. A 1st grader could have made a plot that had less holes in it. The special effects were pretty much of the same quality as in the first Star Wars movie that was released 1977. I'd expect something way better in 2015.""",0
1371,"SOME SPOILERS I went and saw this movie opening morning, and I grew up on Star Wars. The last three were okay, this movie was ten times better. The sets being real with obvious CGI, but theres no way completely around it.  The acting was great, however between Leia and Han the dialogue was weak. The entire time I watched the movie, I was looking for Luke to appear, NOPE. Once everything happened on the Starkiller base and Rey took off with Chewie, I knew Lukes appearance was brief. Which was exactly that.  Im conflicted with that  because I understand that the next couple of movies, Luke will really show up. I wish his introduction back wasn't that short. I will say that Ren is a bad ass and is extremely powerful, however Rey is a badass",1
1372,"Well i think this is gonna be kind a weird that i gave The Force Awakens only 7 out of 10 but please hear my perspective. Okay i must admit i'm not really a Star Wars fan (or Star Trek neither if you wonder) i'm just a movie maniac but i must admit Star Wars is a special franchise it's not only the franchise that huge amount of people love but it's the franchise that inspire a lot of movies today. So after i take that out of the way let's go the my thoughts of The Force Awakens i think it's a pretty good movie but great or perfect ? not really The bright site is this is probably exactly what Star Wars fan wants not only the return of franchise they love but the return of something big something Epic and J.J. Abrams definitely delivers that he proof once again that he's such a visionary director his creativity and storytelling is just so good not only that the movie epic but he just doing such a perfect job of introducing new character to the universe and make those character so interesting , without a doubt J.J. Abrams brings the old Star Wars fan know and love back and fill it with a new exciting energy like a Phoenix that came back from ashes Now here's come the dark site The Force Awakens is not perfect it's a flaws and a huge one too and that's the villain the bad guy the dark power or whatever you want to call them, while the new hero character introduce really well and so much interesting the new 'bad guy' is pretty bland repetitive and predictable which is kind a weird since J.J. latest work Star Trek Into Darkness has such an amazing villain The thing is this part hurts, not only it makes the movie kind a less interesting since the bad guy is kind a boring and predictable it's just makes a HUGE and i mean HUGE surprise not memorable as it should be which is kind a shame since this plot twisted part should really just blow me out of the window but instead i saw it coming from a mile away (especially if you always read news about future Star Wars movie from Disney) One of the main reason why the villain in The Force Awakens is in this state is because of it's actual script it's just so repetitive almost everything you saw have been done before and because of Disney plan of Future Star Wars sequel it's hurts even more since they can't really go too far in this film and that's make everything seems so simple so repetitive there's no real interesting conflict it's just Light vs Dark , Good vs Evil once again and that's like kind a let down consider J.J. Abrams is a director But in the end Star Wars: The Force Awakens still a fun popcorn movie it's a movie that you will feel like 30 minutes more than 2 hours + it's fun it's entertaining it's kind a worth your movie ticket price but unfortunately it's only do that, it's never really challenge or offer something new and that's make The Force Awakens not as memorable as it should be.",1
1374,"Good, but odd things: Very strange closeup facial shots (reveal of RN, him walking through desert, reveal of Ben, his face shown all the time).

Very strange that RN  can do Everything he tries on his first try, I don't understand why they were trying so hard on his character, but he acted well for what they gave him.Female lead was Great!, no problems what so ever.Male lead was a good comic relief that they made into a disappointing jack of all trade character (co-main character, comic relief, romantic interest, main fighter for every fight, change of heart character (too quick), Can do everything he tries thought he shouldn't be able to)Only qualms is that I wish the female lead didn't have to split so much of the movie with her side kick, the male lead RN.",1
1375,"The Force Awakens is such a great movie between the original ones and the prequels. Like the most grossing movies of this year The Force Awakens pays tribute to its original roots. Think about how Jurassic World has the same plot as the first Jurassic Park movie, so I'm not complaining about that because what I liked the most about this Star Wars sequel is that its story is the same, we know what they're looking for and what they're gonna destroy at the end, but here we see an amazing direction work by J.J. Abrams, also the acting was terrific and those things mixed worked really well. What I think that didn't work the most on the prequels was the acting, but here... hey we have the three original actors and a new ones that keep the movie fresh and classic. We still have a lot to see on the coming episodes but this a great start for a franchise that keeps moving generations of people.",1

It can't be described exactly but the moment you get this joyful feeling, you know you're in the star wars universe. With the last movie of the prequel series, the saga strayed from this feeling into another, darker tone.With the force awakens, the saga tries to restore balance to the force and successfully brings back that original star wars feeling. Thank you a thousand times, disney and JJ Abrams, for giving me the star wars fix I've been longing for too long.",1

The  scenery, camera work, and action sequences are perfectly executed, but the overall story is not how I envisioned it.  It's slightly disappointing as a person who grew up watching the originals constantly, but I understand, and can tolerate the use of tried and true gimmicks and plot lines.  I can't help but feel the same way I felt during the second and third Hobbit movies, primarily, that they need to find the balance between innovation and what works already. Hopefully the second movie can infuse some new life, since they wrapped the first one up so(probably too) neatly.",1

1380,"This was a good movie, is it mind blowing and AMAZING, no far from it. **Spoilers. Minimal** This was better than recent Starwars movies but doesn't hold a candle to the originals. It's very comical, take that as a good thing or a bad thing, there is lots of laughter throughout the movie. It feels very rushed like their juts wanted to blow through a bunch of filler to set themselves up for the next movies in the series. The originals are barely in the movie it does focus heavily on the newcomers, again which is good or bad. Leia does nothing major and has minimal lines, yet again they are blowing up a death star, this one's just a bigger. It ends on a cliffhanger that most can see coming.  Silly things like someone who's never used a lightsaber before kicking a trained sith lords ass in mere minutes annoyed some of my die hard friends. It was a beautiful movie to watch, I really did enjoy it, not being a die-hard fan, it made me laugh, it gave me action (albeit cookie-cutter space action copied from all the to other movies). Will it disappoint you? In some aspects yes, but it will still give you goosebumps, you'll still cheer when you see Chewie and Han, you'll love hearing the lightsabers again, seeing the fight scenes and some familiar faces. It's worth seeing, could have been far far worse, it's a solid Good movie.",1
1381,"**Minimal Spoiler review** This film deserves a high score strictly on the fact that there was  A LOT riding on this and JJ Abrams had to create a film that satisfies a wide number of very harsh critics. Let's face it, with a franchise like Star Wars, the fans will never be happy with a film. We can all agree that Empire is amazing, but there are still things about it which could be better. Back to this one. The Force Awakens has a lot to do. This film could easily have been 3 hours long (which may have worked) because there were so many back stories and characters to address. Throughout the film you find yourself asking a bunch of questions, mostly to do with the state of the Galaxy, First Order, Senate, etc. JJ had to ""pass the torch"" by starting with a handful of familiar characters, which needed screen time and introducing us to the protagonists to move this franchise forward. Trust me, it's an awful lot to do in 2:15 minutes plus make the movie fun and interesting. Is it annoying that there is a repetition of plot? Yes. Does it in a sense feel like a reboot of Ep. IV for a new generation? Yes. Is that OK ultimately? Yes and no. Being that the original film is coming up on 40 years of age, we've seen franchises rebooted for far less. I am sure that the OG Star Wars trilogy doesn't resonate with the Millennials as it does with my generation. JJ's approach satisfies all customers. I feel like the new characters all had an appropriate amount of depth to them to make you care for them. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters in the prequels, so this is a win, but as an older fan, I could have used something else than another ""death star"". One of my favorite things about the film, is how relatable the characters and environments are. They're no longer pristine. They eat and drink. The film has light moments as well as tender and is nowhere near the cheese-filled, buddy film, which Jedi was. All-in-all, this is a great ""re-boot"" of the franchise and it will be very curious where is goes from here now that this chapter is out of the way. This film was here solely to bring us all back into the fold and now the story may continue in a manner that some will find more pleasing.",1
1382,"Let me start of by saying I'm a fan of the extended universe as it's covered in many books and comics. I did enjoy this movie a lot, it's just solid entertainment. But I'm not happy that JJ Abrams kind of used a fix like he did in Star Trek to reboot the franchise. I feel that's what happened here and I'm not very convinced this is going in a direction I'll be happy with to see another 1000 movies of which I'm sure Disney is going to launch at us. But I'll surely give it another go with episode 8 but my expectations are lower than before watching this show.Again, it's a good movie but the deus ex machina to do what ever they want is just too much for me.",1
1383,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but i must say that i was a bit dismayed. I watched as few trailers and tv spots as i could, so that i would know as little about the story as possible, but it wouldn't have mad much of a difference. The movie seems filled up with lame small jokes, and what was great about the old movies was, that it was subtle jokes, that fit in the right places. Here, it just seems out of place, and gives the chars something unseriousness to them. The sound side was also a bit disappointing, and i cant remember a single tune, besides the original theme. At least i remember dual of the fates from E1. I so much hope that Episode VIII will be a blast, and the series doesn't seem lost totally. It would just be nice to keep the adult side of star wars alive.",1
1384,"I was expecting more from this movie, however it still did fascinate me at some parts. It isn't great but it's pretty good, I enjoyed watching it but as I said I expected much more from a Star Wars movie.",1
1385,The film is well acted with amazing visual and special effects and the acting is great. The score from John Williams isn't the best but there are some great new things from the score.,1
1386,"Okay, so maybe Force Awakens is a rehash of A New Hope, but it's a damn good one. This amazing movie is able to capture the magic of Star Wars but at the same time feel modernized as well. I won't deny that my expectations for this movie were low. After the disastrous prequel trilogy, I figured there just wouldn't be another good Star Wars movie. I was pleasently surprised by what I saw, which was a beautifully crafted masterpiece that reaches the same glory of the original trilogy. The plot was well thought out, and different enough from Ep 4 that it didn't bore me, and the characters were great. Not to mention the CGI was fantastic. Overall I was definitely more than satisfied with Force Awakens, and I can't wait for Episode 8.",1
1388,"Another killer to the original 3. Propaganda pushing trash. I really cant say much more. If you have any old core values from the times before this new age progressive ideology the world pushes now, you will despise this film.",0
1389,"Abrams brings back most of what worked with the original Lucas trilogy. There is superb action and strong performances. It was a treat to see Han & Chewie back and having a major part in the movie. The script was reasonable and there was some humour which I appreciated. There were some genuinely moving moments in relation to tensions between family loyalty and what side of the force you are on as with the previous films. Negative points: I felt that the fairly blatant portrayal of the First Order as proto-Nazis was cliched. Were there any blonde, blue eyed people on the side of the resistance? Hopefully that's not JJ Abrams ethnic animus coming through. It was ludicrous for Rey to be an expert with the lightsaber straight away. It made a mockery of all the training they supposedly undergo. Overall though I enjoyed the movie and would rate it about 7.5.",1
1390,"This was a fun movie. It brought back the star wars feeling from the original trilogy.  There were some definite plot /character issues. Spoilers below:I will just talk about my biggest issue which hurts the flow of the movie. Rey was a poor acting and looked sweaty the whole movie but the bigger problem is her character becomes a jedi essentially with 0 training and not even any knowledge of it. It's the biggest character leap I've seen in any movie. Defeating someone(Kylo) trained in the force and use of weapons their whole life the first time she turns on a light saber was ridiculous. Couple of other hings to note, general premise is a rehash of the death star plots.There are clearly some jumps in story and history that are unexplained and don't make sense to the viewer once you thin about it. it's good for an adventure movie over all.",1
1391,"SPOILERS AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THEM. People probably posted their reviews while still high on nostalgia. It wasn't bad, but I don't think it was very satisfying. It felt like a tour of memories and nostalgic nods rather than a good movie. Kylo Ren is clearly an emo kid prone to fits of rage and yet he shows no emotion or connection to Han in a pivotal scene. Han and Lea sound like actors reciting lines flatly than parents missing a lost child, that conveniently, they now want to get back. It's better than two of the three prequels. Arguably not better than Revenge of the Sith. I feel like the motivations are just as flat and unimaginative as the prequels, while keeping the focus a lot tighter. I honestly did not connect with Rey and the force came too easy to her. The movie gets too grand too fast. I feel like there was on legitimate tension because it was always rushing to a ridiculous payoff.",1
1392,"Absolutely brilliant ! I enjoyed the Force Awakens very much, mainly due to how enjoyable the characters were, although I also found the action very exciting. And great to see Harrison Ford back on form and seemingly enjoying himself again. The man's an absolute legend!",1
1393,"Fantastic continuation of the Star Wars saga with all the magic, excitement, joy, tragedy and mythology we've come to expect. JJ Abrams has crafted a perfect mix of the new and the old to rejuvenate the franchise. So excited to see what's to come from the sequel trilogy.",1
1394,"A competent movie in its own right, aside from an interesting new villain, this doesn’t really have anything new to offer the franchise. It’s essentially a well made remix of what’s gone before. This will work just fine new fans but older fans might be found wanting. Personally I found they crossed a line too far with the scene where they prepare for the attack on the Death Star (sorry, Starkiller base) which strayed much, much to close to Episode IV. The Force Awakens is okay as a starting point but things need to get more creative for Episode VIII. That movie won’t be given the benefit of the doubt like this has.",1
1397,"When this film along with a whole new trilogy was first announced, A LOT of mixed feelings ran through my mind, what with hearing J.J. Abrams would be directing, the fact that Lucasfilm and the Star Wars universe altogether was being sold to Disney, etc. I didn't find myself as near as excited as most everyone else was for this film, despite the fact that I consider myself somewhat of a big Star Wars fan. Then again, why shouldn't I have my doubts? We already got a Star Wars trilogy that nobody really cared for. And honestly, I found it incredibly difficult to believe that any new trilogy, let alone any new film for that matter, would be able to top any of the three films from the original trilogy. However, it was just this week that I finally had a change of heart after seeing all the rave reviews and great word-of-mouth this film was generating. So I went into this almost completely cold, trying as hard as humanly possible not to come across any spoilers online, in trailers, or possibly even in interviews. I figured that way it might surprise me and I might end up loving it all the more for not knowing as much. Well, all I can really say is that while I found the film rather good overall, it certainly wasn't great like I had hoped. There were things that I really loved about it, but there were also some things that really pissed me off as well. First, I loved the fact that this completely looked and felt like a Star Wars film. Once the traditional opening title sequence we've all come to know and love from every past film begins, I knew that I wouldn't be let down in terms of being fully immersed with the Star Wars universe once again. It served as great nostalgia for me and brought back the joy I experienced watching the previous films at home (of course I'm talking about the original trilogy.) Of course, I was also happy to see the return of the three original characters from the original trilogy as well. As for the many new faces, I really enjoyed most of them and their performances. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega gave great and fun performances each. It was also great to see other actors I'm familiar with, such as Oscar Issac and Domhnall Gleeson. However, the real standout of the new cast is Adam Driver's powerful and villainous performance as Kylo Ren. Some more pluses included the score from John Williams, which perfectly captured the feel of the original soundtrack, as well as the eye-popping visual effects and action. *Sigh*, now for the negatives (spoilers beyond this point.) I'm just going to come straight out with it and say that I'm beyond pissed at Han's death, not just because he died, but also because the way he died was terrible and no one even gets the chance to recover his body or hear any last words from him! It's like his character was simply just thrown away or tossed aside like a piece of trash, which is absolutely disgraceful! I also felt that it was completely unnecessary to kill him off and that it happened just for the sake of shock or drama (damn you Abrams!) Another thing that irritated me was the ending, which left me wanting much more than the meager amount that they gave us at the very end with Luke, who also felt wasted, given that he doesn't even utter a single word at the end! So overall, yes it's better than any of the prequel films by a longshot, but at the same time I was expecting bigger things from a big film like this, and the major issues that I mentioned before prevented me from loving this movie and simply enjoying it for what it was worth. As an action/sci-fi film, it was very enjoyable and fun, but as a Star Wars film, it fell somewhat short of my expectations.",1
1399,"It took a while for me to get my feelings together on this movie. Upon seeing it Saturday night, I walked out very disappointed. The rehash of the death stars, Kylo Ren getting beat so easily by Rey, The rehashing of the New Hope and Empire Strikes Back plots. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how happy I actually was with this movie. Was it the best Star Wars movie? In my opinion, No, but it did not have to be. It brought us as an audience back into this world, and allowed us to see what happened after Return of the Jedi. I still found myself disappointed with Kylo Ren. I was excited to see his character, and I loved it up until he took off the mask. and saw SNAPE?!? HAHA NO. but really i wanted to see more of a badass, like vader. I understood that he felt upset that he was not as powerful as vader and he felt the light in him. However, the movie hinted at the return of a more sinister and badass Kylo to follow, so if thats the case, then this movie was even more clever than I thought, but only time will tell. However, I still found enjoyment and I do recommend this film. I am excited to see what is next for Star Wars, J.J. did a great job and the next director will hopefully do the same. Final verdict, Solid movie and use of passing the torch to the next generation of characters, but still overhyped and a bit flawed.",1
1400,"This movie straight up rocks. It's the best movie I seen all year so much cool **** going on with lots of cool characters. Very exciting and funny to this has the Star Wars feel all over. This proves Harrison Ford has still got it this is his best role for many many years, he is cooler here than he is in Jedi. All the new actors are great too and Kylo Ren is outstanding villain, very interesting.",1
1401,"Meh wars. The real Star Wars was about imagination, sure they where using the plot  of the seven samurai then the magnificent seven also 7 main characters in the original Star Wars , but Lucas created a whole mythology around it. This , though sets looked like Star Wars and the music was ok, had no imagination, Star Wars holiday special mark 2. It was ok instead of epic",1
1402,"Bom filme , porem nao passa de um simples remake de new hope , para quem esperava um grande filme ou algo criativo esqueca , foram pelo seguro e ja consagrado enredo do longa de 77",1
1403,"Well... I am a Star Wars fan in Korea so I had the chance to watch the new film a day or so before all the friends in North America. I was absolutely thrilled when I saw the opening. It was just so nice to have another Star Wars experience in the theaters. However... I think that was pretty much it. The movie was like a blockbuster scale fan movie. It was almost a complete remake of episode 4. The hommages here and there were nice to see but some were just too blatant. The middle part was boring. Oh... and most of all, I didn't feel like I was watching a ""Star Wars"" movie. Good old characters, good old music, good old light sabers... but it was closer to another typical Hollywood SF movie. I guess it was because of the way J.J. directed it... but yeah... it was different. In a nutshell, a fair start for a new trilogy, but not so good a movie independently.",1
1405,"The film is disgustingly bad. It may seem nice at first, but only on the surface. Good casting.Good effects.Good acting.Mostly good design. Horrible plot.Horrible structure. It feels as if Asylum had written the script and controlled the cut, while everything else was done by a top notch studio.",0
1406,"THAT's how you make a Star Wars film! This movie goes a long way in healing the hurts of Episodes I-III.  The story introduces new characters that are going to be quite easy to fall in love with and re-introduces old characters that we already love.  There are both heroes and villains that we care about and a balanced and beautifully told story that does not rely on CGI effects to generate excitement.    The humorous moments are very qualified and very real -- a welcome feeling after the effects of Jar-Jar Binks and the ilk in the prequels. Disney was not afraid to include dark moments where needed, include a hard-hitting (if not completely unforeseen) twist, and leave the plot in a place where you're bouncing in your seat to know what happens next. I withhold one point for a couple of wonky/underplayed moments of dialogue and the reliance on yet another Imperial super-weapon as a plot device.  (No more ""Death Stars""...please.) If you're still hesitating -- go see it / go see it / go see it!!!  Star Wars is back!",1
1407,"A person on a desert planet who is strong with the force without knowing it, and befriends a little android who carries a secret. How did they came up with it? Remember that death star thing from earlier movies, that had an odd weak point and was destroyed? Now its even bigger!... and has an odd weak point and is destroyed. Although I didn't even notice it right away myself, episode seven takes a lot from episode four. A big change is the force now seems to be mostly a skill set that is in a person, and does not need practise or study, just awareness of it. This is a fairly lacklustre remake filled with plot holes and inconsistencies, not a new episode. Which is a shame.",0
1408,"This movie is boring ,simple,shallow and pathetic attempt of a Star Wars continuation . It wouldn't succeed even as a stand alone movie. It is made up of contradicting each ather badly stiched up events. Example: 1:Why would you show a powerful Sith apprentice only to get his ass kicked by an anorexic girl and a toilet cleaner (sorry,  sanitation trooper) :2: Why would you send two TIE fighters after the droid contaning the important map you actualy are desperate to have(it's like sending aB-52 to save a hostage in Iraq) :3: How about the Millennium Falcon been left to rust on a Scavengers planet for years and yet fully fueled and not robbed  ready to fly. I can go on for the entire duration of the movie but don't see the point.Ps. And to those who gave this insult to the real SW fans 10/10 I can only pity your boring, simple and shallow  life",0
1410,I watched this film like 2 weeks ago and forgot to give it my review. Well I'm not a Star Wars fan but I have seen the trilogy and the prequels. This film is to get yourself entertained and leave you a big smile throughout the whole film. The film is packed with action and some laughs. Kylo Ren might not be everyone's favorite but he's a good villain. Don't really have much to say but I did love the cast and the lovely characters. Kids today are sure lucky that this movie came out because it sure as hell will make them fans.,1
1411,"Okay, this is a good movie. Even though it is A New Hope, the story has some varieties. Also, the movie looks great, feels like a Star Wars movie, and the new cast is refreshing and they work well with the old cast. Overall, it's a fun watch and it definitely brought the series back. (To all the haters, think of this, then think of the prequels. It's not that bad now is it???)",1
1412,"I had so much hope.  Just like i did for the prequels. Each and every one I thought ""finally getting back to the good old days"". Always let down. Here's another one. Oh well Star Wars produced 2 good movies and a bunch of crap. Disney is not getting any more money from me and my sons for this franchise",0
1414,"it was something similar to SW4  but having  great visual effects and action(though lightsaber fight was terrible in comparison to SW3 REVENGE OF SITH) it was worth watching on big screen.......but acting,story and direction was better in prequel version of star wars (specially performances of yoda,anakin, sithlord,obi wan and many more).......prequel version has no match till date",1
1415,"The Force Awakens is third best Star Wars movie behind Pt.4 and Pt.5. This was better than Jedi in my opinion, nothing so annoying as Ewoks lol. And yes, needless to say this almost erases the memory of Pt.1-3. Kylo Ren is the interesting villain in Star Wars and the new heros will become legends like the old ones im sure",1
1416,A wonderful movie balancing both emotion and action.Fantastic movie but similarity to a new hope killed off some score.Cameos from classic Star Wars heroes but a lack of appearance of Luke Skywalker will make us 2 more years to see another one.,1
1417,"I really liked this very much, sure it wasnt the most original story okay i accept that but the characters felt original to me. And the action was exciting and overall it was a great fun movie, a total blast. This course corrects Star Wars.",1
1418,"I seriously love this movie - have watched it many times both at the cinema and at home and just live it more. Its the characters that make it.....i really cant wait to see where they go with Rey Finn Poe and mostly Kylo Ren who is a great and emotionally complex villain, so much different from what was expected. Really cant wait for Episode 8",1
1419,"Oh, boy. I just don’t know what more to say about this achievement that hasn’t already been said by literally everyone else. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens has already been hailed for restoring the franchise to its former glory, even though some still nitpick it for being too similar to A New Hope.But you know what I say about that? I don’t care if it’s similar to the very first movie. In fact, it just makes it feel all the more like an old story told a new way for a modern millennial audience. The best part is that you don’t even need to be all into the franchise in order to love it: you can be male or female, young or old, Greek or Jew, yin or yang, and you’ll laugh and cry your way to the end.The opening crawl is now as epic as ever before, not rambling on with political mumbo jumbo like the prequels did. Then it turns as intense as you’d expect when an army of technologically updated Stormtroopers from the First Order assault a base on the helpless desert planet Jakku, where a pilot from the Resistance is said to contain a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, the last of the Jedi Knights.The adorable little ball droid, BB-8, is left to keep the map safe from harm as it’s transported to the Resistance base. While he’s more of a comic-relief plot device than an actual character with fears and opinions, BB-8 adds the perfect dose of personality to make The Force Awakens the funniest of all the Star Wars features, and that’s based on cockiness, not a Gungan’s slapstick fart jokes.Now on to the rest of Jakku, we are introduced to this new planet through the female scavenger Rey, who hunts through the skeleton of a fallen Star Destroyer in search for items worth trading. Her entire four minute introduction is done without any dialogue, relying on the delicate John Williams score and views of fallen empire battle stations to establish her place in the world.Then at the heart of this barren junkyard of a planet lies a marketplace that feels like an interdimensional Morocco. While we may be too familiar already with the whole “desert planet” idea, it’s easy to see why the filmmakers are so drawn to it: the desolate landscapes add all sorts of narrative opportunities on the big screen that makes you feel like you’re there in the unkind environment.One of Rey’s relationships is with the escaped Stormtrooper seeking redemption from life with the First Order. He is named FN2187, until named “Finn” by his new friend from the Resistance. Together they are playful and deep and casual, just like best friends of the opposite sex who mutually agreed on the friend-zone. That’s not to say though that there’s a possibility of a romance between the two in future movies…Then there’s Han Solo. Yes, you heard right: Han Solo is a part of Rey’s journey against the First Order. But let me tell you, the father-like-daughter bond that they share is the heart and drive of this dark story. Who knows? Maybe future movies will reveal Han to be Rey’s father! They sure seem to be setting that up.Even though it’s been a year since this film hit theaters, I still can’t get over how awesome it all looks! It’s not afraid to get on-the-nose political with its Nazi imagery, and keeps to expressing old cultural practices as the republic of this galaxy meets its demise (Midi-Chlorians not included).Then there’s the First Order’s ultimate weapon, Starkiller Base, which is literally a much bigger third Death Star, but this time is more like a winter-forest planet than a space station. The different locations perfectly set the tone between the sand and snow and the green planet of Takodana, where the Resistance keeps their base, along with a nearby gypsy-like pirate whose castle is bustling with patrons much like in the Mos Eisley cantina. If you can just ignore a couple of weak performances and bad foreign accents, the grimy nature of the originals is as alive as ever in every part of the galaxy you’ll see here.So George, thank you for selling your work into the hands of your fans. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens will now live on in history as evidence that the fans of a franchise know how to respect their material and reinterpret it for everyone’s benefit. And best of all, this movie does not mean the end—for we now have Star Wars Episodes VIII and IX, and a Han Solo spinoff to look forward to. May the force be with us all!",1
1420,"O Despertar da Força parece familiar aos acostumados com a saga Star Wars. A estrutura narrativa desse é feita aos moldes de ""A New Hope"" de 77, coisa necessária para trazer confiança aos fãs desapontados com a fatídica trilogia Prequel.Aqui temos um filme apaixonante, cativante, decisivo e divertido. J.J Ambrams sabe com o que está lidando. A direção e os aspectos técnicos do filme são impecáveis, Os movimentos de câmera, a fotografia a trilha majestosa de John Williams...Star Wars 7 nos apresenta o melhor dos personagens (novos e velhos) com uma história familiar e muito mistério ainda a ser desvendado. E nós com certeza esteremos lá para testemunhar.",1
1421,"30 years after the defeat of Darth Vader and the Empire, Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku, finds a BB-8 droid that knows the whereabouts of the long lost Luke Skywalker. Rey, as well as a rogue stormtrooper and two smugglers, are thrown into the middle of a battle between the Resistance and the daunting legions of the First Order.",1
1422,"Not the best Star Wars movie by far, but not the worst either, so I guess it's actually reasonably good, even if that may be more because of all the questions it raises than the answers it gives. What happened after Palpatine was destroyed? The Empire sorta crumbles and is replaced by The first Order, which is basically the new Empire and the Rebels just stay the Rebels. Well, if you're going to start thinking about the movie it's only going to get worse and worse. Kylo Ren is pretty underwhelming in his role of wannabe Darth Vader. Rey is nice as she discovers her power. Wait and see whose daughter she turn out to be.",1
1423,"This is the best Star Wars film of all time! There's so much to love about this movie, it breathes fresh life into a franchise dead from the creators meddling with ""special editions"" and prequels. It full of fun, wonder, and intrigue. The look and feel is Star Wars on point, the planets, the clothing, the creatures are all great and belong. I've watched this movie so many times and every time it I am overwhelmed with joy.",1
1424,"Just missed the original trilogy in theaters by a couple of years.  I can honestly say this was the absolute best theatrical experience of my life.  This movie had the right amount of nostalgia, new characters and story line to satisfy all ages.  The writers said that they set out to ""delight"" people, and they succeeded.  I have re-watched it countless times!",1
1425,"J.J. Abrams has made a movie that left me wanting more after the credits started rolling, I am impressed!",1
1427,"A more than welcome return to the former glories of the beloved saga. What it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in spirit. A perfectly executed melding of the old with the new, the torch is passed on to a wonderfully portrayed new set of heroes who interact delightfully with our old friends.Charming and exciting, the Force Awakens is indeed a New Hope.....for the Star Wars franchise.",1
1428,"A terrific return to form, Abrams' delivers a Star Wars that's strong on character and emotion but weak on story. Kylo Ren is a splendid new villain, BB8 a work of genius and Rey and Finn heroes to get invested in. A good start.",1
1429,"The latest installment of the ""Skywalker Saga"" has rather divided its viewers' opinions but as far as I am concerned, this movie brings my favourite franchise back to life in a wonderful way.I must admit however that it is not a perfect movie. My biggest issues with it are the constant references to ""A new hope"" and obvious similarities regarding the plot. Furthermore, Supreme Leader Snoke and Maz Kanata do not look as good as the rest of the film, which was not really necessary.Now to the pros: ""The force awakens"" stuns me with nearly every single shot, thanks to a very good mixture of practical effects and CGI. The costumes are splendid, the pacing very fast and John Williams' gorgeous music adds to the nostalgic atmosphere. The best thing about TFA is, without a doubt, its characters. Rey, Finn and BB-8 certainly build the heart of this movie. Their harmony is put so well on screen and I am intrigued, how their fates will evolve in Episodes 8 & 9. And of course, seeing Han Solo and Chewbacca regain possession of their Millennium Falcon, is simply breathtaking.TFA leaves many questions and I am dying to see, how they will be answered.",1
1430,"In The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams takes viewers back to the corner of the Star Wars galaxy that they left in 1983, with great new characters and thrilling action. It's familiar territory, for better or worse. More for the better, I think. The film is facing major criticism from some for being too similar to the original movie, but it doesn't bother me all that much. It does plenty of new things as well, and execution is key.Rey is an immediately relatable protagonist, Kylo Ren is a more interesting villain than Darth Vader was in his first outing. Finn adds a layer to The Empire that wasn't there before. Returning characters are greatly utilized. I do hope the franchise goes in different directions with future sequels now that we're back into the swing of things, but The Force Awakens is still beautifully directed, full of heart, and so much fun to watch.",1
1431,"Despite the common complaint that the film mirrors A New Hope. This film also does many things right. Humanizing storm troopers was something unheard of in the main film series, and this movie pulled it off just right. Reintroducing elements from the original trilogy was handled well. Stopping a blaster shot in the air with the force was an incredible visual. The brutality of the light saber fight is also very realistic and entertaining. Overall plot left much to be desired.",1
1432,"The Force Awakens is a good start to a new Star Wars trivia.  I love the beautiful landscapes like Jakku and Takodana that remind me of the sets from A New Hope.  I loved seeing the return of our favorite characters like Han Solo and Leia and seeing a new generation of heroes like Rey and Finn.  I felt like there was a little too much humor (sometimes bad) that took away from the seriousness of Star Wars but there were very good moments like when Kylo killed Han (made me cry) and the final battle between Rey and Kylo.  The music, as always, was amazing.  Overall I would give it a 8.2.",1
1433,"Not as great as ESB (it set the bar pretty high, to be honest) but still a fun movie. The production is simply astonishing. They really wanted this movie to *feel* like it occupies the same universe as the original trilogy; aside from a few misfires (plot-related, admittedly), it does feel like a worthy successor to the story that ended with episode 6. That duel in the snow...wow, what a scene. It's one of my favorite fight scenes from the entire franchise, and I grew up on Star Wars.Yeah, it's a fun movie. Definitely worth multiple viewings.",1
1434,"Though it never manages to reach the heights of storytelling prowess and cinematic glory of the original trilogy, Star Wars: The Force Awakens succeeds in just about everything it could be asked to do: it pays homage to the legacy of its predecessors and passes the torch to a new generation of surprisingly realized characters.There is a great deal of personality brought by the script, with sharp humor and characters that have unique and relatable issues and desires. Some of the dialogue is clichéd, but it's leaps and bounds better than that of the prequels. The characters and their personal arcs are very well-established on screen, even if they all seem a bit too good at everything, always able to get out of any situation with little-to-no difficulty. There are some times where this makes for a less-compelling story as tension gets drained from the action, but there is still a great deal of personality and heart in the script that largely makes up for this. The story is where The Force Awakens really shows glaring weakness. The entire plot is a recycling of A New Hope, and although the lack of originality is somewhat helped by the unique tone and characters, the movie still fails to provide the thrills that it could have because it's all just something that we've seen before. The Force Awakens is a fun, humorous, action-packed adventure that's certainly elevated to status of greatness by its well-written characters. It’s refreshing to see more of a reliance on practical effects that made the originals so stunning. It’s a remarkable return-to-form for the franchise after the dud of the prequels even if it is somewhat flawed in its development of plot and characters.Story: 5Acting: 8Script: 9Visuals/Sound: 10Entertainment Value: 8OVERALL SCORE: 8/10",1
1435,"This Star Wars reboot, The Force Awakens, does a good job of keeping everyone engaged while not giving them an exact replica of A New Hope.",1
1436,"The Force Awakens launched the Disney era of Star Wars. It took what the original trilogy set up, and started a relatively new story with new characters and modified factions. In it, we find ourselves following a new young cast which has striking similarities to the original trilogy. The story also feels very familiar, but it's different enough to not be looked at as a remake of A New Hope, in my opinion. And really, if you take out Star Killer Base, this movie really isn't that similar to other Star Wars movies apart from a certain character's arc. The new characters are likable, the new storyline is formidable, and the visuals are incredible. I just wish some of the humor wasn't so ludicrous. I find myself enjoying this movie more and more everytime I watch it, and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being widely regarded as one of the best films of the saga a few years from now.",1
1437,This is everything I wanted in a Star Wars movie... finally. The Force Awakens has an amazing cast such as Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you haven't.,1
1438,"The purpose of ""The Force Awakens"", other than to cash in on the Star Wars brand, is to begin to make things right. That's a promise that is made early on the film and it delivers on that promise. We meet a whole bunch of interesting, three dimensional new characters with intriguing pasts and goals that the audience can easily be invested in. Some of the older cast members of the original trilogy reappear and prove that they have lost none of the charm that they had back in the late 70s-mid 80s. The plot is an homage to that of the original Star Wars film but distinguishes itself enough to be a refreshing adventure that older fans will geek out about and newer fans will fall in love with. A perfect example of how to bring a franchise back to its glory and introduce it to a brand new generation of moviegoers.",1
1440,"We have reached the level that humanity is seduced by other thoughts. Because it is incomprehensible the prestige of this film, and me as a fan of The Saga consider this movie the weakest of the seven, and it is the lack of Disney creativity and J.J. Abrams who only know how to play it safe not to be criticized. The Phantom Menace is a Citizen Kane compared to this film, very bad actors , completely copied story. Lack the knowledge and Luca's passion in this movie. I was very disappointed Thanks Lucas for The Saga you gave us and was now ruined by white slavers.",0
1441,"Whilst its great to see the old favourites return, its the new cast that really make this latest SW movie an unqualified triumph. A perfect mix of old and new, this was hands down the must fun I had at a movie in 2015.",1
1442,"I'd like to begin by saying this movie is a huge step up from the prequels, no doubt.  I truly enjoyed the action scenes, and the acting was well done.  The only main problem I have with the film is the fact that it was too similar to Episode IV.  There was another death, star, another rebel group, etc.  It basically followed the same plot line, except for the underlying search for Luke.  I also was a little displeased with the fact that Rey and Fin were able to not only handle a lightsaber so well, but that they were able to compete with a trained force user.  Despite his injuries, I would have expected more from Kylo Ren who is of the Skywalker/Solo lineage.",1
1443,"Don't listen to the nay sayers. Han Solo is the heart and soul of this movie. The new characters? They are great, and get plenty of development. And most of all, they have chemistry... not like the forced romance/friendship we saw in the prequels between Ani, Padme and Obi. They have depth and there is more to them than flashy choreographed lightsaber fights. Is it flawless? Nope it is not. Some characters get about as much screen time as they did in the trailers. The movie has an overarching plot copied from A New Hope. But I don't think that is as bad as it sounds. It is, after all, a movie that sets up a trilogy. If you are expecting a Star Wars movie to rock your world and to be better than all of the other movies put together, to redefine Star Wars... well this is not it. And frankly you shouldn't expect such a thing. But this is hands down probably the best Star Wars movie, top two at the very least.",1
1444,"(This is from the perspective of a Star Trek fan that also likes Star Wars.  I've seen all of the Star Wars movies, each once or twice.) The Force Awakens was enjoyable, well paced, filled with action and humor, and introduced likable and interesting characters. Finn, Rae, and BB-8 were all very likable characters that I look forward to getting to see again, getting to hear about their past, and I care about the fate of the characters. Harrison Ford did a great job as the aging Han Solo.  It was a prominent role in the film that didn't feel too over-done.  The demise of Han Solo seemed appropriate and right.  Star Wars has made its peace with Han, and now the new characters are free to move on. The big issue I had with the film, even as just a casual fan that hasn't watched the original trilogy more than twice, with the most recent time being years ago, was that the main device to move the plot forward was yet ANOTHER Death Star.  This Death Star, like each one before it, has one critical weakness that must be exploited by the rebels. I can understand that some things will seem familiar, as they have to be ""Star Wars"" to be in the movie.  But they simply needed to make a better plot device other than Death Star 3.0.  It made the whole movie feel like a re-hash of the original trilogy. In my opinion this ""more of a great thing"" turned out to be a ""good thing"".  I enjoyed the movie but would have appreciated it being a little more ""fresh"".  Within my circle of friends I've found that people that the bigger of a Star Wars fan you are, and the more familiar you are with the original trilogy you are, the less likely you are to like the movie.  While folks like me, that are casual fans, tend to enjoy it more.",1
1445,"Wow, a complete Remake ... great effects, thinnest story ever, even for a fan of the series this is disappointing at best. I really wonder how they could come up with so much repetitive garbage",0
1446,"Blah blah like A New Hope!  Return of the Jedi was like a New Hope, all that time on Tatooine and then blowing up another Death Star with some teddy bears thrown in!  Essentially that is Star Wars!  In the next film the baddies will seek revenge by capturing some resistance members and destroying there base like in Empire Strikes Back!  Nobody wants to watch a political film with a jibbering bunny rabbit thrown in for poopy gags! I'll divide my review into positive and negative POSITIVE:Millennium Falcon returns as do only slightly upgraded tie fighters and X-wings!  This makes space battle scenes much clearer!  Indeed they fight within the planets atmosphere so that is different. Chewbacca for action scenes is played by an athletic basketball player and he is excellently cast for buddy group scenes and his interplay with The Finn character.  Indeed he looks so strong like one of the Neanderthals who could tear a lion apart!  Way better than the Peter Mayhew character who had trouble walking without out bow legs in the original trilogy. Rey played by Daisy Ridley is mostly well acted and was a good protagonist amidst the obvious weirdness of a Star Wars movie. The Kylo Ren Character was well executed by Adam Driver!  He was a way more complex and interesting character than Darth Vader in a New Hope. Harrison Ford put in a solid performance as Han Solo!  Exactly how you imagined Han would end up!  I imagine he has been killed off but the way the film was he could just as easily have been saved by Kylo somehow. Carrie Fisher obviously hasn't looked after herself and all the drugs partying and clinical depression has caught up with her looks and acting ability.  She ain't no Madonna or Jamie Lee Curtis that's for sure she says her lines with a weird look in her eye you usually see in people who have institutionalised. Oscar Isacc is a great actor who can totally change to another character unlike Harisson Ford who mostly plays himself or John Boyega!  He was totally different to his ex machina role and acted a spendid interchange with Finn.  Sadly he wasn't in the film much but when he appeared his execution was solid! The Domnhall Gleeson character as were most of the human First Order Officers typical of the toady slimey scum that can be found in the middle management of most medium to large scale companies.  Just like the old Imperial officers.  I'd like to see more rivalry in the next film with Kylo Ren. C3PO didn't really appear much only to show off his red arm R2D2 was mostly deactivated for most of the film BB8 was a great edition.  Far better than the poopy stepping rabbit in the boring prequels.  At least nobody fawned all over the droids as if they were giving gratitude to a toaster like Queen Amidala did to R2D2. The fight scenes with light Sabres were excellent much like untrained people do who grab weapons to kill opponents.  Here there was finally real tension as opposed to the dancing sabre fights of the prequels. NEGATIVES Boyega seems like the kind of actor who can only play himself.  I still liked his character though, many people objected to a black stormtrooper but for me I found him interesting as he could cope well with the action role. I know people dislike enforced political correctness and I have not seen a black actor who can totally change character like Daniel Day Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Gerrard Depardieu, and not just play themselves.  But to be fair Harrison Ford can only play himself in films. Carrie Fisher can no longer act as Leia.  Maybe her bizarre appearance could be described in the next film in that she's had a weird disfiguring spaceship crash. No boring cliched love story with tedious dialogue like the ""course sand"" dialogue in episode 2! For some reason I didn't enjoy the 3D version of this film way too much crap sticking out at you!  Some people may like this but you should see both versions of the film before passing judgement. I'm getting a bit tied of watching 8 stone women kick the crap out of elite fighting soldiers.  Even Rhonda Rousey would not be able to overcome these situations.  Maybe stun their opponent and escape but not hand the guy a new ****  Except of course if she was using her mouth and nagging and moaning at a man but that is a different type of combat.  Sadly this featured in the new Mad Max film and was equally laughable.  Maybe they just want equality in the acting industry or to pay their stars less by diversifying the workforce making it harder for them to organise against the demands of their employer. Still some crappy Cgi scenes but it was vastly reduced from the prequels. Overall go and see it I'll definitely watch it again. :-)",1
1447,"The spirit of Star Wars is rekindled with the Force Awakens, having been crushed by Lucasfilm's output over the last decade and a half. The filmmakers have cleary studied what made the first movies great and they deliver in spades here. Hopefully this approach will permeate through future Star Wars movies.",1
1448,"Of all seven Star Wars movies now in existence, The Force Awakens is without a doubt the third greatest. Within moments you remember the way that Star Wars was meant to feel, the wooden community theater quality acting of the prequels is gone, forgotten, and buried. Every character is vibrant, emotive, and driven in a way that the prequel characters just weren't. The fan service is there, but mostly subdued, and won't be terribly noticeable to any first-time watchers. As a stand-alone film, it'd be perfect, but in the Star Wars universe, the plot is not terribly original. We've seen most of these moments before, which is why I think it makes more sense to think of Force Awakens as a reboot of the original trilogy rather than a truly new plot line. Enough is new to make it enjoyable, but it hits most of the same plot points as the Original Trilogy.",1
1449,"Finally got to see SW:EVII-TFA yesterday. I am impressed that for one month being in theaters I have not heard of any spoilers that would have undermined my movie-going enjoyment. So kudos to the internets and IRL people. The movie itself is well-done and JJ Abrams really delivered a spectacle making me completely forget about the abysmal Eps 1, 2, & 3. The story, while a derivative of Episode IV was enough to keep me interested and look forward to Ep VIII although a different director is taking the helm. The only puzzling thing about VII is how in the hell did Han Solo & Leia produce such an unattractive child?",1
1450,"This movie was as bad as the last ones. - Villain has a couple temper tantrums and tears up computers with his light saber. Funny stuff. He looks like someone who plays dungeons and dragons. The helmet should have never come off.- Ford and Fishers performances were terrible. They should just retire- Oh no, not another deathstar, but this one is a lot bigger and more powerful with of course a weak spot- Storm trooper escapes wants to get to the outer rim, but the lady he ""just met"" just will not let him leave. Like they have some bond after an hour of hanging out- Luke has a 20 second scene with no dialog? Why?Plot was really good, but with poor performances and a lackluster soundtrack the movie was just a pain to get through. I am done with this Galaxy far far away",0
1451,"Over hyped recycled garbage from Episode IV. Poor writing and lackluster story. Its as if the writer decided to copy and paste the script from New Hope, replace the characters and reshuffle sequence of events. If you've seen the original trilogy, don't bother with this movie. Ideas are ALL reused i.e. Star Killer = Death Star, potential force user on desert planet, droid carrying message, Death star / Star killer destroys entire planet, small wing of X-wings finds a weak spot and destroys Death Star / Star Killer, main antagonist reports to a higher master (Snoke/Sidious) and so many other parallels. Nothing new but juvenile characters and narrative. Light saber duals are pathetic, at least the prequels fights were awesome. Would have been a zero if not for the original cast.",0
1452,"This is a movie that will probably improve upon second viewing. Though I'm not sure. Given how bad my theater experience was today when seeing this movie, I came close into not giving my take on Force Awakens. However, since it's the most anticipated movie of the year and everyone is not so shy about expressing their thoughts on it, I find myself baffled to say that, unfortunately, Episode VII is not the best Star Wars movie, nor the best movie of 2015. It's an entertaining movie nonetheless, but there some weak elements to be had. Now, there was like 20 annoying brats in front of me, who were constantly screaming, laughing louder than it was normal, and deliberately launching popcorns at someone of their group. This is the third time in a row that I happen to encounter a bunch of retarded, uncivilized kids in the cinema. It's annoying. I think my local theater should have an *sshole detector device. Kidding, but this is a serious matter. Why do people come to see movies if they're just gonna distract everyone from seeing the movie? Now you're all asking me to stop addressing this issue, and just go straight to the analysis, which what I'm going to do. Now, with these kids, I too often lost my focus. That's why I was unsure if I should put my thoughts on the film. Now, visually, it's a Star Wars movie. The use of practical effects is definitely much appreciated. Characters, planets, explosions, everything is a treat to look at, but once again, what were you expecting in this franchise? Even ugly is beautiful here, and that's including that weird merchant creature in Jakku. The color of the lightsabers are also fantastic, and I'm pretty sad we didn't have much time to rely on them. Most of this movie was largely composed by firing, mystical forces and aerial combats. I think the writers should commence to realize that those space ships action sequences are getting duller and duller with each movie, they should stick with the immensely fun lightsaber fight scenes. But that's more of a biased opinion. The plot is simple, and they drag it. I thought Luke Skywalker was going to pop up in the middle of the movie, and fight some Stormtroppers, but he only appears in the end, and doesn't say a word. To add, the final shot was awkward, I needed a reaction from Luke himself. Most of that reaction is now left to the imagination. The villains are quite a mixed bag, and I have no intention in making a full analysis about them. Only wanna to say that Kylo Ren isn't as intimidating as his grandfather, Darth Vader, and that I thought Snoke was just a copycat from Emperor in the previous films. Final Score: 7.5/10",1
1453,"The movie was a horrible addition to the legendary saga. It was basically the same plot of A New Hope IV, but of course, with a coating of Political Correctness; more women and minorities added to appease SJWs. I will not watch the next movies I know the plot will be exactly like Star Wars 5 and 6.",0
1454,This was NOT a Star Wars film. It felt more like a popcorn Michael Bay flick than anything else. The story was a complete rehash of a New hope. The characters were bland and one dimensional. Rey had 0 room to grow because she knew how to use the force right from the start. The worlds were lifeless and lacked detail. Kylo Ren was a terrible knockoff of Vader with a voice synthesizer to attempt to make him sound menacing. Somehow he had the ability to stop laser projectiles yet even Master Yoda couldn't do this? This same guy was beaten by Rey who just heard the word the Force and beats him in combat with zero training.  Overall this film was a mess and trash in every way. If you loved the rich universe Lucas made before then you can definitely pass on anything Disney churns out in the future. Star Wars is now a soul less cash grab.,0
1455,"Too bad people is trying to troll this movie. The cast is superb. As people already said, Finn fits the comedy role pretty well. Rey is just amazing, everyone's so hyped about this character. Even little boys were picking Rey's toys over other characters. She's probably the best female Star Wars character ever.The classic characters also shine on this one. I thought they might not fit well with the others, but they did a great job. You can feel the excitement in every scene.About Kylo Ren/Adam Driver. Can't understand all the hate. I think the character is easy to understand... he's just a kid who wants to make Snoke (and Vader's memory) proud of him. He's obviously overwhelmed by the pressure and his trembling voice while he speaks with Rey really say a lot about the character .Funny to see many people complaining about the similarities with ""A new hope"" and after that saying that ""Ren is a Vader wannabee, we cannot accept him as a new Vader"".Highly recommended, this movie is great it's Star Wars top 3 for me, over episodes VI, I, II and III. PS: BB-8",1
1456,"Probably the most anticipated film of 2015; Star Wars: The Force Awakens was not only a box-office phenomenon; but a smash hit as well. JJ Abrams, who originally directed the Star Trek films, manages to create a work of art as it is a beauty to watch. It exceeded my expectations and definitely able to withstand a sequel -- after Rogue One. Rating: 8/10 A+ = 10A = 9A- = 8B+ = 7B = 6B- = 5C+ = 4C = 3C- = 2.5D+ = 2D = 1.5D- = 1F = 0",1
1457,Loved this movie the Force Awakens probably not as good as New Hope or Empire but definitely better than Jedi and of course the prequels. Harrison Ford SOOOOOOO much better in TFA than Jedi. In fact thus Fords best role since the 90s. Let's see how these new characters develop I think they will be legends like Luke Han and Leia if the new films can deliver the promise.,1
1458,"Awesome movie, the dude playing the Stormtrooper is fab, so is the new jedi girl she totally kicks ass. The new bad guy is a hoot as well. Amazing graphics and creatures and literally just an amazing film! Love it!",1
1459,"THANK YOU JJ ABRAMS for giving me the movie I wanted! Who gives a hoot if its the same as Episode IV, its a good movie, everything's recycled whether you know it or not. Lucas stole stuff wholesale himself for the originals, look no further than the opening title crawl that was 100% copied off old Flash Gordon serials. And there's nowt wrong with that. This is brilliant, its a joy from start to finish. This is what Star Wars is all about. Bright people understand this.",1
1460,"I watch films from SFX point of the view and this has best SFX of 2015, mix of old and new seamless with practical effects, also effects made to look like old school effects from the original films,   compare this to the prequel trilogy which looked cold, clinical,  this gas soul. Digital effects combinec with practical effects shiws the way forward for Star Wars.",1
1461,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an amazing movie that introduces new and interesting characters in Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren along with the beloved original trilogy characters. This movie brings back what truly makes Star Wars great in a whole new story. This movie tells an excellent story of the new characters of Star Wars while still connecting in the original trilogy characters in important and creative ways. The movie also sets it self up perfectly for Episode 8 by leaving the fans wanting more and wondering what is to come of certain characters as the force flows through them, as relationships are further formed and as new discoveries are made. Awesome movie, favorite Star Wars movie so far and can't wait for more.",1
1462,"Although I don’t intend to give SWTFA thumps down, I expected it to be more solid, less cliched. 4 points I disliked: 1) The fact that the son of legendary soldiers of “Good” Han and Leia is the villain (and not just any villain, an evil leader). Family business as ridiculous as Han Solo’s scene of death.2) The Gollum-like villain.3) Lack of depth, e.g. how Rey discovers she's gifted with the Force and even beats Ren, a master of lightsabering.4) Sloppy video game action in some scenes, e.g. on the ship where Han meets Finn and Rey. Likeable characters, old and new, the lightsaber duel in the snow, and some stunning visuals (epic last sequence) offset some of its flaws.",1
1463,"Boring, trite, predictable, and full of cliches. Dozed of twice. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",0
1464,"The anticipation leading up to Star Wars: The Force Awakens was surreal.  Perhaps it was the lingering effects of a great night out with old friends the evening prior, which seems to apply how the Star Wars universe feels to me.I remained abreast of the hoopla leading up to the release, and avoided any spoilers.  I even read selective portions of a few reviews, including one that called this film the greatest of the year.Having now watched it, the Star Wars: The Force Awakens feels to me like a reimagined version of Episode IV: A New Hope.  Perhaps “history repeats itself” is the correct epitaph for it.It surpasses the prequels and is on par with the originals, but it does not evolve the storytelling to the next level which we have seen with other franchises such as Marvel, DC and even Mad Max.Still there was plenty to enjoy here, and let’s start with the visuals.  The 3D was well laid out.  Scenes where a Star Destroyer feels like it is popping out of the screen about to poke your eye out, or tie fighters flying in out of my peripheral vision.There is great attention paid to physical detail, everything from dents on land speeders to the grungy agedness of the Millennium Falcon.   The pacing is well metered, faster with the young new characters, slow and lingering with the older generation.The heroes in this film are likeable and compelling, a quality I felt was missing in the prequel films. You start to get to know the new heroes Finn and Rey when Han Solo shows up and reminds you why he is without a doubt the best Star Wars character of all (even though I have a soft spot for Luke Skywalker and the Jedi).I also appreciated how important Harrison Ford was to the success of the old movies, and with the death of Solo’s character I think it will be up to Finn and Rey to emotionally carry this franchise moving forward.I’ve always felt that JJ Abrams does a great job creating compelling good guys.  He does this in spades in the Force Awakens, but now this is where I think JJ’s weaknesses start to show up.His bad guys are never as compelling as his good guys – take for example Nero in Star Trek, or the baldy baddies from Fringe.My 5 year old loves Darth Vader and ol’ Darth has to be one of the best all time bad guy villains.  To me, the great thing with the original series was that we never knew Vader’s backstory.  The mystery of how he was seduced by the force was a compelling part of his character, and the reveal in the prequels did not add up to a net benefit in my books.Kylo Ren is the main bad guy the good guys interact with in The Force Awakens, and the movie takes an “if you can’t beat ‘em join ‘em” approach.  He’s another good guy getting seduced by the dark side story.To me, the seduction plotline worked well for Luke, but for Anakin/Vader it seemed contrived, as it does here.I thought the best part about Ren was his fits of beat the crap out of something or someone rage.  These were well done by Adam Driver, and I laughed along with most of the theatre for its entertainment value.Yet, it seems odd to me there are no effective anger management classes in a galaxy far, far away and is the whole seduction by the dark side no more than falling in with the wrong crowd at an impressionable age?The permanence of the dark side’s hold seems so black and white, an outdated concept that needs to evolve in my opinion.  And Ren’s character seems beyond redemption at this point after he kills his own father in cold blood.Ren seems destined to follow the Darth Vader formula of committing one last act of good before dying.  I hope this won’t take until the 3rd film because a copycat character is difficult to make compelling for that long.I felt the word copycat is everywhere in the film as a whole.  The new planet sized death star, the attack scenes, the master and apprentice bad guys, the resistance/rebellion.Maybe everyone was walking on eggshells with the storytelling and decided to stay with a formula that works to get people excited about Star Wars again.However, if this is more about business people trying to make creative decisions formulaically without an emotional connection it does not bode well for the long term health of the Star Wars reboot.  In other words, I can give it a pass this time.I believe JJ Abrams is the right choice if is partnered with the right people.  Once you unwrap the layers in his stories they have little to offer in terms of creativity and originality – Alias, Fringe and Star Trek being the examples for me.If the original trilogy did not exist, would I be writing this?  Probably not – the Force Awakens would fare much higher if we could wipe our collective minds.In the years to come, will I reach for the Force Awakens every few years like I still do with the original series? Time will tell, but probably not.Does the Force Awakens provide a step back in the right direction, and give me hope for the future?  Absolutely.",1
1465,"this is beautifully crafted Hollywood entertainment, certainly there's a boat load of nit-picking to be done but it gets the basics right and most of all it feels like a Star Wars movie should.",1
1466,"mediocre at best... I liked the prequels a lot more... Never understood why they got so much hate. This movie was pretty dissapointing. Let us hope the next ones will get better. Script below average , characters weak. The sith lords were good enough. Good guys where boring. Battle scenes nothing special , lightsaber duel one of the worst so far if not the worst. I couldn't put a ""yellow"" rating just because this was star wars and we saw Han Solo again but a 7 is the best this movie  can recieve.",1
1468,"It's exactly what I expected. Abrams is a SAFE director. He's not an auteur. He's not going to make anything bad or great, just, good. Fine. Serviceable. Adequate. I guess I have to admit I find it very disappointing on one hand and exactly what I knew would happen on the other. Abrams just isn't that talented. He's good enough to make something people don't hate but not good enough to make something special and where my disappointment comes in is that the worst kind of film for me is the forgettable one. Say what you will about the Prequels but you will never forget them. They are so terrible they are burned into most people's memory despite their best efforts to drink the pain away. Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest movies ever made. Even Jedi is memorable whether you like killer teddy bears or not! My expectation and sadness for this film is it will be like Star Trek 2009 in a few years. Everyone will agree they enjoyed it at the time but you won't be able to get anyone to talk about specifics. Because no one actually remembers what happened in Star Trek 2009. It was fun and pretty and empty. It was low-calorie and good enough to not leave a bad after-taste but not good enough to add to any ""best films list."" I wanted Star Wars to be a GREAT film but as soon as Abrams was picked to do it I knew I wouldn't get that. Abrams was the SAFE choice and safe is forgettable.﻿ It's as if Abrams makes films like Chinese food. You forget them in an hour. They are fun and sparkly and bright while you are watching them but they are like the flashy thing in Men In Black. They make you forget. I also write. And while I don't claim to be the best storyteller in the world I have written four plays and several short films and a **** of short fiction. I spend considerable thought on why a story works or doesn't. I don't want to spend forever writing about every detail that didn't work but I'll touch on basic points on why Abrams' films are forgettable. 1. All action, no breaksAbrams doesn't understand pacing. He likes to pack his films with action constantly and never have down time. The problem with this is it's the down time where the audiences processes what they just saw and it stores in long-term memory. All action, no breaks means very little gets moved from your short-term memory to your long-term memory. 2. Cartoon charactersAbrams doesn't understand characters. He understands cliché. He creates characters on templates that are only relateable because you recognize the tropes. This is particularly evident in his own (non-franchise) work. Quick, describe any character from Cloverfield! I'll bet you can't even remember anyone except Hud, and only because his name is repeated a thousand times. 3. Glitz over depthAbrams doesn't understand themes or subtext. He is incapable of making The Godfather or Apocalypse Now because everything is on the surface. He likes shiny things. He's an ADHD director. He explores nothing below the most shallow aspects of the characters and world. The reason the original Trilogy is so memorable is because it contains all these important, subtle elements to storytelling. It gives you slow moments after the action to pause and reflect. During these moments it builds subtle characterizations that expand and illuminate the characters thought process and motivations. Through this themes are built and built upon as the story progresses. Most of what you probably remember from the OT is not the space battles, explosions or even lightsaber duels. You don't remember the Death Star blowing up as much as you remember ""Use the force, Luke."" It's because everything in the script carefully crafted that moment for you. It is the arc from idiot farm-boy, to frustrated, brat, to being humbled and grieving on the threshold of manhood, losing again, falling in love, learning to seek deeper and that his own concerns are insignificant in the larger galaxy. You see that bumbling brat progress from annoying to interesting through loss and determination. He is given nothing but must earn it. We see so little development in TFA. Poe might get interesting but he barely was on screen. Finn had the largest arc, going from coward to standing up but he wasn't fleshed out beyond the cartoon. Han and Leia are both regressed. and, Rey, the worst of all never had a floor to start from and had no progress to make. Thank goodness Daisy Ridley is such a good actress because there was nothing to work with there. Any lesser actor could not have pulled that off. The fact is, I could write an entire book on why TFA didn't work. Why ""safe by committee"" is a terrible way to make art. Let's hope that Episode VIII is more original.",0
1469,"it´s a very beautiful movie for star wars fans, they´ll find everything you need to see, old characters, new ones, nostalgia and excitement, just enjoy and may the force be with you",1
1471,"Much like Creed before it, The Force Awakens showed exactly how to reboot a film series - familiar story beats with compelling new characters and old characters acting as mentors. Thanks for everything George Lucas, but he certainly isn't missed here.",1
1472,"This movie was amazing, almost on par with episode 4 in terms of story telling. It has a few flaws that I have difficulty looking past, though. First, it does seem like they tried their hardest to follow the story of Darth Caedus but they obviously had to take the movie in a different direction due to the age of the cast. I can understand this and I appreciate their thoughtful nods to the expanded universe. There is still a lot in common with everyone's favorite expanded universe setting. The biggest problem is Kylo Ren's temper tantrums... Darth vader would force choke someone if they brought him bad news. General Grevious would slash them in half... Kylo Ren beats on computer consoles/walls much like the angry German kid, when his subordinate brings him bad news... not really intimidating, just awkward to watch. I also disagree with how powerful Rey becomes, with the force, without any formal training. Just seems odd to me and its hard to look past something like that. The droid and technology designs also appear to have gone back in time, towards the old republic era... not really progressing forward. Everything looks so... old. I think its because they added a roundness to the droids. Just doesn't feel as modern sci-fi but more ancient world sci-fi... To me, its the exact opposite of what they were wanting. That ball droid is still the most impractical droid I have ever seen. It even has to move a little to use one of its arms, meaning it has to line up PERFECTLY to use its devices... This is just... bad design. I do like its personality, though, and it has a few pretty funny moments. Otherwise, the story is fluid, it puts a lot of good, productive nods, to  the fans and the expanded universe. Its basically a movie for fanboys... which is a good thing. All in all, if you like star wars, this is a lot better than episodes 1-3 and worth the ticket price.",1
1473,"First off, I'd like to say that a movie doesn't deserve a score of 1 for ""playing it safe,"" or using nostalgia. I agree it's not very subtle, but I'd rather have a remake-sequel compromise than to see a movie go too far from the focus of a series. This is worth your time and money. Although the action scenes do borrow from the original trilogy in not-so-obvious ways, the movie's plot is all about the wide cast of characters, each with specific character arcs, and this isn't a bad thing: they all work together in such a sensical and realistic way. Although it's not without its flaws, it's a damn fine start to a new Star Wars trilogy. I look forward to the next one.",1
1474,"*Minor Spoilers* Okay, im gonna say it, I found this film a bit disapointing..This is soooo similar to episode IV, Follow. 1: Bring Information about a secret weapons, in this case, a map.2. One of the main cast finds out that they have force powers, WITHOUT BIRTH TRAINING..3. Explosion. But with all seriusness, its a great movie, it was just overhyped, I loved Finn, he was just the best part of the film! He is really the first time I ever cared about a stormtrooper. Anyways, a must watch for Star Wars fans!",1
1475,"My dislikes about the film were that they copied Episode IV. firstly the starkiller base is pretty much death star 3.  Another droid that has to be escorted across the galaxy to deliver a message. A kid on a desert planet that wants to get away and Kylo being another jedi character gone sith. other than how they copied ep iv I didn't like how Rey could use the force without any training, imo its pretty stupid how she could use a Jedi mind trick and how she ruined Kylo at the end. Other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it was great!",1
1476,"The force is strong with this one. I was skeptical at first but I can honestly say JJ Abrams really pulled it off, the story is great and original, I have nothing bad to report. The Force Awakens is worthy to be called Star Wars, this movie is one great adventure, a lot of fun and a few tears.",1
1477,"Sure, the similarities between ""The Force Awakens"" and ""A New Hope"" are many, but the execution of the film's plot is so satisfying that audiences (including myself) didn't seem to care about its lack of originality. ""The Force Awakens"" accomplished what the original films did so well, and the cast & crew does an excellent job re-creating the spirited, thrilling feel of those beloved films.",1
1478,"The Force Awakens is great fun, it really felt to me like the old Star Wars movies in look and feel and spirit. The new characters are fantastic and fun to spend time with, and Han Solo was back on firm after dispointing in Jedi. Luke, not so much, but lets see were we go with his character in the next one.",1
1479,"Most of all this Force Awakens truly feels like a 'Star Wars' film. I dont know what that magic is but JJ Abrams has captured it here. And I like the prequels but they just didnt have that magic some how,  even though they were directed by Lucas.",1
1480,"Not perfect - or quite the masterpiece I was hoping for - though with so many people to please, I guess that was almost an impossible task (though Mad Max Fury Road managed it!). That said, overall The Force Awakens is a very successful attempt to get things going again - and infinitely better than the horrendously flat prequels. Great 1st and 3rd act - but a bit let down by a slightly poor mid-section. I thought Boyega and Driver were brilliant, and although I loved idea of having female lead and like the character of Rey - Ridley was a bit too much of a Keira Knightly-clone for my tastes (with same grating plummy voice) - though not offensively bad. Still reeling about the death of a certain character. Actually not sure it was the right thing to do for this first film - but certainly made it take off dramatically.  Even with its faults this still predominantly felt like ""old"" Star Wars again (aside from a couple of bits which felt more like the prequels) this is probably the best kid-friendly sci-fi since Avatar, and very excited about the next chapter... Though I wish/hope Abrams takes the helm (and not the Jurassic World guy who's apparently doing it). The force has awoken! (Though scared Disney will flog the franchise to point of nauseam over the next decade - as they have with Marvel!) Saw it in IMAX 3D - and the 3D was excellent - would never know is was post-converted - some of the best I've seen this side of Avatar, Gravity, Life of Pi... Had me ducking all over - and one shot of star destroyer actually had the entire crowd gasping in disbelief it wasn't in the room!",1
1481,"Let's be honest, this movie had many more reasons to fail than reasons to succeed. The hype couldn't be higher, the feelings about the prequels couldn't be more hateful and no one really could think this would be better than the originals. But, Star Wars The Force Awakens delivers, and in a great way. Many people has mentioned the good things. Great writing, excellent effects, (both CGI, and practical) beautiful art production, and soulful performances. Also, many people has mentioned its defects, including commentaries about how it feels all too familiar or even changing all the good things I just mentioned into failures. In one of the reviews I read, the reviewer mentioned that we would all feel the same about this movie in ten years, like we feel about the Phantom Menace today, with his arguments relying in our ""blinding stupidity"". Other reviewer said that what George Lucas did in the prequels was in some way good, the politic discussions and all that. I mean it's okay, personally I don't hate the prequels but Lucas tried to explain every little thing, so I don't see why going 'back to basics' is a bad thing. It's actually a very good thing. This movie has soul and personality and it doesn't rely in a lot of CGI like other blockbusters (and/or seguels/reboots) this year. Also the quality of other matters, like performances or writing, to be redundant, differentiates this one from its high-budget buddies. The story is quite simple, and it does resembles Episode IV, but it combines familiar elements with good and exciting new ones. It is clearly an introduction to this sequel trilogy, so maybe the other ones will expand the story and deepen into it, but this one is just what it needs to be, a new start, a fresh start. I've seen it two times. At worst, is a good movie, at best, is everything we wanted from an Episode VI sequel. For the next ones I can't talk, and maybe Episode VIII will have a lot more pressure, but this one is extremely satisfying.",1
1482,"Utterly terrible writing and characters that are completely unbelievable and irrational. There's so many plot holes and inconsistencies that it would take a RLM video to point them all out. The dialogue is nothing short of atrociously bad with characters exclaiming things for no reason, and pretty much thinking out loud as if a camera was shoved inches from their face. Rey is taken straight out of a Mary Sue fan fiction of a perfect female character written into the Star Wars universe. Non-stop fan service cripples the movies credibility as Han Solo is brought in as the mentor for the two main characters for utterly absurd reasoning. He's then killed off unceremoniously, and seemingly unmourned beyond a hug. Terrible acting from Adam Driver makes the entire scene utterly laughable. The dialogue again written by some angsty 15 year old just makes it feel like I'm reading something on deviantart. It's hard to put into words how bad this scene is, we know NOTHING about their relationship or why it's turned to this. Han and Leia allude to a tough marriage, and him being sent away. That's it. It very quickly becomes ""Rey: The Movie"" instead of Star Wars beyond that. Throwing aside reason or previous material Rey is somehow instantly a master of the force, and has full control over it. Not only that both characters seem to be able to wield a lightsaber flawlessly. Everything in the universe is moved aside quickly so as to focus on Rey. I think we all thought it was hard to imagine a worse movie than the Phantom Menace but they've pulled it off. It looked like it was actually going to be somewhat good mid point and then it just became a complete vehicle for Daisy Ridley without any focus whatsoever to anything else.",0
1483,"Star Wars Episode VII is a brilliant return to form, an old fashioned swashbuckling adventure true to the spirit of the golden era of Lucasfilm (late 70s to mid 80s). Hopefully they'll be taking a similar approach with the new Indy movies.",1
1484,"J.J. is truly a master story teller.  Here is why.  Despite the fact that the core narrative structure being much similar to those of New Hope  or TPM, the complexities of character development and interactions are more closer to the Empire Strikes Back.  Unlike the remake of Star Trek series, his task was to satisfy fans by providing enough nostalgic moment  but simultaneously feel attached to new characters ! ! In other words, he had to work on twice as many characters than any of previous installments.  This of itself is such an undertaking!  So having a simple plot for this episode was essential in order to appropriately introduce each character and give every one of them some moments.I have to admit that  the evil depicted  in this film seemed to be rather weak.  kylo ren seemed to be vulnerable rather than threatening.  But this was by designed.  Unlike any of previous films which had pure evil, this film is showing the evil we will find in the heart of every one of us.  So, I was able to sympathize a lot more  to kylo.  Will he become a Sith or will he turn to the light side?   As vulnerable as he is, any possible outcome can be worth considering .  The film also had fun, excitement, thrill, humor, a bit of romance, a great music scores and everything else that made Star Wars a space opera.",1
1485,"Better than the pre-quels. Better than the Ewoks films. Better than the Holiday Special. Better than Star Trek 11 and 12. Basically just a remake of Star Wars but with a better script. Could have done with a little trimming. Nazis symbolism was antiquated and ham fisted for example. Oh I dunno, it was alright I guess. I'll let the kids see this one at least.",1
1487,"I don't understand some people on this website. They don't like the fact that the plot of this movie is not very original, and I agree with them. But that is not a reason to give this movie a 0 or a 1. This movie has great characters, great dialogue that is very ""star wars-y"", exciting action scenes and awesome special effects. Now that I say it, this movie reminds me a lot of mad max: fury road. That was also a movie with great characters and special effects, but with an unoriginal story. Therefore I believe that this movie fell victim to the hype train, unlike mad max (which was rated a lot higher by most people). I do understand that this movie has its flaws, but I don't think that it is godawful, like some people do.",1
1488,"Cracking return to form for Star Wars and a thumping great action movie in its own right, with charisma to spare. JJ Abrams has a gift for getting the most from his performers and its the performances that are the strong point of The Force Awakens - star making turns from the new leads, a wonderfully creative take on the traditional Star Wars villain by Adam Driver and triumphant returns from the O.T, cast. The story moves briskly but the emotional beats hit hard and the action is as good as you'll see.",1
1489,"***THIS IS A NON-SPOILER REVIEW*** For the first time in thirty-two years, the cast of the original Star Wars has reunited, to tell billions of fans around the world, just what happens next. With the largest weekend opening in the history of film, and the merchandising off the charts, Does the Force Awakens live up to the hype? Yes and no. The story starts with Leia (Carrie Fisher) still in charge of the resistance, looking for a missing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil). The only clue to his location is inside a droid, that is discovered by a planetary scavenger and a former storm trooper, who together embark on a journey to return said droid to the resistance. As far as special effects, make-up, sound effects, costumes, and 3D goes, this is easily the best Star Wars ever. Even if you're a person who has never seen a Star Wars film, you can't help but be impressed by the visual impact of the film. It's was also amazing to see the old cast back together again for another adventure, but even that somewhat failed to meet my expectation. Maybe my hopes for this film were too high, but as I watched it, I couldn't help but think that I was just watching A New Hope again! The characters may be different, but throughout the film, certain situations are almost exactly the same. I am sensitive to spoilers, but I will give a small example, using just the description of the story. A New Hope, Princess Leia sends a droid down to a desert planet with a hidden message, where it is discovered by a young worker, who takes it to Obi Wan and then on to the resistance. The Force Awakens, a droid is send down to a desert planet with a hidden message, where is is discovered by a young scavenger, who takes it to Han Solo and then on to the resistance. Unfortunately the parallels don't end there, as they continue throughout the entire film. In reading other reviews, some people say it was intentional, to honor the original film, but with one of the largest budgets and audiences ever seen in the industry, why not instead go for originality? That's not the only thing that bothered me, as this film takes place thirty years after the original, the empire has fallen and a new villain has arrived, yet everyone still uses the same ships, blasters, and technology? Has this civilization not progressed at all in three decades? Aside from the similarity to A New Hope, I did enjoy seeing the cast again, and every actor involved in the new story was outstanding in their own right. Star Wars continues to be the pinnacle of success at the box office that all films are measured by, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't tell you, the similarities to the first film are more than just perceived, and in my opinion, they take away a lot from the franchises third trilogy, right from it's very beginning.",1
1490,"This movie was fantastic,aside from some minor acting problems (fin) and a little feel of remaking New hope the movie is fun and entertaining to watch.I had my cousin who had never watched a Star Wars movie before and taught its stupid but she loved it (she is 15).The only thing i realy didnt like is how little Luke we got for a movie that was all for Luke,oh well i am sure he will have a much active role in the Next one.",1
1492,"It retreads much of the same plot points as A New Hope, but The Force Awakens puts its primary focus on character building rather than world building since this is already a universe we are already familiar with. The new characters are likeable and while I saw a certain character death from a mile away, there is no denying that the The Force Awakens isn't just riding on nostalgia, but rather effectively setting up a new story arc through its focus on gorgeous setpieces and more well rounded characters. I would have appreciated if some characters got more screen time, but we have two more films for that.",1
1493,"I went in without any plot spoilers (though I had read some news about production and such) and I wish I'd gone in knowing less, so no spoilers here. However, be aware that if you've seen the original Star Wars and the JJ Abrams Star Trek, you won't see much new here. Not that this is the worst thing; The Force Awakens can't be accused of any great originality but it beats the hell out of the prequels. Scattered thoughts:*John Boyega is the best thing in this movie. He's asked to sell so many different emotions and to convey a difficult character with very little screen time devoted to his backstory, and he somehow makes it work. I wish we'd seen more of him.*BB-8 is the second best thing. Whatever it is about fake robots and bleeps and blorps, it just works.*Oscar Isaac is the third best thing, and probably the most skilled actor in it, but he's underused.*Chewbacca is the movie's principal action hero. Yes, really.*Mark Hamill has far more stage presence in this movie than he did in any of the originals.*Rey (Daisy Ridley) demonstrates her strength by complaining about sexual harassment during a battle for no reason. But otherwise is a passable Luke Skywalker redux who will hopefully grow into the role as he did.*Han Solo and Princess Leia's future is kind of a disappointment.*Kylo Ren is ridiculously emo, and whiny, and really a disappointment.*The location shooting is great, and this movie looks much better than the CGI foolishness of the prequels.*There is mass genocide of people we're given no chance to care about.*The whole thing takes place in JJ Abrams Time, this weird time warp where it seems like actually less time may have passed on screen than you spent watching it and where people decide to do things and then instantaneously appear wherever they need to be to do them.*You could drive a Star Destroyer through some of the plot holes.*Other than lines repeated from earlier Star Wars movies, there isn't much in the way of memorable dialogue.*Likewise, the new John Williams score is fine, but hardly lives up to perhaps the best known film scores ever.*Every now and then a decent joke lands.*The next Star Wars is heavily teased. This won't be the last one, folks. Surprise! It's by no means a great movie, but you'll have some fun.",1
1494,"In interviews both J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy talk about the task of decoding and recapturing the original ""Star Wars"".  The director says he wanted most of all to create for today's audience that same feeling of awe the original did for him as a kid (who hired to helm this property wouldn't?).  This movie probably has done it as well as can be done.  The bad news is it simply cannot truly be done short of retread.  When the revolutionary original came out in 1977 it set new standards creatively, technically, and as a business model.  Sci-fi movies weren't anything new, but taken to that aesthetic level and to such stratospheric success surely was.  It created a new space fantasy sub-genre and never had it been so much fun or inspiring at the movies!  Flash forward 38 years and thousands of genre movies, TV shows, video games, graphic novels, merchandising galore (ad nauseum), etc. and you have to ask yourself before getting your hopes up too high:  How can a new Star Wars ever match the experience anybody (at any age) felt when they saw the first one in the late seventies, those that got it that is?  The answer is it cannot, just as the prequels no matter how popular with the youth at the time could not attain that level of newness again.  It's about the times we live in.  Just think of the sheer endless volume of entertainment choices kids have today whereas decades ago going to a blockbuster movie was more of a big deal.  Since then the ever evolving sophisticated VFX spectacle offerings have been increasingly the norm.  Even by the time of ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983 this was becoming evident.  Another factor is you cannot replicate the unknown, against all odds irreverent kind of moviemaking enterprise it began as after it becomes the most successful franchise of all time.  They did it once, but by the time of the prequels Lucas was so powerful and revered that the actors were probably too timid to challenge anything he wanted.  So with all the money and means still at hand but different people in charge now, how did this one turn out? Its production value is as huge as expected and the style is thankfully in unison with the previous chapters.  J.J.'s solid touch and fresh energetic visual approach work for the storytelling not instead of it.  The right dose of humor is there.  Ford is good (though I expected more from the character) while the new cast is completely interchangeable with any of hundreds of other young actors.  The villain is miscast.  There is no doubt this movie was cast with a marketing agenda for diversity.  Now does that make it more realistic or do those obvious strategic maneuvers behind the scenes hinder character depth and take you out of the story?  It's debatable.  The main problem is halfway through I realized I've seen it all before!  It's the same plot basically as the original with all the same flourishes updated to today's cinematic standards.  It feels extremely calculated rather than original and of its own.  Well that's pretty much what every sequel and reboot is.  Bigger is more but rarely do they capture the original magic or expand upon it.  The real magic goes back to these characters we love and how we felt when we first encountered them.  For that matter I'm not sure I even want to see where they are thirty years later just as I wasn't thrilled to actually see what came before the original trilogy.  I sure thought I would be, but after it was executed the original itself became forever tainted.  When you show the back story or the after story, it inherently kills some of the offscreen mystery we all individually fill in with our own minds.  Star Wars is completely geared for episodic sequels though, and this one is probably right on the money (yeah $!) as far as what the studio wanted.The genius of the original was nobody was asking for it.  It was an unknown.  The genius of the first sequel was it stayed true but also added new depth and dark textures.  Here it's one big nostalgia fest with a sheen of high spectacle gloss.  They didn't take any chances.  Instead of focusing on an original story the script makes sure to connect the dots.  This checklist formulaic mentality is ruining big tent pole movies these days which leave me bored and only admiring of the incredible artifice of it all not the movie itself, and that aspect is incredible here if not that old inimitable magic. The look is far superior to the prequels yes (I don't fault George for pushing digital though, and all his critics fail to realize he will ultimately go down as an innovator of the entire medium rather than an artist working within it like say Spielberg).  Fortunately the 3D pretty much delivers, at least better than most now which idiotically hold back on it.  If anything is completely conducive to 3D it's Star Wars. The others:  ""Star Wars"" 10, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" 10, ""Return of the Jedi"" 4,""The Phantom Menace"" 2, ""Attack of the Clones"" 5, ""Revenge of the Sith"" 6",1
1495,"""Chewie, we're home"". The Force Awakens is a continuation of the ""Star Wars"" saga, balance returns to the Force as the First Order, emerging from the ashes of the Empire, clashes with the Resistance, which includes scrappy newcomers as well as heroes from the former Rebel Alliance. It's been awhile since we've seen a Star Wars movie hit theaters and the last one wasn't that great. Fans today are still not over what George Lucas did. Then the news came out about a 7th film in one of the biggest and most iconic franchise of all time, but that only made fans more worried. Everyone had doubts over J.J. Abrams directing a new Star Wars movie, because Star Wars is one of the BIGGEST movies ever and fans seriously don't want another Phantom Menace on their hands, but after seeing the movie I can safely say that J.J. Abrams nailed it. J.J. Abrams broke his back making this movie, I mean taking on a project like this is a big deal. Abrams himself is a fan of the original Star Wars movies and while watching this movie I could tell. He put everything in this movie and it absolutely paid off. I can't imagine anyone else directing this movie and I think it's a perfect idea for a Star Wars fan (like Abrams) to direct the movie, because he knows his roots better than Lucas. Abrams really listened to fans and this isn't the first time a director did that, I mean with J.J. Abrams wanting to make a good Star Wars movie, he wants to get everything nailed down perfectly and the best way he could do that is by listening to what people what. Abrams did fantastic job directing this movie as he added a mix of A New Hope, the old school film making and a little bit of a Star Trek feel to it. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega play new character's in the Star Wars saga and both of them are unknown stars to some people. Both of them deliver a great performance and their characters were enjoyable to watch. The characters themselves are interesting, you care for them and you have a little glimpse of their back story that makes you want to know more about them. All the characters in the movie are great and I'm talking about the old and new characters. Now lets talk about the villain 'Kylo Ken' played by Adam Driver. This might honestly be the most fleshed out, human and understandable villain we've had since Vader, now I'm not saying he's the next Vader or he's up up there with Vader, but he is a menacing villain that's quite frightening at times. He's not the type of villain that's just evil or tries to have a clear motivation that's done poorly in other movies, but here (Without spoiling everything) is more than that. He was a great villain and just his presence can make anyone go silent. I loved the use of the CGI in this movie. Abrams went back to original way of filming things and that's blending the CGI into the background that this universe is set in, and it's execution was beautiful. Now when I think about it, the whole movie is one big ""f**k you"" to George Lucas and how this movie avoids the things that we hated in the prequels (two of them is the use of CGI and Jar Jar). To those wondering if Luke Skywalker is in the movie and again without giving much away, yes, he is. Now for the flaws: A lot of people have said that The Force Awakens is basically a remake of A New Hope and I do agree on that. Some might have no problem with that and that's fine be me, but there were some call backs that felt a bit force (No pun intended). I already talked about how amazing the visual effect's look, but some effect's were a bit noticeable. I think some of the noticeable effect's were some of the CGI character's. But all that a side, the rest of the effect's was really good. Overall The Force Awakens is a great Star Wars movie and it feels good saying that. It's way way better than the prequels and Return of the Jedi. It's absolutely worth seeing. P.S. Here is something for those people who are going to spoil this movie for others. ""Those attempting to spoil Star Wars for others, know that it's the most attention you'll likely receive in life"". - Quote by Chris Stuckmann",1
1496,"The Force Awakens is a welcome return to the lived-in universe of the well-loved original trilogy. The characters are engaging, the visuals are stunning, and the story adeptly balances the old and the new. TFA's greatest flaw is its plot, which is essentially a rehash of A New Hope. The story is fleshed out in a different way, but the bones of the tale remain similar, sometimes to a fault. Despite this, TFA manages to recapture the beauty and escapism that embodied the original trilogy and was so lacking in the prequels, a warm return to a galaxy, far, far away...",1
1497,A great movie and a great  return to the Star Wars franchise! Brought back the best feeling of standing and waiting in line for hours waiting for the new Star Wars film! Gives me hope for the next trilogy!,1
1499,"The original trilogy was fantastic, the prequels I'm willing to pretend didn't happen but this film was a real let down, so much potential completely wasted. It gets 1 for the special effects, which where incredible, but for a film with the budget this film had we can expect that. What was unexpected was the lack of imagination, terrible plot and dull characters all of which were so bad that I am going to abandon the franchise. Its such a shame",0
1500,"I don't understand the hate. First pass viewing I too found it easy to be critical and compare it for following elements of Star Wars and Empire too closely. But on closer inspection, I think this was exactly the right thing to do. Packed with elements and feelings that made those two (particularly Empire so great). I also found that when I watched it again, I was struck by the quality of the scenes (music, dialogue, humor, cinematography, etc). I found some scenes pure magic. Again, I don't get the hate, I think the haters aren't true fans. I was 7 when the first movie came out and probably saw it 27 times in the theaters throughout the years (that's what megafans did in those days in the Midwest).  I thought Rey was fabulous. Calm and patience make her a natural with the force. Maz, Fin, etc.  All good stuff.",1
1501,"The Force Awakens is a great film. Not only does it brilliantly set up Episodes VIII and IX with some great story material, it has some great characters. Finn, Rey, BB-8, Poe Dameron, General Hux, and especially Kylo Ren, are some seriously great characters. Even more, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Adam Driver, are fantastic actors and do a great job here. I cannot wait to see where the series goes from here. JJ Abrams does a great job blending new and old here by giving diehards the nostalgia they crave and giving the new generation the new adventures they crave. The writing was strong and the special effects were out of this world. The score was great, but should not win the Oscar for Best ORIGINAL Score due to just being a copy-paste of previous Star Wars scores with some new tracks alongside the ones of old. My main problem with Episode IV and then the prequels were the whiny characters and thankfully that is not the case here. At no point are they whiny and this really elevates the film. I think much of the criticism in regards to characterization and story are kind of stupid admittedly because this is the first of a trilogy. Of course nothing feels explained or fleshed out...there is nearly five more hours of story to be told.",1
1502,"IT was amazing, and exactly what it needed to be. The visuals were much better than the prequels, character development was great, and the environments and world were outstanding!",1
1503,"This is the most overrated Star Wars movie ever.The perfect word to describe it is: ""fanservise"", but I can't blame too much Disney or Abrams for that... A large part of Star Wars fandom doesn't understand Star Wars at all, they loved the original trilogy as children, but they don't know why these movies are so important in cinema history, they liked the spaceships, the battles, lightsaber and laser blasters, and of course Darth Vader because he was badass. And of course they hated the prequels because of the politics, too boring, it's too difficult to think and try to understand the plot, they wanted only the same story again with a lot of shootings! Well I hope that now the fanboys are happy, we have TFA, basically A New Hope all over again, after Return of the Jedi there is the same situation than before, again the empire (First Order) against the Rebellion, the politics doesn't exist at all (so you don't understand why the hell there is still a part of the empire, the new republic and the rebellion at the same time, but the fans are happy!) and a new DEATH STAR, but this time BIGGER. Even the settings are so boring and uncreative. This is embarrassing, really, marketing and nothing more. I can't understand fans who like this but hate the prequels. The Phantom  Menace and Attack of the Clones were bad executed, but they had heart, the courage to try something new. Revenge of the Sith is just awesome, full of emotions, incredible settings, amazing plot and music... The Force Awakens in comparison looks like a fan fiction. Please use your brain, Star Wars saga deserves more than pure marketing with no heart. P.S. I'm not American, sorry for my bad English.",0
1504,"This Star Wars movie was better than the whole Original Trilogy, except maybe The Empire Strikes Back, and its only the first one on a trilogy. Also, NO EWOKS TO BE SEEN, 10/10",1
1505,"Not disappointed at all! Music:Well, not much to say, it was good. As well pretty similar to this from past episodes (as it had the same composer). It can be good information, that we could hear some good old tracks, that we already knew. Plot:Story was OK, and i wasn't bored by the most part of the movie, but i guess movie was missing overall backstory, so we wasn't sure what happen in past 30 years. I was pretty disappointed about the end, because i heard some spoilers about it, and it destroyed the whole climax. :V Visual:We've got similar climate to this from old trilogy. But in this case, director had more opportunities to make this universe alive. I was  enjoying every single second of this beautiful balance between CGI and good old-fashioned SW. There is much emotions, that I rly can't express, as it's my first review ever, but there was something about this movie that kept me saying in my mind ""OHH MY GOSH OHH MY GOSH OHH MY SGOSH"" the whole time. I guess I'm not ready enough to tell you all i feel about this movie, but all I want you to know is that, it's definitely worth watching.",1
1506,"Star Wars is a new revival for the beloved franchise that defines the movie until now. It is as brilliant, vibrant and brash as the light saber which symbolizes for the entirety of the movie. The force awakens is a step right back to the glory days of the saga which Disney, Lucasfilm and JJ Abrams worked hardly on. They created a movie masterpiece that will hopefully form a trilogy as good as the original. The film is step in the heart of the 21st century but at the same time keeps the franchise's traditional elements. The introduction of new leads who are full of hope and strength that course through the movie. Rey is steadfast, brave and smart. She portrays with grace yet strong and defiant. Finn adds a lighter and funnier mood to the movie with his humor. But he is  also passionate for those he holds dear. BB 8 is full of life which will make another fan favorite. Kylo Ren is relentless but insecure. Such a fresh idea to show the villains' insecurities.The original cast, of course, aren't left out of the spotlight just yet. The triumphant return of the saga's original characters helped in shaping this movie. The Force awakens is full of new light and new ideas. It is visually grand with a clear and concise plot and with leads that will shine as the new stewards of the franchise. There are some moments in the movie that would make you reminisce the love you had for the movie over thirty years ago. I applaud Abrams for creating a modern version of Star Wars with its trademark elements. The unexpected fates of characters and the strong portrayal as the villain can stand at par with the original. Fueled by strong performances, stunning visual effects, and plot's well thought-of path, The Force Awakens stands as a great revival of a franchise loved by all. This movie will defiantly catch the hearts of movie-goers for years to come and definitely define a new era of popular culture.",1
1507,"What a ride. Within a couple of thrilling hours all memory of the prequels are well and truly laid to rest. The Force Awakens recaptures the core feeling and experience of the original trilogy in spades, whilst introducing refreshing new characters, locations and concepts. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are two magnificent acting talents to be leading the franchise into the future, and Rey is the perfect female lead Star Wars so desperately needed to bring the films into the 21st century. The dynamic between her, Finn and Poe is electric, and Poe's contribution to proceedings will hopefully grow as the trilogy plays out; he seems a real gem of a character already. Adam Driver plays perhaps a more interesting and layered version of Darth Vader in Kylo Ren, displaying the internal conflict of a transition to the dark side through his fine acting. Those moments Ren lashes out in rage at control panels and electrical equipment with his crackling cross-guard lightsaber are shocking to say the least and show us we have an unpredictable and inexperienced villain who is clearly going through a very rough time mentally. The reveal that Ren is in fact the son of Han and Leia is tragic, and one I didn't see coming. If anyone was in any doubt as to whether he could live up to Vader as a central villain, those doubts would have been shattered the moment he slayed the Star Wars fan favourite, his own father. Although perhaps an unpopular turning point, this scene will surely prove to shape the events of the next two films and gives the audience reason to hate Ren even more than they did Vader. The set design and props for the film are stunning and prove old filming techniques and methods still have a vital role to play in modern cinema. Some of the creature animatronics were unbelievable in intricacy and seeing the Millennium Falcon in all its glory once more was worth the ticket price alone. The lightsaber duels felt weighty and grounded in reality, with the inexperience and vulnerability of the lightsaber users clearly evident. A scene involving a lightsaber-wielding Finn getting beaten by a furious stormtrooper and his staff was one of the standout moments of the movie and dared to venture into new Star Wars territory. Although certain scenes felt unnecessary or too long (the rathtars attacking the Falcon springs to mind immediately) The Force Awakens takes it's audience on a journey back to the space opera 70s  but also on a path to the future of this expansive universe. I went into  the cinema with incredibly high expectations and was not disappointed. Christmas 2017 cannot come sooner. Luke might even get a line this time!",1
1508,"If you are a Star Wars fanboy then please get off the internet, and go back to your special little corner where the only movies in the world that matter are the original trilogy, please, its time for the grownups to talk. Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens is a good movie. That is a summary of it all. However for more reasons, just continue reading. Lets start with the story, people are complaining that it is a terrible rip off of A New Hope, and my response is: So what? Does this reasoning mean that you also hate A New Hope? Does it mean that this movie recreates it badly? No. It retells the story in a way that is familiar and also fresh. The cinematography helps the feeling of hugeness and epicness that JJ Abrams wanted, in the action scenes the camera is moving at a pace that feels intense but also lets the audience see what is happening and let them breathe, during more soft moments, Abrams lets the camera linger and slowly move to help immerse us into the scene, basically the camera work and lighting is phenomenal. The dialogue and character interactions and acting are also well done, people may not remember, but the acting and dialogue for A New Hope wasn't as brilliant as we think today. People may argue that there are plot holes and plot points that don't make sense, but guess what? ITS THE FIRST IN A TRILOGY. They are bound to explain it, there are 2 more movies coming. There is also the argument that the villain Kylo Ren shouldn't have been beaten so quickly, but guess what? He was still in training. I wonder if people just forget the scene when Hux is talking to Snoke, and Snoke clearly says: ""bring me Ren, it is time to complete his training"" so that argument is invalid. Basically this is a good movie, and unfortunately, it has reached the point where suddenly its cool to hate it because ""Yeah, I'm different."" and that is a shame. Don't let those people defer you, because most likely they are a bunch of fanboys who know nothing about film making and just want to dislike something because it doesn't reach the standards they set. I would highly recommend seeing this movie",1
1509,"Great special effects, but short on original story line and character development.  It appears that Disney feels that you can't restart the Star Wars franchise by bothering to develop interesting characters to set the stage for the next 4 movies.  Instead, they were too busy setting up the next special effects scene.  They better get it right next time or my patience and attendance will wait for a video rental service.  I did not appreciate the portrait of Kylo Ren having temper tantrums with his light saber when things didn't go his way.  Aren't Jedi trained to control their emotions?  He is no Darth Vader.  Taking off the mask was a mistake and made him lose much of his mystique.",1
1510,The movie is about an 8.5 to 9.  Voted 10 because like most online polls you have to vote to the extreme since people will say its either 0 or 10.  So vote with the heart.  If you don't drown yourself in science babble or cry about it not being a perfect film you will enjoy it.  If you are the type that hangs on every little flaw and cant accept anything but yourself as perfect you likely won't.  Take it as you will.,1
1511,"I loved this movie. It's not a perfect 10 but i'm giving it one because there are way too many morons who are giving it a 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 to this movie, failing to recognize at the very least the craftsmanship behind it. Is this really a movie deserving a 0? Are you completely nuts? There's a limit to be a hater (or a fanboy). Normally i would give it an 8 or 8.5, maybe, when i just left the theater, i would have gave it a 9, but because of all the retarded people who are giving it a 0 (REALLY????), i'm going the other way.",1
1512,"By far better than Episode 1-3, on one level with Episode 4-6, maybe even better. Dear Team of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I was flashed. The first time for about ten years. After Episode 1-3, Episode 7 brings Star Wars back to the roots. There are only actors who know what they are doing and everytime they do it, you see that they love Star Wars. Everytime we recognize the spirit of the old movies (some on here call it ""ripoff from previous movies"", I would never call it like that) we see the spirit of the new movies based on the Originals. We see a mixture of drama, great humour, lovely nostalgia, hatred and sadness. I am just glad about this new Episode of Star Wars and I am looking forward to the next Movie. The entire Team of Star Wars Episode 7 brought the original Star Wars Trilogy back.Thank you!A Fan.",1
1513,"cualquiera que haya disfrutado los episodios IV, V y VI de la saga va a disfrutar mucho esta septima entrega. La trama es atrapante con algunos pequeños giros de comedia que la hacen mas llevadera y muy buenos efectos visuales.",1
1514,"I greatly enjoyed this movie to be honest. I can say part of it was probably due to nostalgia since Star Wars was one of the first series of movies I watched. The story also kept me hooked throughout and I enjoyed the effects. So if you have the chance, I recommend watching this movie.",1
1516,"Some of these reviewers are clearly trolls, I mean 0 out of 10 for a film of this magnitude, seriously? well its the only attention they are gonna get, bye bye trolls Star Wars and its millions of fans have struck back. The Force Awakens is the biggest and best film in the Galaxy.",1
1517,"Star Wars The Force Awakens IS nostalgic, flashy, cheesy, romantic, funny, cute, dramatic, predictable, commercial BUT... and most importantly... it is Fun.Star Wars The Force Awakens IS NOT gritty, hardcore, realistic, thought provoking, logical nor does it take itself too seriously and I can see why self-defined hardcore fans can have a problem with that. I saw Empire in theatres when it came out. I read Zahn, played the RPG and devoured SW lore my entire life. I had and At-At and a Falcon and a bunch of figurines only My Vader did not stay in its plastic container, it came out to play and, eventually, broke and went to garbage compactor heaven.For those fans trying to recapture that feeling they had when they were 10... No Movie, no matter how awesome, will do that for you. You can't keep your childhood in a neat plastic wrapper.This Movie hit all the right notes for me. It managed to eclipse the horror that are the prequels and satisfied my inner geek.When all is said and done this is a fun movie with a great cast and a truly wonderful nod to the creators and actors of the originals.",1
1518,"The Force Awakens es una película innegablemente entretenida, J.J. Abrams hizo un excelente trabajo mostrándonos una nueva perspectiva de Star Wars, pero considere que así como es entretenida, también tiene muchos problemas, por ejemplo: considere que el segundo y tercer acto fueron muy rápido, hasta ser un poco confusa. También considere que The Force Awakens se aferra mucho en la fórmula clásica de Star Wars, muchos cosas aquí ya se han visto allá, sobre todo con Episode IV-A New Hope, muchos fans pidieron que esta nueva pelicula debía mantener elementos de las películas clásicas, porque muchos errores de las precuelas se basan en eso, y sí, en The Force Awakens algunos elementos clásicos funcionan, pero la mayoría de ellos en vez de funcionar parecen mas bien reciclados, y a veces la película es un poco predecible gracias a eso. El CGI aquí, es muy bueno, no se siente abrumador (parte de eso se debe al uso de efectos prácticos, gracias J.J. Abrams), pero mi problema se enfoca es en el Motion Capture, los personajes tales como Maz Kanata o también el Líder Snoke, son obviamente CGI, no son personajes innovadores como Gollum o incluso César (Planeta de Los Simios). También otra cosa que no me gustó es la relación entre los nuevos personajes, NO los personajes en sí, me encanto la forma en que los personajes se desarrollaron, sus historias, lo que no me gustó fue como se relacionaron, sí Finn ayuda a escapar a Poe Dameron, luego se encuentra con Rey y blablablá, hasta ahí bien, pero la forma en que su relación (los 3) se desarrolló se sintió muy rápida, hasta a veces forzada (mención especial a cuando Finn se reencuentra con Poe Dameron cuando creyó que había muerto, y cuando se encuentran se tratan como si fueran amigos de toda la vida, cuando en realidad la escena en que ellos se conocen no dura ni 10 minutos), ahora que lo pienso, hay varios errores muy notables que para fans de star wars pueden ser mortales,  no he terminado. Otra vez, con elementos reciclados, esta vez con la nueva base estelar de la primera orden, que si si, es 10 veces más grande que la estrella de la muerte y es súper intimidante y eso, pero al igual que en A New Hope, en realidad no fue muy difícil de destruir, plan-punto débil-boom ¿se entiende? Otros personajes nuevos SÍ se sienten forzados como Maz Kanata (que desperdicio de potencial de un personaje memorable), a quien sentí que trataron como que de hacerla una nueva Yoda (por favor), el líder supremo snoke tampoco me gustó mucho que digamos. Probablemente lo que menos me gusto de la película fue la rapidez con la que Rey se convirtió en un Jedi, de un momento a otro ya puede manipular mentes y profesionalmente manejar un sable de luz sin entrenamiento alguno (por favor). Creo que ya abrume mucho con todo o malo que parece que ya no puede haber algo bueno, pero no es verdad, y no me malentiendan, The Force Awakens es una película muy entretenida, disfrutable y muy agradable de ver, lo admito estuve súper emocionado, pero también estaba muy preocupado, todo el primer acto es PERFECTO pero raramente el punto débil de esta película es lo rápido que fue, que no se dieron cuenta de que muchas cosas se forzaron, y otras cosas que pudieron ser épicas, no se aprovecharon, así como también se aferraron demasiado a la formula clásica en vez de preocuparse más de ser independiente y única. Sí, los intentos de esta película de ser súper épica son mayormente fallidos, cuando en realidad solo fue disfrutable, entretenida, y si, a veces sorprendente en algunas cosas, pero no súper épica. No salí del cine decepcionado ni mucho menos, la recomiendo fuertemente si quieres pasar un buen rato. Algunos fans se decepcionaran, otros la odiaran, otros la amaran, otros (como yo) pensaran que solo estuvo bien). Sé que es inoportuno, pero si me gusto el personaje de Kylo Ren como villano, y ¡Valla sorpresa! (los que ya la vieron me entenderán). Como resultado le daré a Star Wars: The Force Awakens 7/10 (B+).",1
1519,"For a fan of the first trilogy like JJ Abraham, i would say the movie respect the spirit of the 5 to 6 era. Some of the complains i heard were about the sidelined of certain character. I suppose the absence of Luke Skywalker was a BIG part of the complain. Actually i don't understand the need to see him at the end of the movie... We could have saved him for the next movies. J.J. Abraham is no stupid . But like Kylo Rhen(who is a fan of Darth Vader) he's a big fan of the franchise and we could see that .So many scenes taken from the old star wars movies: twisted family relations , big ship battles, light saber duel,even a death star to destroy etc... From a teacher point of view , he would get a low score for the cut and paste feel of the whole thing.The plot is dedicated for a six years old child to comprehend. So leave your brain at the lobby and enjoy the ride at least for the new actors who did a decent job.",1
1520,"This is not a perfect movie, but I thought it was a highly enjoyable one, and a triumphant return to the franchise after a decade away. The negatives have been hammered home, and yes, this movie borrows A LOT from A New Hope, but it honestly didn't bother me all that much until the very end (did we really need ANOTHER movie ending with the Rebels exploiting a weakness in a Death Star!?). That said, I thought this movie had a lot of positives that far outweighed the one major negative.The Force Awakens nails the vibe and look of the original trilogy, something the prequels whiffed on completely. I also loved the new characters, as Rey, Finn and Kylo Ren all had compelling stories, and all three actors did fantastic jobs in their roles. Compelling characters were perhaps the biggest flaw of the prequels, and this more than makes up for it. Surprisingly, this movie had some legitimately funny scenes, something we haven't seen in a Star Wars movie since maybe Empire. Oh, and the action scenes were great and the aliens were cool (as a fanboy, I feel compelled to point this out). All in all, this movie neither exceeded my expectations, nor did it disappoint me. It's far better than the prequels and a wonderful start to a new trilogy. I just hope they take these wonderful characters and this fantastic new world in which they exist and put them to a more creative use the next time around. For now though, I'm happy with this movie, and I'll absolutely be seeing it again.",1
1521,"If You're expecting a lot of character development and unforeseen twists in the plot to a formula story, you won't get it. The main character (Rey) is obviously Skywalker's  daughter but it delivers the action scenes you expect. Don't wait for any scenes after the credits for this is not a marvel studios movie.",1
1522,This movie is better then it looks.Im not saying its the best star wars movie ever but it has quite amazing acting and the trailer looks amazing.I also love how the characters look older now.,1
1523,"To be honest I had some issues with The Force Awakens.  Several different writers (J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt) worked on the story, and it shows a certain mishmash. However, the combination of humor, thrills, nostalgia and (yes) powerful storytelling should satisfy most Star Wars fans as it did me.  The Force is definitely with it. I am looking forward to seeing the next episode, hoping that it will be a real classic.",1
1524,"Like the film's villain, Kylo Ren, I'm torn between the light and the dark. The fan in me wants to love this movie but the critic in me is sorely disappointed. The Good The movie has amazing visuals and high production values that will not disappoint. It was great to see the Millenium Falcon on Jakku in IMAX 3D. The worlds were beautifully designed and full of life. I was interested to see the Force used in a new way (i.e. Kylo Ren stopping a blaster bolt in mid air). There was a feeling of nostalgia while watching the film that people who grew up with the franchise would only get. The lightsaber battles were decent when compared to the highly stylistic duels of the prequels. The background villain (Supreme Leader Snoke) was menacing and cool. I wanted to see a lot more of him. The movie is highly entertaining and that's the best thing going for it.  The story, while it has been done before, offers a lot of potential for the future. Its a good starting point for the new trilogy. The Bad This movie felt like a 2+hr fan service flick filled with forced humor and cliched story elements. The biggest problem with the Force Awakens is the narrative. There was absolutely ZERO character development. Finn meets Poe and helps him escape, they don't meet again until later and are suddenly best friends? Finn crash lands right near where Rey lives from Orbit? Rey discovers she is force sensitive and is able to master the Jedi Mind Trick at will? Finn, a non-force sensitive male is able to duel on par with Kylo Ren (who's had YEARS of training under Luke and Snoke)? Rey picks up a lightsaber and beats Kylo Ren easily with no prior experience with dueling or the force? These moments were confusing and extremely frustrating. Not to mention the big reveal that Ren is Han Solo and Leia's son felt cheap and rushed. Han Solo's death was no surprise either, anyone with a brain saw that coming miles away. Captain Phasma looked cool but did nothing to advance the plot at all. She was basically eye candy for nerds. I felt like this movie could have been a lot better if it had taken some risks. This was basically a rehash of the original trilogy right down to every storyline. The humor in the movie felt out of place and forced. This isn't a Marvel movie, its Star Wars! things are supposed to feel natural even the laughs. This movie suffers from an identity crisis. Say all you want about the Prequels but at least they were something new that none of us had ever seen before. The single most frustrating thing is that after sitting through the movie I have no idea what the title was in reference to? None of the other movies had that problem: The Phantom Menace (The Sith reappear)Attack of the Clones (The Clone Wars Began)Revenge of the Sith (The Sith take over the galaxy)A New Hope (Luke begins the path towards saving the galaxy)Empire Strikes Back (Vader captures everyone and beats Luke)Return of the Jedi (Luke defeats Vader and the Emperor)The Force Awakens (???)",1
1525,"I enjoyed this very much. The focus appears to have been to create an entertaining movie that can appeal to everyone, of all ages, genders, not just Star Wars fans, and it is a massive success on that respect.",1
1526,"This was a good movie, perhaps not a great one but it should be setting up great things hopefully. As a middle aged fan who didn’t care too much for the prequels I liked the fact that it mirrored the original movie, although I can see that this would be a problem for some. It’s not without original elements - BB8 is a perfect mix of new and old, Kylo Ren is a type of villain we haven’t seen in the Star Wars Universe (more three dimensional Darth Vader or Darth Maul), Finn is a new type of character and the flight through the ruins of Imperial ships was inspired. I thought the character of Rey, whilst likable and well played by Daisy Ridley, could have done with a weakness of some description to balance things out – I’m not sure where they can go with this character as she already seems to be an able and fully formed Jedi. Overall, entertaining and well-made but definitely room for improvement.",1
1527,"Personally, I mistunderstand the people saying that Episode VII is bad, it's actually not. They released a new movie, c'mon! It's a great moment to joy! I was into the plot, all characters were awesome. If you have not watched the film yet, I definitely recommend.",1
1528,"Okay so when I first saw this I was slightly disappointed because I wanted Luke to show up and kick a** at the end but now - I love this movie, like actually LOVE it. seen it five times, again last night and enjoyed it more than ever. and you know what, I actually lilke StarKiller Base - yeah I know, crazy, but I like it, I think its a funny twist on the Death Star, I like the way it sucks the life out of a star then spews it back out as a weapon. Who gives a **** if its not science, since when has that mattered to Star Wars??? Like, how can the Millenium Falcon fly in atmosphere, it has no aerodynamic qualities at all, no flaps or rudders, but no one ever complained about that? I cant actually believe people use this as a criticsm of this film. Starkiller is great, and while I'm on, I like Snoke as well. He's creepy and a good design. Voice by Serkis is good. Looks like he’s had some kind close encounter with a lightsaber on his forehead, nice design. BB8 is just flat out awesome. Perfect.",1

1530,To all the haters ragging on the story. It was necessary to make it feel like the original trilogy. To get the loyalists back and introduce Star Wars to a new generation. This film was masterfully done.,1
1531,"My first Star Wars was Episode 1 (I'm not ashamed of that). I was super young and I was blown away by the cool fights, Darth Maul, and the CGI. I did see all the originals and the rest of the prequels years later. I'm not a Star Wars fanatics and I'm not that young anymore when I saw Episode 7, so this review is from my perspective as a regular movie goers.I think Episode 7 is an okay movie, full of ""classic Star Wars"" action and overused cliche from previous Star Wars (another Death Star, rebellion, father son issue, and discounted Darth Vader?). I honestly think this movie is for those hardcore fans and their kids who's hungry for classic Star Wars plot after years of ""betrayal"". It also caters to female audience as well as minorities, which is good in my opinion. It tries too hard to provide for many different groups and it become lacks of originality. It becomes watered down and 2 hours just not enough to explain everything after years of hiatus. Everything become bland and not appealing to film enthusiast like me. Not even half way through you already know what's gonna happen and the twist is not as exciting as when Anakin learns the truth about his father.This movie success show how powerful advertising and internet community are. One person opinion become everyone opinion in matter of second. Daily dose of overblown trivia. They literally put all the hungry fans on leash. The best thing about the movie were it's CGI and soundtrack.",0

1533,"The force awakens is not only my favorite science fiction movie of all time, but also one of my favorite films in general this is because it breathes enough new blood into the old series that it is reclaimed into new and old glory of the star wars spectacle",1
1534,"When i first saw this movie i was amazed, but now looking back at it.It is just like episode 6 but i like the new Characters and the first Order.Honesty i think this movie is good but its too Similar to a new hope.",1
1535,"This was the best movie I have seen in the last decade! Thank you! It was an amazing ride! People that say that original actors didn't get enough screen time, are misguided. It was an emotional roller coaster, if you are a Star Wars fan.",1
1536,This movie is garbo dont watch it complete trash retarded i walked out of the movie. main actress was an ugly **** trash nobody should go see this piece of crap movie,1
1538,I love the Force Awakens more nowork than when I first saw it. First and foremost it's the characters that make this great. The foundations have been laid for an epic trilogy. The Last Jedi has a lot to live up to.,1
1539,"A fun start for the new trilogy. Interesting characters, well-executed death scene and overall fun sense of adventure can't quite overshadow that this movie is a rehash of A New Hope, but it gets pretty close.",1
1540,"Disney brings proves that they can kick off a new series of Star Wars Movies with something amazing, this movie is truly special.",1
1541,"One of the best Star Wars movies ever made. Period. If you grew up with the original trilogy on VHS, then this is the film for you. It lived up to and surpassed the hype.",1
1542,"I've seen every one of these films as they've been released and aside from maybe ""Empire,"" The Force Awakens stands above all of them. TFA gave us so many things the prequel trilogy did not - characters we care about, 1st class production values, fantastic performances top to bottom, and a script/plot that was cohesive and interesting.  Yes, maybe the plot borrowed from Episode 4 a bit too much - droid on a desert planet looking for his master and finding a nobody who then helps save the universe - but it is produced and told in a new and interesting way, with a good script and terrific acting. Daisy Ridley is going to be a huge star.  Adam Driver is diabolical and reminds me of a young Alan Rickman in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.  I was expecting a little more screen time from Max von Sydow (a personal favorite actor of mine), but the new actors all held their own beautifully.  Then there are the original trilogy actors who look old and tired, but definitely help with the nostalgia factor. Speaking of that, this film teeters on the edge of too much nostalgia, but there is just enough without ramming it down our throats.  There is one scene in particular that you'll miss if you blink that is very funny. John Williams' score is another blockbuster.  I was so relieved when I read he was doing the music because JJ doesn't normally use him in his films.  And speaking of Mr. Abrams, a few of his buddies from Lost and Alias show up in this film in cameos, similar to MI3 and Star Trek. I think that JJ Abrams deserves all the praise he can get for this film.  He undertook a monumental task in not only directing the film, but directing a Star Wars film.  Especially after the prequel disasters.  The fans were hungry for a good, modern Star Wars film and he took the risk of being crucified like Lucas was back in 2000-2005.  JJ did a great job and  I plan on seeing it again soon.",1
1543,"The best Star Wars movie since ""Return of the Jedi"". First things first, this is a Star Wars movie through and through. The change in creative control has ironically brought Star Wars back to its roots. Not only does ""The Force Awakens"" echo classic Star Wars, it is the embodiment of the modern blockbuster. For old fans like me, the nods to previous films and character arcs of old favorites is wonderfully emotional. The new characters are also spectacular. Poe is a just about the most awesomest pilot ever. Finn is a the wide eyed kid coming into the Star Wars universe. Rey is the embodiment of the heroes journey. It all comes together so nicely you will want to see it again.",1
1544,"The trailer to this movie always gave me chills every time I watched it, yet I still always expected it to be like the prequels.  With Disney taking charge, I had slight hope for the film with no more George Lucas.  The plot feels a little cheesy with them trying to finish a map to find Luke Skywalker, but they still managed to have a really good story the movie with character development.  I think every single nostalgic moment made me almost cry more than some parts of the movie, like the millennium falcon taking flight, getting to see Han and Chewy, and the moment that just hit my hard with chills and excitement that I thought I was gonna cry at was hearing the loud Star Wars theme to single the movie finally started, and seeing, ""STAR WARS"".  If you are expecting to see all the old characters from the IV to the VI films, you'll get you wish.  If you have a bad feeling about this film being like the prequel films, don't worry, there's no character like Jar Jar Binks, it's still got some of those humorous moments that were in the original films, and not in the prequels.  You will truly come to love the new characters in the film, and won't be disappointed to see how much things will surprise both in the story line, and characters return.",1
1545,"My friends, my wife, my family, and I loved this movie!!! My brother, and I grew up watching the original 4,5, and 6 when we were in our teens, and this movie hit every nostalgic, authentic, and adventurous nerve beyond anything that I could have ever imagined. Ignore those giving it anything less than an 8. They are the ones who have internal problems that they need to work out before judging anything of this world. This movie started by drawing you into a scene where you had questions, and so many of them. Then step by step, your questions were answered, and your dreams were fulfilled. The action scenes, the story, the graphics, the acting, and the overall atmosphere of the movie was beyond imaginable. Even if you're not a huge Star Wars fan(To which my wife is not, and she loved it!!). Then this movie is still for you.",1
1546,"I just got back from the movie and all I have to say is I loved it. They story was compelling and just overall fun to follow, even knowing what was coming around the corner. For those of you that complain that the story was just ripped off of episode 4 you have to look more into the film aspect of things. The star wars films especially episode 4 where built all around a simple hero cycle. George Lucius took this simple hero cycle and turned it into a story we all know and love today, and JJ Abrams followed in the foot steps of George Lucius and did exactly twisting it up and forming into something new that should be looked on as great. People hating on this movie came in with a closed mind and weren't willing to change what they believe it to be, no matter how great it was. Now you guys are stuck unable to enjoy the movie while people who maybe had there doubts gave it a chance and saw what the movie really had to offer. Sucks to suck. I'm definitely watching it again and many times over. There has been an awakening!",1
1547,"Internet is now full of people whom nothing satisfies, that's the only explanation for  scores of 3 or 4. Generally is a very entertaining movie (like Star Wars was) and has holes in the plot (as the original had). Some  People look like do not quite understand that this is a film base on  a fantasy, the script does not have to be  deep, or pretend to give us any lesson in life, because it is only entertainment  as a game of basketball or baseball are. If you want lessons of philosophy go to read Platoon, if  you want a fun time go see this excellent movie and wait like me, for the next one",1
1548,"Great movie.The new characters are not shoved down your throat, they are introduced well and you actually care about them. The plot is a little too derivative of the original trilogy but it's still good. Some fans will never be happy.",1
1549,A great movie to get a whole new generation of Star Wars fans excited while still pleasing the OG's of the series! Totally recommend it to anyone who loves a good sci-fi film.,1
1551,"The movie nearly was perfect. Reviewers reflecting the movie as a rip off, or a rushed plot, probably are very bitter . There is a lot of misery in the world today, and a lot of miserable people, and that is what makes Star Wars: Episode VII, one of a kind, and should be considered by many to an Abram's masterpiece. In such an ugly world, Star Wars gives us a chance to escape to a galaxy where the impossible is achievable, the joy is real, the drama is personal and the excitement is glorious. Hype of this caliber is a double edged sword. A film of this stature will not be enjoyed by all, but those who left this film ""disappointed"", most likely went in with a negative mind set, or an overly optimistic view this movie would change their life. This was a movie for Fanboys (which I consider myself). This was not a development of something completely new, and was never intended to be. Unfortunately, there will always be negative reviews, and those reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. I am truly surprised by the negative feedback, and had to vent, now on to the review. CONTAINS SPOILERS:Lets start with the negatives, every movie has em. Adam Driver's helmet/mask was removed too often. The only scene the helmet should have been removed was when Ren was confronted by Han. This would have brought more power to both the scene, and Driver's character. The undeveloped characters of Maz Kanata, Poe Dameron and Supreme Leader Snoke are why this review is not a perfect 10. These characters have serious potential, but neither of the three fully blossomed during the film, possibly intentional on J.J's part. Those claiming Finn and Ren's characters were undeveloped, wanted a 4 hour long movie. Now the good stuff. Referring back to the scene in which Han confronts Ren, Driver ambitiously delivers. He brings raw emotion, heartwarming conviction, and an empathy in which viewers can feel he is undeniable torn between good and evil.  ""The power of the darkside"" is perfectly captured in this scene, and I left more than satisfied with Drivers performance. The nostalgia was very well placed, although awkward, maybe even a little sloppy, in certain scenes. Han and Leia being the parents of Ren is beautifully thought-out, and reveals there is Skywalker blood in Kylo Ren. Ren is obsessed with completing what his grandfather, Vader, failed to achieve. It is also clear Ren is unaware that Vader was the one who ultimately destroyed the Sith. I left satisfied, excited, and ready to see it again today!",1
1552,"8/10 as a movie in general, but as a Star Wars film? 10/10. The characters are interesting and real, the humor isn't forced, the story is interesting, and there's an overall sense of mystery prevailing, as we try and understand what's happened in the last 30 years...",1
1553,People who rate a movie at a 0 or a 10 should never rate a movie. No movie is perfect. No movie is purely so bad it deserves a 0. I ignore those reviews. Is this movie perfect. Heck no. Is it fun it fun to watch. Absolutely. It is the soul of what made the originals great. The actors are good. The effects are good.,1
1554,"One would expect that, after 2 obliterated death stars, the bad guys would have learned to protect them a bit better. Or just, you know, not to build such massive weapons.Basically Episode IV revisited.",1
1555,"This was an exciting spectacle of a movie.  The Star Wars fan in me loved it, but the movie-goer in me says it wasn't perfect. The movie succeeds most as a transition from the original trilogy.  The look and tone are spot on and there's a really great sense of epic scope and scale that nails the sci-fi/fantasy notes.  The new lead characters are fantastically realized, and for the most part like-able with complete arcs, and the old characters work fairly well as a bridge.  It's a great mashup of the old Star Wars we know and love along with enough new pieces that are ready and willing to be expanded on in the upcoming movies. That said, there were some flaws.  There is quite a bit of pandering and callback to the original trilogy films, much of it blatant and pretty forced towards the end.  The plot was also on the weak side.  Yes, it followed a lot of the same outline as episodes 4, 5, and 6, but I think they added enough variations and subversions to make it fresh and, most importantly, leave room to really expand the story in the next films.  As with most beginnings it spent a lot of time on world building and character introductions that it didn't get as deep.  The plot also had some pretty extreme jumps in logic and took some shortcuts and there were a few points of way-out-there science that threw off my suspension of disbelief (like how starkiller base works...). All in all it was a really fun movie that perfectly setup the next installment.  There is enough for old and new fans to enjoy and the hook for the next movie is great. To address some of the common complaints I've read about the movie (spoliers): Rey/Finn beat Kylo Ren!A lot of people complain that ""Rey and Finn with no training whatsoever beat the highly trained jedi/sith Kylo Ren!"".  First of all who says Rey and Finn weren't trained?  It's established pretty early on that Rey can handle herself and knows her way around a weapon.  Finn is a storm trooper who was trained from a very early age.  It's not a huge jump to assume he was trained to use melee weapons, he even fights another storm trooper in melee.  Second, Finn fought a Kylo Ren who had just been shot in the gut and was bleeding out.  By the time Rey got in the action Finn had already injured both of Kylo's arms too.  This was in no way a full strength Kylo Ren, so I don't think this fight really turned out that outlandishly. There was no character development!What exactly were you expecting?  Did Luke suddenly become a full jedi by the end of A New Hope?  Was Han a fully fledged respected leader of the rebellion by then?  How much development did Leia get between being getting captured and handing out medals?  This is the first movie, you can't honestly compare the development of the original trilogy cast over the course of 3 movies to the new characters' development in 1.  The main players in TFA (Rey, Finn, Kylo) all had fairly complete arcs, but are still developing.  It would have been nice to get some more screen time for Poe and some of the First Order leaders but you can't spend half the movie on everybody. It's just A New Hope all over again!I mentioned this above, but yeah it's pretty similar.  Droid with important information gets stranded on a desert planet and finds a naive hero who finds a mentor who takes them to a bar to get to the rebellion and blow up the death star.  There's also the ""I am your father"" moment from Empire Strikes Back and the starship battles from Return of the Jedi.  Yes, I saw all that too.  The thing is it's a whole new set of characters with different backgrounds and motivations.  I think it's a fine way of rebooting the franchise without alienating the fan base and so long as they use it as a setup and go in a different direction in the next movie it will have been worth it.  The real core of this conflict is that the First Order is very much on the offensive and actively attacking the resistance/republic  which is a far cry from the Empire trying to crush that insignificant rebellion.",1
1556,"Episode 7: The Force Awakens was exactly as it should be. Silly, awesome, dumb, serious, adventurous, and a lot of fun. It was Star Wars, through and through.",1
1557,"This movie was about passing the torch to the new generation of actors/characters. It succeeded indeed, since all the new pg are extremely interesting and the future looks brighter than ever",1
1558,"Filled with great characters (both familiar and unfamiliar), exhilarating action, and spectacular visuals, director J.J. Abrams has affectionately brought the beloved franchise back to life. Everything about this movie screams Star Wars.",1
1559,"First, this movie made me feel like I was watching Star Wars. I was in the theatre like I was 10 years old again, captivated by the magic and awe of the universe.",1
1560,"So did movie live up to the hype? No. Is this because the movie is terrible. No actually, it's because of Disney's shameless marketing that made it out to be the second coming of Jesus, I mean c'mon, BB8 oranges? But fruits and religion aside, The Force Awakens is a fantastic return to form. No it's not better than Empire but it definitely stands as high as A New Hope and if not, higher than Return of the Jedi. This isn't a perfect movie but that's no reason to overreact and give a damn zero. The movie has heart. I felt more here than all of the Prequels combined. It's acting, writing, and direction are all terrific. One thing that stands out is it's comedy. This is definitely the funniest Star Wars film ever. Is it the best movie of all time? Nope. Is it movie of the year material. Yes. Time to celebrate guys, Star Wars is good again. Notice: I give this a perfect score only to counter one of many zeros given by some angry Legends fan or mediocre review. My true score would be a 9 out of 10.",1
1561,"Powerful characters and the relationships that develop make up for a lackluster story.  Dialogue and acting is a VAST improvement from previous episodes. Yes, there are parallels to A New Hope, but only in style and delivery. The characters are unique and their motivations are unique. This is NOT a complete rehash of A New Hope in my opinion. The ending may seem anti climactic to some, but in my opinion it was very gutsy! There is a lot of unanswered questions and unfinished business that we should give the creative team the benefit of the doubt will be dealt with to the fans satisfaction in Episodes 8 and 9. There are some plot holes that seem intentional (we'll see if they were) and some that I'm on the fence as to whether they were intentional, or if the viewers are just expected to assume what happened. One of those plot holes has to do with who actually SURVIVED at the end of the film.",1
1562,"So just meanderings for Star Wars The Force Awakens (no spoilers). Every professional reviewer (that I've seen) and fan has basically peed all over themselves with glee stating this is either the best or second best (behind The Empire Strikes Back) 'Wars film ever. I really think that this is exaggerated in that the Lucas Prequels Episodes 1-3 were so CGI heavy, plot light, and basically added nothing to the franchise story that the bar was set EXTREMELY low expectation-wise to begin with. Add to that the fact that J.J. rebooted Star Trek a story-lite, action-driven, WB infused, fight laden, explosive caricature of it's former plot driven incarnations further cooled expectations of the new Star Wars trilogy under his direction. I think only the fact that it is a modestly story driven film, using actual sets, ships, and characters/extras that it completely eclipses the Lucas prequels. Add to that it's been 10 years since there's been a Star Wars movie, the fandom hunger is present for anything, especially something resembling the original trilogy glory. J.J. delivers in that respect but to be objective and not caught up in the ""here and now"" of the revival moment. The Force Awakens is no where near the richness of Empire Strikes Back and likely falls short of the birth of the franchise in A New Hope. At best I'd say it competes mightily for third place against Return of the Jedi. Frankly if not for the annoying Ewoks and laughable failing of the Imperial forces against said stick-wielding monkeys in Return, this new film would easily fall to fourth best of seven in the current franchise run. While it is heads above the Lucas toy sale driven aims of the prequels it still smacks of a dumbing down to appeal to the Facebook scrolling masses and fails to fully vest yourself to the characters and story as the original trilogy did. The one thing that absolutely drove me nuts is that (especially) the two new main characters were always pantingly breathless in multiple scenes in the movie. All this heavy breathing became really like nails on a chalkboard for me. If you movie is really THAT action-packed that your main characters have to pant through the film either pretend they're super-human and let them stop panting or else cut down on jumping from one action sequence, to another, to another, to another and perhaps fill those gaps with plot and character development.",1
1563,"While it's not perfect, I went into this movie hoping for something relatively on par with The Empire Strikes Back, and I wasn't disappointed. In my opinion, this is at least the 3rd best Star Wars movie in the series The Bad: - BB-8- Some genuinely bad dialogue in one scene. Two characters spouting exposition in the most wooden way possible. Compared to the writing in the rest of the movie, this scene stuck out like a sore thumb- The plot feels a bit muddled in places The Good: - Great new characters that are easy to sympathize with, regardless of what side they're on- A few exciting action sequences with intelligent solutions given by the protagonists- Rylo Ken is a very memorable villain, one whose motivations aren't black and white- While it doesn't make 100% the entire time, the plot pays a lot of homage to A New Hope- The plot (while muddled at times) has some very memorable and well executed moments- The movie really FEELS like Star Wars through and through, something that could be difficult to say about any of the prequel movies- One scene in particular was very artistically done, not something I would normally associate with a Star Wars movie. The theme of light and dark was used to full and brilliant effect If you've ever enjoyed any Star Wars films before, don't hesitate to check this one out. Whether you have high expectations or not, you will at least enjoy this movie, if not love it. The Force Awakens feels like A New Hope 2.0, simultaneously the same yet superior to the original. This movie reminded me of why I loved Star Wars in the first place",1
1564,"If you have enjoyed any of the Star Wars movies, this is well worth seeing. If you enjoy Sci-fi movies that lean towards action, this is well worth seeing. If you are a film snob who hates really popular  movies, skip this. The reality is no movie will make everyone happy. Just like there is no one song or musical artist that everyone loves. The Force Awakens has a target audience that just so happens to have been building up for about forty years now. There is enough retro items to keep the fan base happy while offering an entertaining experience for those less familiar with the Star Wars universe. Try to fight the sense of over hype and just watch the movie for what it is, a fun Sci-fi flick. If the Star Trek reboot movies worked for you, this one will as well. Nice to see Lucas Films new owners have done what George could not. The overall quality of acting was higher, the pacing was better, and the story was better. J.J. Abrams has come through with a quality movie that maybe just beat The Empire Strikes Back as the best of the Star Wars series so far. If I had complaints it would be the way certain characters were able to do things that in theory people had to be trained to do. Piloting certain vehicles that in theory they had not used before or styles of fighting they had never done before. Nothing against the actor that play Kylo Ren, but he seems to tall and different from his parents. Small issue, but that is just something that bugged me. Resist hating this movie just because it is so popular. To many people feel they must balance score by giving a super low score to a popular movie. In some cases, I do think movies get higher scores do to great marketing over good quality, but this had both. Worthy of the high praise.",1
1566,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have ever had. Star Wars is back! And the hype couldn't be more real, but luckily J.J. Abrams has crafted the best Star Wars movie in 32 years. This was easily my most anticipated film of all time, as it was for many other Star Wars fans like myself. But watching this movie I instantly fell back into this universe and seeing all the old characters was like reuniting with old friends who have been gone a while. But what surprised me was how much I loved all the new characters and they almost instantly felt like they belonged in Star Wars. I loved Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, as she was truly a great heroine who might've stole the entire show. Daisy Ridley's sweet, rough, and emotional performance has cemented her in Star Wars for me and I cannot wait to see her in the future of films. Finn, played by John Boyega, was a fantastic new character and had a heart of gold. John Boyega's performance had heart, humor and was overall a grand addition to this great cast of characters. Poe Dameron was another new character that I also really loved, as he was a wisecracking badass pilot who felt similar to Han Solo in the original Star Wars. I wish we had gotten to see more of him, but thats what sequels are for. Oscar Isaac plays Poe and brings a great performance to the film and shows once again why he is one of the best rising stars in Hollywood. Kylo Ren was, along with Rey, my favorite new addition to the Star Wars characters. He was scary, mysterious, complex and he is a brilliant pressence on screen that's similar to Darth Vader. Adam Driver does a fantastic job as the character and handling his dark and tragic character. BB-8 was also a great new droid and I quickly loved him for his humor and personality that we learn through his interactions. He really captures the essence of droids with how while we can't understand their language, we know exactly who they are and what they are saying. Harrison Ford returns as the legendary Han Solo, and boy what a return it is. Han Solo was always one of my favorite characters of all time, and watching him kick ass and make smartass comments with Chewbacca at his side made me feel like a kid again. Ford brings everything he has to the role and I commend him for his unforgettable performance in this film. Seeing the entire old crew back was just indescribable. Seeing Leia, C3PO, Chewbacca, Han was like the greatest family reunion ever. It felt like we were finally home. J.J. Abrams has accomplished what many of us thought was the impossible, he has made Star Wars great again. I realize many people enjoy the prequels, which is fine of course, but for me it didn't have the magic of the original trilogy. This film captured the feel and fun of the original trilogy, without sacrificing the dark elements. The great cinematography was also something I noticed, as it made the emotional scenes and action sequences look and feel beautiful. Many people have said the film is very similar to the original Star Wars from 1977 and while there are definitely similarities, I don't see this as a compaint. To me this was a great homage to the original film and it made me happy to see that J.J. Abrams wanted to bring that experience back to life for both old and new generations. I loved this film so much. Of course it had small flaws, which can be found in the original trilogy as well if you look hard enough, but I had the highest expectations ever for this film and as someone who has loved Star Wars all his life I can say that its the best film since Return of the Jedi all those 32 years ago. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a phenomenal cinematic that was everything I wanted it to. It was emotional, funny, exciting, occasionally scary, and it did a perfect job at mixing the old and the new. The wait for Episode VIII cannot come fast enough.",1
1567,"Foreseeing the franchise's potential in the future, Disney has invested brilliantly by taking over Lucas Film and nominating Abrams as the director of Episode VII, who has done everything just right in reviving the fantasy saga. Having himself written the script with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, the film finds itself recycling the basic formula - An adventure beyond the galaxy, loaded with ton of action sequences, sense of humors and emotions, but the most important is the overall improvements from the last prequel 10 years ago. While the story is much predictable, the lightsaber fight might not as epic as the original trilogy and the ending seems a bit unpleasant, the return of the original cast mixing with fresh bloods creates a great chemistry in developing the climax, the visual effects are undeniable marvelous thanks to its wide angle cinematography and breathtaking CGIs, even the scores from John Williams, powerful as always to hold audiences at their seats until the end of credits roll. Although being formulaic, less darker antagonists and certain characters are underused, Abrams is still successful in awakening the nostalgic force of this galactic sci-fi adventure.",1
1568,"Super fun not really great cinema I had a great deal of fun watching this flick. It's not a great movie but it serves it's purpose as a bridge episode from the original trilogy to the new universe. The performances were spot on and i'm intrigued to see more.",1
1569,"A competent Star Wars film, great new characters, great practical effects and great to see our old star wars stars (no pun intended) back, but on the story side, it is weak. Not that is not a good story, but it is litterally the same as episode IV. I understand that they wanted the movie to be familiar to older audiences and bringing back that nostalgia factor, while introducing the universe to younger people, but its just too similar to ignore. But still, it is better than episode 1 and 2 and it is well-made, well-shot and a lot of fun.",1
1570,"Well what can I say. I have created an account just to write a review. I really enjoyed the movie, of course there are some flaws in the plot and some questionable acting choices but all in all it is a great experience. It really does feel like Star Wars, the feeling I got when I was watching the original trilogy was the same here.Some people say that the film is a remake of A New Hope and the the whole movie was a bit rushed and well  these statements do have some truth to them. Personally the rushed plot is something I have noticed too, but I beleive that this is a build up to an even more monumental sequel, with more information on the characters on so on.I recommend to see this movie either you are a Star Wars fan or not. I will watch it again no doubt about that.",1
1571,"scenario: weakacting: goodeffects: very good it is a good star wars film. i think better than 1-2-3 but scenario is conflicting. i did not like it. kylo ren is very special character. i think he will be 2nd and 3rd movies. effects are great",1
1572,"The story is surprisingly closely lifted from the original Star Wars, but still worth seeing.  The plot is better than any of the prequels, but the action scenes are a little below Revenge of the Sith.  Go see it for the sense of nostalgia, that it relies heavily on, but don't expect anything new.",1
1573,"Enjoyed the movie! On the side note: I'm amazed of some reviews/ ""essays"", hey guys is just a movie! Enjoy life, there are other things more important to be upset...",1
1574,"I'll keep this as absolutely spoiler-free as possible and I'll try not to say everything all the other positive reviews haven't said already. After the first trailer for The Force Awakens came out, I basically put myself into a media blackout for the movie. Star Wars was a huge part of my childhood, so I wanted as much of the plot to be as fresh as possible on release. Going into the theater, I couldn't have told you anything about the characters, not even a name for most of them. I mean, I assumed Poe was the main focus of the movie because I saw the Lego version of his X-wing for sale everywhere. Part of the blackout was because of the Prequels. I just wanted to keep an open mind. I remember loving Episode I as a kid simply because it was more Star Wars. I didn't want to watch this movie and just sweep the mistakes under the rug just so I can keep loving the series. The Force Awakens does take a few missteps, but I absolutely loved it. J.J. Abrams, the writers, and the cast keep the spirit of the series alive, but they aren't held down by it. It's a lot like the first new Star Trek in that way. There are enough references and throwbacks to the originals to make the old fans smile, but not so much that it would alienate newer viewers. It also does a good job of not relying on the old cast. Each of the new characters are interesting their own ways. I just can't wait to see what happens with them next. There's also a wonderful feeling when each of the old characters are introduced. It's like seeing an old friend each time. The camera work is excellent. J.J. Abrams keeps the focus exactly where it needs to be each time. One scene follows our heroes engaged in a tight ground battle, but keeps the camera trained on a distant X-Wing battling TIE fighters in the sky, and the whole thing really gives you a sense of the size of the battle. More great camera work can be found during a tense showdown between the heroes and the villain later in the movie. The wide shot perfectly captures the light side struggling against the dark. They absolutely nailed the special effects. The soundtrack and sound effects are spot on too. The wail of the TIE fighters and X-Wings, the targeting system from the turrets of the Millenium Falcon. Awesome. The only real downside is that it follows the A New Hope formula a bit closely. That, and some of the larger twists (don't even google any character names if you want to avoid spoilers!) can be seen coming, but even that doesn't detract from the movie. Ok, if you're still reading along with me, I'll cut to the chase. Even if you're not a huge fan, go see the movie. The whole thing can be described in one word: fun! I really don't know what the negative reviewers wanted to see different. Frankly, I have to wonder if they're just trying to be different by not liking it.",1
1575,"Star Wars is an interesting beast. It ignited the imaginations of the world in the 70s and produced one of the best plot twists in cinema history. It made a return with flash that got too bright and some terrible writing but kept the imagination and fantastic set-pieces. Now, Star Wars is out of George Lucas' hands and into Disney's. Like many I was worried Star Wars would be used and abused, but if Force Awakens is anything to go by then those worries can rest easy(er). The plot uses most of the same plot devices as A New Hope, but it never feels like a re-make but it's own thing. In fact, the movement back towards the smaller scale galaxy helps keep this new film together, while the Prequels got a bit lost in their own vastness. Rey and Finn are great characters, as is the brilliant BB-8 while Han Solo and Chewie are in their element improvising their way through every encounter. Kylo Ren is a total bastard, but a conflicted bastard manipulated by the Supreme Leader Snoke, who's silly name can't hide his terrifying power over Kylo. Not all the characters are great, though. C3-PO and R2-D2 seem to be there for the sake of being there, Poe seems to be there just to push the plot forwards occasionally without much real reason to be involved while Captain Phasma, bigged up as an intimidating hunter, ends up a chump. Still, what Abrams brought something George Lucas has no concept of; subtly. Not every detail is screamed in your face because they don't have to be, much like what Kylo Ren's really struggling against internally and revealed entirely when he kills his father (a scene that wasn't exactly unpredictable but still shocking). This also applies to Finn, who made me feel sympathy for the Stormtroopers with only one line of dialogue, which Lucas likely would have done with an overly lengthy scene. The Force Awakens is a fantastic return for the franchise with not a dud scene in sight. I'm looking forwards to what else can be done with the franchise, though remain a bit apprehensive about the idea of a new Star Wars based film ever year.",1
1576,"Well, what can I say about this movie? That it is FREAKING AWESOME! I saw all the previous Star Wars movies, and Star Wars:The Force Awakens is one of my favourites. I have no complains about Kylo Ren not being as intimidating as Darth Vader, but he has his reasons to not be. And they had to kill Han Solo somehow, Harrison Ford is getting old for the character, and I fought his death quite honorable. The fight scenes are just getting better, and the mentions to the older movies are very well done. And that is why I give this movie a 10/10, I just could´t see any flaws",1
1577,"Wow. Just Wow. This Star Wars is incredible. Daisy Ridley is amazing. I am completely happy with the way that it turned out! I was very happy with the story line. I don't want to give away too much! Go see it for yourself!",1
1578,"I am so so happy with the way this movie turned out. It is exactly what it needed to be. The action is intense. It is funny. The characters are lovable. Daisy Ridley is my new favorite actress. Do yourself a favor, take the kids, and go enjoy this movie. I very much feel as though anyone who is giving this a zero has multiple accounts and literally went in to the movie only hoping it to end so they could go home and give it zero stars. Do not feed the trolls. It is a very fun, intense, exciting, heartfelt story that will move your emotions. It is what film is supposed to be.",1
1579,"This is a Star Wars movie.  That is the most accurate review you can give it. Think about what you feel when you think of a Star Wars movie. This movie is that. It is what I pictured it to be.  From the character intros, like Fin a stormtrooper that whats no part in the uniform, to Poe Dameron, the best rebel pilot in the universe.  their stories unfold with little exposition and off the cuff remarks that occur in the background all while the action is occurring.  Gone are the long winded talks of the prequels, the movie covers story at a fast pace.  Similiar to an 80's Spielberg movie, where you only know what you need to know at the moment.  BB-8 is the break out star of this movie.  Is it possible to think a robot is adorable.  He has personality and because his head can move it allows him the ability to emote emotions with his head.  To the point that you can understand his beeps and whistle.  Rey is awesome, a little bland compared to Fin and Poe but then again we see the journey thru her eyes.  The trailers show you nothing about her and I think that was awesome.  Shes smart, funny, and determined, while not coming off as **** or bossy.  Something all great female leads must have.  Adam is awesome, but talking to much about him would ruin the plot. I loved this movie, my only grip is they borrowed a little to much.  I understand that Lucas has always said that his movies always rhyme and are familiar, but at times this felt like a shot to shot remake to A New Hope.  I almost gave this movie an 8 or even a 9 because of that.  However, I had to give it a 10, because it captured what I felt as a child going to movies.  I loved learning about the new characters.  I wanted more Poe, Fin, and Rey.  I love the nostalgia but I loved more how the old blended with the new.  I had a smile on my face the whole time.  I felt like a high idiot who couldn't stop smiling.  I felt the way I wanted to feel in the prequels but never did.  I was never bored and was always smiling and excited.  The movies not perfect but it's fun, like a Star Wars movie should be.",1
1580,"This movie may not be a perfect 10, but it sure is not a 0. I had a blast watching this movie. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish and that's exactly what I hoped for. I get the dissatisfaction regarding the parallels with ANH, but it's grossly overplayed. Looking through some of these reviews, it seems clear that some people are dead set on being as disappointed as possible.",1
1581,"It was questionable whether we would ever have a Star Wars film set after the ends of Return of the Jedi. However after Disney purchased the mega franchise from creator George Lucas fans were treated to the announcement of a new Star Wars trilogy, Episodes VII, VIII and IX.The Force Awakens, the first major Disney related Star Wars product after the complete wipe of the Lucas era extended universe lore, centres around Rey and Finn as they embark on a quest to find a missing Luke Skywalker. Rey is a scavenger on the planet Jakku and eagerly awaits the return of her parents who left her on the planet when she was a child. Finn was a Stormtrooper for The First Order, a group that rose from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. As the duo meet thanks to a droid containing Skywalkers location, they begin to be hunted down by The First Order and require the help of the Rebellion to survive. Headed by General Leia Organa, the two young heroes aided by Han Solo and Chewbacca take on The First Order and the force sensitive Sith apprentice Kylo Ren; however in the process one of the two begins to find that they themselves can also use the force. The Force Awakens is very similar to the 1977 original Star Wars. The plot is almost identical and the devices it uses to reel the viewer in are extremely similar, though updated for a 21st century audience. It's a fun Star Wars experience that delivers all it should have done and succeeds in living up to the massive hype built up around the film. However the film also suffers some major issues in terms of explaining how The First order can even exist in a galaxy that is now governed by The New Republic, as well as what role the Rebellion actually has in the galaxy anymore. Not to mention how our force sensitive hero can within one scene become adept in the powers of the force as well as use powers they have never seen used before (such as the mind trick). Plus how our non-force sensitive character can survive a lightsaber battle with antagonist Kylo Ren, let alone cause him to back down and retreat. It's a great entry point for people new to Star Wars as no prior knowledge of the series is necessary before viewing, as events of the original trilogy are mentioned in passing and the prequel trilogy is never spoken of (rightly so). It also manages to deliver a brilliant new chapter in the Star Wars universe, even if it is just giving a new lick of coat to an old story in many ways. It has it's problems, but I'm sure many of the questionable aspects will be resolved in future fiction. For now, The Force Awakens is a great film and one of the best entries in the series.",1
1582,"I had a very bad feeling about this. But the movie was unexpectedly good. Not a masterpiece though. But enjoyable. It's still Star Wars. In some parts it forgot to be a Star Wars movie, in others it's full of fanservice, but the story? Believable. The characters? Well written, new. The humour? Definetely the Star Wars type. The continuity? Kept. So, go see this movie yourself, you could enjoy it or hate it, but remember: it's a Star Wars movie, nothing less, nothing more. 7.5 is my vote, because this is a ""good start"".",1
1583,"Obviously it's all a matter of opinions, however I feel a lot of the extremely high scores for this film are rather reactionary for what is, essentially, a remake of A New Hope. All of the same beats of previous films are there: The rogue apprentice turned to the dark side, the jedi master that trained him who has now hidden himself away, the Death Star at the end of the film (yes, it is just another death star) and, finally, the average hero taken off of a desert planet who discovers they've been in touch with the force this whole time. To top it all off, the twist in the middle of the film is that Ren is related to Luke and Leia, just to borrow some emotional punches from Empire, too. Who'd have thought? The problems in this film are quite noticeable and mostly concern the plot, given that there is simply too much going on at any given time and the audience is never given the time to truly relate and sympathise with what is going on. The Death star sub plot is extremely tacked on and doesn't feel weighty or meaningful, and the film really takes a nosedive around the time Leia is introduced, as suddenly there's so much to do/explain that none of it feels explored to the extent needed to make it have an impact. Obviously those are some problems I have with the film, however I have given it 8/10, a very good score, for a reason. The two main characters, Finn and Rey, are both interesting and vulnerable, making them relatable. They are acted extremely well by a new crop of actors who seem to have been cast very well indeed. Kylo Ren as a villain was an interesting choice, as he wasn't this almighty being such as Anakin was in the prequels (I still can't get over the Jesus symbolism), he was insecure and weak in some aspects. His inability to separate himself from Vader and become his own villain made me care about his plight and I'm interested to hear his and Luke's backstory. And, unlike Anakin, he wasn't unstoppable. This brings me onto the point of the action. What an improvement over the prequels. Where the prequels went for more choreographed sequences that seemed like performances and didn't actually contain an ounce of tension, the lightsaber battles here were rough, messy and tension filled. Inexperience led to these makeshift and dirty fights that were more about the characters fighting in them than the fight itself. The Falcon chase scene was also brilliant, and looked amazing. Well done, JJ. Speaking of Abrams, he helmed this film expertly. The cinematography was masterful, as were the locations he chose to film in. Every shot was beautiful, with crisp wide shots and a mix of dark and light locations giving the movie a real visual fidelity. Literally the only issue this film in regards to aesthetics was that one character who was hoarding Luke's saber, she looked so badly CGIed and it took me out of the experience every time she was on screen compared to the impressiveness of practical effects used for everything else. Expectedly, the sound design was also perfect, but was it ever not going to be? Han's role in this film was better than expected, and his eventual death carried with it a lot of weight, even if it was predictable the minute we discovered Ren was his son. It's undeniable that it was an emotional and very effective moment, as was the film's very last shot of Luke and Rey. Overall, the film suffers from a lack of original moments under-pining its wonderful environments and characters, and, in typical Abrams fashion, the story moves along at such break neck speed that some glaring and in cohesive elements (or lack thereof) to the story can be glazed over. It's a film best experienced in the moment, and without too much dwelling upon its intricacies and details can be thought of as a very good film, and one that has left us so many questions that I have no doubt in my mind episode 7 will be even better, and worth the wait.",1
1584,"Star Wars Episode VII is a familiar yet refreshing chapter to the beloved saga. You can tell it's a star wars movie, yet you can also see J.J. Abrams fingerprint all over it. By brining back old casts and new, the movie allows the older generations of views to feel nostalgic while newer generation is introduced to the amazing franchise. They did a fantastic job of immersing the viewers how much time have passed since episode VI with original casts whom have aged quite a bit since then. The story it self is a retelling of episode IV, but i think it was far more grand scale than the original. The movie isn't perfect (as cinema sins say, ""No movie is without a sin""). For Example, Mark Hamil doesn't even get a line. He just stands there looking gloomy. Also, not enough time is spent on the character development of the antagonists. In conclusion, SW VII is a great film for all ages. It is a must-see movie",1

1586,"BRILLIANT,EXCITING,VIOLENT. J.J Abrams has once again taken a beloved movie franchise, and saved from the darkness it had previously fallen(HINT HINT, the prequels, HINT HINT) and turned it into a smash hit. Now i'm a little biased, since i've been a STAR WARS fan since i grew up, this movie really took a new role in the franchise, Bringing in new faces and old ones, filming on set locations, back to the original source. many people criticize this movie due to the fact that its plot is similar to a NEW HOPE,well so was RETURN of the JEDI, a movie we take to our hearts was a relish of the first one. THE FORCE AWAKENS, however brought in new ideas and many twists in turns in it that you dont want to miss a single second. I give this an 8 because the plot was so-what similar to a new hope, lack of character development(Captain plasma,Poe,Luke,leia,etc).",1
1588,"Omg! sooo good!! I enjoyed this movie quite a bit but I'll let you know now that I am not obsessed with the Star Wars Franchise and really only saw the first 6 movies this year. This being said I was worried how the new one was going to turn out and worried that it would be utter crap but the people making the movie obviously knew they had a lot to live up to. Of course the ending pissed me off being a cliff hanger and all but it definitely sparked the interest of wanting to see the next one. I agree with my husband that the story does feel a bit repetitive to the other movies (mission). However, that didn't really bother me. I loved the lead character Rey she was an awesome kick ass heroine. I actually really enjoyed the entirety of the cast! great movie!",1
1589,"Short review - See it before someone blows it for you.  There are things that just won't be the same if you know them ahead of time. Not a masterpiece, but very good. Longer review - It's here, and it's good.  A wonderful accomplishment considering folks like myself who literally have a lifetime of expectations built up for THIS movie.  There are some truly heart-felt moments in this film. Being critical - this film does stay too close to familiar themes at times. It's a strength of the movie, and it's greatest crutch.  It's necessary because the film seeks to bring the audience back to the feel of the original trilogy that may have been alienated a bit by the prequels.  It's also necessary to bring the younger audience along.  However, the best parts of the film are the things that are entirely new.  A positive for the series moving forward. The new characters are excellent, and Rey is a wonderfully strong female protagonist.  Her strength appealed to many young girls in the theater, exclaiming that ""This is the best movie ever!"" at the end.  The cast, in general, is more diverse than the original series. Visually, the film looks great and is beautifully photographed.  This film lacks the over-the-top CG of the prequels, and lacks the lens-flares of Abrams' Star Trek films. Due to the familiar themes noted above, the film doesn't venture into new territory much.  At times, it feels more like Indiana Jones than Star Wars.  This isn't bad, it's simply different.  While the film isn't a masterpiece, the ending is, and sets up the next film for greatness.  JJ Abrams lands the film in exactly the right place.  It's wonderful. Definitely a must see.  Old fans will embrace it's homage to the original films, and new fans will enjoy a generation of new characters and villains. The film leaves you wanting more, and I can't wait.",1
1590,"Return to the beloved fantasy adventure, Star Wars: The Force Awakens will be a journey many will cherish for years to come. Rejoice fans of sci-fi and fantasy, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is as good as advertised. It follows the footstep of Episode IV, using gallant action adventure theme with lighthearted and effective humor. The characters are very approachable, both the new heroes on the path of finding their selves and the old veteran who will produce such irresistible nostalgic effect. J.J. Abrams knows what worked and what didn't, and he appropriately follows the time proven classic. The plot may feel a bit much like Episode IV, but it's more of a gleeful return than mere imitation. This is a story of epic saga as it’s meant to be, following courageous yet easily identifiable characters. It's not an overstatement that the movie transported me back to my childhood. The new two leads Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) are absolutely likeable. In a sense, they are the successor or Luke and Leia, and both of them perform valiantly. Finn is not the usual heroic type, but he's endearing all the same. He would be a fan favorite as he's exuberant and delivers most of the incredibly well timed humor. Rey is the heart of the new title. She represents what Luke did back decades ago, someone who is determined although apprehensive about finding her fate. These two are not the typical troupe, but they will be most likely universally accepted since they are a good mix of fresh look and fantasy characters done right. A few familiar faces, and without spoiling much, return. Han Solo is charismatically bringing the same that made him famous. There are a few moments where he stands for a bit, reveling on the past that is virtually infectious to the audience. Visual effect, as expected, is very pleasant. There's more grit and detail on the chaos, as well as more menacing look on the light saber or laser beam. However, the retro screen transition still looks as good as ever. Star Wars: The Force Awakens, just like A New Hope, will definitely be a journey many will cherish for years to come.",1
1591,The best movie I have ever seen! Definitely worth the 3 hour wait in line. Everything is extremely well done and there are some twists that I never would have guessed. My only complaint is that in certain spots it drags a bit but that is my only very minor complaint.,1
1592,"Finally. And wow. Two words I found myself saying at the premier last night. Finally, we get to dive back into the characters and struggles of the original trilogy, and wow, Abrams really outdid himself with this one. I recognize that this movie is not for everyone, just like all movies are not for everyone. That being said, this movie is for me. Let me tell you why, and maybe it will diffuse some gripes by those this movie is not for. It did not lay everything out for you. It did not make the Star Wars universe notably bigger or more flamboyant. It did make you aware of the potential for how much bigger it will be. It did make you think in a movie that could have let you shut your brain down for two hours. And I think that is its biggest success. George Lucas initially created the saga as a series of allusions to powerful mythologies and universal messages, but somewhere along the way he began to treat his audience as if they were toddlers that needed to see or hear more exposition chronicling the feelings of everyone involved. And it backfired on him. We began to reject his messages as glamorous cgi overpowered them. What Abrams did was bring those messages back to the front and let the feelings and motivations of his characters display themselves in ways the audience could viscerally identify. We don't know why Kylo Ren chose the path he did or where Rey is from or why The First Order is so mysterious, but we can make inferences based on the evidence provided, and let me tell you, the personal imagination is a much more powerful storytelling device than any medium outside our mind, and Abrams found a way to fully exploit this to make the story a potentially powerful message again. Yes, it retreads familiar territory in order to pay respects to the ot, but it makes it a logical and determined decision rather than an act of laziness. As for the acting, I only didn't like Leia. Carrie fisher is kind of weak in the role, but still does a fine job of bringing us a wearied and down trodden Leia so desperate to escape her reality that she slips back into a role familiar to her. Harrison Ford is once again the Han Solo we want and need him to be. The new players are fantastic as well. Daisy Ridley is surprisingly strong in the role. John Boyega is extremely likable and provides much needed humor. Oscar Isaac brings a bit of nuance to a character that could have easily been a Wedge Antilles clone. And Adam Driver... Everything wrong with Hayden Christensen was improved upon here. A villain with notable edges of psychosis, mysterious motivations that make you try to piece together why he did what he did. He was the highlight. And to everyone complaining about his appearance...smh. I think back to how Darth Vader was portrayed initially and I'd say we have the potential for a much stronger, potentially just as iconic, villain. There were some slip ups with dialogue or a brief moment of lazy writing, but few few few. I'm a Star Wars fanboy, but for the messages, not the pictures.",1
1593,I was shocked that this movie was actually good. I was expecting Disney to destroy this reboot os Star Wars but the plot and characters in this movie are done very well and it is a really good movie.,1
1594,"JJ told us a history, this is not new for sure, but he got it. I mean. he is a superb director who can tell a history and cast his characters very well. Surely is a new hope for this Brand and for all Starwars lovers. Do not expect a brand new history  or even characters with deep development",1
1595,"It's been 10 years since we've last experienced a Star Wars movie (not including the Clone Wars cartoon movie). We've had good one and we've had bad ones. So the question is, does ""The Force Awakens"" hold up? Yes! I believe it does. And here's why. It captured the beauty and essence of what makes Star Wars great. The music, the action sequences, the great characters and the story. People have argued that it's just a rip off of A New Hope. While I agree it replicates A New Hope at parts, that's not what the story is about. I promise I won't spoil the main plot in case you haven't seen it. I love the new characters, particularly Daisy Ridley's Rey. She is a strong female character that is a blast to watch on screen. I also love Oscar Issac as Poe Dameron, John Boyega as Finn and even Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. He's a villain with a real internal conflict which makes his character fascinating to watch. Even the old cast is great once again, particularly Harrison Ford as Han Solo. But have to give credit where credit is due. J.J. Abrams directed a fantastic movie. He captured the heart and spirit of what made Star Wars unforgettable. He brought us new fantastic characters as well as brought back old characters we've come to know and love. There was a lot of passion from his directing and even writing alongside Larry Kasden and Michael Arndt. Now look, the movie does have some issues. The ending comes off as convenient, there is some noticeable CGI and elements of A New Hope are easily noticed, but it's the lure and spectacle that makes this movie so damn fun to watch. Overall, it's a return to form for Star Wars and i can't wait to see what's next in store. I give ""The Force Awakens"" an A!",1
1596,"This is what Star Wars needed. JJ Abrams knew what was missing in the prequels: fast paced fun. Characters,mysthicism and plot are all developped between action or humor scenes. I loved Abrams direction, just as good as in the star trek movies but without abusing some light techniques this time. I'm a fan of all the Star Wars movies, specially the original trilogy. I loved de parallelism between The Force Awakens and A New Hope. Some criticize it, but I think it's a good way to recapture the spirit of the saga. Either way, it's not a copy paste. The political situation it's not the same, the characters are not the same. Plus, the character's impact of the ending it's not the same. Personally I didn't like just one thing, the artistic design on Snoke character. In another hand, some criticize the inner struggle of Kylo Ren saying it's ""emo"". I think this ""emo"" thing is the best thing about the character. It makes him deeper. There is plenty to build on now. I can't wait for the new movies.",1
1597,"Star Wars The Force Awakens brings back everything that fans like in the first trilogy. From the new and old cast all of them bring chemistry and good performances.However, its story and development of it is weak as at times if feels rushed or confusing. Overall, JJ. Abrams did what he was asked  to do which is reawaken the force and in that he succeeded.",1
1598,"Despite some questionable moments, it's a great movie. I'm not a SW fan, but I really enjoyed previous episodes, even watched Star Wars: Rebels spin-off and played couple SW games. And I gotta say, this all-new episode definitely has SW atmosphere, just maybe it's not as dark and mature as in previous movies. Funny moments are funny, people around me laughed naturally and I heard cheer every time when characters from original trilogy show up (first time, not every, ha-ha). Main heroine is awesome, great choice for a future female Jedi (possibly?), her antagonist also cool, but he really should't take off his mask this often. Just one thing confused me a little: new lightsaber looks inconvenient and too much like classic swords, I have no idea why lightsaber needs crossguard, wielder of the sword should be even more aware of his blade, considering the dangerous nature of the lightsaber. It looks cooler, that's no question! I prefer to see things more or less usable, reliable and elegant, even in fiction. But maybe all I said is just rubbish, overall movie is great, as I said before, so go see it if you haven't already!",1
1599,"(Spoiler Free, so you can all calm down)Years ago we were blessed with an epic trilogy unlike anything we'd ever seen.......many years later one man (whose name we dare not speak) set out to ruin it, not just ruin it but bring it to the verge of death.......and now here we are again with the beginning of yet another trilogy. Star Wars VII which has been saved from its potential destruction by none other than Mr J.J.Abrams. Cause let's face it who else were they gonna get to direct this.We can now rejoice in the knowledge that Star Wars is actually good again. Halle-freaking-lujah! I'm not going to talk about what happens in this movie, only that it will definitely feel like A New Hope. Perfect casting all round, it's established itself as something new mixed together with the things we loved about Star Wars along with some other cheesy moments that I'm willing to let slide. Will not disappoint, definitely recommended.",1
1602,"The Force Awakens is a fantastic film everything you see in the film is star wars bringing the universe to life in a brand new direction and visual representation, I loved the new and old characters in this film they all had such natural chemistry in their interactions they were also very well developed with interesting backstories, the story in this film is very reminiscent of a new hope in many ways but still brings new ideas and twists to the table and was a very good setup to a three part story, the practical and special effects melded well together giving the film a more realistic aesthetic (Like the original trilogy) the action sequences were also very well choreographed and crafted with much excitement and lastly Kylo Ren was an amazing villain with a presence so magnetic that I felt fear for any of the characters that came in contact with him he was also very sympathetic I understood why he thought the actions he took were the right thing which is what you need to make a great villain.The Force Awakens does have a few minor details that could have been done better. There was no explanation has to how Poe got out of the sinking sand. Captain Phasma was unexplored and underused. star killer was basically the death star just much largerbut other than that it was great.",1
1603,"I am not a Star Wars geek and simply saw this film without geek expectation glasses (I have seen all the other films). I very much enjoyed this movie. The cinematagraphy was lovely, the characters did their job to convey emotion and meaning. The action was great. It, for some reason, reminded me of the feel from Guardians of the Galaxy. If you are not a high expectation having Star Wars buff, then you will come away from this movie pleased. I went in knowing nothing and I loved every single minute of it. Enjoy!",1
1604,Love the movie it's great for all star wars fans  it way better than the prequels and  better than the new hope . It a good start to a new trilogy let's hope they can continue with this !!!,1
1605,"I don't know how to start review, but let's go. References to first saga: droid with some important info, new ""Death Star"", sand planet etc. This movie has everything SW fan can dream about: lightsaber duels, starfighter battles, a tonn of species through all the film, familiar characters and of course a lot of nice humor. In this part we can see much more jokes and what's important - it's still not comedy. Camera work, actors dialogues, everything looks very incredible ! Can't say I could expect more or less, but it definitely exceeded all expectations. We've been waiting for 10 years for this people and here it is guys - Star Wars Force Awakens ! 10/10 I want to add an update. This movie shows to us how important is love, friendship, humanity. It shows how brave a man could be. Brave because a man overcame his fear and stood for people he care of, stood for all the good people who needs it. Han gave the 2-nd chance to Ben though what he become. At some moment Finn understood he will sacrifice even his own life to save Rey. Can't say when I felt so much joy, happiness and excitement last time. Really. Some people may think that Star Wars is childish saga but now I'm 25 y.o. and I could definitely say - NO. This movie is for any age of people. It could teach you a lot of things. It's not about the jedis, siths or smugglers. First of all it's about the people, about their qualities. It's about light and dark...sides. Maybe I do like it so much because in this saga Evil is more dangerous than anywhere else and that's why our heroes must be even more brave and resolute. Can't remember any movies where darkness was so fearful and dread like in SW and Silent Hill. As for negative and average feedbacks - most of them just stupid and makes no sense. A lot of people complaining just because movie isn't like they imagine it beforehand. Or even better: people who dont like such genre or universe leaving negative feedback. This isn't cool but still they have right to do that. Thank you Star Wars actors and all involved in work on this movie !!!! Peace ^_^ Thanks for reading folks. Cheers.",1
1606,"For me it would be impossible for any Star Wars movie to trump the original series, the nostalgia alone is too high to top. That being said I enjoyed this thoroughly, just about as much as the original movies. I wish George Lucas passed to torch about a decade ago bc then maybe the prequels would have been good too. There are a few weird moments that keep it being a ten. Not gonna mention them bc they are spoilers",1
1607,"The film, while not particularly innovative in regards to the sci-fi elements (rehashing old props/settings from previous Star Wars films), sets up the new trilogy nicely. You could argue that too much of the film relies on nostalgia for the original trilogy and its characters, but Daisy Ridley and John Boyega's characters hold their own well and are developed properly, creating excitement and anticipation for where the story takes them in the next installment. There's no denying that the movie is entertaining and exciting, the only point of contention is whether the film achieves what you had hoped from a Star Wars sequel. For me, I think it did a great job.",1
1609,"Just came back from seeing Episode Seven and I have to say the movie was good, not close to being great.I'm not going to go through the plot line because tons of people have done that here.I will say that if you have seen the previous six, there should be no surprises.Each Star Wars movie seems to follow the same script. The performances of the actors were very good.I really liked Daisy Ridley,John Boyenga and Harrison Ford.I honestly thought there would be more Oscar Isaac. If I had to place this movie on my list of favorite Star Wars movies, it would rank number five, behind ""Revenge of The Sith"" JJ Abrams did a good job directing it. The writing was much better than the last three movies. Kudos to Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Dennis Arndt. I'm hoping I'm around for Episode Eight. Abrams has already said he regrets no taking it on. ""Brick"" director Rian Johnson will helming that one. If you have seen any of his movies, you know the Star Wars franchise is in good hands.",1
1610,"I had a lot of fun with this movie. Its no where near a flawless movie, but a good one none the less. The new characters where good. I felt that bringing on relatively unknown actors was a gamble, but it worked out. The sound effects were so punchy. It made that much more exciting of a movie. BB-8 was way less annoying than I initially thought. So that was a surprise.With that said, the movie does have flaws. The movie seemed rushed. It really wanted to get into the action that was shown off in the trailers, that everything else seemed rushed. With some of the major spoilers that happen, the rush them rather than building the suspense around it. Also it did seem like a rehash of A New Hope, and if they go that route, I hope they do not do the same with this trilogy, or else it will make it way too predictable.So with all that said, I had fun, and I would recommend it highly.",1
1611,"As a fan of Star Wars since the early 80s I was looking forward to this film - and was glad it delivered on all fronts.  This is an immensely enjoyable romp, and yes it does retread some old ground from A New Hope, but  that is not necessarily a bad thing in my eyes. The new characters are very likeable and believable, and the film is mainly well paced throughout and although the running time is over 2 hours it doesn't feel long. Harrison Ford puts in a great performance as well, reminding us why we loved the original films. JJ Abrams is obviously a fan of the series, there are several nods to extended universe in the film as well as a plethora of references to previous films. I thought Kylo Ren was a great baddie, the actor plays him as very calm yet at the same time mentally unhinged. Yes he's not that powerful compared to previous baddies but as was mentioned at one point, he hasn't completed his training - so this is just setting him up for the next films. People moaning about leader Snoke being computer generated - you do realise he's meant to be a hologram of the character? Also there are some plot holes which don't make sense around the main characters skills  but until we have seen the rest of the trilogy we need to let those go as I'm sure they may have some back story which will explain this. My only issue was the too brief appearance of Mark Hamill, but it seems like he will have a much bigger part in the next film. Everyone I know who has been to see this has loved this film, so not sure why so many people don't like it on this site, guess people just don't like the lack of back story in the film about why the galaxy is in the state it is, who the main characters are etc. But I'm guessing we'll get that in the next film, so I just enjoyed a great action romp with a sense of nostalgia and didn't think too much about it.",1
1612,"I will give it a 7 out of 10.  It is far more entertaining than Episode I through III, but probably lacks the originality, suspense, and plot of Episodes IV through VI. I find the new protagonist interesting and like-able, although sadly, there wasn't much room in terms of character development.  This is about the same for the antagonist, and for other supporting characters.  It's not that the acting was bad or anything, it's just that the movie left me wondering why I should care for them. The battle scenes are naturally amazing and good to look at, but it also leans a bit too far on the original Star Wars formula without bringing anything new to the table. In fact, it feels as though the whole movie was meant to strike at nostalgia more than do anything particularly ground-breaking, which is why I feel I cannot give it a higher score. All this said, if you are a Star Wars fan, then this is a movie that you cannot miss.  It's not perfect, but it will keep you entertained.",1
1613,"My review of Force Awakens is simple it is THE BEST STAR WARS FILM of the bunch in my opinion. Imagine everything you can from acting, to action, sound, visuals and this films hits the mark on every single element in my book. My only criticism of the film, the only single one I have is that the plot borrows far too much from the original trilogy specifically from A New Hope and I would have liked to see a more original storyline.",1
1614,My hypothesis is that the people that didn't like the new trilogy are the ones who grew up with the original. I saw the prequels first and ep3 was the best. So I knew there was no way it could be as dark and dramatic as revenge of the sith. And it wasn't. Most of the time it feels like a comedy that's pretty funny. Everything else is great. The only flaws are the final battle and kylo rens face,1
1615,"Be aware of your expectations and know the series for what it is and what it will become. This installment was directed by JJ Abrams, who does not reinvent the wheel, as the story is nothing groundbreaking. But it carried itself with dignity this time, it respected its characters, and delivered the right pace and feel necessary to make it feel like a classic Star Wars film. It is this new cast of characters and legacy direction that make this new episode serve as a reminder of why I fell in love with Star Wars in the first place. I can't hate it, although I certainly have a few gripes with the editing of the film. For instance, some of the exposition was blandly delivered or fell on deaf ears. I found a lot of it predictable, but it could just be me. Yet, I think it's safe to say that we expected the story's events to transpire as they did for good measure in the next episodes. I commend the efforts of the cast and crew to deliver a truly phenomenal entry in entertainment this year. Also a big thank you to John Williams, as the music made it Star Wars!",1
1616,"The Force Awakens isn't without it issues, including a fair number of plot holes and convenient occurrences, but after the much maligned sequels that were downright dull at times Episode VII sees the franchise return to form. The cast, both old and new, are great (particularly Daisy Ridley, in what amounts to the lead role) and the mix of action, plot exposition and humour is pretty much spot on. It's hard to imagine too many people not being entertained by what's on offer here.",1
1617,"Super Pro's:-I think I saw Coruscant get blown up-Adam Driver and Oscar Issac-No over-saturation of lightsabers and the force-No clown character or childishness-The prequels can now vanish into history alongside the Holiday Special and Ewok filmsPro's:-The tone of the film is so consistent and thick you can almost smell it-Best acting of any SW film.-The Visual effects, both CGI and practical-The Sound effects and score are all familiar yet new-General Hux and Kylo Ren are so human they're terrifying-The comic relief is sparse and doesn't interrupt the pacingCon's:-The Falcon's reveal was underwhelming and sloppily explained-The freighter scene/Han&Chewie reveal was frantic awkward filler-Too many New Hope parallels-That certain someone's death felt irreverent (lacking proper respect or impact)-Rey is an awesome pilot AND learns force powers despite no training or experience",1
1618,I loved this movie. YES there are some plot elements from the original 3 Star Wars films but this movie is extremely well done. One could argue this is better than any previous Star Wars film. The action is Indiana Jones'ish. The production qualities are certainly better than any previous edition by a large margin. It has the feel of the original 3 which is great. I got to recapture some of that magic of my younger days today.,1
1619,"This movie made me feel goosebumps,And it moved me to see the main characters become inspired and filed with a sense of purpose and belonging following what unassumingly is the light side of the force i.e the renunciation of disharmony with the world.  Fin and ray find a sense of belonging and purpose simply by desiring to help each other and the universe conspires in their favor ultimately bringing them togehter. I believe this is the magic of the Starwars universe and this movie embodies it and delivers. However ,everything that is dark is an antagonizing fascistic body , that is hungry for power and dominion   manifested by a single minded ideal that is the first order. And it feels a lot like the very first movie Episode 4 as result it  brings nothing new to the franchise except a correction to the reputation the last 3 prequels destroyed in the eyes of potential new audiences This movie is a blend of the old with the new,as many critics have said so far. Which I think Stars wars needed considering what the prequels did to the original cannon. People go see this movie.",1
1620,"Come on, it's Star Wars!Star Wars: The Force Awakens is finally here, and just like the previous movies, it's absolutely amazing.  The new characters give the movie a breath of fresh air, while keeping the elements that make Star Wars what it is.  The movie isn't really engaging, in fact during one part, I went off to get popcorn.  However once it starts to get good, it gets REALLY good.  The acting, the action, the new faces and especially the familiar faces make The Force Awakens something you don't want to miss for the world. Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens gets a 9/10.",1
1621,"A rich, dense, imaginative, visceral, fully entertaining experience.  Being a Star Wars original trilogy continuation, it ignites a plethora of catharsis from fans, which makes this film 'great'; if this weren't that, and/or I weren't one of those, it would be just 'good', with great acting from Daisy Ridley and John Boyega.Ridley's portrayal of Rey is one of the more touching performances I've ever seen, while Boyega provided an unexpected, expertly executed comedic affect with his Finn.",1
1622,"I loved the movie. In my opinion, it was fantastic and everything that I wanted it to be. The key words here are ""I"" and ""opinion"".  What bothers me is the fact that some people who did not like the movie feel that I am some kind of idiot or just plain crazy for my opinion of liking the movie.  If you did not like the movie, that is fine by me. You are 100% entitled to your opinion, but it is flat out just your opinion.  Remember, you can be the only person in the whole world that enjoys something, and the only thing that ever matters is how you feel.",1
1623,"A movie worthy to the Star Wars series for sure! While the movie mostly introduces a new cast, older characters make their return in style! The new main characters freshen the series up a bit and again makes it another interesting Star Wars movie to watch. The Force Awakens has a very interesting plot and succeeds to make every second of the movie fun to watch. The Force Awakens makes a great start to the Sequel trilogy.",1
1624,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens (conocida en español como Star Wars: El despertar de la Fuerza o La guerra de las galaxias: El despertar de la Fuerza) es una película estadounidense del género ópera espacial. Prevista para ser estrenada el 18 de diciembre de 2015,3 4 está escrita y dirigida por J. J. Abrams5 1 y es la séptima entrega de la saga Star Wars, atendiendo tanto a la fecha de estrenonota 1 como a la cronología interna de la serie, pues transcurre unos 30 años después del sexto episodio, Return of the Jedi.6 Inicia así una tercera trilogía, que se añade a las dos ya existentes.3 También es la primera película de la saga Star Wars en ser producida tras el retiro de George Lucas, quien aún así ha colaborado en ella como consultor.7 El reparto principal de la película está compuesto por los actores Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, Andy Serkis y Max von Sydow, con Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew y Kenny Baker retomando los papeles que ya habían interpretado en los episodios anteriores.8",1
1625,"I'm torn between it creating a new universe and new characters and the fact that it was a fun action packed nostalgia ride recreating the same excitement that I felt when I first watched New Hope.Deep down I wanted Mara, Ben Skywalker, the solo childern (Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin) I wanted  the legends universe.  I'm just going to be hopeful that will come sometime in the future and embrace this Canon for what it is. At the end I was still drawn in emotionally and excited for the next installment.  This movie was fun, had fresh twist built on the foundation of what made the original trilogy great. An Oscar winner... no, but a fun movie to get set your imagination on fire with ""what if""s and ""Where will it go""s.  If you like Star Wars/sci-fi go see this movie, I know I plan on going again.",1
1628,"Fantastic return of Star Wars to the big screen! J.J Abrams and cast did a  great job. The locations were beautiful, introduction to new characters and old characters on screen on screen was done very well. Daisy Ridley was outstanding.",1
1630,Pretty good but not epic as the first trilogy. At least better from the previous trilogy and without awful childish characters like Jar Jar Binks. I overally enjoyed even if it was not that original.,1
1631,"Brilliantly-crafted movie with beautiful effect, palpable tension, and great characters. The plot is a retreading of familiar points, more a remix than a sequel, and has some questionable holes and forehead-slappingly dumb moves. But you won't be thinking about that until afterward. In the moment, the experience will capture you. And that's what makes a good movie.",1
1632,"""New emotions, new exciting faces, new exciting faces wake up. JJ Abrams is reborn a hope that inexplicably had died in the world. Fans! Calm! Jeffrey has done and the best way.  Jacob to renovated, improved and matched what has been achieved by George"" It has finally arrived.  From the moment where it appears ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" with the intergalactic background,  the imposing yellow and majestic musical piece until the last sentence of ""Rey"" was felt the true awakening of the ""Force"". My eyes filled with tears, my heart beat faster than normal, emotion penetrated the entire audience in the theater, hands shaking me, I sweated, I screamed, I lived the ""Force"". Such is the beauty of the movie that you forget about the chronology of this saga, the only thing you care about is this loaded with action - adventure and fun as the first. 'The Force Awakens' has  reborn in my the love for this saga, and it's true, very few films keeps me on the edge of the seat for 135 minutes but you have achieved it, and not only to me, also to the billions of fans and non-fans of the world. The stealthily beautiful new creation of JJ Abrams and his co-writer Lawrence Kasdan opens the way in an epic manner for the following parts of the franchise that will break records at the box office. Familiar characters, new scenarios, new weapons, new ships, new characters, same chemistry, same love, same rapport are the mix that will end with points basic plot and story already known. The real ""Star Wars"" films have been based on personal and family ties: love, dreams,  blames, family and other ingredients that create the human being, in the seventh part revived all these family dilemmas raised in the previous films, about the secret of brotherhood between 'Han Solo' and Princess 'Leia'. Disney made us suffer with the extreme 'Luke's' absence in all marketing campaigns and even made us doubt about his presence in this episode, although all that suffering was worth it. The ancient characters: Leia Organa, Han Solo, BB-8, Chewie and others re seen with characteristics more old, showing his age to the surface.  Dark force rises with more force than ever before as 'First order'.  To replace the action that the masters can no longer take us, enter new and fabulous characters to the saga.Rey (Daisy Ridley), a survivor of resources in a desert country, Finn (John Boyega) or ex - guard of assault, and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) a pilot expert. This entails, to the spectacular performance of Adam Driver as Kylo Ren the great new villain, It's perfectly careful with the details, and his single voice shows his spite, hatred and disgust and sadness with his tantrums of toddler when they give a bad news. But personally who really woke up in my sentimentality was the Harrison Ford's performance , just displayed in screen and my madness explodes, ending with the incredible event that even I can't believe. Lightsabers (obvious blue and red) are cleverly better designed than the 80s and 70s and intuitive. So beautiful is this film that if there were no same lightsaber would be perfect. As we all know Abrams is fanatical to the landscapes of George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" films and in this film does so with a vengeance, from deserts enigmatic to terrifying forests. Our fields of vision are carried to the limit, Abrams takes care of every imperfection, and gives us an impeccable result, giving us drones, galaxies and other fantasies that would be impossible without the involvement of new technologies deployed (Industrial Light & Magic). ""Star Wars"" is one of the largest franchises (or the largest franchise) in the cinematographic world, and this time ""The Force"" does it in an exceptional way. Destroying the box office, praising to criticism, like fans, entertaining young and old that never had seen the saga, is a product for all and for everybody. ""The Force Awakens"" is ironically perfect, beautiful, sentimental, outstanding, entertaining, interesting, and not only is the best gift of Christmas, it's the best gift in the world to ""Star Wars"" and the fans because this time: ""The Force"" really awakens.",1
1633,"To paraphrase from the CNN movie review, the movie ""both resurrects old pleasures and points in promising new directions."" The movie fundamentally has touches of George Lucas' original movies but in director J.J. Abrams' hands there is a much needed shift in tone that brings the material closer to the feel of a Steven Spielberg film moving into an Indiana Jones realm. I think the tempo is a good combination because it keeps both current and new Star Wars fans' interest and lays a solid foundation for the future movies. The battles and duels are epic with just the right touches to set everything up for the next movie. The movie also has to address character evolution --sadly. For us Star Wars fans who've read all the books and seen all the movies, it's painful but JJ Abrams handles it masterfully where the characters' legacy is appropriately preserved.  We 'Star Wars fans of good standing' approve. The ending (a coda) filmed on the beautiful Skellig Michael  off the western coast of Ireland is predictable but I find myself wanting more and eagerly anticipating the future movies.",1
1634,"Star wars the Force Awakens is a brilliant film. Great family entertainment, younger fans will love it. 5 stars, 10/10. Take the kids and enjoy. May the Force be with you.",1
1635,"I stood in line for 6 hours for A New Hope with my 6 year old little bro.   This made it all worth it.  All we can talk about is the next movie.  Haters are going to hate (reviewers).  I've not been this emotional in a movie in decades.  This movie was a big part of our childhood and JJ was up to the task.  Hear, hear, JJ, hear hear.",1
1636,"All I hear, is that this movie is better than the prequels... If the last thing I ate was feces, then anything would taste good.  This story parallels a weak Star Wars ""IV,V"" so bad, it's pathetic.  Within the first 10 minutes I could tell you the entire outcome.  Very foretelling.  Typical Hollywood rehashing.  I felt like it was Star Wars had married a weak Hunger Games and this was their off-spring.  Flying a spacecraft in Hyper speed with no previous experience and seriously, light saber fighting a Sith with no training, and winning.  Not even Vader/Anakin was that powerful. Kylo Ren's (Sith) temper tantrums are not typical of a Jedi or a Sith.  I never saw Vader stomp his feet and wield his light saber recklessly all pissed off.  He just replaced (killed) you.  Control your emotions.  I expected better one-on-one fight scenes. Darth Maul fighting was what I was expecting, and I got Peter Pan.  Enjoyed seeing the old cast.  Not a bad movie, but don't set high expectations.  The kids will like it.  Episodes I and II were awful (except for Darth Maul), III was decent, and IV, V, and VI were sweet!!.  Episode VII Force Awakens is just ""decent"".  Not a movie I would watch over and over. Had lots of action and excitement. And of course, the typical scam... leave the ending open for us to come and throw more money at you in a couple of years.  Good Luck... and May the Force be with You!!!",1
1637,This episode is the Star Wars 4 - The new hope with new actors... There is the THIRD DEATH STAR.......... again a droid with important data what arrives to the rebels who will be destroyed in a second BUT! Then there is an another hole where the X-Wing can enter and blow the base up. That's the story. The new actors are bad. I can feel how they tried to make the imperials as the Hitler's team to show us that they are the bad team.... So I think that was about 7 point but the next one will be so bad as the old good actors fading out... I really sad because I'm a star wars fan.,1
1638,"A LOT of haters out there for such a great movie!  Can't win them all I guess.  For the people who grew up on Star Wars and have loved it with a passion since they can remember, this movie is for you.  This is the greatest movie out of them all, in my humble opinion.  I think Disney has done a tremendous job at handling one of the greatest franchises in cinema history.",1
1639,"Edited version from my blog... First I want to start off by saying this movie is well worth the effort and expense to see. It is likely the best movie you'll see this year and will not disappoint. Seriously you can't walk out of the theater thinking anything less than ""that was a good movie"". But I had very high expectations. This was what Phantom Menace had to face, stratospheric expectations because the first three films are legendary. The Phantom was a bogey at best when measured against those films, if you'll pardon the golf parlance. This film cannot be spared that expectation either, but it benefits from the fact that it will most likely be measured as much against the prequels as it will the originals. I went in measuring it against the first trilogy of films and that is a very high standard. Star Wars remains the second or third highest grossing film of all time when corrected for inflation, depending on whose all time list you look at. A lofty target to be sure. It seems that Disney took a safe approach here, perhaps a little too safe. I found this film to be thoroughly entertaining, visually exciting and beautiful, and just really well done for the most part. But the film was horribly predictable, I knew what was going to happen before it happened in at least a dozen scenes. Why? Because they did it before. This film took some generous liberties with the sequences from the original trilogy films. Numerous scenes and plot elements are not just vaguely similar to the first three films but practically 'cut and pasted' in. My son Nolan joked that it was a great movie but should be called, ""A New Hope, 2.0"". It could be followed by The Force Strikes Back and Return of the Force. Is there not an original idea left in the universe? I was quite surprised to see a lack of lens flare in this movie, the director was JJ Abrams, right? Just kidding, I think JJ overdid the lens flare in the Star Trek movies so much that he may have burned himself out on it. Either that or Disney turned off the lens flare generators ;) So regarding the characters, I have to be very vague here, because I think people have some ideas about 'who is what' in this movie and those ideas may turn out to be misguided. Everybody knows that Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill reprise their roles in this film. It is Ford's Han Solo that really has the bulk of the scenes among the old school characters in this movie. That is fine by me, because Han Solo is one of the best movie characters ever! Harrison Ford does not disappoint here. The dialog provided for Han Solo was epic and even as an aging hero, Han Solo still kicks ass and it is all believable. The primary new characters are Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren, played respectively by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Adam Driver. Rey gets a lot of screen time and that is a very good thing. Daisy knocks it out of the park and steals every scene she's in. I am delighted with her character thus far and look forward to her reprisals in future movies. It's not just her acting or screen presence, which is very good, but the character is amazing. She is for now shielded in a delicious veil of mystery. There is so much potential development for her. Rey gets an A, see what I did there ;) John Boyega is another big plus. This guy also lights it up. His character evolves quite a bit in this movie, but does it so well, that it does not feel rushed. His acting was excellent, his character believable, and his on-screen presence was very strong. Another A grade. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is a little more difficult to digest. My son, Nolan didn't feel he was at all menacing in the villain role. Comparisons to Darth Vader are unavoidable. Darth Vader is a character that is one of the most iconic of villains. His menacing voice was performed by James Earl Jones and it doesn't get any better than that. Those are large shoes to fill. The first time Kylo Ren speaks it's like, what? Is the Pillsbury Doughboy under that mask? I agree with my son that he really wasn't very strong as a villain, but I think that may have been done on purpose. The movie will make some revelations that could explain a few things about the character. The Dark Side is shadowy and the villain on the surface isn't always the villain running the show. This character is conflicted and like Anakin Skywalker, he is quite powerful, just not fully in control. I give him a B grade. The plot of this movie is a little soft but it holds together well enough. I had the bar set at Empire Strikes Back and this film falls well short of that, but it is better than the prequels and frankly about on par with Episode VI, Return of the Jedi. I no doubt like millions of others, eagerly await the next film. That bodes well for Disney.",1
1641,"Great revitalization of the Star Wars franchise, but this movie is literally a remake of Episode IV: A droid with valuable information is sent off into the desert, a masked figure shows up right after, captures and tortures the person for information. (Darth Vader in a new hope and now the new less threatening Vader, Kylo Ren). The droid finds its way to the new Luke Skywalker(probably his daughter), Rey, a character that knows nothing of the universe but is very powerful and is meant for more. They even both live in a similar place, a desert with bandits and thieves and the place is attacked and destroyed like Lukes home was. Then they meet Solo who tells them all about the force and what has happened just like Obi-Wan told Luke in A New Hope. They go to a cantina filled with different aliens and there is even a live band. The rebel or alliance base is located on a forest covered planet, Leia is stationed behind a control room just like in episode 4 while the alliance, covered in orange jump suits plan an attack on the Third Death Star. This new death star even has the same design flaw, where the hero flies down a narrow pathway and shoots something inside to blow it up. Hans Death is Obi-Wans death in episode 4. A father like figure in Han and Obi-Wan, hero's stand helplessly by as he dies, Rey even screams noo! just like Luke did. It's the exact same plot just certain parts are in a different order. Very creative! (sarcasm). It also is a very rushed film. For this I think it is because each new film is being directed by a new person. J.J Abrams for Episode VII, Episode VIII is Rian Johnson, and Episode IV is Colin Trevorrow. I think Abrams want to get as much in this movie as possible and get credit for certain aspects of the story that could have, and should have, been developed later. The fact that Rey, a person that has only known about the force for a few days and has never been trained at all can defeat Kylo Ren, someone that has been trained by Luke Skywalker, one of the most powerful jedi ever, and also trained by Snoke I'm sure very powerful. This felt very rushed and lazy, she can even do the jedi mind trick. This was great visually and added great new actors into the mix, but it was just Episode 4 A New Hope 2.0, and a very rushed episode 4 at that. Hopefully the next 2 movies don't make these mistakes.",1
1642,"This was the best movie I have seen in the last decade! Thank you! It was an amazing ride! People that say that original actors didn't get enough screen time, are misguided. It was an emotional roller coaster, if you are a Star Wars fan.",1
1643,I absolutely loved this movie. The plot was great. The new characters did a hell of a job. J.J. Abrams wrote a  phenomenal script. This is a must watch if you are Star Wars fan!,1
1644,"I'm in my 40s and a SW fan right from the start. It might seem to some, that JJ has only delivered fanservice. But this is so much more than that. After I went onto trailer embargo etc. I went unbiased into TFA and it is really what I hoped it to be - and then some. The style oozes oldschool mixed with funky modern computer jazz - but never in the sense that CGI gets in the way, it really is a supporting role to those remarkable and outstanding setpieces. This is the movie every StarWars fan wanted to see. And holy jedifunk did it deliver. Absolutely recommended, also for non-SW enthusiasts, for the outstanding entertainment! THANK YOU, MR.ABRAMS!",1
1645,"Two things were inevitable with this film. The first is that you would get people who blindly loved this film just because it's a star wars film that's not one of the prequels and the second was that there would be people who blindly hate it just because it's a star wars film that isn't one of the originals.But once you get past the fanboy obsession what we have here is really well put together movie. The new cast are remarkably likable from the outset, each of these actors has a bright career ahead of them. Finn and Rey get the most screen time and there's a lot of passion and charisma behind their performances which is helped even more by the great chemistry they have together.Poe Dameron has a more understated role but I enjoyed every minute he was on screen. I'm assuming he'll get a bigger part in the future, or at least I hope so.The new villains are exactly what they need to be as well with Kylo Ren being the most intruiging. This film kind of sets a stage of Finn, Rey and Poe vs Ren, Hux and Phasma which I am totally on board with!Story wise, there's no way around it, this film is very derivative of the original trilogy. Some plot points are literally exactly the same. But it's done with so much charm and respect for the originals that I honestly don't care, I'm just enjoying myself too much!Basically this film is not perfect but it does so much more right than it does wrong. It's pretty much the kind of film star wars fans have been pining for for far too long and after decades of waiting we finally have another good star wars film and a building block for an awesome continued series that I can't wait for.",1
1647,"Its a great movie. we have to accept the ""new generation"" with a lot of jokes and more. This movie show us a new start in this saga. The character touchd the force for the first time and in this movie its look's all a little bit ""noob-like"". i think we have to watch all the episodes for a real review. The character of Kylo Ren is great. he looks like a angry and uncontrollable guy who has no idea what he is doing - but think - he is not a full sith or something - he is just a student and we can looking forward for the next episodes. there is something big comin",1
1648,"Despite sticking very close to the plot of New Hope, JJ Abrams breathes new life into a movie many expected to be a bust. The character development throughout the movie and the emotion that is exhibited in decisive scenes knows no bounds. Overall, I am extremely impressed with The Force Awakens and believe it should be nominated for Best Picture. Not just for its outstanding visuals, but for the movie as a whole and the pressure put on Abrams to deliver, a goal that he exceeded.",1
1649,"NO SPOILERS HERE. If anyone gives this movie anything under a 7, they are lying and TRYING to hate it. Remember, this is the internet and most people don't think for themselves. They just find out what is trending on Reddit and copy-paste. This movie was a joy to watch. It was everything that I was hoping it would be. So you know where I am coming from: I grew up on the original, non special edition, VHS tapes and Empire is my favorite out of all of them. I have been wanting to see a good Star Wars movie in theaters for years and it finally happened. As someone who has TRIED to like the prequels and can't find much redeeming in them, it was a relief to have a genuinely good movie placed in front of me. Now, the movie does have its flaws, but nothing that would warrant a low score. There are a few callbacks and familiarities, but they are not as heavy-handed as the majority of the people complaining want you to believe. All the new characters are great. They have more emotion and development within the first 5 minutes of each of their introductions than any character in the entirety of the prequels. Kylo Ren, specifically, was a much deeper and layered character than I was expecting. There are a couple characters that I would have liked to have more screen-time, but I'm assuming we'll be getting that in Episode 8. The characters who got the screen-time here deserved it and did a great job with it. The special effects are for the most part amazing. There are a couple of jarring CGI moments, but they are VERY few. We do have a return to physical sets and practical effects and the movie was just pleasant to look at. By the end of the movie my biggest disappointment was only that it was ending. The moment the credits started to roll all I could think was that I wanted more. I cannot wait to see where the story continues.",1
1650,"I might be a star wars fanboy (and I'm not really hardcore at all) but I thought this was a great addition to the franchise. There were a lot of loveable characters, John Boyegua was especially good! The plot was pretty safe, in my opinion, but it's been a long time since a star wars film so it's understandable. I thought the comedy was very flavoursome, not unsuitable for young uns and BB-8 was actually surpsingly easy to empathise with! I feel that Rei was rather flat and didn't really show much of herself but I'm sure she'll get stronger as a character in the further 2 episodes. Easily the best film I've seen in ages and the best star wars film since the phantom menace.",1
1651,Old skool SW fan here - This movie flat-out ROCKS! Daisy Ridley ROCKS! John Boyega ROCKS! BB-8 ROCKS! And most of all Adam Driver as Kylo Ren ROCKS! Exciting times ahead watching these characters develop......,1
1652,"It's a great movie and in many ways even better than I expected. The new Actors did an amazing Job creating well-thought-out Characters, but also the older Actors were charming as ever. ""The Force Awakens"", for me, is the start of an interesting new Trilogy, with stunning Special-Effects, great Action-scenes and emotional Moments. Can't wait for the next one.",1
1653,"Great movie. So impressive to make something fresh that still fits so well with something created 40 years ago. To those who say it is a lazy identical reboot, that's a lazy comment. If you haven't seen it. Go see it. Now. If you have, then feel free to keep reading on and read my brief rant about the chief complaint I've heard (obviously there is basically universal praise for the film but there is one criticism that seems to be common amoung the haters). It has elements and similarities to the original trilogy, but if you see sand and think tatooine or snow and think hoth and a young Jedi searching for parents and their place in the galaxy and think ""reboot"" you're really missing the point.  And the fun. Those similarities are there to connect us to the past so that we can meet the new characters in a Star Wars world. If it wasn't similar to the world we knew from the original trilogy, it wouldn't look and feel like Star Wars. It would be a movie with the Star Wars brand name and some old actors that we sort of remember. What JJ did was bring us in with enough of the old that he can now move forward with the new characters and their new stories and they will be definitively Star Wars...they will feel like they belong. If you wanted something new and completely original go see any of the other sci-fi movies and tv shows of the last 40 years that have tried to capture what Star Wars has but never had. If you want a great Star Wars movie (I think it's the second best behind Empire and in many ways even better - although neither could send alone as great without the original) than this is it. And you will leave excited for what comes next. If you want something different, go see a worse unrelated space movie and pretend it's Star Wars. Then you can have completely ""original"" content. It was exactly what the franchise needed. And it was executed with perfection.",1
1654,"There's a really good reason that this film is destroying the box office record's. I loved the suspense and can't wait for the next.  JJ Abrams has done a phenomenal job directing this one.  Blending in the new with the old, it's pure fun and edge of your seat excitement for everyone.  Not tainted like so many of today's movies with bad language from uneducated script writers that can't figure out a better way to express what is happening.  Where the prequels have failed, this movie soars, and there is no slowing it down.  I want to go again and again.",1
1656,"The Force is Strong in this one, as we are heading back to a galaxy far, far away, to reunite with our favorite characters from the Original Trilogy as well as meeting new interesting and great characters for this new generation of Star Wars fans.

1657,"Moving on from George Lucas' saga and one of the industry’s greatest achievements is no small undertaking. Along with their many collaborators, J.J. Abrams and Kathy Kennedy have managed to exceed all of our expectations and offer something truly special to age old fans and new Star Wars lovers.",1
1658,"Was it similar to Ep4? Sure!  But it needed to be, it needed to show us they knew what Star Wars was suppose to be.  I'm highly looking forward to Ep 8.  I've been a Star Wars fan since I could walk.",1
1659,"Never has a film needed less build-up or background than the extremely long-awaited 7th cinematic installment of the ‘Star Wars’ saga, ‘The Force Awakens’. So after the unprecedented build-up and hype there’s only really one question to answer, does it live up to it?, and the answer is, for the most part yes. Despite considerable constraints and the daunting task of getting the balance right between paying tribute to the series legacy and catapulting it into the 21st century, ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ is a triumph of blockbuster event filmmaking and a prime example of what a major studio can achieve with a passionate filmmaker that’s given the adequate source material, space and time to get the formula right, not mention some major $$$. It’s clear that superfan and writer/director J.J. Abrams was constrained by new ‘Star Wars’ universe overlords Disney in how much he could deviate from a successful formula, the balance is indeed skewed towards recycling much of the narrative from the original trilogy and capturing the currently precious pop-culture nostalgia dollar. Which means that the story does often feel like a corporate box-ticking exercise. But at the same time ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ is the perfect 21st century representation of the magic that made the franchise so popular, and Disney have allowed J.J. Abrams the space to work his storytelling magic and deft hand at ensemble cast handling. Pretty much every main character in ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’, both the original “Legacy” players and the new generation, get the chance to shine within a story with a very healthy dose of humour and charm. Which in the end is what made the original series so popular and enduring when you get past visuals and special effects, which quickly become obsolete. So if you’re looking for a huge cinematic experience with laughs and thrills, featuring characters in a beloved and familiar universe, plus some new ones that intersect with what you already know, ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ will not disappoint. In fact the only really disappointing element, aside from a few dark side character choices and a slightly overly familiar narrative, comes way before the film’s release in the form of many trailers, TV spots, magazine spreads and the general ubiquitous spoiler culture that surrounded the latest story in a galaxy far far away… By the time you’ve seen ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’, you’ll probably already know what virtually every major character looks like, sounds like, what vehicles and landscapes to expect and have figured out the crux of the narrative. It seems that audiences have gladly traded the wonderment of 1st time viewing exposition for a quick fix and the build up of anticipation, and studio marketing departments are only happy to oblige, but for us this had a negative impact on the enjoyment of the film. With series sequels and spinoffs now scheduled over the next 4 years at least, the question will now be if Disney can keep relying on tried formulas and nostalgia or whether the franchise can now stand on its new 21st century legs, and if the slew of new ‘Star Wars’ films will dilute the magic and appeal of the franchise, for general viewers at least. Only time will tell. But given the film’s already extraordinary, if expected box office success, coupled with potentially greater merchandising returns and the opening of ‘Star Wars’ themed lands at Disney parks in the near future, it seems that Disney’s massive 4 billion dollar acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012 might turn out to be the bargain of the century. The Bottom Line…Despite being slightly predictable and relying heavily on nostalgia, ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ is a thoroughly entertaining adventure of epic proportions that just about gets the balance right between the old and the new, reinvigorating and blasting a cultural phenomenon into a new era.",1
1660,"wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better then the pre quels, if not better then the originals or as equal. if your not a star wars fan or still have a bad taste in your mouth since the prequels well worry no more, for everyone out there this is a great movie not just star wars but in general. almost everything is fantastic, can't wait for episode 8, imma go the first day, dbox, and go in star wars pants, shoes, shirt, sweater, and beanie!!!!!!!",1

Captain Phasma turns out to be a transgendered, gets kicked out of the Empire and joins The Resistance because they are more tolerant.  Leia and Luke are killed off by Snoke and the evil Nazi Regime.  Rey and Finn fall in love.  Finn finds out Kyro Ren is secretly gay and is in love with him.

This was the first movie of the lot where you actually felt & understood the size / feel of the craft [esp. x-wing, tie-fighter], with very little CGI muddying the waters.  And watching in a theater with reclining leather seats & superb sound only added a notch to the headboard. But as I began to contemplate the obvious problems [ie. Carrie Fisher's absolutely wooden performance, akin to Karen Allen's laughable appearance in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; is it me or was Leia botoxed beyond reproach?], some other outlier issues rose to the surface.  Why another death star?  Why another father-son conflict?  Another sand planet?  Was supreme leader snoke an offspring of gollum and voldemort?  Why was the stormtrooper ladycaptain such a pushover?  And why oh why would Kylo Ren display such wussiness at the end when he was so powerful in the beginning? Many more questions need to be answered, although I'm not sure we can completely fault Abrams here ... as it may have been Disney's writing team who drummed up some of these doldrums.  The largest underlying problem felt to be the weighing down of the new with the old.  Hopefully in the upcoming sagas, the writing teams leech out most of the old ... as this fresh core of actors more than held their own here.In the end, my emotions were tied more to the special effects than the rehashed storyline or even most of the human drama.  I certainly didn't feel surprised or remorse when one of the big names goes down.  As any individual born in 1970:  the original SW released right in my wheelhouse, and I know many of my classmates will be eternally tied to that first trilogy. I certainly won't be one of the ones found saying this is the best Star Wars ever.  B+",1
1669,"Amazing movie, pretty much an homage to the original trilogy. Acting was great, story was a little familiar but still amazing, left a lot of questions unanswered as it should for the next 2 movies to answer, it was even filled with humor, and overall it was action packed and very exciting movie. The only problem I had was some scenes were a little corny and the characters seemed to become friends a little too fast.",1
1671,"An entertaining film, engaging characters, a story which at first seems to only touch the surface, but contains enough depth, emotional gravity and unanswered questions to set up the new trilogy. This is my first time on metacritic and I notice its full of trolls who want everything explained to them and can call it plot hole if the explanation is not there. There are holes, its called backstory, information that will be revealed in the next installments. Heres my counterarguments to those with ADD or lack any real depth to think beyond the surface: Rey learned the force to quick, it took Luke 3 films: Ummm, maybe she was trained? Maybe she had her memories suppressed by Luke to protect her? Maybe the ""Awakening"" is Rey starting to realize who she is? Maybe you have to wait till the next film to find out? Han Solo just happened to show up: Han specifically stated when they were walking to the Cantina that he picked up the falcons signal when it reached space, that hes been looking for it a very long time. Learn to listen people. Character Development: I think each new character was introduced well, great chemistry between them, comic relief with Finn and Poe. You don't know everything about them. You didn't know Luke and Leia were siblings till ep6, or Darth Vader was daddy till ep5. Rey seems like the force reborn. Maybe some of you just don't like black stormtroopers or Latino pilots or female leads and dislike the film without outright saying your prejudice -- that's a personal issue you need to deal with, take it somewhere else. Remake of EP4, 5, 6: There are some parallels, but a lot of differences in each new character backstory that we do not fully know about yet. Its given there was going to be a dark side character and that ep1-9 will be about skywalkers, so there will be similarities. Perhaps your hungry for a whole new story not about skywalkers. The only thing that bugged me was Death Star 3.0, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. It was bigger. more deadly and the New Order wanted to take the galaxy by fear. Like in real life, we created bigger and deadlier weapons to kill each other with, same thing here. Its ok, don't have a stroke. But there are some who actually offer constructive criticism who make some valid points but enjoyed the movie for the most part. Read those, disregard the trolls who are probably unhappy about their own lives. This is what I got out of it: Remember this conversation between Luke and Yoda in empire?Luke: I saw…I saw a city in the clouds.Yoda: [nods] Friends you have there.Luke: They were in pain…Yoda: It is the future you see.Luke: The future? Will they die?[Yoda closes his eyes for a moment]Yoda: Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.Luke: I’ve got to go to them.Yoda: Decide you must, how to serve them best. If you leave now,help them you could, but you would destroy all for which they havefought, and suffered."" I think this is the link between the original trilogy and ep7. Yoda didn't say might or could, he said, "" would destroy."" Luke was impatient, went to save his friends instead of heeding Yoda's vision, which leads to the chaos in ep7. If Luke had not gone, Lando would have saved Leia and the gang anyway, Han may have died or been shipped off to Jabba. If Han had died in ep5, Kylo Ren would never exist, the story would have played out differently. Its to early to project what could of happened if Luke stayed with Yoda or what will happen in the next films. But what ep7 does offer is the rise of Kylo Ren/Snoke and the destruction of the Republic Capital/Fleet -- which fulfills Yoda's vision in ep5. Instead of rushing in and saving his friends, Luke decided to wait this time, in exile. Maybe he had his own vision when Ben Solo turned and saw Rey as the one who will bring balance to the force (leaving a map for Rey to find him). There is a reason he is in exile beyond feeling ashamed about Ben Solo or not wanting to help his friends,we'll just have to wait and see; it's what makes ep 7 and all its unanswered questions a hook for the next films. The last shot of ep 7 shows this symbolically, when Rey, the next great hope, returns the lightsaber he lost in Cloud City, which carried all the mistakes and history of Anakin and Luke. All we can hope for now is that Rey doesn't make the same mistakes and listens to the will of the force.",1
1672,"This episode in the star wars saga is one of the best but lacks originality and verve.Kylo ren is a good villain and rey is good and bb8 is even better.This trilogy has started off more than solid and will have plenty of time to correct the problems of this movie like thin characters and lack of new ideas. This episode is very much like a new hope and a bit like the phantom menace but it works.",1
1674,"I consider myself as a big Star Wars fan since my childhood and farseeing enough to see crap where crap is (the first episodes of The Clone Wars and more recently the Battlefront game) and honestly, this movie was great. Ok, not as great as the Original Trilogy or even the Prequels, but it clearly has his moments. The whole story of Kylo Ren is interesting : a good guy inside who tries desperately to be a bad one, like his grandfather Darth Vader (for unknown reasons for now) and fails miserably. It's something new in the Star Wars universe. And, I must say I recognize myself in his adoration for Darth Vader (and I guess I'm not the only one). It's normal that people found him whiny, it's how he was mean to be. The character of John Boyega is also a good find. He represents clearly our point of view of the Star Wars universe : a normal person among far superior beings, such as Jedi or old legends. He is lost in this vast universe just as we would be in his situation. And his relations with all the rest of the cas works perfectly : companionship with Poe, Rey's protector wannabe (which is kind of ironic considering her powers). Which lead me to Rey. Although I totaly agree that she may be too powerful for a neophyte, Daisy Ridley's interpretation is impressive. We are happy or sad when she is. And last but not least, I have to talk about the movie's flaws (because everything is not dark or light), and I think that they all come from one thing : the f**cking Starkiller base (Oops, sorry it seems I lost control). It's just a Death Star rip off and makes people think this film is a remake (and technically it is true from a certain point of view ), it totally rushes the end of the movie and brings a threat that we don't really need. So, it was not the bet Star Wars movie, but it brings me back to my childhood and that's all I wanted it to do !",1
1675,"Go see the movie.  That being said, it was a bit disappointing.  I was expecting something epic, and while it had some epic elements, it failed to combine them all into a work of art. Best-1.  Daisy Ridley:  She did a great job in the role, albeit some of the writing was a bit off.  Not really her fault. 2.  Poe Dameron:  Basically the new Han Solo.  A lot of the wholesale ripoffs from the previous movies bothered me, but in addition to being a good character, the acting was spot on.  I wish we could have seen more of him. 3.  The Grit:  Abrams flawlessly executed the ""feel"" of the original movies. 4. BB-8:  Lovable droid, that's basically the modern R2-D2.  Will be a money making machine for Disney.  Seems like they stole him out of WALL-E, though. Good-1.  Lightsabre fights:  I'm simply remarking on the quality of fighting, not anything else.  The acrobatics from the prequels was fun, but the style of this and the originals is more dramatic. 2.  Kylo Ren's Costume design:  Looks and feels the part. 3.  Modernization:  what I mean is that they've updated the ships, etc.  Think about what a mini-cooper looked like in the 70s and what it looks like today.  It's a similar thing with the TIE Fighters and X-Wings. 4.  Return of original cast members:  With one exception (discussed below),  the original cast was used properly. Bad-1.  You could see the big ending coming from a mile away.  I mean... cmon. 2.  Carrie Fisher has come a long way since the metal slave bikini days.  Obviously she's aged and nobody is expecting a sex symbol, but her acting and characterization are off. 3.  The writing.  I'll just lump it all in here.  There's some good parts, but there's also some horrible parts.  There's humor laden throughout the movie, but I think I laughed once or twice.  Speaking of which, there's way too much humor as well.  This is supposed to be an action/drama with just SOME comedic relief. Worst -1.  Kylo Ren:  I'm not sure if he's supposed to appeal to the post-millennial generation, or if he's supposed to come across like a spoiled brat who just had someone spit in his cereal.   He started off great, but quickly fell apart as soon as Poe talked back to him.  Vader would have never put up with that.  I hope his character changes in the following movies. 2.  The Plot, and overall rehash:  This was basically a wholesale ripoff of A New Hope.  I know just about everyone's said that so far, but it was quite annoying.  I don't mind nostalgia.  For example, when Poe and Finn escape in a TIE fighter and shoot down their pursuers, it's identical to when Han and Luke escape the Death Star and shoot down TIE fighters.  That part is fine on its own and works when done with subtlety, but comes off as corny when pervasive throughout the whole movie. 3.  Character development:  How are Poe and Finn are somehow best friends at the end of the movie, but only met for 30 minutes?  I guess I'm fine with a Stormtrooper becoming good, but it happens more or less instantaneously.  There was no internal confrontation, just a blood smear and boom he's a good guy now.  Also, if he was basically just a janitor, why was he in a raiding party to destroy that village?  Makes no sense. The whole part where Rey yells at Finn for holding hand could have been done so much better.  I think she yells at him 4 or 5 times not to help her.  Just do it once and leave the 4 other times out.  You accomplish your social justice agenda without over-doing it, and save a few seconds you could use on developing someone else's character.  Plus this whole part made her seem like a child, when the goal was the opposite.  I could go on about the character development, but will leave it at that. 4.  Hand Holding the Audience:  I'll use another example to illustrate.  Poe basically runs train on a bunch of First Order TIE fighters while ground troops for both sides are also fighting.  In the midst of this Finn exclaims something to the effect of ""whoa that's one awesome pilot.""  I just watched him down like 6 enemies in a row while dodging blasters and doing barrel-rolls.  I don't need a character in the movie to tell me that.  Plus, why is Finn looking at the air battle when he could get shot any moment? 5.  Finn cannot use a lightsaber.  They never should have put this in the movie.  Also, no way Rey can crush Kylo Ren in a lightsaber fight like she did.  Even though he was shot, there's no way.  It took Luke, one of the greatest Jedi ever, 3 movies to get on that level and she does it in one?  I call BS.",1
1676,"It's not the best or most original in the series, nor is the plot airtight, but the film is exciting, humorous, well made, and at least as good as it needed to be. Harrison Ford really brought it and the new cast is excellent. The X-Wing sequences and saber action were legit. The film moves at a quick pace and it's easy to follow, although some bits make less sense than others. The art direction, character designs, sets, and sound design all harken back to the original trilogy. Fans' mileage may vary with the new characters, but I loved all of them, Rey and Finn especially. Ridley and Boyega really shine here. I just wish we knew more about these characters. We barely spend time with Oscar Issac's Poe Dameron, for instance. Sure, this movie isn't perfect. The filmmakers make a lot of odd decisions and old friends Han, Leia, and Luke aren't where we thought they would be in 30 years. It also recycles ""Episode IV"" to a great extent, even blatantly ripping off entire plot points, single shots, and individual sequences. The core story isn't strong, either, with coincidences and unexplainable occurrences flying out all over the place. However, the film does have a few saving graces, particularly in the performances and dialogue/banter. I'm very glad I went in with tempered expectations - in tossing the Expanded Universe out the window and remixing classic elements while barely adding to the existing mythology, in many ways ""Episode VII"" is as much a quality work of reverential and referential fan fiction as it is a continuation of the ""Star Wars"" saga. Sure, this hero's journey is more diverse and technically polished, but a strong sense of deja vu permeates this production via familiar plot points, mise-en-scene, designs, set pieces, editing and even John Williams' score. For many, that nostalgia will be a comfort, but I'm torn on the sheer amount of it, especially in the latter half of the film. It will take a second viewing for me to decide whether this film's overuse of ""Star Wars"" iconography is earned or not, but I can forgive them playing it safe and erring on the side of excess fan service simply because this is the first ""Star Wars"" film in a decade and they're just settling into the rhythm of things. As far as I'm concerned, there are the six ""original"" films and the Expanded Universe, and this and any further books, shows, and movies constitute a whole new canon, which I'm calling the ""Disney canon"". I remain curious as to what Lucas' version of Episodes VII-XII would have been and hope he publishes his ideas some day. Kasdan's script has the action and humor down, but it remains to be seen whether Disney has any idea how to deal with the more mythic and mystical aspects of the franchise, such as the Force. They need a writer who understands Eastern philosophy on a deep level. That said, they're off to a rollicking and energetic start here and I am so glad they were able to get the original cast members to reprise their roles. I'm curious to see where Gareth Edwards' ""Rogue One"" and Rian Johnson's ""Episode VIII"" take the series. Thanks for reading my thoughts. May the Force be with you all!!",1
1677,now this how you make a sequel take everything what made the original great and multiply it by 10 and it only has me wanting more and i am quite fascinated by kylo ren and emperor snoke,1
1678,"This movie would make up for a million prequels if there were! Amazing acting, special effects, story, music, and anything else is handled nearly perfect. This movie brings me back to the days of the original trilogy",1
1681,"Massively entertaining, great fun but wholly unoriginal, the Force Awakens harks back to the early 80s glory days of the action movie with a swashbuckling attitude, snappy script and bombastic score. Not a complete knockout but it's a tantalizing set up for hopefully better to come. Lets see Luke kicking *** in the sequel!",1
1682,This movie is ultimately worth of wait. Disney done a great job with this movie! Congratulations JJ Abrams! It was the most phenomenal movie of 2015. It will be better than any Star Wars movie!,1

1686,it is good but luke didnt said anything but we saw new characters old characters and a newjedi,1
1687,"Although The Force Awakens has some problems (being rehash of ep. 4, should have explained better why we have again empire vs rebels situation, Rey mastering the force just like that...) it is still quite enjoyable Star Wars movie.",1
1688,(92/100)Although it borrows from A New Hope it has enough material to tell its own story.,1
1689,"I was 10 when I saw Star Wars for the first time in a special triple bill of Episodes IV, V and VI in cinema in Leicester Square. I still remember the feeling of being transported to a another world where the battle of good vs evil was raging on, in a fairytale where princesses, funny creatures, talking robots and awsome super powers existed.I was fortunate after all these years to watch the next episode of the saga in a church turned cinema in Winchester on a super comfy sofa for two with my 10 year old son and it was like being 10 years old again myself, like seeing it through his eyes.Everything that I came to love about the original trilogy was there and all the familiar characters were back. The special effects were made to look realistic, there was good doses of action and humour, the new protagonists introduced are all genuinely interesting (with the exception perhaps of the Supreme Leader) and at the end of it, both my son and I, are left counting the days to the next Episode...",1
1690,"It's not the perfect film, but it's exactly what this franchise needed.  Action, adventure, the continuation of the Hero's Journey that Star Wars is basically the space opera version of. I've enjoyed this film multiple times.  Don't let the negative feedback dissuade you.  The same people who criticize the current film for being too similar to ANH were the ones who said I-III were too different, and wanted a return to form.  They are the types who cannot be pleased and will refuse to accept any Star Wars after ROTJ because it ""ruined the EU"".  Aside from the Thrawn trilogy and X-Wing series (both of which aren't necessarily 100% contradicted since TFA takes place some 30 years after, and Thrawn and X-wing only happen 6-9 years after the Battle of Endor...but that's just wishful thinking), most EU is bunk (see Yuuzhan Vong) and reads like lame fan-fiction. I'm looking forward to a great new series of Star Wars films to come for the foreseeable future.  Rogue One, here we come!",1
1691,"Star Wars is back. It's exciting enough to enchant new audiences and bring out some glorious, nostalgic feelings for the longtime fans. It bares a striking resemblance to the original classic ""A New Hope."" The set up is basically the same, with scenes clearly being strongly influenced by that masterpiece. It leads to a very familiar feeling film. Yet, despite it's direct influence (and outright borrowing at some points) to a previous film the modern touches give it a feel all it's own. It feels like a new take on a classic that simultaneously moves the series forward. The set up for the new trilogy is a bit too familiar, but the possibilities for where the series can go from here are both endless and exciting. I can't wait to see where things go from here. As far as this movie itself goes it proves to be a stunning way to kick things off. J.J. Abrams knows just how to play off of people's love for the original(s) by borrowing the right elements, while simultaneously moving the story and universe forward so it doesn't feel like a straight up rip-off. The new characters are incredible. The movie lets us learn just enough about them to make them compelling, but also gives them enough secrets and hidden depth to keep us intrigued and interested in discovering more. The same could be said about the universe as a whole now. We get a delicious and filling first taste that will have us dying for the second course. The new heroes are incredible and I can't wait to see more from them. That being said the real stars of the show are the villains, most specifically Kylo Ren. I made the mistake of initially viewing him as nothing more than a Vader rip-off. However thanks to some incredible writing and an unbelievably stunning performance by Adam Driver I found him to be much more. Unbelievably complex in his motives and emotions, he is almost instantly compelling. Part of the excitement moving forward for this series is going to be where his story goes. The rest of the villains have a great deal of mystery behind them. Who are they? What are their ultimate goals? The movie leaves us with a great deal of questions to keep us interested in the future. It leaves us wanting more, but in a good way. A way that leaves us entranced with what we have already been given. A way that lets our imagination run wild. It's a movie not only meant to get us excited for the future of the series, but also one that's meant to rekindle our memories of it's past glories. It's nostalgic and new. Things like added humor and darker action give it a more modern feel. The new plot elements and characters serve as a great way to make a borrowed template feel like something almost completely different. The return of the original characters played by the original actors is just an joyous touch. Star Wars is most definitely back and Episode VII is an exciting way for it to be brought back to life. I give the movie a 9.8/10",1
1692,"While it does feature many elements of a new hope, the force awakens  is still an amazing star wars movie, with the action, feel, and fun that the original trilogy was. I",1
1693,"In short, the greatest movie since the originals. What George Lucas couldn't do, disney did with this movie. You care about the caracters, scenery is beautiful and story is great. looking forward for future movies.",1
1694,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, and to be frank, I did not expect to. I have had truly disappointing experiences watching JJA's earlier SF movies, and I expected little from this one. I will admit that the movie liberally copies scenes from the earlier episodes in slightly modified form. And I will admit that there was a scene that had me cringing because it demonstrates such a flawed understanding of physics and scale that it's flabbergasting to think that the people involved in allowing it through into the final product did enjoy at least a high school education. Overall, though, the acting and the cast were top-notch, the story was compelling and the realization was beautiful, both visually and musically.There are quite a few deus-ex-machina moments, but that's not fatal for a sci-fi or fantasy flick. I had read up on the spoilers before seeing the movie (as I was not originally planning on seeing this in theaters) but had an opportunity to join a larger party, and was very surprised to see myself liking the result a whole lot better than the episodes 1 to 6. Partially this is because the movie does not overreach: it's not a deep monumental epos, it keeps things small and does not overexplain - hence a lot remains to be seen (pun intended) in the sequels. I for one am looking forward to them.",1
1695,"I was inspired to watch the whole series again after watching Episode VII! I think that it could've been more cohesive on the whole, but there was significant character development to the point that I really felt for the characters, and even sympathized with them. Definitely worth a watch, and you will be begging for more once it's done!",1
1696,"Surely, best Star Wars film since Episode VEpisode VII is plenty of intense moments, ahd although many of them are fan service moments, those moments really shine on their own.Great movie 9/10",1
1697,This is the best Star Wars Movie to date...This is the best looking movie i have ever seen.  IMAX 3d...WOW.  The first 1.5 hours was simply perfect.....The plot in the last 1/2 hour or so felt too close to episode 4 for me.  Nostalgia is fine but basically the last 1/2 hour was to derivative of ep 4 for my tastes.  Still great movie.,1
1698,"Really enjoyed The Force Awakens, saw the first one in 1977 and have grown up with the films, me and the wife took the kids and their friends and they loved it. i could see myself in them seeing Star Wars for the first time. i thought the film seemed like a breath of fresh air compared to the CGI heavy prequels, yes the story is familiar but what do you want? all the old fans said the prequels were terrible and that they need to go back to how the first trilogy was, and now there are groans that its too much like the originals?, I for one was buzzing when I left the cinema, if it didnt feel like it did when you were 10 years old? thats because your not, perhaps Star Wars is no longer for you, and like Han Solo maybe its best to hand that baton to the youngsters!.",1
1699,"I am not going to go into a lengthy explanation of everything, I think there is plenty of people out there doing that.  What I will say first and foremost is that despite some flaws in storytelling, this is a worthy follow up to Episode 6.   It is a fun movie that stays true to it's roots.  It utilizes the old characters well and introduces some new ones that are going to be able to carry it forward into the future.  The use of more traditional special effects is nice as it looks very much like Ep 4-6 in art style and not overly CGI like Ep 1-3. I feel like unless you just enjoy hating things, you should enjoy this movie.  It is fun, fast and exciting journey into the fantastical universe of Star Wars.  I am excited to see where it goes and sad that I will have to wait almost 2 years for it. Now - to prove I can be sort of critical... though despite these things, I still loved the movie:1. Another Death Star?  A bit of rehash?  (now to play devil's advocate to myself, it was a relatively effective weapon in the original trilogy, they did manage to destroy a few planets, which is no small feat.  It might actually make a lot of sense that they tried it again.).2. How did Finn manage to duel Kylo so well?3. Was Kylo a little to much like an emo teenager?  (But, devil's advocate again, I think it was intended, he is going to transform into something much darker (I am guessing).  I am thinking he was kind of in that phase Anakin was in before completely going to the Dark Side.) On a final note, I will try remind everyone that none of the previous films are perfect in any regards.  Many of us probably hold them high on a pedestal that might not be totally deserved.  Or if they do deserve it, you should give the new film the same exceptions you give to the older films.  They are a journey into another galaxy and do a great job of transporting us there.  But, many of us saw when children so the nostalgia filter is thick.  They have plenty of flaws as well if you are willing to acknowledge them.  But, I do  love them all!!",1
1700,"When it became obvious, very early in the movie, that The Force Awakens was going to deliberately and cynically rehash the storyline from the original trilogy, I was almost tempted to dislike the movie. However, I was soon swept up in the scenery and action and, despite myself, really had a great time. So, what was particularly good?1. I was particularly taken with the character of Rey. For the heroic lead to be a girl was refreshing. And she wasn't the typical glamour girl in distress either. Rey started out independent and capable, and her looks were tomboyish and unglamorous. I liked that.2. The spaceship graveyard near the beginning. In addition to being visually stunning, it was an elegant way to generate that feeling of depth in the setting, without getting bogged down in world-building.3. The pace was non-stop. Even on the occasions when the movie shifted from action to drama, the movie remained a rollercoaster ride.4. The action scenes were punchy and exciting. This is particularly refreshing after the long (and not especially dramatic) battles and fight scenes of the prequels.5. The lack of Jar Jar Binks, ewoks, or any similarly annoying character. In fact, BB-8 (the new droid) is surprisingly charming and entertaining. So, what could have been done better?1. Didn't like the re-use of the rolling text at the beginning of the movie. I didn't think they were brilliant in the original movies, and it's now 2015/16.2. I thought that humanising a storm trooper was a great idea, but I thought Finn's desertion from the First Order was a bit too rushed.3. Kylo Ren is a whiny teenage brat. As the main villain of the movie, he lacked convincing menace. I always thought he was going to get his ass handed to him. It shows that giving a villain a backstory and believable emotions isn't always a good idea.4. I'm over the whole Rebels vs Empire/First Order thing. The setting has more to offer than that.5. I'm over the blowing up of Death Stars. I didn't want to see it again.6. Poe Dameron should have stayed dead. He wasn't a crucial or charming enough to warrant bringing him back near the end. Overall, the pros outweighed the cons by a significant margin, and I look forward to the next movie. By the way, who else thinks that Snoke could be Tarkin?",1
1701,"This is really Star Wars and I like it. There are some mistakes in the plot tho, but still its okay. Even if this movie didn't do a revolution in cinematography  it is still worth to watch.",1
1702,"10/10 movies doesn't excist but this is a Nine out of ten! so why do i give a 10/10 this movie got my respect.best movie since part 1 & 2. and i really enjoy it.",1
1703,"NO SPOILERS! This Movie gets a 10 period. Do NOT LISTEN TO THE TROLLS! I have been a star wars fan forever. Not a big fan of episodes 1-3, but still watch them (nerd). I have seen the original trilogy like 100 times. This is the movie, as fans, that we asked for. The trolls are right, there isn't much new here. It does not hurt the film at all though. This took me all the way back, and set us up for 2 more great movies. It was everything I wanted and more. Beautifully shot, all the laughs, and sadness, and action we needed. The pace of the movie was perfect. Never did I look at my watch, or feel like it dragged on. I didn't want it to end. Ignore the overall user rating (and retards who gave it a zero). 50 something zero's will take this down no matter what we do. Go see it for yourself, and Score it  fairly.",1
1705,I think I can easily say this is the best blockbuster of the year. I have never been the biggest Star Wars fan but the new characters and story line worked very well. My only concern is with the ending which was quite derivative of the first three films. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this film.,1
1706,"I don't seem to get the negative reviews. I really liked the movie. But I guess just because it's popular it gets so many negative reviews. Hands off haters. Anyways, I really liked how the story went, the scenes were pretty cool and the effects are also cool (Note that I watched this in 4DX which contains chair movement, effects around the viewer, etc.). Many negative reviews barely/don't address that.",1
1708,"It's nice, satisfying and ""oddly"" frustrating, like a beautiful birthday cake that is eaten till only one last peace is left. Like that birthday cake has aged after it was put in the fridge, has the star wars in the Force Awakens aged. But it has aged backwards, from the mature wine of Empire strikes back has it turned into a childlike grape juice. And like grape juice is it nice to take in but not as exciting as a prickling wine. The new good characters are well developed and very likable, while the new bad characters seem like toddlers who donned a cape and start crying when they don't get their new toy. The portrayal of the galaxy is very much like the first Star Wars but it lacks the grandiosity of Empire and Return of the Jedi.The land battles are kept dissappointingly small but the air battles are GREAT.All together it's a bit like the first one but made with different camera's and camera angles. Lets just hope that the next one will be like the first coke you drank, very prickly and sweet at first while it keeps you awake all night.",1
1709,I enjoyed this movie immensely brought back what star wars is. People complain that it is too similar to episode 4 and I agree to an extent but that's what this franchise needed and the new characters are awesome.,1
1710,"As a filmmaker, talking about Star Wars is a topic very complex and very difficult, because this franchise manages aspects which at the end professional critics see him in a way and the fanboys see it otherwise.This new chapter in the saga was without doubt one excellent and epic film, the same feeling I felt when I saw the original (Episode IV, V and VI) returned it to feel with this film. J.J. Abrams did something that George Lucas (the original creator) could do with its prequels (is not that they are bad, maybe if they are loose, but they walked away completely from the style of the originals) and this is going to write in caps because I want to make it clear: ""This is a movie of STAR WARS"" ""EPISODE VII is FEELS like a film of STAR WARS"" from that begins until it ends feels like the original. There is a complaint from ""Some fanboys"" that this movie is a bit like with Episode IV, my answer is simple: this made it for the simple fact of creating nostalgia to the most loyal fanboys of the saga, and not only that, the new characters are completely amazing and interesting. I don't want to give any Spoiler, because that is not the point, you have to see this movie at the cinema and I find it unfair that many people end up counting the main plot by social networks, all they need to know (if it is that they are reading this little critical) is that if you're a fan of Star Wars or not You'll enjoy this film and feel the same sensation you felt with the original movies, original, unique and totally exciting because it feels fresh, feel. The action scenes are incredible and John Williams soundtrack combines the classics with new melodies and that gives freshness and nostalgia at the same time.And I would like to say something very daring: STAR WARS: EPISODE VII is one of the best films of STAR WARS; If the fifth Episode was the best, the 7th Episode followed, surpassing even the original Episode IV and Episode VI. A magical, exciting, epic, fun and nostalgia-filled adventure. Review en Español:Como un cineasta, hablar de Star Wars es un tema muy complejo y muy difícil, pues esta franquicia maneja aspectos que al final los críticos profesionales lo ven de una forma y los fanboys lo ven de otra.Este nuevo capítulo de la saga fue sin duda alguna una excelente y épica película, la misma sensación que sentí cuando vi las originales (Episodio IV, V y VI) lo volví a sentir con esta película. J.J. Abrams hizo algo que George Lucas (el creador original) no pudo hacer con sus precuelas (no es que sean malas, tal vez si son flojas, pero se alejaron completamente del estilo de las originales) y esto lo voy a escribir en mayúsculas porque quiero que quede bien claro: ""ESTA ES UNA PELICULA DE STAR WARS"" ""EPISODE VII SE SIENTE COMO UNA PELICULA DE STAR WARS"" desde que inicia hasta que termina se siente como las originales. Existe una queja por parte de ""Algunos fanboys"" acerca de que esta película tiene un tanto parecido con el episodio IV, mi respuesta es simple: esto lo hicieron por el simple hecho de crear nostalgia a los fanboys más fieles de la saga, y no solo eso, los nuevos personajes son completamente increíbles e interesantes. No quiero dar ningún Spoiler, porque ese no es el punto, uno tiene que ver esta película en el cine y se me hace injusto que muchas personas terminen contando la trama principal por las redes sociales, lo único que tienen que saber (si es que están leyendo esta pequeña critica) es que tanto si eres fan de Star Wars o no, vas a disfrutar esta película y sentirás la misma sensación que sentiste con las películas originales, porque se siente fresca, se siente original, única y completamente emocionante. Las escenas de acción son increíbles y la banda sonora de John Williams combina los temas clásicos con nuevas melodías y eso da nostalgia y frescura al mismo tiempo. Y me gustaría decir algo sumamente atrevido: STAR WARS: EPISODE VII ES UNA DE LAS MEJORES PELICULAS DE STAR WARS; si el Episode V fue el mejor, el Episode VII le sigue, superando incluso a las originales Episode IV y Episode VI. Una aventura mágica, emocionante, épica, divertida y llena de nostalgia.",1
1711,"im not the biggest star wars fan, but i do love star wars and have been to see everyone in my lifetime in the cinema! (im 30 years old) this has been my favourite star wars movie by a long shot and also the best film i have seen in a cinema in many years! also one of my new favourite films!",1
1712,"Chewie..we're home. It's the same feeling you will have after watching The Force Awakens. Incredible, intense and finally, a worthy continuation of the original trilogy. It has their 'flavor', but with the technology that backs up the much reviled prequels. All the new casts are amazing, set pieces mind blowing..to tell you more will spoil the surprises of The Force Awakens. In my book, this is the second best Star Wars after Empire Strikes Back.....'Nuff said, go see it.",1
1713,Hit all the right notes!  Nostalgia mixed with a yearning for more Star Wars!  I really couldn't of asked for more in this new Star Wars film.  I am eagerly looking forward to Episode 8!!,1
1714,"Fantastic. Sure, it has similarities and parallels A New Hope in certain regards. But it is not a ""re-hash"" or ""remake"". It, for sure, has it's own identity and continues the saga beautifully. People claming that it is a bad film are deluded and kidding themselves. Even if you don't love it, I can't see how it isn't at least a good or well made film.",1
1715,"I thought Disney was going to **** it up, make it extremely friendly. However, within the first 20 minutes, Blood is smeared on a stormtrooper's helmet. Overall, I like this movie a lot and will be my favorite movie of 2015.",1
1716,"It's not perfect but it is Star Wars through and through. Watch this movie! Rey is one the best female protagonists in recent times (Possibly ever) and although people may regard the movie as being too ""PC"" one does have to accept that times have changed and Disney is now trying to get a completely new generation of viewers into the star wars universe. In my opinion Abrams masterfully balances (Well as much as possible) fan service and nostalgia while sowing the seeds for a new saga in the Star Wars universe. Also the feeling when that opening music starts and the prologue brief starts to roll in was unreal, never felt anything like that for any over movie ever.",1
1717,"This is the movie of the year. Doesn't care if some people criticized it for being ""boring"", ""similar to the original trilogy"" or that the ""story isn't original"". This isn't a perfect film, but it's a extraordinary start for the resurrection of the saga many people love and cherish.",1
1718,"A wonderful homage to the first Star Wars film, setting things up fantastically for the next one. They absolutely nailed the essential elements of the first trilogy and introduced a great cast of new characters. Brilliantly done, welcome back Star Wars, its been too long.",1
1719,"It's difficult not to get wrapped up in the hype that surrounded 'The Force Awakens' before it was released. As you watch the beginnings of the film, its even harder not to find yourself falling into nostalgia and comfortable familiarity in a franchise we have all grown up with. But, from a completely objective viewpoint, The Force Awakens can be considered both a success and a failure for various reasons. Firstly, this film succeeds in relaunching a world for a younger generation. Older Star Wars fans can get heated about the pacing, familiar story, and character use in this film, but ultimately it is a picture for fresh eyes. There is humour, personality and light-heartedness throughout the two hours and it is all handled well. Additionally the visuals are used appropriately and really do add to the overall experience, rather than saturate it. Uses of lighstabers feels raw and heated, rather than over choreographed and unnecessarily flamboyant. In terms of effects, story, character, and humour, The Force Awakens ascends above the prequels in leaps and bounds. But there are some disappointing elements too. At times the plot seems clunky, running along at break-neck speed and it can take an effort to keep up. The plot points here are so painfully close to the original Star Wars films that it can be a struggle to feel like this film is anything fresh. We've seen all this before. We've been through this journey at least once over. Sure, the ride is fun, but it would have been much nicer to have something that offered a difference to what we've already seen. Older characters feel forced in at times, and generally I felt there wasn't enough time for things to really breath and be expanded upon. Within minutes we are sent from planet to planet, from one situation to the next, and I feel it could have benefited with simply pacing itself slightly slower. As well as this, there are several parts to the story that seem to disregard previous laws in the Star Wars universe, and contradict much of what has been established in Lucas' original films. Overall, this is a good, fun film. It is best enjoyed with a open mind and an acceptance that this is more about the fun than the deep and rich rules of the Star Wars universe. If you are a huge fan of the series, there will undoubtedly be moments you will feel underwhelmed with, frustrated with, perhaps even angered by. But for each of these scenes, there is another that reminds you why you liked this universe to begin with. There is plenty of action, character and colour here. And that's something that's easy to enjoy, once you let go of impossibly high expectations and the films clear flaws.",1
1720,"Enjoyable but found wanting. Watched it twice. Ren is the wink link after the first hr. Tauted as the best villain since vader in the promotional materials, but as soon as he removed the mask he took on a different demeanour. Too unusual looking in this role without menace, just looked like a weirdo and although driver is 32 he looked and acted like a teen. They could of made him and the ridiculous CGI Snoke far better. He shouldn't of been unmasked or if he did give him character. Not to mention fin/especially Rey getting the better of him. Silly and over rushed. I don't know why since vader and the underused Maul, with the exception to palpatine that SW villains have fans complaining, just look at the extra capt phasma. I can live with the loosely rehashed ANH story but we kind of got that in ROTJ too. So it's an obvious tie in to success, as that's what we loved but come on, 3 times? It's pretty much Rey/Fins movie the first half and Harrison ford still pulls off Han Solo. I liked the movie overall, quite enjoyed the characters like BB8 and good to see chewie back, not sure about leia? Again her presence in this film was odd.Visually it looks better then the prequels. I've taken a few wks to write this as i just wanted to take it all in. People I know who watched it enjoyed what they saw. The die hard fans were more critical along the lines of what the negative reviews have said. I'll buy it when it's released and it's one of those that's watchable enough. A good Star Wars movie but definitely not on par with the classics, not even Jedi.  Still 3rd biggest film of all time so far, so something other than just hype is keeping some happy.I found 7 a justified score taking everything into consideration despite quite big frustrations.",1
1721,"This movie puts to shame the prequels, the cast is great, the new actors were well chosen and deliver great character build. The sound track is amazing as always and the cinematography is stellar. Even if the plot has a lot in common with episode IV the reason why i still enjoy this movie it's because it's great for the new generation of fans to enjoy and still gives a fresh sense of nostalgia to the old fans. The way the character development was shown wasn't to much but still does a good job presenting the new characters. Kylo Ren is well built, Finn and Rey as well. A special note for the great Daisy Ridley which really marks with it's way of showing that girls/women are no longer the damsel in distress.",1
1722,"The movie has its flaws, there is no question about that, but the flaws are completely overshadowed by its strong points. The acting is great, the comedy is included in just the right amounts, the emotional moments are powerful, the direction is top notch, the acting is great, the effects are used as effects should be used - to give a better perspective or scene than what could be done without them. The writing scene to scene however was average to bad. You will feel a lot of ""because the script said so"" moments but this is honestly the first movie I have looked past them because everything else was done so well. Also, if you have not seen the original trilogy a lot of the nostalgia would be lost on you, and so the movie would probably not be as enjoyable. Having said that,  I have seen it a second time and while the nostalgia is much weaker the second time around its still a really fun movie. If you come in expecting a masterpiece of screenwriting you will be disappointed, but anyone else will love it.",1
1723,"I've been reading the reviews on this site and man, some of them are pretty harsh. As a lifelong fan, I enjoyed the movie. Yes, it has some plot holes but what movie doesn't. Name a movie that doesn't?!?!?! It was entertaining and nostalgic. It is my opinion that some fans will never be satisfied at any new Star Wars movie. Fans complained when George Lucas made the prequels and the special editions of the original trilogy and now they are complaining that Lucas isn't a part of the films!  The Star Wars universe has been a part of our lives for so long that it has become something to be protected and treasured. And some fans will never be satisfied!!!! And God forbid, if someone else comes along and has another idea where the story will go, especially now that Disney is at the helm. My husband and his cousin, who are the biggest Star Wars fans I know and the biggest critics, enjoyed this movie. For me, bottom line is I enjoyed this movie. I've seen it twice and would see it again if I can and I eagerly await the other Star Wars films.",1
1724,"The Force Awakens is a fantastic movie! Everything in it is logical, and the plot is great. Yes, definitely, some things in the movie repeat other things that have been seen in other movies of the sequel. However, this repetition is logical and the repetition doesn't become too much and doesn't become annoying. It even makes the plot better. Also, the visuals of The Force Awakens are awesome, and the actors act quite well. J.J Abrams made a good job with continuing the sequel, and I would be happy if he makes the next movies too. Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens definitely gives me the feeling of nostalgia, and I would watch it again when I have the opportunity.",1
1727,"With great characters, exciting action, and a familiar yet investing plot, Star Wars The Force Awakens not only proves that is was worth the hype but also that good Star Wars movies can still be made.",1
1729,"Star Wars - I space fantasy/romance opera in a galaxy far far away, set a long time ago.  Ep IV, V VI set the tone for a beautiful and expansive universe that many of us born and lucky enough to have grown up with these films, loved them. Even those of the younger age have endured it a little. Mr Lucas then gives us the prequels. They were different, not bad, different! They had to be. That story was based in an era that needed the wider sense of expansiveness, It allowed endless creativity because so many more factors can be introduced, and later taken away. Many points hit the mark, others didn't. Attack of the Clones is still a question mark for me. Now we have the ""new"" movie - it is a SEQUEL. The brilliant thing here is that it remains true to the theme of IV V and VI, it needed to be! Being 30 years in the future, SO WHAT if the plot seems similar. Same things happen in our real lives!  Things come around full circle, and the worst part is that they become worst every time - ie. war, financial crisis, natural disasters! Same themes, but each time, we handled it differently. That's what this film is about - We have come full circle, now it is up to the new generation of heroes to take the banner and lets just join the ride and see how they handle it. The other beauty of this film is that one could watch this film without knowing anything about the first  6 movies, and still enjoy the ride. Those that were expecting something different to the first 6 - you come up with a better story line then smart-a$$e$. Someone did come up with something different, I II and III - didn't like them did you? Someone has come up with something familiar, different enough to keep it fresh, and you are still not happy? This movie was made for the fans, so fan service is good. Those who complain about fan service - uh... you are relevant because???? This was never going to be an oscar winner, Cannes finalist, advent movie maker guild award recipient. This is a great fun filled adventure that retains the same spirit of IV V and VI. TL:DR - Awesome movie for those who go watch it for what it is - a fantasy romance sci/fi that has been revitalized. Ignore the haters.",1
1730,"Malgré quelques approximations au niveau du scénario que je ne détaillerai pas pour éviter le spoil, j'ai trouvé ce Star Wars Episode VII excellent. Un parfait épisode IV++ avec quand même son lot de nouveautés plus que bienvenus. Le film est techniquement extrêmement bien maitrisé de bout en bout, je n'ai jamais décroché une seconde. étant friand de fan service, certains passages m'ont bien faire rire, certaines personnes pourraient trouver que c'est trop, ce n'est pas mon cas et je pense que passé l'épisode 7, les clins d'œil se feront plus discrets. Certes on passe un peu vite sur la découverte des personnages, mais ce n'est pas vraiment différent de l'épisode IV selon moi. A condition de trouver un réalisateur de talent qui ne serait pas bridé par le studio, je pense qu'on peut s'attendre à du très lourd pour les prochains épisodes. Nostalgiques de la première trilogie, je vous conseille d'aller le voir, il est bien mieux que l'épisode 1,2 et 3. Puristes de la première trilogie, à vous de voir ; si vous voulez de l'épisode 4 upgradé, il est fait pour vous.",1
1732,"Simply the best of them all to date.  With as much anticipation as ever, JJ abrams delived Star Wars back into it's glory as well as bringing new faces to mix with the old and an intriguing storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  well written well acted, and well done!!",1
1733,Outstanding.  i liked it yea there one shocking part of the movie and the end left us hanging for number 8 will be interesting to see what happens in a few years.,1
1734,"everything about this movie was perfectly executed. the characters had real conflict and emotions that the audience connects with, even kylo ren. yes, there are some references to the original trilogy, but they are tastefully done (by the characters in the original trilogies). This is the direction that fans wanted the prequels to take. also, having a woman captain, pilot, or hero in this movie is not ""PC"", it's realistic for the universe. The star killer base, reminiscent of the death star, is totally inline with the original trilogy and universe as well. the empire/first order most likely would try something ""bigger and better"" the next time around, so i think this makes total sense. this is star wars simply stripped down and at its best. it doesn't rely on nostalgia, but it realizes people have been waiting a lifetime to see this universe again. it's beautiful, complex, and leaves you hungry for the next movie... let's just hope somehow j.j. will direct it again",1
1735,Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the first time in ages that I can say a Star Wars movie was really that good. I have had to sit through an underwhelming year of blockbusters with very few things that I liked. At the end of the year its nice to have something save it. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the most fun I’ve had at the movies not just this year but in while. Abrams is the right fit bringing a sense of fun back to the franchise and reinvigorating my love with the film. It delivers a complete and satisfying story that I can’t wait to watch again while also leaving me wanting more. While the ending  is a bit of a let down the future films will hopefully make up for that. The biggest fault the film has is that it needs to have an equally satisfying follow up. While it is uncertain if future films will live up to the awesomness of this one for now we have a great start to what looks to be a promising future.,1
1736,"Not going to spoil it for you guys but WOW. This movie was wayyyy better than I thought it would be. It was beautiful to behold and seeing the Star Wars introduction made me smile. This is a new start to what looks like a great new trilogy. The characters, story, action were all great. Fans that thought Disney would ruin this shouldn't fear this movie is Star Wars at it's very core even sometimes more violent and chaotic. The cg and effects were stunning and J J Abrams directing was top notch. George Lucas should feel at ease that this is on the hands of someone who truly cares about Star Wars. Now it's not perfect( what film is these days, right?) there are some downsides. First off some characters get sidelines early. Like a potential fan favorite that just shows up. For the most part though the characters get enough screen time and the pacing is well done. The other issue is...somethings from the previous episodes are missing. I won't go into detail but it kind of bothered me since I've been a fan of the series since the original trilogy. But this is the first episode of a brand new trilogy that is off to a great start. To put it bluntly this is a new hope with added stuff. It follows some of the things that incredible movie did and stands as one of the best in the franchise so far. I really enjoyed this one despite my complaints. It's what fans will really enjoy if they are true Star Wars nerds like myself. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here. STAR WARS IS BACK **** 9/10",1
1737,"The bottom line for why this movie worked is because it did exactly what it needed to do; Reestablish Star Wars as it was before Lucas' prequels. Yeah, some of the people who are hating on this movie have valid points, but they forget the fact that we just got a movie far better than Episode I-III and maybe even better than Return of the Jedi. Most people who are giving this move a '0-4' unrealistically bought into the hype as if it was some portal into the future as what this movie has to be. It sets an expectation that not even The Empire Strikes Back could achieve. Sorry, I just had to get that out of the way. Anyway, I'm just going to get the flaws out of the way first, because they're not the point of this review. First off, yes, this film can feel a bit too familiar at several points. A lot of the basic plot, characters, and scenes are strait ripped out of (mostly) A New Hope. The little 'wink wink' and nods to the originals were really the ones that took me at out at some moments, but fortunately, there are few of them, and they are over within seconds. These problems do get a pass for me, because they're more so homages rather than reminders. Second, the Starkiller Base was the line for me. Not only is it absurdly impractical, but it really is just another Death Star. I do appreciate when the film recognizes this, but it was still just a bit too much for my liking. And that's it. Everything else was, well, pretty much perfect. Not only is the start of the film ingenious, but so is (mostly) the rest of the movie. From the opening scene we are given everything we need to know, and how to feel throughout it. Our main characters aren't only incredibly handled, but also human, which is something we haven't seen in Star Wars for a really long time. Something that has to be understood is that these characters are the main focus of this plot, unlike in A New Hope where everything revolved around a planet-destroying ball. Something that can't be unnoticed is the new roles, not only are Rey, Finn, Po and Kylo Ren great characters, but evenly comparable to icons such as Luke, Han, Leia, and Darth Vader. The new roles didn't only have great actors behind them, but actors that wanted to be there, putting in all that they had. When I see an actor like Harrison Ford after thirty years, I didn't see Harrison Ford on screen, I saw Han Solo. The same goes for the other returning cast, with I'll be it, limited screen time. It is also intriguing how fast it is, this is the fastest moving Star Wars since Episode 5, for nearly all scenes have no time for relaxing, which is actually a good thing here. Other misc. things include how technically impressive it is, the music old and new, and how well it sets up this new trilogy. Anything that I didn't mention I probably loved anyway. Overall, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is exactly what this franchise needs. Yes it is mostly Disney playing it safe with a retro style, but if it went too different, then you have a mistake made by the prequels. This film feels like the Star Wars we've known to love, and I can't wait to see where it takes us.",1
1739,"Just a masterpiece of sci-fi. Overall a fun octane adventure full of memorable moments, and characters. Even a character who is there for five minutes is enjoyable and even the storm troopers have personality giving them a bit of humanity, motivations are easily understood and the characters relationship with one another feels genuine and heart warming. There's good fan service but not the kind that will drone on about something from the original trilogy, it's just a quick tease for the fans getting some good chuckles and it even pokes fun at some (as cinema sins puts it) 'Ex Machinas' or things from the original trilogy or prequels that have bothered fans. The effects are breath taking and life like to the point that I couldn't tell wether if it was CGI or some creative way they managed to do something. But I think the film can lay off the humor and be serious for at least 10 minutes, it's just a serious situation loses all seriousness when one of them will do something silly, and some characters I feel could use more screen time to add more weight to all their relationships, and sometimes if felt like a fan fiction. But still a must see in theaters fun lovable movie. And storm Troopers can aim, and are really competent making them all the more threatening when they're being faced in battle!",1
1740,"Thrilling. Wonderful. Excellent... A true sequel, worthy of the Star Wars name. I entered the room on the 16th of December at five minutes after midnight, fearing the blatant overuse of CGI, and I can tell you now... My fears were washed away. The practical effects could not have been any better. They blend in with the world seamlessly. The main characters; pretty much flawless. From Kylo Ren to Han Solo, just about every single character was played flawlessly. The atmosphere could not have been any better. This film truly gives you a Star Wars feel. The effects, like I say, blend in absolutely perfectly with their surroundings. The graphics... Just stunning. Hell, even the humor in the film was well placed and absolutely appropriate. However, this does not mean there are no criticisms to be made. There were some flaws with the film, mainly within the story, and even though they are more personal issues than anything, I still feel they count as flaws.. However, I will not spoil the story. Overall, this film is excellent. I was hanging between an 8 and a 9, though I decided to give it a 9/10 rating. Let us hope the future films are just as good, if not better than 'The Force Awakens'.",1
1741,"Good acting, good plot line, good special effects and well edited!  Very hard to be critical of the film unless you are simply against Star Wars and nostalgia.",1
1742,"I don't know what people are complaining about. After Episodes 1-3, there was a LOT to make up for. And make-up it did, thanks to JJ Abrans and Episode 7. Everything that WASN'T in Episodes 1-3, is in Episodes 4-7. Yes you heard me right. 4-7 flows seamlessly.  Watching Episode 7 aka ""The Force Awakens"" was like watching Star Wars for the first time in my life. It sounds like Star Wars, it feels like Star Wars, it plays like Star Wars. As a fan of Episodes 4-6, I got EVERYTHING I wanted in Episode 7, yes, everything. I'm sure if Episode 7 didn't contain everything it did contain, people will be complaining, ""oh where is the Star Wars we knew and loved?"". Haters gonna hate. But me, I'm a lover. Well done JJ Abrams. This is Star Wars returning to form.",1
1743,The movie is fantastic ! I saw all 6 Episodes more then 10 times each and the new one is the best film for me ever ! I cant await Rogue One and 8 ;) I hope we will see more Phasma and BB8 is the best !,1
1744,"It's a perfect sequel, not flawless but its still one of the best movies made this year, killing hansolo was a daring move but they delivered it in a powerful scene.it is perfect for all age groups.",1
1745,"I personally liked the film, I thought the acting was great, the action was superb, Not going OTT on CGI and the characters were like-able! I do agree with other people on here that it is pretty much a modern remake of A New Hope which knocks off a few points from my scoring but any Star Wars fan, new or long-time should go and see it!",1
1746,"It felt like a bird stuck in a cage. They didn't give it the freedom to experiment like the originals did.﻿ Don't get me wrong. I still enjoyed it for what it was but it didn't really add anything to the franchise in terms of story. It followed too closely to the New Hope while adding parts from empire strikes back. The opening scene captured Star Wars brilliantly and JJ Abrams knows how to get the audience's attention almost immediately but throughout the rest of the film it fell flat and stayed too 'Safe'. The reason the originals were so popular was because they did something that cinema had not seen before. They were original and that my biggest problem with this film. I would like to point out the new characters of Fin and Poe were enjoyable to watch and Rey even though being a little flat, captured the feel of Luke Skywalker which was nice. The new villain was somewhat interesting but wasn't a 'classic villain' and didn't give me the same fear that Darth Vader gave me even though that is what his character essentially is. On the positive side, as this is a soft reboot disguised a sequel, I generally hope and believe it has given them the foundations to be let off the leash and explore the Star Wars universe so much more in the future sequels. Give me a bit of that magic back. Please.",1
1747,"The film achieves a skillful balance between nostalgia and future. The strong performance of Daisy Ridley saves the storyline. The adaptation of content from EP 1-2-6 was in parts to strong, but brings us also all - young and old - emotional back to the Star Wars Universe its characters and history.",1
1748,"Great main characters (Rey, Finn), fantastic action sequences, emotional depth, great music and effects.Reveal of the villain too premature, weak secondary villain (general hux), too many nods to the original and the movie coul've done without poe (oscar isaac).",1
1749,"The force is strong with this one. I'll begin by saying I had very high expectations for this film, whilst accepting that I might be sorely disappointed. Therefore I'm delighted to report that this film exceeded my expectations in many respects. The storyline was excellent, the cinematography and overall aesthetic superb, and the performances were masterful. Visually stunning, with a plot beautifully paced, and one that will keep old school fans intrigued, this is a complex and thoroughly detailed homage to the classic Star Wars form, structure and pathos. A worthy successor to the The Return of the Jedi this is, see it you must. May the force be with you. 9.33/10",1
1750,"Saw the first film in 77 and have loved the films ever since. I took my kids and their friends to the Thursday night showing and everyone loved it, over 2 hours of pure cinematic fun. I really felt that The Force Awakens captured the magic of the original films, and i left the cinema with the same feelings i felt as a child watching them for the first time. While the story may seem familiar,  the film has enough hidden gems to uncover with more viewings. Well done to everyone involved in bringing Star Wars back to where it belongs. A great family night out and everyone rated it 10/10...",1
1752,"This movie is pure awesomeness, starting from the characters who are done soo good like Kylo Rey BB-8 with a lot of emotions and passion, the plot is pretty good too a little bit similar to the first one but i did not mind that, also the effect were stunning and the acting on spot. The film is also full of twist wich I really diged. All and all a movie worth every penny and a great 10/10 ( 5/7 :D )",1
1753,"Awesome new Star wars film just been and seen it for the 3rd time, and it just gets better and better, IMAX 3D is amazing. loving the new characters Rey Finn and Poe, cant wait to see how they develop. Kylo Ren great too. dont know what film these people are watching who have rated it 0?? everyone I know who has seen the film love it. If I could rate the film 11 I would but 10 out of 10. and well done Disney and JJ.",1
1754,Amazing!I got great pleasure from viewing. The spirit of the classic trilogy pleasantly surprised. A lot of really funny jokes and the return of old friends),1
1755,"I rediscovered the feelings, scenarios and excitement of the first trilogy by G.Lucas. Perfect mix of old and new characters and (most important) a proper villain. Good and well balanced use of special effects.Great performances by all actors.... And fortunately no more ""midiclorians"" and JarJarBings (thank you so much J.J. Abrams!) Chewie, we're home!",1
1756,"Who: John Boyega, Soccer Ball R2D2, and a movie without Jar Jar Binks and Hayden Christensen as a lovely addition to the franchiseWhat: The best Star Wars movie since 1983Where: That wondrous galaxy far, far away we came to know and love before George Lucas took a huge s*&% on it with CGI and prequelsWhen (can I watch again): WHY AREN'T YOU WATCHING IT NOW!?Why: Much like the original Star Wars, this movie entertains us on an unequaled level and we are reminded how blockbusters should be made in a time when we perhaps need it most",1
1757,I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. It met all of my expectations and that alone warrants a 10 rating. That being said I liked it so much that I'm going to go see it a second time in theaters. Good job Mr. Abrams you did am amazing job. Two years is gonna feel like an eternity leading up to the next one.,1
1758,"Really liked it. It's a sequel, not a prequel and makes the previous Jar Jar Binks creations look too CGI driven. I liked the recent prequels, but this one ties them all together.",1
1759,"World wide media acclaim. Box office records broken everywhere. 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, need I say more? Disney and JJ you nailed it with a superb addition to the Star Wars universe, not to mention the introduction of some great new characters, Rey, Finn and Poe are all brilliant and I cant wait to see how they and the story develops, miles better than the prequels and second best to The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion.",1
1760,"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with a start to the film on a Tatooine-like planet, as per usual, but a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic -- with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc). Furthermore, the move from Disney to advertise Finn as the main Jedi guy was clever, as it meant for the reveal of Rey as the Jedi to be much better than otherwise could have been possible. Finn, though, is a fantastic character, with John Boyega deserving more nominations for his charismatic performance. One other thing done well with The Force Awakens is the lack of slow story development which so marred the progress of the prequel films, and A New Hope in part (I thought, though it was amazing even so), and also the decision to focus on characters to develop the story other than excess plot development means for better character development and means you actually like the characters, unlike Episodes I, II and III. Moreover, the return of light-heartedness and inclusion of comedy makes it an even more enjoyable watch; however, mixed with darker themes clearly inspired by the best parts of Episode III, there is more violence and concentration on action -- with that providing excitement, and the comedy bringing extra enjoyment. Finn personifies the more light-hearted approach along with the brilliant BB8, and Kylo Ren is a fantastic vehicle for the darker side of the film, even though he is a bit of a snotty nosed dork. The Force Awakens is the main product of Disney's buy out, and so I'm very happy Disney got involved if it meant this beast of a film was made. It was almost a dream of mine that there would be a sequel trilogy, and it has actually happened, so I was aptly excited. My excitement was repaid emphatically, as when I sat in the cinema fulfilling one of my most anticipated pipe dreams, I was blown away by this surprisingly light-hearted yet violent, action packed and particularly well crafted, yes, beast of a film. 94/100.",1
1761,"over all it was a good movie.But because of all the promotion and outrageous anticipation it disappoints me. I was thinking of it to be near perfect.And I thought that my expectations were met.But the final half an hour,ruins the movie.Hans death,and the fact ray gets almost all the credit.And my expectations are now not meant,I wished that phin defeated the Sith he deserved to win the battle,not ray.",1
1762,"This movie is just absolutely perfect: 238 millions dollars in one week end!!! CGI is really good, story is lame, film pacing is actually on of the worst i ever seen. But as always, money wins!!!!",1
1763,"This latest installment of the series achieves what the Star Wars, renaissance revival, endeavor sought to do. Unfortunately, the film does not accomplish much more beyond that. The film is fueled with incessant action and coupled with copious amounts of wistfulness and sentimentality for the day's of old, George Lucas’ world of Jedis and Sith lords. The very opening scene is taken straight from the New Hope playbook (a slow, over-arching shot of a giant spaceship). The context of the shot, and the film as a whole signifies a complete opposite of outstripping itself from it's past. To a (possibly successful/ unsuccessful fault), Abrams blends the venerable age of New Hope and mirrors it to its contemporary. After the prequels divided fans so vehemently; this film blends the comical and jubilant provocations that would warrant a similar finale, villain, and plot structure and bring about a new age of the franchise's history. The plot systematically carves a rhapsodic and zealous touch while shifting characters to a specific thoroughfare and a space to garnish and manipulate while the sumptuous cinematography is supportive, not its tenacity. With perhaps a lavish amount of affable material, the film attempts to shift gears perhaps too vigorously in the final act. Abrams in this attempt has accomplished of rekindling the Star Wars franchise in wake of imprudence and impatience. Enjoyable to its fullest, Star Wars represents and will always represent a cathartic yet recurrent medium through which cinematic artists may invigorate a franchise (regardless of whether it needed to be made or not). To be clear, no movie ""needs"" to be made. No unrequited notion of financial stability of social commitments does any movie (or production company for that matter, Disney I'm looking at you) by necessity and by virtue requires it to be produced. Where there are frequent divisions within both the showmen and the greats in contemporary science fiction, the ultimate goal of getting people in the theater seats relies on an outdated story-telling mesh; refurbishing but staying true to its history. Abrams has introduced one of the franchises most endearing installments to date.",1
1764,"Best things: For such a high budget fim, I don't even need to tell you the VFX are incredible. The Rey (Daisy Ridley) - Finn (John Boyega) duo works incredibly, and they get the story going in an amazing partnership, I'd say they're the best thing in the movie. They didn't overdo in the fan service, that it's just the right amount. And BB-8, it's great, a perfect replacement for R2-D2. And Adam Driver plays Kylo Ren very well. Worse things: The story is basically 'A New Hope' with a few changes, and it's disappointing especially if you watched A New Hope near the date you see/saw this movie. The 'Empire' (now called The First Order) is stupid, they have build ANOTHER death star, they never learn... And, you get a constant feeling of ""I saw this coming"", you really don't get surprised a lot The Force Awakens is a good return to the Star Wars saga, well directed and with an excellent cast, gets us waiting for what will come up next. But, the fact that it's basically the same story as A New Hope sucks.",1
1765,"Frankly, it is just impossibru to rate a movie more than 8 since its plot is mainly based on events and twists copied from earlier episodes. I mean: another deathstar, and, another ""son kills his father""-storyline? Come on! I mean: Anakin tried to kill his master (twice). Luke tried to kill his father (twice). Darth Vader killed his master, Palpatine. Any1 else see a pattern here with male-centric son-father/sensei-violence here? I substract one point from hasty storyline, unwitty, unrealistic dialogue and bad screenplay. Yes. Bad. screenplay. It is unbelievable that back in the 70s and 80s camera angles and perspectives were more complex than today. When modern technology makes it possible to have cameras practically anywhere and/or make the scene with digital technology, it is just astounishing how dull and uninnovative screenplay is. With all the money Disney had, they could only copy&paste earlier Star Wars movies. Boooo-ring. Yeh, i am a fan of the original 3, but many of the problems of the Episode VII are not related to Star Wars but Hollywood movies in general. Hasty crap this one. Worth one view, though.",1
1766,"The best way i could describe The Force Awakens in a brief words is that it is ""A New Hope blended with the Legends canon"". And for those familiar with both will find during the movie they will begin to draw links between the two following similar plot points and outcomes reminiscent of  the former star wars media. And for that reason, the force awakens plays as a very safe movie through and through sticking to a formula known and loved by audiences, instead of treading in Phantom menace territory disappointing another generation of fans. However playing it safe is unfortunately what lets down this movie Starting to a strong premise on the planet of Jakku audiences are greeted to the trilogies new trio, Poe, Finn and Rey. Each different and driven by their own motivations but varied by there available screen within the film, despite running for over 2 hours the film doesn't feel long enough, with the only reasonable development seen out of Rey who is no doubt interesting but is otherwise is focal point of the entire film leaving the former 2 character to have to suffer having their origins further developed in the already planned sequels. But where there is a strong premise it becomes apparently more noticeably around the films 3rd act in which the film begins to speed up to accustom the films running time and as a result the films quality begins to depreciate. In which aspects such as the force, villain motivations and scene quality feel rushed all accumulating to one surprisingly average light-saber duel and an aburt ending that make you feel a bit cheated What you will love about the film however is the attention to detail and the careful amounts of love and hard-work put into recreating the star wars universe once again, putting emphasis on props instead of CGI making the film more awe driving to watch as set pieces come to life delivering chills reminiscent of the original 1977 films release. Space battles although limited in screen time are a great improvement to the series showing off aerodynamic functions of x-wing fighters and the millennium falcon none of which possible in the original films Overall the force awakens is a great premise and leaves you wanting to see what happens next",1
1767,"When I saw The Phantom Menace i felt it was a great start to another era of star Wars films until Jar Jar Binks showed up. But that does not mean that the rest of the film does not have value in the Star Wars universe. Actually now that I have viewed the new Star Wars, I see how great the story line of the PhantomMenace was because of George Lucas's story telling skills.But this time around George Lucas is not at the drivers seat, He was pushed out the creative process as soon as Disney purchased his ""Empire"".  Thats why I didn't expect Disney to be true to what George Lucas originally wanted Episode seven's story line to represent.  JJ Abrams and Disney used the main idea that Luke was the last Jedi and he needed to go into hiding for his own personal safety. This point was the only real remnant left from George Lucas's thoughts of what episode seven should entail. Although Lucas never put to much thought into all the details for 7, 8. and 9 because he never intended to bring them to the big screen.The Good points of The Force Awakens, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, R2, 3P0 and Chewy,plus a really good new cast especially John Boyega as Fin the runaway StormTrooper. Although the plot line uses A New Hope as template the new characters cross paths with the original cast, creating a familiarfeeling, ""did we do this before""! The nostalgic plot line did give me a lump in my throat, combined with John Williams excellent music score and ILM's visual effects, the experience was a blaster to the past.Conclusion; If you are a long time ago, in the 1970's Star wars fan, just like me you will have mixed feelings about The force Awakens. Why ,because This episode is not so much as an episode of a continuing story but both a stand along movie as well. It comes of as trying to please to many fans from different time periods, which causes the viewer some confusion of the intent of this installment.So, this my final thought I left the theater feeling that episode seven did not go deep enough into whyor how the older characters ended up where they were at that time period. But, at the same time itmade me feel the same way I did in 1977 when I first saw Star Wars. Young and wide eyed...",1

1775,"The Best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back. Not a copy of Episode 4 but it does pay homage to it. If this is just remake of A New Hope, then Terminator 2 is just a remake of The Terminator.

And that every reviewer's profile I go on that gave a negative review of this movie just created an account recently (it looks like Universal paid people to review this movie a dog sh*t score to make up for their **** movie, Jurassic World).",1

1779,"Its good, and leaves a lot open. Which is important because this is the start of a new trilogy, and I think what some people are forgetting is that the starting movies to any series are meant to build up. While it could have never, ever lived up to all the hype it got I think it was a very good movie. SPOILERS TO SOME EXTENT! I am quite interested to learn of this new bad guys motivations and reasons for betraying his family as those aren't entirely explained. I think that this movie had a strong black guy and strong female protagonist will shut up a good portion of quibbling idiots out there. And while it was largely a nostalgia trip, looking at you cooler death star 3.0 , this movie had enough new in it to justify its existence. The music is what you would expect, visuals are neat, and the much underated snow forest at night battleground was used to great effect. I can't honestly think of anything to complain about when it comes to this movie other than the fact that it never completely blew me out of the water. Go and watch it, and when you do, spoil it for all of your friends. before its too late.",1
1780,"As long as you are capable of judging a movie fairly without your nostalgia goggles, you will enjoy this film. This is a well paced, engaging, and heartfelt movie. It would be just as good without being Star Wars yet it's good as a Star Wars movie also. Finally we can separate the trolls from the true fans. If you nitpick so much that you think it's worse than the prequels you need to reevaluate how you make judgements.",1
1781,"I love Star Wars and sat as a three-year old at the theatre watching A New Hope.  Now I am sharing the same experience with my four-year old son.  There are plenty of people being critical of The Force Awakens and that is their choice. Whatever.  All I wanted was to enjoy the experience and the movie.  To that end,  I did and it was incredible.  I laughed a ton.  Thoroughly enjoyed the new actors.  And loved seeing the old guys.  It was an amazing experience and hats off to JJ for pulling it off.",1

It pretty pompous and childish to complain abot how similar this films is to the 1977 original.The new characters (Rey,Finn,Kylo Ren,Poe Dameron,General Hux) Will have much more development and conflicts in episode VIII. I guess Fanboys wanted a three hours film with all the answers (Thank you Lord of the rings,you made the audience much more exigent),.People say the prequels were decent,originals,interesting and much entertained that Episode VII...THEY ARE WRONG (Stop defending the prequels !!!)Episode VII HAS EVERYTING what it needed,Humor,Great action,Not much cgi, and the most important aspect that were so attrociously represented in George Lucas´s Prequeles....HUMAN EMOTIONS.",1

If you are disappointed, check your butt for a stick!",1

The movie has very exciting and fun moments!!! Yes its plot has cliches and scenes that recall the one seen in episode IV-V, but it's not a remake of those.",1
1786,"I'm not sure what everyone is crying about.  This movie was awesome.  At first, when Disney bought Lucasfiilm in 2012 from ol' George, I thought the movies they would inevitably make would be cartoony and horrible (much like a certain prequel trilogy).  But on the contrary, JJ Abrams and company did a very tasteful job in bringing back the character development, humor, and progressing plot lines they were evident in the original trilogy.  To all the people that gave this film a 0, what exactly were you expecting?  This movie has great dialogue, action sequences, and enough  witty scenes to more than redeem the beloved original trilogy in 2015.  No matter what product, movie, TV show, or video game one makes, there's always going to be a group of people that are going to hate it.  Whatever.  To each their own.  I thought it was great!",1
1787,"The Force Awakens is a triumph. The cast and the performances (Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford) were great, the characters were grounded and felt actually interesting while maintaining a skillful balance between nostalgia and future.  Everything about this movie is just so perfectly executed and played out. As I said, the characters had real conflict and emotions that the audience connects with and relate to, literally no character in this film was uninteresting by any means. I could not believe how good this film turned out to be, its easily one of the best films 2015 and Star Wars has to offer and would recommend for both new fans and old.",1
1788,"Star Wars Episode VII is everything you wished the prequels had been. In other words, it's a return to the series roots. Action. Drama. Thought provoking sci-fantasy. There is a lot of quite intentional ""mirroring"" of the originals going on with scenes, story lines, and characters that seem to parallel the original films. But don't let people tell you that this is a ""remake"" as a result of that. That's a very shallow way to look at the film. There is also a lot of new going on both in terms of character development, plot, and world-building. If you have enjoyed any of the Star Wars films, you're likely to enjoy this one.",1
1789,"I enjoyed the TFA.  Star Wars comes with a load of expectations set from the first 3 movies, so heavy that even George Lucas couldn't match them with the prequels.  Everyone loves Star Wars and it has the most hard core fans of any series, so the people who like TFA are REALLY going to like it, and the people of don't like it are REALLY going to dislike it.  I was lucky enough to see episodes 4, 5, and 6 in movie theaters when they were first released, so I'm a fan who's been there from the start in the 70s.  It's hard to put my finger on what makes episode 4, 5, and 6 resonate with fans - are they movies about friends struggling together, or are they about people who come from nothing to accomplish great things, or are they about destiny?  Are they about all these things?  I think it's safe to say that 4, 5, and 6 were accidental masterpieces.  But we still love them and don't want to see Star Wars go away. TFA is a reflection of its heritage but it's also a product of modern times.  It feels a little different.  And that's good because episode 5 feels different from 4 and 6 and The Empire Strike Back is one of the greatest films ever made.  TFA has a diverse cast, strong female characters, complicated themes that weigh down on key players - it speaks to us in the important ways.  Our lives are like that, so it's good to see a film that reflects these things. It's hard to imagine a better home for Star Wars than Disney.  The expanded universe built over the last thirty years is ignored and they've move forward with only the previous movies as its foundation.  Time to make Star Wars stories that'll speak to us again.  Terrific movie, a promising start for something new.",1
1790,"There were only 2 things I didn't like about this movie, a Liar Revealed story arc with Finn, I hate The Liar Revealed, it can ruin movies VERY quickly for me, thankfully it didn't with this one, but it could have had the lie kept up.  Also, I felt mixed about Kylo Ren, with his mask on, holy crap was he intimidating and awesome, without it, he was young Anakin all over again, a beta **** whiny **** However, these didn't detract for how awesome this movie was start to finish.  It had the right timing for all humor bits, awesome bits, sad bits, everything.  The fan service was over the top, and holy crap KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN!!  So many audio easter eggs hidden in the film!  It's great!  Hearing the opening theme in theaters, was bliss.",1
1791,"WHAT I LIKED: A film with so much hype rarely lives up to expectations - but the 'The Force Awakens' exceeds them all. It's just truly amazing. Watch brilliant characters in a film that credits the originals whilst moving forward in the most exciting way possible. We've never seen a film that encompasses so much in terms of tone and emotion, that still pulls it off with such continuity and sensitivity. You can really tell everything was beautifully crafted by every hand in it's making; 'Episode 7' is beautifully acted, directed, scored and shot to the most incredible standard. But there's more to this than all those achievements, Abrams pulls off a movie that genuinely makes you feel every emotion. It makes you laugh, cry and despair, gives you chills and makes you grin from ear to ear. This is everything you wanted it to be and so much more more. Whether you're a Star Wars fan, or not - this is the must see movie of 2015.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The odd clunky scenes are there, and as with 'Episode 4' (which this film appears to be very similar to) the plot could be slightly more layered, and less bitty in terms of the way it is portrayed. Plus one small thing, Kylo Renn doesn't look remotely intimidating or torn without his mask.VERDICT: History is made. 'The Force Awakens' is a spine-tinglingly beautiful piece of film that does so much so sensitively. Star Wars is back, crowning Abrams as the new king of film.",1
1792,"Undoubtedly this installment of the Star Wars saga will not sit well with some, and for some this will color their reviews.  Just because the story has taken a path that does not suit their ideals they will exaggerate its flaws and turn a blind eye towards its strengths. Many of the faults, and there are some, do not really harm the story telling or damp the exhilaration of dogfights, blaster battles, lightsabers and Xwings vs. TIE fighters.  We have a new cast of strong characters with exciting new actors and a whole new world of Star Wars ahead.  You can sit back and enjoy the ride or recount the past an embitter your future.",1
1793,"Star wars: The Force awakens is an extremly awesome movie. I LOVED it. It did feel like a modern version of a new hope, but I accept that, because of the 'point-of-no-return' scene in the movie for one of the characters (kylo ren). This movie is amazing, and it honored the good old star wars movies, and I felt nostalgia while watching this movie, and it was only a little bit forced, but thats okay in my opinion. I really like where they are taking the new characters and their realtionship with people around them, and how they're just playing out. At first, I thought that Kylo ren was gonna be a very Darth Vader 2.0. But he isnt. His character WANTS to be Vader 2.0, but he is something completly else. He's like, what Anakin should've been. Overall, amazing movie, can't wait for episode 8!",1
1794,"First off, most all the criticisms I have read are valid. The problem is it sounds like a lot of people are ""chasing Amy"" with this film-- In other words, they are pining after a film that does not exist, that can never exist because a major motion picture by definition can not be perfect. Star Wars was never meant to be a dark, dystopian fantasy as is the trend these days. It was meant to be a ""space opera"", and on those terms The Force Awakens succeeds resoundingly. It is, first and foremost, character driven. Rey is a compelling lead and is compellingly acted by Daisy Ridley. Harrison Ford once again shows why Han Solo is the role he was born to play. This is a film about family; somewhat ironically, the ""space battle"" element of the film is the least effective. Yes, there are ""plot holes""-- but these exist in all six previous films as well. That's what ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is for. Yes, Abrams is sometimes a bit --too-- referential of the original films. But the stage is set for an intriguing, exciting slate of films to come. It introduces characters you want to see more of, and poses questions and quandaries you want to see them wrestle with. And, it's just cool. Crazy that Lucas originally just wanted pure, good ol' escapism, which is exactly what this film delivers with reverence and respect for its legacy. Yes, the criticisms are valid, but hopefully they are put in the context of reality rather than the ideals we have about Star Wars but, if we're honest, are simply not possible for any film to live up to 100%. That's what makes Star Wars so special and so personal.",1
1795,"It goes without saying that you can safely ignore the trolls on here giving this film 0 or 1 or 2 etc.  The film is good, the only question is how good.  Well, my friends, I am sadly old enough to remember Star Wars the first time around and then of course there were the **** misjudged prequels that we all wished we hadn't been exposed to. The Force Awakens though is a different animal to the latter Lucas monstrosities.  This is REAL Star Wars.  JJ Abrams sets us right back into the Star Wars universe and as Han says at one point, it feels like coming home. I won't mention any spoilers here but I will say that the trailers previously released were masterful in the way that they diverted attention away from the real plot of the film.  I will also say that ALL of the newcomers give brilliant performances.  There was more genuine comedy in the film than someone like Adam Sandler could muster over an entire career.  It really is laugh out loud funny in several places and in BB8 a star is born.  But then SW has always had humour, because it is realistic, it's lifelike.  And just as in life, the SW universe has laughter and tears, light and dark. Faced with the huge weight of this task, it was inconceivable that Abrams would do as good a job as he did with the Star Trek franchise but honestly he actually surpassed it.  This film is everything the prequels weren't.  It respects and inhabits the SW universe but also respects the audience too.  We had no right to expect the film would be this good.  We can only be thankful that it is. My main thought upon leaving the cinema was ""I must see this again as soon as possible"".  I just cannot wait for the next one.",1
1796,"Very well executed film. But there are somethings that are a bit compeling to the overall of it. Like: Kylo Ren is a huge boss at start, but seems to fade away a bit by the middle of the film and by the end a bit too humanized for me. All the jokes are in place, but I felt like I need more back story for Poe and Finn to get a better emphasis on them. Why would we have that trooper to face Finn? They have a backstory but is not told in the film. The new death star was a huge let down for me, I would prefer to have Snooke aboard on his ship with a HUGE army to invade, destroy and to have the Republic made hostage than see the same ""death star"" plot again. Either way, with these issues aside the film can make itself strong enough with a benevolent 8 for visuals, effects, acting, script(most part) and harmony of the universe.",1
1797,"I don't understand why this movie has so many negative reviews. It's a solid 9.4/10, but I'm giving it 10 for good measure. It is everything a Star Wars movie should be and is deliberately meant to mirror the story of A New Hope except that it will allow for the next two movies to be very different from Empire and Return. Kylo Ren is very cool, his voice is amazing. Sure there are flaws, but what sci-fi adventure movie doesn't have flaws. This isn't meant to be a Kubrick epic, it's very much a Star Wars film and I loved every second of it. I love the lore and the themes of Star Wars. It's a story of true mythology and antiquity.",1
1798,"Who knew that Disney had the force with them? :DI rank star wars films:Episode 7Episode 6Episode 4Episode 5Episode 3Episode 2Episode 1I love all the movies  but there are some I love more than others.",1
1799,"A great movie i enjoy a lot this movie, the cgi, the practical and all kind of effects are great, the story its good, but i thin you need to se the original trilogy to feel the movie 100% :D",1
1800,"BB-8 and Finn interaction, Rey (Best actor/actress Star Wars EVER had), Han Solo, Chewie, and another villain that is not in the trailers! The movie also knows how to use jokes. What are you waiting for? JUST GO AND WATCH IT, need watch again 9/10",1
1801,"I think that's the best star wars movie I ever watched. From the start to the end, I felt that movie like a good one. The only that I can say and I think that could see as a negative movie, it's too short.",1
1802,"The newest entry into the Star Wars franchise helps redeem the franchise after the mess that George Lucas made with the prequels.  Compared head-to-head with the other films in the series, I think this one had the best script and acting, avoided the total convolution of the prequels, and had the best overall presentation.  Unfortunately, as great a movie as it is, it would be so much better if it weren't the seventh entry in the franchise.  Viewers will have the distinct feeling that ""they've done this before,"" perhaps because they have.  The story, although better executed than before, borrows a few too many plot elements from the original trilogy to be comfortable.  As a result, the movie becomes extremely predictable to anyone who has seen the original films.  It feels like the writers couldn't decide between a remake of the original trilogy or a continuation of the old story, so they just kind of threw it all together.  I hope the next installments are a bit more original. Please bear in mind: I did enjoy the film.  I never found myself being bored, even if I could guess exactly what was happening next.  I enjoyed the new characters by themselves, although the ""insta-relationship"" formed between the cast, particularly Finn and Rey, appeared more like codependency and naivety than chemistry.",1
1803,My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! We are also fans of the other 6 films. My favorite was Return of the Jedi! It was a bit nostalgic. I found myself thinking about this movie days later. I can't wait to see it again!,1
1805,"I feel as if people are hating on this movie because they expected way too much out of it. Star Wars movies will always be rated low by stubborn fans who just can't accept that the first two movies will never be topped. The prequels got a lot of hate but they weren't AS BAD as everyone says they were, people just expected too much. Return of The Jedi wasn't rated very high because people expected way too much after Empire Strikes Back. This was a fantastic, beautifully made film that will catch the attention of new fans and will take the older, more die-hard Star Wars fans down memory lane with a lot of old characters and elements being displayed throughout the movie. The combination of new and old in this film was just perfect. Seeing the Millennium Falcon in action again filled me with nostalgia but we also saw it doing some amazing stuff we have never seen before. The new villain had a bit of a Darth Vader feel to him but brought a new feel to Star Wars as well, as he seems to have a very different personality to what Vader had. The new characters were refreshing and brought something new to Star Wars while the old characters brought a really exciting nostalgia factor to the movie. I will admit I was close to tearing up a bit seeing those X-wings flying across water to face the new Empire-like First Order, one or two other scenes had a big emotional effect on me too but I don't want to reveal any big spoilers. Hard to find a flaw with this one, definitely worth paying to see it.",1
1806,"This movie is great to watch in the cinema, but if you take a closer look you realize that most of the characters (with a few exceptions) and the story line are poorly written and sometimes it feels like they recycled stuff from Episode IV. I also dislike the new villain, Kylo Ren, he just doesn't seem like a real bad guy to me, but that may change throughout the trilogy. After all the movie still looks great, has good action sequences and many nostalgic moments. That's why it's still worth watching for everyone.",1
1807,"In Star Wars the Force Awakens, a continuation of the hit saga Star Wars I would give it an 8 out of 10. I had only two problems with this movie. One was (spoiler alert) Kylo Ren as Han Solo and Leia's son looked absolutely nothing like Han Solo or Leia. In the original movies, you could see some sort of a resemblance between Anakin and Luke, and General Palpatine and Leia. But, Kylo ren was nothing like Han or Leia. They could've done a much better job of choosing the role of Kylo Ren (no offense to Adam Driver as Kylo Ren he did a spectacular job of playing the emo role of their son.) Another concern with this movie I had was (extreme spoiler) I don't believe any smart or sane person would walk onto a three foot wide ledge with someone psycho who hates you and would do anything to kill you to fix a bond. I mean let's stay realistic I mean if I had a son who wanted to kill me I would never go anywhere near him when he has a lightsaber or especially on a ledge I mean c'mon thats very unrealistic. I also don't believe that Han Solo should've died write as the new movie came out like they could've lasted a bit longer with him. But then again this could be the beginning of some sort of revolution beginning with the death of Han Solo so I am not going to be too quick to judge but there were many other realistic ways Han Solo could've been killed (I'm not saying I wanted him to die I actually rather enjoyed him and his jokes in the movie and it was depressing when he died but again it is possible that was part of the plan for another movie to come.) Alright I'm done being negative towards this movie and I will start saying things I liked about it. I thought the concept of a storm trooper with his own opinion that breaks lose of control of the first order was genius and I never could've come up with something like that on my own. I thought Daisy Ridley did an impeccable job of playing the badass mystery girl with some attitude. There was a lot of mystery to this movie and I enjoyed that because I know all will be explained in the later movies. I loved the references to past movies and characters and the way the force was interpreted and who it chose. In conclusion, It was a great movie with limited flaws and room for more movies to be made later on and the actors and actresses did extraordinary job. If you didn't like my review well that sucks for you cause i am only 13 years old. :)",1
1808,"Good movie. Solid start, very fun. Keeping in the context of getting a new generation into Star Wars,  this is a very good start. It has issues, Abrams essentially passed the innovation and creativity to the next director Rian Johnson. In keeping with a story line similar to a episode 4""he played it safe""",1
1809,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a welcome return to form for the legendary series, but it's fair to say that it's not exactly blazing a new path, preferring instead to give the fans all the things they want to see. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the film's sheer similarity to Episode IV (A New Hope) is distracting at times. The movie is nicely shot and J.J. Abrams has clearly studied the direction style of George Lucas, as the film feels very familiar in presentation, and he thankfully keeps his own directorial gimmicks to a minimum. The visual effects are excellent as one would expect from Star Wars and the sound design is equally impressive, reinforcing the movie's familiar feel. Leads Daisy Ridley and John Boyega give engaging performances, and Harrison Ford looks like he's having a good time reprising Han Solo one more time, but some of the other characters are little more iffy, particularly the villainous mastermind, who is both not very interesting, and presented poorly via visual effects, while some of the supporting characters also feel like they are there more out of obligation than because there is actually anything for them to do. Hopefully these characters will be better fleshed out in episodes seven and eight. Overall, SW:TFA is best described as a promising start to the new trilogy, but future instalments will need to do a lot more than simply tweak the nostalgia nerve of Star Wars fans to maintain interest.",1
1810,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens clears the brush and brambles that have sprawled out of control for 30 years, clearing the way to what should be an incredible new series of films. Kylo Ren is the best fleshed out villain in the Star Wars universe. Never before have we been so connected to the antagonist. But Kylo Ren isn’t the only new character worth noting. I’d go so far as to say that all of the new characters are exciting, memorable and worth seeing in future films. Unfortunately some characters get sidelined for major portions of the movie. With the bulk of content the story needs to cover, the movie moves at light speed. This leads to plot holes, convenient plot devices, and circumcised emotional moments. The filmmakers are trying to cram so much information into 2 hours that the film suffers. In the process of trimming fat from the story, the filmmakers took a little too much meat.",1
1811,"Excellent continuation of the star wars universe! J.J. Abrams has done an fantastic job at making star wars relevant again. Jaw Dropping visuals, intense battles and impressive story telling really makes The force awakens as one of the best 2015 has to offer.",1
1812,"Great Movie! The movie had a bunch of new characters as well as old ones. The story was great, and had almost every aspect of a Star Wars movie every fan would want. The Story line was somewhat of a mix of the different aspects of 4, 5, and 6, but I don’t want to spoil anything for anybody. John Boyega did a terrific job at acting, and same with Daisy Ridley, although both kinda overacted if ya know what I mean.Overall great movie definite 10/10! This is probably the best movie of 2015 in my opinion tbh.What I didn't like was the fact that there was no backstory though, I felt as this could have done a way better job if they explained how the first order happened and things like that. Overall great movie, and it's definitely worth watching. This is obviously nothing compared to the original 3, but way way better than the prequels.",1
1813,"The stakes were high on Disney and JJ Abrams to deliver with the Force Awkens. Star Wars was either going to just fade away like a celebrity that had seen better days yet trying to hang on to former glories or it was going to find its pulse again and reignite young and old into the Star Wars universe. Find its pulse, it certainly done. The adventure, humour, romance that George Lucas introduced the world too back in 1977 makes a triumphant return. The way we fell in love with the original cast, the new cast has that allure too. For sure it is sentimental to the older generation (something that Lucas discarded in 1,2 & 3) All generations were catered fir here and in particular one small droid called BB-8. It also offers the non star wars fans a route into the story. Was it worth the wait. Certainly and as a big Star Wars fan that felt let down by Lucas with 1,2 & 3 I say that with great delight and relief. Witness the movie for yourself and enjoy.",1
1814,The movie was great. It had everything I could of wanted and I am eagerly awaiting a second viewing. There were moments I questioned why Rey was progressing so quickly and the ending was a little ham fisted but I'm sure in the sequels all will be revealed.,1
1815,"I can see why many hard core fans would not like this movie, as it wiped out so much canon of the star wars universe, but honestly I think it is a good thing, and they did very well with this.  Yes, it mirrors A New Hope (IV) in many ways...but so does return of the Jedi, I have no problem with this.  The dark side has always tried to build big bad weapons that could obliterate everything, so taking nearly 30 years to turn an entire planet into a weapon is a fine plot point, and very dangerous.  Sure, you ""know"" the good guys are going to win, but it really seems desperate the entire movie.  I think they have done a great job respecting the old characters, and gave them great roles in the new star wars universe, really used the idea of the force as it was supposed to be, subtle but present, but set the new heros up for a great success. The reason I am deducting one point from this score is that I felt the relationship between some of the characters felt forced, and was not great acting.  Poe and Finn would not have a total ""bro"" moment after meeting again at the rebel base, it was a really stupid scene.  Finn and Rey's connection seems rushed, but maybe there is a reason for this, I think she would have fallen more for the ace pilot (Poe) over the stormtrooper deserter, but w/e.  I felt too that the moment between Han and his son was just not genuine, and that Ren's acting overall was just not great. Lots of positives, lots to go on here, not a perfect movie, but I think on its own, its an awsome movie.  Great balance of action, drama, character development",1
1816,"“The Force Awakens”, the first in a brand new trilogy of Star Wars films that picks up some three decades after the events of the original trilogy that began with Star Wars (1977), continued with The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and ended with Return of the Jedi (1983), ignites the franchise’s new era with a bang, and is sure to create a new generation of fans, while also satisfying the grown-ups in the audience whose main interest might be nostalgia for the original series.The main plot concerns the search for the missing Luke Skywalker, the original series’ hero who has since disappeared in the intervening years. Skywalker is being searched for by both the First Order, a newly risen evil empire led by the villainous Kylo Ren (essentially a new, updated version of Darth Vader), and a movement called The Resistance, led by Skywalker’s sister Leia.Featuring the return of the franchise’s original stars, Harrison Ford (who reprises the role of Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Leia), and Mark Hamill (Skywalker), the movie is simultaneously a tribute to the original Star Wars and a passing of the torch from this legendary trio to a new trio of heroes, played by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac.  Ridley, who plays Rey, an impoverished orphan girl on a desert planet, is the breakout star here, mixing the vitality of youth with an incredible confidence usually only seen in seasoned actors. Prior to this film, Ridley was the definition of unknown – she didn’t even have an IMDB or Wikipedia page, and had never starred in a theatrically released movie, so as much of a gamble as her casting was for the filmmakers, there’s no question that they made the right decision.Boyega holds his own as Finn, a soldier for the enemy First Order, who after feeling a pang of conscience after a battle, switches sides to join Rey and the Resistance. Finn is clearly interested in Rey, although it’s not clear if she reciprocates this, and we’ll presumably have to wait for the next episode to find out.Isaac plays Poe Dameron, a pilot in the Resistance, considered by many “the best pilot in the galaxy”. Isaac adds such an aura of “cool” to the film it’s a shame he didn’t get more scenes.And rounding out the main cast of newcomers is Adam Driver, who plays Kylo Ren, Lupita N’yongo as cosmic bar owner Maz Kanata, and Andy Serkis as the sinister Supreme Leader Snoke.With a franchise this revered, director JJ Abrams is wise to stick to story basics rather than experimenting, and the main plot points for The Force Awakens and the original Star Wars are so similar as to be unmistakably intentional. Abrams’ experimentation shows up more in the casting than in the narrative. Having a female lead character is sure to expand the fan base for Star Wars, as well as address the concerns of many critics of the film establishment bemoaning the lack of strong female leads at the box office. Another interesting casting choice is the youth of the primary villain. Driver’s Kylo Ren appears to only be in his 20s or early 30s, much younger than the relatively aging villains that have typically permeated this series – this perhaps hints at a more innate nature to Ren’s evilness. And for the pure fun factor, the new robotic character of BB-8 – a sphere-shaped robot with a playful personality – is sure to be a hit, especially with kids.“The Force Awakens”, currently in wide release, has broken several box office records, including: largest opening day gross ($119 million), largest opening weekend gross ($247 million), and fastest movie to gross a billion dollars (12 days).",1
1817,"It's a pretty good movie. However, one or two parts about the story didn't really make sense. The villain wasn't really powerful as I hope he was. Still a good movie.",1
1818,"The Movie was very well displayed. All the characters were very well thought out and so were the Dialogues, although Kylo Ren could have been more evil",1
1819,"I would never stop to get amazed over how people need the feel to convince the rest of their convictions... You liked the movie.. .great for you! You didn't... so don't go any more? What entitles anyone to what a Star Wars movie should be? This is what it is... If you liked it, I guess it is best for you because you payed for it... If you don't... well, I'll have to guess you were predisposed to hate this one, because I feel that it delivers exactly what people wanted... Episode IV again with new characters and XXI century effects. That's it... No more no less... But I don't need to convince anybody of anything. I liked it, I enjoyed it, and I will probably watch it again just for the pleasure of watching xwings near water...",1
1820,"I'll certainly say this: It felt like a true war in the stars. Something the prequels were missing. Loved the action, the new and old characters, the sounds. All of it was top notch. And that Han Solo moment - brought a tear to my eye. I was loving the film up to that point, but I felt like it was missing a real unforgettable moment - this was it. I knew it was coming the second it was set-up, but that didn't take away from it at all. I remember having a moment of losing my breath, and I can't remember the last time that happened in a movie. I certainly got my moneys worth out of this one. Fantastic film. 9.5/10",1
1822,"Exceeded my expectations. Has a great mix of action, humour, interesting characters and a fascinating new story. I give Star Wars: The Force Awakens a 10 not because I think it's a perfect film, but because it's damn close and 9 just isn't good enough.",1
1823,"Great movie ,not as unrealistic as the first 3 episodes and not as simple as the last 3 episodes , i loved it and to be honest i was expecting something worse than this.",1
1824,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a very entertaining Star Wars movie. It isn't as good as the originals but is far superior to the prequels. The film feels over-familiar in a lot of ways but fresh and exciting in others. Most importantly, it sets a strong foundation from where Star Wars can go anywhere. Episode VIII can't come soon enough!",1
1825,"Don't know what movie others were watching, but I was watching Star Wars and it was awesome!  I sat in a movie house almost 40 years ago and watched and incredible world and today in another movie house was like welcoming back an old friend -- who I have missed terribly.  So very pleased and excited to finally see this movie",1
1826,"The Force Awakens brings us back to the original Star Wars we loved and ignores the super-disappointing Prequels, I know there are fans of the Prequels out there and they had to endure years of being made fun for liking movies that the vast-majority will agree that the Prequels are very disappointing.",1
1827,"Not quite a home run, but satisfying to any sane Star Wars fan. Admittedly, because its Star Wars it's put to anything less than magical stings a little more because of how special this franchise is to myself and many many others. Many of us who lovingly criticize this movie are hoping the next one is free to tell its own story and show us something new. +New cast/characters are stellar+Beautiful sets and cinematography+No Jar Jar-Too many wink-wink moments to previous films-Certain problematic plot points could have been easily addressed",1
1828,"J.J. Abrams resuscitates a franchise and delivers the movie event of the year The wait is over. The movie event of the year is here. Star Wars: The Force Awakens, number seven in the series for those who wouldn't know a Jedi from a Jar Jar, emerges bloody with unrealistic expectations but gloriously unbowed. It's everything the kid in us goes to the movies for — marvelous adventure that leaves us surprised, scared and euphoric. So let out a Wookiee roar for director J.J. Abrams who sweeps us out of the black hole of George's Lucas' trilogy of paralyzingly dull Star Wars prequels and into a brave new world. Okay, not quite. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is basically an updated remake of Star Wars: A New Hope, the 1977 Lucas original that changed the face of movie space epics and made us all one with the Force. Now it's three decades later. Our heroes have a little age on them, they being Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). It's great that Chewbacca, C3Po and R2D2 look exactly the same. The newbies are repped by Rey (Daisy Ridley), a desert scavenger abandoned by her family on Jukku; Finn (John Boyega), an AWOL stormtrooper with little taste for killing; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a pilot working for Leia, a princess turned general who now leads the Resistance. Hey, wait up. Didn’t 1983's Return of the Jedi feature Ewoks dancing their fluffy tails off over the demise of Darth Vader and the defeat of the Empire. Yeah, but what would a Star Wars movie be without evil? So Abrams and cowriters Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (he co-wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) provide a doozy. A fresh malevolence called the First Order has emerged from the ruins of the Empire. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis by motion capture) operates out of a space station that makes the Death Star look like a Lego. His villainous young protégé is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a masked figure who communes so regularly with Vader's mangled helmet that a long future in therapy is a given. The bald-faced attempt to clone Vader, one of the greatest badasses in film history, is clankingly obvious, but Driver, masked and unmasked, gives him hypnotic and haunting contours. As any Star Wars fan knows, bloodlines are crucial to the plot. And there are times when everyone seems related to everyone else. (The Lucas template is drawn from sources as diverse as the Bible, Shakespeare, Oedipus Rex and Road Runner cartoons.) Bad things happen to those who issue spoilers about this franchise. But I will say this: The action, from lightsaber duels to X-wing dogfights with TIE Fighters, is explosive and buoyed by John Williams' exultant score. And the movie is also funny as hell. Abrams knows how to build a laugh and fill the emotional spaces between words. He's a fanboy who knows what fanboys want, but he also delivers the goods for the rest of us. Giving starring roles to a black man, a white woman and a Latino is the right idea that could have gone seriously wrong; instead, it's quietly history making. Isaac oozes flyboy charm, Boyega, bracingly comic and cunning, is a find, and Ridley (both she and Boyega are Brits) is a star in the making. Rey is the kind of can-do woman of heart and mind who can make a franchise. I'm not just talking marketing. Her scenes with the equally purposeful Leia have a femcentric wit and warmth. The new actors are all aces. But no one can steal a scene from BB-8, a droid who looks like an orange-and-white beach ball on a continuous roll. No one, except for Ford who owns this film from his first crooked grin. If you don't lose it when Ford's Han Solo reenters the Millennium Falcon, a hunk of junk he calls a spacecraft, you truly deserve banishment to the dark side. ""Chewie, we're home,"" he says. Truer words have never been spoken.",1
1829,"I guess this will be somewhat of a review on both the movie... And other reviews. To begin with the movie, I do not think it was in any way a perfect movie. There's little to medium issues throughout, as every movie I've ever seen has, including the classic trilogy that I grew up with and is near and dear to my heart, yet imperfect in many ways. The primary major flaws that seriously bother me and actually keep me from enjoying the movie as much as I would like to have to with the new (not a) Death Star. On principal, I didn't want to see another Death Star. It's been done twice before and I liked both those times and they mostly worked, but give it a rest. I believe Rogue One I'll center around the mission to acquire the plans to the original Death Star (spoiler? I don't know. It's what I've heard. If it's true, then it's the main plot and you'll at least know that much before seeing the movie, anyway.) and I'm okay with that. That actually sounds interesting. But no more new (not a) Death Stars! They're obviously not something the bad guys are good at defending and should maybe try something else. Would've still been cool to just be their headquarters or a major factory or something. Anyway, besides being a third DS, even worse is the way it functions. The previous models made scifantasy sense. I can accept their workings. The new one just stretches the limit of what is possible, even in a scifi fantasy too far. It's called Starkiller, but it's not a star killer. It does kill the initial star by absorbing it to power its weapon, all while remaining an ice planet, but then it shoots through hyperspace to hit a target in s different part of the Galaxy and doesn't just destroy that planet - it makes that planet explode into becoming a new star. And, when destroyed itself, it becomes a new star. The whole scenario is just too ridiculous for me to accept. Better to do the version the old EU books did. Instead of destroying a single planet, it makes a star go nova and destroys the whole solar system. It would look cooler and - to me - make a whole lot more pretend sense. Also, the planets being blown up can instantly be seen in a completely different solar system on s planet during the day, as clear and big as if in that planet's own atmosphere. It looked pretty. But it's insanely beyond belief impossible. Anyway, that really bothers me, but the way the weapon functions really isn't all that relevant or a huge part of the actual story. I thought the acting, effects, pacing, overall story, new characters, drama, humor, dialogue, basically mostly everything was pretty great. Not perfect. I can happily pick many negatives in anything that I still thoroughly enjoy. There's a lot of nitpicking I could do. Like I could do with literally every movie I've seen. I guess it comes down to how much there is and how much it bothers you. What I enjoyed greatly outweighed what bothered me. I feel like the prequels set in s great depression and the Force Awakens brings back the spirit of Star Wars. Easily the best and most enjoyable Episode in the past few decades. On the topic of it being ANH repeated: yes, it does hit many of the same beats. But it is not the same story. It hits many, but not all, of the same beats, while building its own tale, and I'm glad for it. It hit a few too many (ahem - Desth Star 3), but I liked the beats it hit and it introduced a lot of new elements. It had s slightly awkward ending, but it was also made knowing that it was getting a sequel, allowing itself to get away with leaving many loose ends. There's s bit of good and bad to this, but I think it's left in s cool place for the next episode and I do expect that one to go more in its own direction. Now for reviewing reviews. I know it's nothing new on sites like this, but I just think it's ridiculous and can't understand these scores. Lots of perfect 10s, which is frankly s bit unrealistic in my view, but also sooo many absolute 0s. Come on, guys. Let's think about this. By giving it a zero, you are actually saying that this equal to or worse than the worst movie you had ever seen in your life prior to seeing this. That is just absurd. I am completely confident that is not true. Unless maybe you've only ever seen 9 other movies. You may not like it. It may not be what you wanted. But it's not Catwoman bad. It's not... Whatever bad. I'm sure there's something you've seen that's much, much worse. It's flawed, sure, but a zero? That's just childish. Give it a 1 for not having Ewoks.",1
1830,"Great movie, enjoyed every minute as their were no dull moments.  Not a perfect film as it really did copy New Hope's plot but the introduction of Rey and Finn was a big step but it paid off massively.  John and Daisy were excellent in this, their chemistry was so good it reminded me of Han and Leia (although obviously not as good).  The action scenes were fantastic, no over use of CGI but Abrams instead used real sets.  I really cared for Rey and Finn which is something most movies dont do for me.",1
1831,"absolutely amazing  and no jar jar-esque character   or over done cgiwow...loved this.  JJ Abrams should direct all three. 800 million alreadyi hope RIAN jOHNSON can match JJ Abrams in episode 8all you zero spammers get the heck off ruining metacritic",1
1832,"I didn't feel like tip-toeing around spoilers as it's super hard to not talk about them, so read at your own risk. First off, while I wasn't alive when the original trilogy came out they were some of my first movies that I learned to love. The prequels were coming out at that time, and while they were entertaining for a young kid like me I could tell that they weren't as good as the originals. Episode 7 is absolutely a million miles better than the prequels, and are almost up there next to the originals in my opinion. It's a massive love letter to A New Hope, and while the structure might seem a tad too familiar, the movie stands on it's own in many ways. First the characters, Han is great, always will be great. Leia hasn't exactly aged as well over the years, and is missing some of the spunk she once had, but is still a welcome sight in the film and the relationship between her and Solo is still very believable. What really impressed me was the character of Rey. I don't quite know how to fully describe her, but her character arc is absolutely fantastic. She is basically the center of the story, and from the get-go you can see her spirit and youthfulness, her sense of wisdom but also inexperience. Finn and Poe Dameron are also well portrayed, Finn being a very headstrong yet sympathetic type. I felt that his sudden change of heart was a little too abrupt and convenient for the story sake, but he works well with Rey and Han as the leads. Not a fan of Snoke, the villain reminiscent of the Emperor. Maybe it was the fact he looked like a mix between the villain from Guardians of the Galaxy, and Gollum. He didn't frighten me like Kylo Ren did, and the set-up of him being the real bad guy behind everything really isn't all that convincing. Kylo Ren on the other hand is a real three-dimensional villain, torn between his parents Leia and Han, and seduction of the dark side. It's hinted we will learn a lot more about his fall to the dark side, and I'm really excited to see how it plays out. Many have criticized how much the structure follows A New Hope almost to point for point, I argue that while yes it does, it does it all with such confidence that it's more of a massive nostalgia kick than a been there done that. The characters are what really pull the story through, and add enough originality that left me so excited to see how the rest of it plays out. Rey's training, the fight against the New Order, Leia's relationship with her son and how she'll have to handle it. I really hope the next couple movies can take this set-up and run with it (in a good way). I love how authentic this universe feels, and I was pleasantly reminded of the original trilogy throughout, while growing attached to the new cast at the same time.",1
1833,"Just left the Cinema and thought the film was absolutely brilliant, well done to Disney and JJ abrams you have completely restored my faith in the Star Wars films after the CGI heavy prequels. This film ticked every box and was great to see a film that was obviously made with a lot of love and passion for the franchise, loved seeing the Falcon again, the Sabre flash back scene, the X-Wings racing to the rescue and the Kylo Ren, and Rey fight in the woods, 5 stars all around and cant wait for episode 8.",1
1834,"Great movie, but too much seemed like Episode IV. It followed ""The Hero's Journey"" trope too much, and, while entertained, I sat through the movie waiting for something different.",1
1835,"The Force Awakens from the great director J.J Abrams is a great start to the new trilogy and exceeded my expectations. He has brought the series back to life in a fabulous way. It incorporates a mix of new characters and old characters, which is important to the film's story. Ridley and Boyega are both great actors who portray Rey and Finn well. Also Han and Chewie had a good and needed return. The main villain Kylo Ren was not quite as scary as Darth, however, he was intimidating and ruthless, just like a villain should be. Saying this though, Driver was an awful pick to portray him while not in the suit. I personally think he looked like an older teenager. Apart from this it was though. While the film was not as good as the original, it was better than all the prequel trilogy films combined. And of course it is worth a watch.",1
1836,"Better than all the prequels combined, and as good as the originals. This movie has the same magic as the originals. The characters have depth. The acting is superb, and the use of CGI was used sparingly and done well. You will find yourself feeling the way you did when you first saw Star Wars and then some new aspects that the Star Wars universe has not yet experienced.",1
1837,"I loved this movie. I know that the sexists and racists have problems with this movie, but if you're a decent human being you'll love the fact that there is more racial diversity than in previous Star Wars film and you won't give a crap if the hero is a woman. Daisy Ridley is both a beautiful woman and an amazing actress. She made the movie what it is. Who said the Force had to be specific to men... Yes, she bests Ben. What's the problem. The movie makes it clear she know how to defend herself early. Think about it. She is a woman who was abandoned and had to grow up among thieves and scoundrels. It makes sense she knew how to somewhat hold a lightsaber at the end of the film. Additional, Ben was shot. He could have been dying as he had to face Fin and Rey. I don't think it was easy for him to swing a lightsaber when is bleeding to death. The movie had amazing cinematography. The direction was solid. The acting overall was great, except for Carrie Fisher. She dropped the ball, and she's most probably the reason the final confrontation between Han and Ben wasn't as impacting. She either needs to step up, or they need to rethink her role in future films. Harrison Ford was fun to see again in this movie. I hate that he died. I love Chewy. I recommend you watch this movie. Hater will drag the score down, but the movie is great.",1
1838,"Just great and everything I wanted out of a new Star Wars. Great new characters and the oldies were good once again. Amazing score from John Williams and the action was just mind blowing. Despite some of it's minor flaws regarding story telling, it didn't affect the enjoyment I had from this movie. Definitely the best Star Wars we had since The Empire Strikes Back.",1
1839,"It has the funniest and smartest dialogue of the series. It has wonderful chemistry between the actors. It's beautiful to look at. And Chewbacca finally gets some respect. At the same time, Abrams certainly has established himself more as a perfecter of pop culture more than an innovator of it. In some ways this is impressive, and I do think you could make an argument that this film's parts are better than the elements of the films it rather brazenly cribs. And it doesn't just crib A New Hope. SPOILER ALERT: Finally, especially for those who have reacted with extreme negativity to the derivative themes and plot elements, it is worth considering the scene in which the Resistance plans its attack on the whatever the heck its called Death Star Planet Starkiller Ha Yes Seriously. The dialogue in that scene is shockingly confident with self-parody. The movie knows what it's doing.. It does it with extreme confidence and a wink. And it works. It's basically Han Solo's method put to film.",1
1840,"Episode VII satisfyingly drums the nostalgia growing inside lovers of Episodes 4 through 6, while presenting a more realistic image of the Empire's/ First Order's war machine. There are new characters for a new audience and a new time, but the series has some explaining to do with regards to how quickly the Force Awakens in some of these vulnerable new leads. Hopefully it does so while being mindful of its history to avoid jumping the shark visually or with character development . Overall, I like what this is turning into...",1
1841,"The movie is really good and the fact that it repeats some parts of the original trilogy could have an explanation like mass effect in future films.Maybe is the destiny of the skywalkers to repeat some cycle until they reach the balance in the force.Maybe the Jedi are the guardians of the balance and always kept the galaxy to destroy itself with technology like the death stars.I suspect that Luke disapear for this reason.",1
1842,"The Force is with this one. absolutely loved this film, ticks all the boxes in my opinion, great to see a young actress taking on the main role, I thought Daisy Ridley was brilliant. Harrison Ford was brilliant too although I feel the young cast has brought a certain freshness to the Franchise, bb8 is a great addition. and loved Kylo Ren, cant wait for episode 8.",1
1843,"The 3rd best Star Wars movie. It has some script issues, but other than that it is a perfect start to the new Disney trilogy/ monstrous empire of a series.",1
1844,"Overall it was a good screenplay and had a modern twist to ""A new hope"" to reboot the franchise into this era of film. However it was too fast paced for certain things to be believable, most notably the protagonists connection to the force. It's okay to setup a sequel, but there are way too many open questions at the end of this film. The antagonist has emotional issues and appears weak too often to be considered a Jedi. The progression of the antagonist also does not make much sense the way he behaves in the beginning of the film compared to the end. Certain parts just don't add up, but a fun film to watch if you're not that critical.",1
1845,"TL;DRThey played it safe, They've gone full Marvel and played it safe to be successful. A lot of the movie does things wrong, (twists are introduced poorly). The twists are **** amazing. I loved the who's who aspect of it, but it's presented the worst way possible.Imagine if Darth Vader told Luke he was his father on the phone, while calling him for the first time in his life. And no introduction, just: ""Hey, I'm Darth Vader, your father.""Worst presentation. the fact of who is who's father is good, interesting spin to the story, but how it's just said as a fact was a disaster.",1
1846,"So let me start off by saying that I left the movie theater feeling very happy – which is more than some would dare expect. After the fiasco of the second trilogy, this installment felt very fresh and brought back many old feelings. With that said, I think it would be fair to break it down into some aspects: Characters (9.5): It’s extraordinary how likable the characters in this movie were, and even more extraordinary is the fact that they felt very original! From the heroes to the villains the aliens to the droids, it all felt very much like Star Wars. Some of the are simply brilliant while some are not, but every single one was very well written. Dialogue (10): Loved what they did with the dialogue. The jokes are well timed, and the fact that the characters are very enthusiastic of their own feats feels very real and relatable. Soundtrack (7): It seems as though they were going for something minimalistic. The soundtrack is beautiful but very discreet, and the original themes feel a little underused. There are some triumphant moments, though. Combat (10): For me, this was by far the best Star Wars in terms of combat, with both spaceships and lightsabers. The TIE Fighters/X-Wing shots are gorgeous, the ships feel very real and it’s as though we can feel their weight and their precision. The final lightsaber battle is simply amazing, and it’s THE FIRST BATTLE EVER WHERE IT ACTUALLY SEEMS THEY’RE TRYING TO HIT EACH OTHER! No choreographed bullsh*t, very real and believable action. Loved that part. Plot (5): Unfortunately, that’s where it falls short – very short. There’s no saying much here without spoiling the movie, but let’s just say that there’s a permanent feeling of “been there, done that”. As much of a tribute to the original movie as it is, it could have used a lot more innovation. All in all, I think it was a great start for the new trilogy. Was it amazing? No, not really. But it seems to be on the right track, and I’m very optimistic about the future of the saga.",1
1847,"Just incredible, the feelings, the emotions, being the first star wars movie i see on a cinema i want to watch it 30 times more, but it gave us more questions than answers we had before, also there's not that much originality to it, kinda similar to episode IV. that's why the 7.",1
1848,"Star Wars: The Force Awakes is fantastic!  Feels like you stepped into a nostalgia time machine.  Even better, getting to share that feeling with your kids, lightsaber in one hand, popcorn in the other.",1
1849,"as a  Star Wars fan I felt that The Force Awakens has returned to the Star Wars that i've liked from the originals. In my opinion it has all the excitement and emotion and adventure like the originals has, even though parts of the plot for the new film can present it self to be recycled at times, it has all the right chemistry that the originals had to keep invested, its has the perfect chemistry with the script of the characters also that made The Force Awakens enjoyable. What was also great about the film is how it made great use with a nice combonation between pratical special effects and CGI which in my opinion made the film more immersive. is it a great as the originals, almost, is it far better than the prequels, most definitly, so is the The Force awakens worth a second viewing on the big screen, yes.",1
1850,"Here's the most honest fan review of the Force Awakens you'll see on this site. This is coming from a life long fan of Star Wars. First let's talk about all of the extreme hate this movie seems to be getting with some fans. This movie is not perfect and I'll explain that later, but giving this movie anything below a 3 because ""it's a remake of the original"" is just ridiculous. So this movie is so bad that it's worse than Fantastic Four?!? Taken 3?!? Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?!? Sure, there are elements that are similar to other movies, but whether you are a fan of the prequels or the originals you could say the same for many of the other Star Wars movies. The attack on the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi is very similar to the big battle in A New Hope. Anakin growing up on Tatooine parallel's Luke's childhood. The Wookies (in ep III) and Gungans (in ep I) are very similar to the Ewoks ""nature vs technology"" theme from episode 6. So, why this gets so much extra hate I'll never know. In all honest I think many of the extreme negative reviews are written by prequel children who are sore at the fact that a new Star Wars (not helmed by Lucas) is getting rave reviews and breaking every box office record on the planet. Notice how most of the hateful reviewers have oddly Star Wars specific user-names and also have terrible grammar and spelling. Might give you a hint to the mindset of who is writing multiple reviews for the same movie.  If that doesn't help, click on a reviewer (positive or negative) and you'll see some that have 1 or few reviews.. that's the sign of someone creating multiple accounts to review a movie more than once in effect drastically changing it's score.Anyways, now onto the Pros and Cons: Cons:* There is way too much coincidence in JJ's story telling. All of the characters in the movie just happen to run into each other to make the story happen. Objects and MacGuffins just show up in the strangest places because they are needed for the story. You can say it's fate.. or destiny.. or the Force, but I think it's just lazy writing. With some thought and effort there could be a better way to get the story to come together.* Where are all of the cool aliens and species from the last 6 movies? As a Star Wars buff I did not see any of the aliens I've seen in Star Wars lore over the last 40 years. In that regard it didn't seem as much like Star Wars and could have been any sci-fi epic.* JJ put a little too much mystery in my Star Wars. It seems like we are dropped in the middle of a story, not at the beginning. I left the movie with more questions than answers. Pros* Han Solo is the star of this film and for good reason. In the previous films he was just part of the secondary (or third) story line, but here he and his smuggling past is front and center.* Kyle Ren is an interesting new villain. Though he might try to emulate a famous Sith lord, he is anything but. I find that a lot more interesting than just another cool-headed, scheming, uber-powerful Sith master.* The original Star Wars heroes were archetypes of fantasy characters like the old wizard, the princess, the pirate and the farm boy. Well this movie they archetypes of the Star Wars universe itself... a stormtrooper, an ace pilot and a scavenger. I love that.* Though some of JJ's directing style might be a little too flashy for my tastes, everything else in movie.. from the practical effects are top notch.* Humor is back in Star Wars and in a good way. I'm laughing with the move instead of at it as in previous films.* There are some genuinely heart breaking moments in this movie. There is so much more emotion and passion in this movie, something I think the Star Wars universe has been missing for a couple decades now. In short, the first half of the movie is too much coincidence and everything quickly and conveniently falls into place, but once the movie finds it's pace it turns into the 3rd or 4th best Star Wars movie of all time. It's a good beginning to a new trilogy and I can't wait to see what's next in the Star Wars universe.",1
1851,The Force Awakens is a return to form for Star Wars. While I never hated the prequel trilogy; the original trilogy is still the best in my eyes. The plot in the Force Awakens moves at a brisk pace. Perhaps its the pacing that hides one of the biggest underlying issues the Force Awakens has. Upon reflecting on the film you will start to wonder about some notable plot holes that aren't quite explained in the movie. This is all the more evident in that the Force Awakens follows many of the same story beats from A New Hope. The end result feels a bit copy/paste but it doesn't make it a bad film. In some ways perhaps its appropriate that it draws inspiration from a New Hope. That is ultimately what Force Awakens is for the Star Wars franchise. Its a new hope for Star Wars Fans young and old.,1
1852,"Star Wars - Force Awakens. Solid 8.75/10Give me a break with all the 5 or below user scores.  Get a job people, and make useful comments to serve the community.The star wars series was never a super clever masterpiece.  That's OK.  It does not need to be to still give us an imagination inspiring fun romp.  The series gives us a legacy worthy mass pop culture inclusions.I was a star wars fan before the film and remain so after.  This was a very good movie telling us what happened after Vader fell and the death star exploded. Pros - several characters we know and love are back, great special effects, felt like coming home warm and cozy, some questions as to who some characters were kept it interesting.Cons- a little to much pandering to fans with rehash of lines and story ideas (essential to have some but maybe a bit much (rehash).",1
1853,"If you gave this film a zero you are whiney little fanboy who isn’t ever going  to be pleased by anything at all and you may as well just give up on Star Wars and let the rest of us enjoy star wars return to form. Is this film perfect? Nope.    Is it very good? Yeah it is. does it reuse familiar plot points, hell yeah but it adds a lot and the pace structre and characters are all brand new and entertaining. IF you like star wars and you re not already pre disposed to dislike this film then you will probably enjoy this film. Hard-core Star wars fans make my head hurt, make up your minds what you want and try to be reasonable or at least partially rationale.",1
1854,"When this movie was announced I was scared that it could ruin the franchise and that it could never live up to the hype, I was so wrong J.J Abrams gives us one of the best Star Wars movie ever. It may have taken a bit too much from a Episode 4 but the new characters and story give it an identity of its own. The new Characters are great Kylo Ren is a great successor to Darth Vader the conflict you see in the character make him one of the best villain in Star Wars.",1
1855,"I'm really short on words on this amazing movie. It lived up to my expectations as a Star Wars fan and even exceeded them. The new characters Fin, Rey, Kylo Ren, BB-8, Poe are all great characters and were developed very well. The action and dialogue were amazing, old characters like Han, Chewie, Leia were also fantastic. The plot was also good even though there are some similarities to IV, it still set up the trilogy fantastically. What i also love is that it reveals a lot but also leaves a lot of questions unanswered. T The final scenes are also full of emotion and are just delivered perfectly. It is a fantastic return for star wars, probably the 2nd or 3rd best star wars movie to date.",1
1856,"The people giving this movie zero's and 1, 2 or 3 scores, from what I've read either haven't seen the movie or arent real star wars fans. The movie is fantastic, the acting was great, the comedy was a great addition, the fights looked realistic, the music is awesome, the story is similar to episode 4, which was playing safe but it worked. The movie has charm and a bright future while it was a similar to a new hope it has many different layers. Besides, of course it reminds you of the old movies, one it was intended to, secondly, it's in the same universe with many of the same characters in similar locations or even the same locations a times, it is a sequel after all.",1
1857,"This film is really good . My real mark is near 8-9. But i give it a 10 because this film not so bad,it's really nicely action film for watch it with friend",1
1859,"Definitely better than the prequel's, but it doesn't answer alot of questions, nor even ask some of the questions you felt they would have been building too. The main problem I have with this movie is the fact that  it doesn't do a great job explaining what happened between Return of the Jedi and this movie. Alot of stuff clearly happened and I suppose some of that is answered in the books. But the movie glosses over that real quickly to get to the action. It's a good time and I think most Star Wars fans will like the finished product, even as it builds up for something down the line. This movie was all about laying the ground work for the next two movies and will be better once those movies are released IMO. The movie is good now but it could start what might be a great trilogy going forward and that's what will be the biggest legacy this movie will have, whether the next two movies capitalize on the plot going forward.",1
1860,Thought it was a well done remake with amazing special effects. The movie used 3D to its advantage and it felt like you were on the battlefield. Story is very similar to past Star Wars but this is the first of the new trilogy. Overall great movie and definitely worth seeing in theatres.,1
1861,"I was hoping it would be just what it needed to be to save the franchise from the glum and frankly painful prequels. I entered the cinema with such apprehension, noted the lack of the Twentieth Century fanfare and then those yellow letters crawling up the screen. As I read I thought, yes no mumbo-jumbo, a nice simple description of where we are, I can go with this… And oh hell yes, it was just non-stop ‘STAR WARS’, that how you save a sinking ship. Yes it leans heavily on plot points/devices from the original trilogy but isn’t that the one we love? The action sequences are breathtaking, there is even comedy not Jar Jar cringe but more akin to Marvel’s Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. Most important of all, there are characters and character development i.e. - acting! The new comers steal the show in the best way possible. It ain’t perfect but which of the original three were? I walked out of the theatre with a feeling I hadn’t felt since The Empire Strikes Back. J. J. has left us wanting more, and where else would you want to be!",1
1862,"The force awakens blows the phantom menace and attack of the clones out of the water. Although this movie is basically a rehash of a new hope in several ways, I will say J.J abrams has done it well though. Also Adam drivers kylo ren is getting a lot of bad rap because ""he didn't look intimidating"" and every sith should look intimidating. Well people kylo ren wasn't necessarily a sith but more of a man with a agenda to become like his grandfather....Darth vader.",1
1863,"Great Star Wars movie. The characters were great, the story was great, and the action was fairly good. My only complaints are that it was a bit slow action-wise, but that's because it's beginning the new trilogy, and also that the whole plot seemed kind of similar to A New Hope. Not extremely, but there were some similarities. Overall, this movie was not a disappointment and is a fresh entry into the new trilogy. Go see it.",1
1864,"Not bad Disney, not bad. If you're a huge SW fan and you go to watch this movie with your expectations low as I did, you might be gladly surprised of how much this movie doesn't suck. It is not a masterpiece, but it's not bad either. Most importantly, when the movie finished I didn't leave with that bitter sensation from Episode I, quite the contrary, I found myself whistling the Star Wars theme while driving home. It does rely a lot on nostalgia to please the fans, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. It also introduced new characters, which I found refreshing and I think it's something the franchise really needed. The acting from the main characters was decent-good and the effects were excellent as in most modern high-budget movies. Overall a solid 7, I would recommend watching it if you have the slightest interest for Star Wars.",1
1866,"Liked it a lot!I've watched all the movies of saga. And though some find this movie a copy&paste, I don't. Yes, they took some elements from previous movies to create a nostalgia effect, but in general it felt really fresh for me!Love new characters, especially Rey, probably the main character of the film, and Kylo, terrifying villain with really deep personality and backstory.Last scene of the movie made me wait for the VIII extremely impatiently.But of course, movie has flaws (nothing is perfect), so don't get overexcited before watching it, if you want to have a good impressions!",1
1867,"I wasn't initially a huge fan of Star Wars, the prequels were almost entirely horrible, and the originals had two good films to one average one (not taking into account the 'special edition' changes). This film however, was really top notch. People have criticised it for being similar in structure to the older films, but what does that really matter? A New Hope was released almost 40 years ago; surely enough time has passed to draw some inspiration from it? The Force Awakens is Star Wars for the new generation. If I was a kid now, seeing this for the first time and without any knowledge of the previous six, I would be pretty blown away and looking forward to the next two films in the trilogy.",1
1868,"I went in with an open mind.  I came out pleasantly surprised.  The action scenes were exciting.  The human interest part of the story was intriguing, as well as emotional.  The newcomers, especially Daisy Ridley, were very good.  The special effects were outstanding.  And the story moved quickly, with no time for idle conversation.  Yes, it may have borrowed a little too much from Stars IV.  And maybe Harrison ford and Carrie Fisher have seen their better days.  But Overall, ...""The Force Awakens"" is a crowning success, the 2nd best of the franchise, behind only ""The Empire Strikes Back.  Now that all the fans have gotten their Star Wars fix,  I expect Episode VIII to take the story to new heights.",1
1869,"Such s great movie, it kept me interested from start to end. I've seen it twice and I'll probably see it again. It just brought the feeling of Star Wars back. I completely loved the whole movie.",1
1870,"Not perfect but entertaining: To sum up better than episode 1,2,3 worse than the old trilogy and Rogue one.The good:  1) It's the seventh installment of a long movie franchise and It is a decent film...a quite rare fact on its own. It could have been so much worse if you think of the poor quality sequels of other long movie franchise (Transformers films series for example) 2)It has the same feeling of the old trilogy 3)The original trilogy actors are well integrated in the plot and do not make only a brief cameo.  4)It has humour but not too much 5)It is enjoyable for a young public without being boring for an adult. 6)It makes spectator want more. 7)No gungans, no midichlorian, no annoying children!!!!The bad: 1) The main villain of this episode is not that impressive...almost a little dumb. 2) Plot not too original 3) After the first view in theatre loose his appeal. Keeping in mind that is a sequel give this movie a try.",1
1871,"Let's be honest. To make a new Star Wars movie after all that exists, is a big responsibility. And there is no way *no one* could do something that everybody likes. But, the movie is good. Good if you haven't seen any other of them, and also good if you saw them all. It relays a lot on references to episodes IV to VI, and leaves a lot of questions in the air, which is good, because it will keep you hungry for more.",1
1872,"Do not watch this movie expecting nostalgia. just, don't, its a different breed, its on a different footing. Do not expect too much, do not put it on a pedastool either, do not compare its characters with the other films. Done? ok, its a wicked film on its own. full stop.",1
1873,"The Force Awakens is the best film i have seen for a long time. It really is like watching a proper film from years ago, hardly no CGI, great characters, non stop action and the sort of film cinema was made for. 3rd best Star Wars film in my opinion. but what a trilogy we have coming. so made up for the prequels.",1
1874,"I'm not going to lie, I understand why a lot of people have given this film poor ratings but I think they are being especially harsh due to the franchise it represents. Had this been released as a standalone film I reckon most ratings and reviews would be in the 7 or 8 out of 10 range. Admittedly the plot isn't exactly going to blow your mind but the mere nostalgia of the Star Wars universe brought a tear to my eye. The action is well filmed and the special effects, as one might expect, are fantastic. The introduction of new stars while also featuring many of the old ones marks the start of a new generation for Star Wars fans. Of course it's not the best film I've ever seen but there wasn't a single minute of the film I didn't enjoy. So if you have been delaying in seeing this film because you fear that it won't live up to your expectations, don't, because it will not disappoint.",1
1875,"The Force Awakens is a very entertaining movie. I am a big Star Wars fan, and I loved it. Is it a perfect movie? No. But many of our favorite movies (Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, Star Wars) are not perfect movies. What counts is, was it entertaining? That's not to say I give movies with major plot holes a free pass, but rather I accept that all movies have some flaws, no matter how small, and I just care if those flaws ruin the experience or not. I see people giving TFA very low scores saying it has flaws. That seems silly to me. While watching TFA, I was on the edge of my seat with a big grin on my face the entire time. It wasn't until after watching the entire movie and talking to my wife about it that we started to notice little flaws, but overall the movie was so fun, engaging and entertaining that none of those small flaws matter. Also, I don't give the movie a free pass just because it's Star Wars. While I love the original trilogy, I really disliked the prequels. I felt that TFA was a return to form while also modernizing it with better special effects and quicker pacing. It was respectful of the material that came before while also being it's own thing. I applaud JJ Abrams for pulling this balancing act off masterfully. I also see a small (but scary) portion of user reviews saying that they hated that a woman was the lead character, or they hated having a black character, and all I can say is, if you're a racist, sexist bigot, well, that's your problem, not the movie's. Finally I see some (ironically) confusing reviews filled with grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors saying the movie made no sense. All I can say there is, maybe you need to finish grade school first. Overall, I can honestly say that TFA was easily in the top three movies of the year, along with Inside Out and Mad Max Fury Road.",1
1876,"This was my favorite Star Wars of all 7 so far, honestly. I really enjoyed the main protagonist Rey and really great writing/acting/effects all the movie throughout. Interesting return also to more mysterious Force origins/explanation from the original than in the prequels; the Force awakening felt more mysterious and drove a great narrative.",1
1877,"It was... very, very good.Very good, incredibly good, seriously good, muy buena, muito bon, tres bien, sehr gut, very good, avoid spoilers, go see it.",1
1878,"I saw the movie 24 hours ago, and have had time to process what i saw. It fully accomplishes what it set out to do. There is an entirely new generation of Star Wars fans who relate much more to these characters and their story. I took my nephews, ages 7 and 9, and they have not stopped talking about the movie. All day they have been trying to relate it to Star Wars: Clone Wars and Rebels. Definitely taking them again, getting the DVD, and a trip to the Lego store has already been committed. They were pumped when they saw the Millenium Falcon, but not so much Hans Solo. It was good to see Solo and Leia, but only in small doses. That is why i gave it an 8. This is next generation stuff and they need to pass the torch. And for anyone who is saying it is just the same story rehashed, not so much. It has heroes, villans, and they are headed towards an epic finish. But, in the Star Wars universe, that is what it is. Different characters, different locations, spread over 1,000s of years. Most great sagas follow the same theme. You know, on second thought, probably could have given this movie a 9 simply because there is no Jar Jar Binks.",1
1879,"A sequel and a reboot at the same time, ""The Force Awakens"" takes us on a fun last ride with our beloved characters before introducing to new stories in the next installments, though a third Death Star and that scene with the smugglers were totally unnecessary. Good Star Wars..",1
1880,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens... What the movie lacks at first off is the idea of taking Kylo Ren seriously. Adam Driver's character seemed so dumb and childish throughout the film, we realize that he is a young adult but this isn't a characteristic for a strong villain. His voice was so odd that I was questioning if it made him feel as uncomfortable as I do about it. The death scene of Han Solo was built up yet let down due to the fact of the similarity between this scene and the scene between Luke's fight with Darth Vader. There were many jokes and puns thrown into this film that for some reason were felt to be needed yet I beg to differ. About half of the puns were somewhat humorous in this film all the others were not at all. Oscar Isaac's character Poe decides to start off the stand-up comedy show by saying probably the dumbest line in the movie to the galactic boogeyman known as Kylo Ren, it goes along the lines of something sort of like this, ""So who starts this thing do you talk or do I talk?"" Like what the f*ck, shut up, just sit there acting fearful or whatever to try and build Kylo Ren's ""daunting"" character and save the screenwriter's career ok Poe. I would like to have seen some more of a back story for Rey's character and Jakku in general which will possibly be addressed in Episode 8, but I highly doubt it. One thing I don't like about movies that I know are getting a sequel is that for some reason they feel the need to create the movie as a ""set-up"" for the next sequel. I'm here to watch a movie when I go to the theaters and I guess you all feel the same way, I'm not there to watch a ""set-up"" film. What's great about this film though is that this film really isn't even a ""set-up"" film, I was happy where they left off and they did pretty well with the ending. A very strong point in this whole film is that the acting by everyone (discluding Adam Driver) was done very well. Harrison Ford looked very comfortable back again to reprise his role as Han Solo and I loved that about his character. Daisy Ridley, Rey, has a great story and I am anticipating where they will take it with Episode 8. The greatest character though in the whole movie and what really helps my score for this review, is John Boyega's character Finn. The concept of Finn's character is such an awesome idea because it seems to be something out of a stormtrooper's limits to have even done what he has done. A boy who was grown up and raised to fight with the authoritative figure turns its back on them and fights against them, seems a little cliche. What makes Finn great though is that it's not even like he is the number 1 hero in the film and he seems to be more of a newcomer than a trained killer which gives the audience a sheer liking for him based on him seeming more like one of us than just some type of a person who is supposed to be a programmed assassin. Because Finn is learning throughout this whole movie from start to finish, he learns just how cruel the Empire is to where he learns his purpose to stay with the squad who helped him get where he is at. Finn is ironically a ""down-to-earth"" kind of character and an interesting one too based on how he left the First Order and I can't wait to see his role in the next movie and I hope he can make a large impact again. The movie overall is good, even though I have critiques about it and what not I have seen it twice and wouldn't mind watching it a third time.",1
1881,"Awesome awesome awesome, fit all expectations! the characters and the acting is very good, the story is surprising, i think its a very good movie to start the new Saga",1
1882,"It really entertains me, the movie is near-perfect. The characters and plots,scenes are awesome. It has its flaws at its dialogue scripts but hey I think it was a pleasant experience for us old generations and new generations of Star Wars fans.",1
1883,"Star Wars is back but this time under the wing of Disney and directed by JJ Abrams. But that doesn't matter especially with a movie this good. Star wars the force awakens is one of the greatest films ever in my opinion beating out empire strikes back as my all time favorite star wars movie. Lets tackle this one by one Music is amazing and nostalgic as John Williams is back and conducts another amazing score. The characters are great while not being as good as he could be Harrison Ford puts on a memorable  performance as Han Solo. Finn is a stormtrooper who decides he doesn't want to kill anymore and runs off to join the rebellion. The only two characters who are sort of meh are Rey and Kylo Ren. Rey is a great character overall just like Luke she grew up away from parents and lives on a desert like planet known as Jakku. My only problem with her is she can do almost anything already. Sure Luke piloted an X wing in the first movie but she piloted the Falcon almost perfect. And when Finn gets hit, she grabs a lightsaber and duels a sith lord. It took Luke a long time from sparring with a droid, a battle with vader while still training to the return of the jedi where he is a full fledged jedi and here is rey using the force after 5 minutes of seeing a fight. Kylo Ren don't get me wrong is a great villan a true struggle between being good or bad. But he isnt a true sith to me because he doesn't use the sith qualities of the dark side to fight. He uses his anger to throw tantrums sure in the end when Rey insults him he starts fighter more aggressive but by then it was too late. Overall this is a great movie and worth your time but those two characters might leave you scratching your head",1
1884,"Yes. It might be nostalgic at times.But it's darn entertaining and fun to watch. The visual effects, the twists and  also some heartfelt moments just reminds you of the good old time when you sit on the counch and watch Star Wars with your friends and families.",1
1885,Good start but so un-original in parts...pity I was hoping for a totally new fork in the story. But good start and can be built upon now to a new story hopefully with some better light saber fights :P ...,1
1886,"This addition to the SW Saga is excellent: it does well in reintroducing the characters and icons left behind in Return of the Jedi, as well as opening up a neat new story arc. While I do see that the length is around the typical length of a SW film, I think some good could have been done by making it longer than usual.",1
1887,"As a fan of the old canon (i.e. Expanded Universe), I was pretty upset I lost all of that because Disney wanted to new movies. So I was *very* skeptical. However, aside from a couple missteps, this movie is absolutely fantastic. The new characters work, the story 95% works, and it was a great reintroduction to the OT characters. The only issues for me were Starkiller Base, and how absolutely unneeded it was in service to the plot, and how little world building happened within the movie. They could have tried a hell of a lot harder to let us get a sense of the political and military aspects of the current galaxy.",1
1888,"8.5/10. This movie was a energetic and enjoyable experience at the theater, one which I have not had since a long time ago.....OK so the movie, YES the central plot was a mishmash of a few previous films but other than that, it added new characters that you liked. The hot jedi girl, Finn, The pilot who had that Han Soloesque mixture of charm and bravado were all entertaining. I do take issue with the dark Jedi in training guy though: He was powerful enough with the force to hold a laserbolt in place but he could not defeat a girl with no training whatsoever? Yea, he was wounded but still he should make short work of them. Anyhow, go see the film and enjoy! It will not change your life but it will give you hope that the best aspects of a Star Wars universe have returned. I look forward to the sequels.",1
1889,"This movie have indeed awaken my interest in Star Wars again. I have seen the original trilogy countless times, and this is just what a new trilogy needs. In every way! I've seen it 2 times, and the second time gave me even more. It has some similarities to ep. 4, but the main plot is its own. The Force and Luke truly guides Rey when things intensifies. The hate this movie gets from people is weird, but when the 2 following episodes are out the haters and trolls will see that their negativity didnt hold. Its a Trend to be over the top negative these days... To give this movie a 0 is just too stupid to be taken seriously.",1
1890,Force Awakens was really good and I enjoyed it alot. I was affaraid that ot would be different then the others but it really had starwars feeling on it. I'm really looking forward to next two movies,1
1891,"The Force Awakens is a refreshing return to the classic hero story used in the original trilogy and repeated all across human history.  It has the quality story line of the original trilogy combined with the special effects of the prequels.  I do not normally like re-watch movies, but The Force Awakens is one that I was eager to see again.",1
1892,"Even though this movie was not without its flaws, it was indeed a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.  Much better quality than Lucas' prequels.  Regarding the highly critical reviews by some viewers, I think anybody who would rate this movie less than a 5 is just being ridiculous.",1
1893,"First of let me say that I gave this film a 10 because I am a Star Wars fan and I absolutely loved the movie. Yes, I am biased. This film in actuality probably deserves an 8 or a 9. Let me start by saying everything that I loved about the movie. The movie touches upon new concepts, like a storm-trooper having emotions! Usually storm-troopers are dispassionate hoards of soldier simply used as a means for conquering the galaxy this film builds on storm trooper self awareness and for me that is an entertaining angle. I personally liked the comedy that is placed into the film, but comedy is a matter of taste, so I can understand how that might not be for everyone. The storm-trooper advanced weapons. Oh my god! So cool. A storm-trooper holds his own against a lightsaber. This was much needed in the series since droids could do it in 1-3, but then nobody but sith could in 4-6? Highly entertaining scenes, with a lot of action and emotion throughout. I was disappointed when they didn't kiss (no spoiler, if you've seen it, you know). This is not a bad thing because it REALLY made me feel disappointed and I believe movies are meant to make you feel emotions. Besides I'm sure they will kiss in the future. On that same level, I believe the new actors put in some great performances and if your a fan of the franchise, then you definitely know where the next few films are heading simply based of this. It was also great to see a lot of the original cast return. That must have been hard gathering them all back together. Overall, the reason I would give this an 8 is because I felt like the whole movie relied way to heavily on the previous entries into the franchise. One or two nods to the previous films would have been a great homage, but every other scene directly took or imitated from a moment in a previous film and it made me feel like that was a bit of a cop out. Can't wait for the next one! Kylo Ren is a rat! :)",1
1894,"Filme foda, porém, com um pouco de falta de explicações (que acho que ficaram pro próximo filme), e incrivelmente nunca foi tao fácil usar um lightsaber, junto com várias coincidências (que podem ser ignoradas de certa forma) que fizeram o filme não ser tao perfeito, mas sem duvida vale olhar.",1
1895,"Ainda estou meio chocada com algumas coisas mas o filme é esplendido, os momentos de ação são muito bem feitos e os alívios cômicos estão bem colocados. Indico, com certeza!",1
1896,"Mix some ideas from the old three movies, add some references to the old three movies and don't do any big experiments. For me it was enough to like this movie. It felt like Star Wars, the prequels never did, now they can start with something really new.",1
1897,"Excellent, very true to the original spirit of Star Wars. The parent-child theme so strongly featured in the original trilogy returns, but with an excellent twist: the child is the villain. The parallels between Ren and Vader are strong and well-constructed, including the mask (which he wears not because he has to, but because it makes him feel like Vader) and the outfit (which is Vader-esque but lacks the long, large cape that helped to make Vader intimidating). Kylo Ren is a fascinating character, and I can't wait for Episode VIII to hear his backstory. Rey is an equally interesting character. Much of the Star Wars fanbase now believes that she is Luke's daughter; if so, it is a storyline that is very effectively set up. The parallels between Rey and Luke, much like those between Ren and Vader, are strong, portraying how the Star Wars universe changes, yet simultaneously remains. I could continue with analyses of the other characters, but I'll conclude by saying that I was extremely impressed with how well TFA met my expectations and that I'm very excited for VIII.",1
1898,"Don't believe the haters.  Star Wars: The Force Awakens is nothing more and nothing less than Star Wars, which means it's perfect.  If you're expecting a work of art, look elsewhere.  If you're expecting people doing awesome stuff with the Force in a galaxy far, far away--stuff more awesome than George Lucas probably even conceived of--run, don't walk, to the theater. Acting is far better than the prequels and even the original trilogy; special effects are awesome because they are a perfect mixing of cgi and practical, making The Force Awakens a breath of fresh air; and the nostalgia factor is off the charts.  The cast is perfect and should be applauded. Spoilers Daisy Ridley does a fantastic job as a young woman who has heard about the Force all her life but has never believed in it until the First Order interrupts her quiet, boring life.  John Boyega is perfectly cast as Finn, a baby taken by the First Order and raised to be nothing but a perfect killing machine who has a change of heart on his first mission and betrays his masters; and Oscar Isaac is brilliant as Poe Dameron, a fighter with General Leia against the newest version of the Empire and the Sith. If you love Star Wars, go see this movie.  If you hated Star Wars, avoid it, for you'll see nothing new.",1
1899,"The Force Awakens strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. Filled with incident, movement and speed, dusted with light layers of tarnished ""used future"" grime. It captures the kinetic energy that made the first film, from 1977, such a revelation to filmgoers who marveled at Lucas’s mashup of B movies, Saturday-morning serials, Japanese historical epics and mythic heft.",1
1900,"A great movie that really captures that stars wars look and feel, and is just a fun and nostalgic ride that will keep you entertained from start to finish with its old and new characters and its familar but still entertaining story, make this a movie that must be seen.",1
1901,Eu tenho que admitir que o filme é otimo ea historia tambem mais não tão bom para uma experiencia visual pois o filme é longo e pode se torna chato mais foi o melhor filme de 2015.,1
1902,Great movie. Great story. Great characters. JJ Abrams did an amazing job with this movie. It truly lives up to mos of the hype surrounding it. Lets leave it at that,1
1903,"Having been a fan since about 5 years of the Star Wars franchise, there was obviously a lot of hype for me and many many others just like myself. To me, this movie restored my faith in Star Wars for years to come. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job bring back the franchise with a new style and no being afraid to take some risk while still somehow giving most fans what they wanted to see. It's not going to hit for every fan because too many of us have expections on what is supposed happen and when it's not that, it can disppoint but to me it was a great Star Wars movie.",1
1904,"Final: 8.5 /10All in all, ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is a great movie. It's a wonderful bridge between the original trilogy and the new trilogy. J.J. uses the past Star Wars movies and the nostalgia from them to propel the movie’s plot, not just reminder people of the good ole’ days. It is well written and filled with gripping action, humor, and emotion. Does it have flaws? Of course. But there are only a handful of movies that have ever been made that are completely flawless. But that being said, the flaws that it does have are not so invasive to the movie that they take away from the positive things in the movie.People complain about how it was a straight up copy of A New Hope, most notably Starkiller Base being another Death Star. However, what about the construction of the new death star in Return of the Jedi? I mean it was literally a second death star. Same name and look. (I did very much enjoy Return of the Jedi regardless of that). The name ""Starkiller"" was the original last name for Luke, until ""Skywalker"" was hatched. Naming the base ""Starkiller Base"" was a nice nod to George Lucas' original ideas that many people may have missed, and was one that I enjoyed.People also complain about how Jakku is too much like Tatooine and say it displays a lack of creativity and originality. That is honestly pretty dumb. There are over 20 major deserts on earth, and plenty of other minor ones as well, so why can’t there be more than one desert planet? I mean seriously come on people. If it was a forest people would say it’s too much like Endor. If it was a city people would say it’s too much like Coroscant. If it was ice then people would say it’s too much like Hoth. Over the 6 previous Star Wars movies, most (if not all) biomes have been used, so I do not see how Jakku being a desert is a lack of creativity or originality.Another major complaint people have is that the plot itself copies that of A New Hope. A droid with a very important message meets one of the main characters on a desert planet. Someone is rescued from the prison block from the bad guys. An old man sacrifices himself. I big ball in space gets blown up by the good guys. Yes, there are definitely some similarities in the plots. Sure The Force Awakens borrowed some basic plot points and ideas from A New Hope. However, the details and characters within the story make The Force Awakens its own. I can find way more differences in the two movies then I can similarities. Granted, there are more similarities then I mentioned, but the details in the plot points make the movie its own. One last thought on this: If the movie had been nothing like A New Hope, then people would have complained that it was nothing like the originals and didn’t have the right Star Wars spirit and themes. If it had not borrowed some basic things from A New Hope, people would have complained as well. It borrowed things, but the movie was more original than many people think it was. People keep looking at the surface of the movie and refuse to look deeper, missing the details and development that make The Force Awakens its own unique movie that positively propels the franchise. The three main flaws I found in it: 1 Rey’s sudden ability to use the force and her skills with a lightsaberAlthough this is a flaw, I believe it can be easily explained and I believe it will be explained in Episode VIII.My thought is that Rey was trained to be a Jedi in the past by Luke. This would explain Kylo Ren's enragement when he found out Finn and BB-8 were accompanied by ""a girl"" because he very well could have been trained with her. Then Kylo Ren proceeded to kill all the padawans except for Rey. She possibly lived because someone saved her or he could not bring himself to kill her because they may be related. Her memory of her training may have been force wiped by Luke, explaining why she does not remember it. In addition, we see on Jakku that she already has fighting skills with her staff.2. R2-D2 suddenly turns on and has the rest of the map.My theory: C-3PO tells BB-8 that R2 has been in low power mode since his master, Luke, left. However, if Rey turns out to be Luke’s daughter, the R2 turning on all of sudden can be explained because she’s the daughter of his master, which in a way could make Rey R2’s master because Luke is not present. R2 turns on when Rey arrives at the Resistance Base, supporting this theory.3. The death of Han SoloI would have liked to see an interaction between Han and Kylo Ren earlier in the movie, before Kylo killed him. I mean everyone knew Han’s death was coming, but it would have made the scene and his death more engaging, gripping, and emotional if we had seen some interaction between them earlier. I know Han saw Kylo earlier in the movie at the end of the battle at Maz Kanata’s, but I am talking about more of a face to face, talking to each other kind of interaction. That being said, Han touching Kylo’s face right before",1
1905,"I couldn't ask for more, was an emotional experience that I will never forget and will see again in theatres. For me, the perfect marriage of the old and new.",1
1906,"This movie has shown me how bad the prequels really are!It was the most fun and ""Star Wars"" feeling I had since the classics.Yes there are a lot of copy - paste scenes from the classic movies but I can connive about that because of the fun this movie is.",1
1907,"I know that just about everyone else has probably already said this one, but... THE FORCE IS DEFINITELY STRONG WITH THIS ONE! I absolutely loved it! :D",1
1908,"Familiar story almost predictable, well it was predictable.  Compared to many ""top"" movies out there now it was great...  Glad I have seen it but, I wouldn't pay for it again.",1
1909,"If your never liked the original trilogy, then ya, you probably won't care much for this movie. However, if you were a big fan of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, then you will see the familiar writing by Lawrence Kasdan who was missing for the prequel trilogy.  This was as much a return back to Lawrence Kasdan's story telling than this is about JJ Abrams and that should make true original Star Wars fans very happy.  The humor, dialog, and balance of myth in the story is back to what made most of us original trilogy fans enthralled by the Star Wars films.  There is a lot left unknown intentionally that will leave a lot of room for personal theories and speculation which is always the fun of falling in love with this universe. The use of real sets really made the film feel like the original trilogy and the scale of everything felt very real as opposed to CGI and prequel trilogy.  I actually wasn't a big of the CGI characters which will be obvious when you see them.  But there are few and for the most part everything else looked and felt very real.  This was the worst thing of the prequel trilogy. Yes this is a movie for old fans who will have some nostalgia watching this.  But, this is also a movie for a lot of new fans, particularly young girls who have dad's who are an original trilogy fan. Most of all what really got me was returning back to the heart of Star Wars which was always about this essential fight between good vs. evil and how people can go from one to the other.  It is a very simple way of creating a fantasy universe that helps simply explain our own real world and ethics.  I remember many religious and philosophical discussions with all sorts of people, and Star Wars / Yoda-isms were often recalled as some point of ethical retort.  This is what really draws people to the world of Star Wars.  This film returned me back there, and it's a place I haven't been to since 1983 when Return of Jedi last came out.",1
1910,"This movie is one of my favourite movies of all time. Its very intense and has lots of moments that true Star Wars fans will love. In this movie I loved everything except Han Solo's death, and to be honest there were some characters that were in the movie for a very little amount of time like Captain Phasma and Poe Dameron.",1
1911,"It's not a 10 but it is not a 0-4 either. A 5 is as pessimistic as I can be about this movie after considering the shortcomings other users have droned on about ad nauseum (the copycat nature of some plot elements, Finn's accent or lack thereof, the way Rey uses the Force, etc. etc.) I have seen the movie twice and have just as much knowledge of the lore and Expanded Universe as anyone. It is fun to watch, so much so I took my whole family to see it on Christmas and they all enjoyed it as a spectacle, not as the defining work of art for our time. The morons who are writing the reviews with zeroes don't deserve a vote, especially the ones complaining about feminism! Seriously? Get real. My detailed breakdown: 9/10 Special effects - A visually appealing movie especially in 3-D. It is not consumed by visual effects as I would say I-III are. 7/10 Plot - A little derivative but the story of Star Wars is one of the cyclicality of good and evil. The harsh critics are ignoring this element. As I state below, this has to be viewed as film 1 of 3 and I believe the treatment in subsequent films will help validate some of the choices screenwriters made. 8/10 Character development - Consider this film as the first step in creating depth, not as its entirety. Loved Rey as she felt believable. Rhetorical question: Could the ""awakening"" of the Force have something to do with Rey discovering abilities quickly? Finn was good but could use some polish with fewer throwaway dialogue lines. Leia needs a bigger role in Episode 8. BB-8 is a nice addition to the droid cast. Episode 8 needs to develop Poe more fully and explain how he didn't die. Harrison Ford was good but translated a little of his disdain for the role onto the screen. Driver is believable as his character seems to have a lot of room for personal growth. Luke's subsequent role of course will be a real indicator of whether this will be a good trilogy as a whole. The potential presented for 8 and 9 is the real success here, even with certain imperfections. Music 9/10 - Big fan of the score and I think we will see further use of unique character motifs in subsequent films. Overall - 8/10 Collapse",1
1912,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a great start to what may be the best Star Wars trilogy so far. The film contains the perfect blend of action, emotion, nostalgia, and comedy to keep the audience engaged from start to finish. Unlike the prequel trilogy, the film contains deep characters that have enough personality to make the audience want to know what happens next. And the actors chosen to portray these character did a spectacular job playing the parts. While the film does mirror A New Hope a bit too much, it still contains enough new ideas that make it stand out from the rest of the saga. Overall, The Force Awakens is a great film and raises more than enough questions to make the audience want to see the next movie.Pros:- Action-packed- Deep characters- Nostalgia- Comedic relief- Evokes emotion- Amazing actingCons (if I had to pick one)- Mirrors A New Hope too muchVerdict:Visuals/Music - 5/5Plot/Characters - 5/5Structure - 5/5Acting - 5/5Overall - 5/5 = 100%",1
1913,I took one point off for unoriginality and another point off for being predictable.  It's kinda like a roller coaster in the sense that you know what's going to happen but you enjoy the ride.,1
1914,"I enjoyed this movie because I felt I could relate to the younger cast more than I could to the cast in episodes one, two, and three. Hell, I'd argue that John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are better actors than the main stars from any of the previous star wars movies. Then again, that may due to poor direction and emotionless dialogue. This movie did reuse a number of elements from A New Hope, but the new cast really caught my attention and led me on quite a ride. The villain seemed a little cheesy at times, but since his characterization demanded conflict he represented himself quite well. I know some don't like the re-used elements, and others wanted a different movie, but I believe this movie carries more universal appeal and can only help to broaden the star wars audience.  You can tell a lot of effort and love were put into this movie by the cast and film crew. The use of props and sets over digital effects and green screen speaks volumes. The score was great as always and unlike the star wars movies of the 90s, its still fun to see even after repeated viewings. Thank you Disney and JJ, you brought my childhood back to life and have returned Star Wars to what it is supposed to be.",1
1915,"Don't listen to these negative reviews.All of them are just ""fans"" who think they know what Star Wars is better then the rest of us.If they had any credibility they would have at least rated the movie instead of giving it a 0. The acting was beautiful, characters were pin point, humor even better. Subtle but out there proudly.And yeah, the plot is a bit recycled from Episode IV but as a plot tool it is used in a best way to reintroduce us into this magnificent  universe. It's not a ten for sure but most of the problems with this movie for me was getting used to some details as the continuity is new.",1
1916,"This movie has done what I thought would be impossible... It got me interested in Star Wars again. I had originally lost all interest in the franchise after watching the prequels. This movie essentially copied many elements from ""A New Hope"", which in a sense makes it almost feel like a reboot for the series. This is basically Star Wars for a new generation of kids.",1
1917,"JJ Abrams has revived the series as he did with the Star Trek franchise. The quality that really shines through is what is evident and appreciated is that he is a true and knowledgeable fan of both series and there are a number of insider nods that hearken back and pay homage to the past (much as Daniel Craig has with the Bond series & he makes an uncredited cameo as a stormtrooper. SPECTRE was shot at the same London studio) Not to mention, bringing back series relics: Harrison Ford steals the show with his age-defying performance. The newcomers were great and so is this installment. Your alias is that of a Jedi & are a person of interest who kept the series from being lost on the fringe of the galaxy & The Schwartz was clearly with you, Felicity Navidad Mr. Abrams!",1
1918,"The Force Awakens is certainly not as special as the original 3 movies in many ways, and yet it still has the same sense of excitement that you would expect from a Star Wars movie. Some moments seem a bit unnecessary and repetitive. It is painfully clear that Abrams wanted to avoid every aspect of the prequels. The story as a whole is very similar to the originals but it almost doesn't matter because of how well it was executed. Some of the new characters such as Rey and Kylo Ren are absolutely amazing and set the tone for future movies. Overall a really good film",1
1919,"When I first walked in to The Force Awakens, my expectations were lukewarm. It was a mixture of coldness due to the prequels and excitement because of the directing prowess of JJ Abrams. However, after a 2 and a half hour joy ride, I have to say that this movie is my favorite Star Wars movie. Period. I've never cried, laughed or applauded so much for ANY movie. It took me away from the world for a while, and I felt at home. Boyega and Ridley have amazing chemistry, and the movie in a whole was really fun. Sure, (to avoid spoilers) Ren and Phasma were a bit underwhelming at first, but looking back I am very happy with  the screentime they were given. A 10/10 is fair, as I don't think it's a perfect movie but a movie that did its job: Immerse you within a story. Go see this even if you don't like Star Wars. It's that good.",1
1920,"Great new characters, well choreographed action and lots of humour that is actually funny- not without it's flaws in the story department but a 10/10 for entertainment.",1
1921,"I loved the movie. Some say it borrowed too much and was unoriginal. I disagree, It was a self-conscious homage to the original trilogy. It was meant to induce nostalgia but also, I think that it is meant to show that history repeats. I guess we will see in the follow up films. I loved the new characters, they are compelling and exciting and I am looking forward to seeing more of them. The only complaint I had is that, yes, it did seem like fan fiction at some points. I am giving a 10 instead of a 9 to balance out all the negative reviews from angry fanboys because it was too ""diverse"" and ""PC"". Get a grip guys.",1
1922,Star Wars was damn good. It's back! It's not a stupid kids movie! There's actual acting!! Someone with two hemispheres (praise Kasdan) wrote the dialogue!!!!,1
1923,"After a second viewing I found the film to hold up and my critiques after my first viewing did not feel so severe. The film on its own is seemingly masterful. Vibrant characters with appropriate story arcs. Expansive feel to the universe. Good, sometimes great acting. Nothing was gimicky. Nothing took me out of the story. Contextualizing this to its prequels, you can certainly have some more complaints. But it has been 30+ years since the original trilogy. I would have liked to see a move further in another direction, moving farther away from the previous 6 films. But ultimately I am quite happy to know that the spirit of star wars is alive and well.",1
1924,"Forget the negative whiners. They saw the originals age 10 and expected to get the same awe struck feeling when they are knocking on 50.It is a ripping yarn, definitely echoes of a new hope and at times a little contrived. But hey, it is humorous, dark and raw at times and full of spectacle and energy, just the formula of the original films.People who think the 7th episode in a film franchise is going to be a classic original need a wake up call.Like all hugely anticipated events there will be those who's expectations will never be met. However - take this film on face value or as a continuation of the greatest franchise in sci-fi history and it hits the spot beautifully.10/10 for me every time.",1
1925,"Don't let sad fanboys bring the new star wars universe down, it is above all else, a really well done movie, with interesting characters for which you really do care about, there is no shot in this movie that don't have a purpose inside the storytelling, it introduces a new flawed and emotinaly unstable villain and an even more misterious mastermind behind it all. It has astounishing performance from new actors and old alike. It is amazingly worried about the details and it has even greater production value, with amazing sets design, practical effects and what not. You can definitely feel how much love was put in the making of this movie and it is a much nedded and well deserved re-start for the franchise.",1
1926,"This movie is perfect, and I feel anger so many people giving low note for the movie, I loved the action scenes, the fights, everything is a perfect movie and made me appreciate even more the Star Wars saga",1
1927,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is something special... kind of. It is a definite step up from the prequels, but an on-level movie when compared to the original trilogy. First off, the characters. When talking about our new protagonists, (Rey, Finn, Poe & BB-8) I can say without a doubt that these new characters are fantastic. Never once in the movie did I think, ""Nope,"" when being introduced to these, and more, characters! The casting for them really showed how much they took these characters into consideration. Daisy Ridley, as a new comer, was shone onto the big screen phenomenally, and was thankfully not sexualized. (Which, might I add, actually takes AWAY from a movie, Hollywood.) John Boyega gave a great performance as both Storm Trooper and Rebel. The new droid BB-8 is a great new companion for Rey, and it shows that Abrams wanted a new lovable droid without copying R2-D2. (This cute little ball is my favorite new character.) Harrison Ford showed how great he can change a role to fit a huge change in age, since he wasn't playing Han Solo, just 30 years later, he was playing an 30 years older Han Solo. (He really stole the show, to be honest.) The chemistry between these characters was amazing, especially between Poe and Finn, and I could not picture a better group of people to play these characters. However, the villains do fall short of what we hoped for after Darth Vader and Palpatine. Snoke and the General were laughable, and, thankfully, barely contributed to the story itself. When it comes to the man behind the mask, Kylo Ren, this character succeeds with flying colors. Some do complain about the casting - Adam Driver - but, for me at least, it was a perfect way for this character to show that he wasn't just some ""Vader 2.0."" He was human. A kid seduced to the Dark Side by an evil Sith being used just for his power. I loved it, but I can understand why people don't. He has some temper tantrums that can be annoying to some, but to me, it showed the immaturity in Ren that drives his motivation. (Which is to please Vader if you couldn't tell by the trailers.) To those who do think he's just an emo piece, you're entitled to your opinion. It may be wrong, but you're entitled to it. The new Storm Army is something that has to be cleared up, mainly since some people were getting into a bunch over a black Storm Trooper. The only Clone Army was in the prequels. Episodes IV-VI were all just random people in masks with terrible aim. Same thing with this movie. (Well, their aim is better now. Maybe it's the helmet redesign.) The new weapons and blaster lead to some fantastically choreographed fight scenes. I'll get into that later. Onto story. It's fantastic, at least to me. I do acknowledge that it is very, I mean VERY, similar to A New Hope. Almost to the letter. It even has a Death Star like planet called Star Killer Base. (No, that's not a spoiler, it's in the promotional art.) Never made sense that the First Order could outdo the Empire in less than 30 years, them being a small remanent. Some do complain that they have taken over and that the republic was destroyed and so on. Well, on my third watching I noticed that the Resistance is just a small part of the Republic Army to stop the obviously powerful First Order from taking over the REST of the galaxy, since they've only taken over the small area we see in the movie. Easy to miss, and it took me awhile to realize. Could be horribly mistaken, though. I personally didn't mind it, the similarities to IV, and actually understood the reasoning behind it. Episodes I, II, and III really left a burn mark on the franchise, with the overuse of bad CGI, bad scripting and acting, and barely any respect to the original trilogy. (Granted I still do like the prequels, sort of.) They really needed something to pull the fans back in to Star Wars, and taking from IV was the best route, in my opinion. (If VIII is a copy of Empire though, that won't work.) You'll enjoy yourself in this movie. The writing and, as said before, acting is spot on, and this is definitely the funniest SW film. Something that I did find odd about how the movie progressed is how some very interesting characters got sidelined, like Poe Dameron, Captain Phasma, and one HUGE sideline that you'll either love or hate. The choreography with the Lightsaber fights are the best in the saga. They all feel like they have genuine emotion behind them, and not just with Kylo. Our new Jedi in training shows that they have the known emotions normally associated with the Dark Side, combining those with the Light. (Side note, this is the first main movie in the franchise that explicitly states ""The Dark Side and the Light."" Found that to be cool as well.) Of course the Force is a huge part in the movie, and how it Awakens. Old and new tricks are shown, more old than new, and it was fantastic. I know, I've been using that word a lot, but that's what the movie is.Quality - 8/10Enjoyment -10/10Overall - 9.5/10",1
1928,"I'm a Star Wars fan, and I thought the movie was great! The movie probably had the best acting out of all of the Star Wars movie, as Daisy Ridley did a fantastic job at portraying Rey and the execution of the movie was great. I also liked how the settings in the movie felt real because of how many of the scenes were done on location. The plot had a few problems, although it was not as bad as some of the reviews I have read have said. The movie was sort of like a different version of A New Hope, but it still had many unique traits and many of the characters were quite different from the characters in A New Hope, and there were still plenty of original moments in the plot so that the movie was not a completely like A New Hope. Instead, the movie used a few plot points from A New Hope but still felt completely different from the original Star Wars series. 9/10",1
1929,"Absolutely fantastic!  It carries on brilliantly from the end of Episode 6 and introduces some brilliant new characters with real energy and charisma.  The magic is there, fully.  IMO, this film is nearly the equal of the first film (episode 4) except that, of course, it doesn't introduce a whole new universe - it merely carries it onwards the way the 6th movie really should have done.  Brilliant.  Looking forward to Episode 8 in 2017!",1
1930,"I fought this will be the worst Star Wars movie, because Disney owns it now, but I was wrong! It's a great Star Wars of all time, thanks to JJ direction. Too bad in my country that Kanjiclub only appear in 5 minutes, since those are the only Indonesian actors that played The Raid. The effects was great, and it's a really2 good movies... Recomended for all fans to no fans of Star Wars!",1
1931,"JJ Abrams successfully pulled off a huge task. Reboot the Star Wars legend. And in my opinion, he pulled it off. The film exists as a sort of primer to a whole new set of Star Wars films. By recognizing the past, and setting the stage for the future, I don't see how this film could have gone any other direction that how it did. After suffering through Lucas' prequels, this new film seems brilliant by comparison. The effects and art direction are spot on and just what the doctor ordered. You have to give JJ credit for doing minimal CGI on alien characters and creatures. I for one really appreciate that. The acting falters in a few points, but not in the new main characters. All the leads are strong and play their parts well. Of course it's not perfect, and flaws can be found if one looks for them. But those that rate TFA poorly are either looking for attention, indignant ulta-fans or simply trolls. It's a solid flick and the best star wars we've had in a long time. Just don't let the hype ruin it and go in to it with a level head. Have fun!",1
1932,"I was very excited about the news of a new Star Wars Saga movie picking up after Return of the Jedi. I was reading many things after I found out Disney was taking over. Since I'm a huge Star Wars fan I was really worried that there would be some unexplained pieces or complete rewrites. I have seen that some of the direction that was taken was disagreeable to Lucas and others that have followed Star Wars and the many novels that have been written around the stories.I think the biggest challenge was that they had to reset what was canon and what wasn't part of the core story from books that were in the past considered to be important for the continuing Saga. I think they probably could have used the information that was in the Legends book, but in clear Disney fashion, they took the ideas, reworded them, renamed them, placed characters in different lineages, made up a few and disfigured the story from the Star Wars Legends books.But this isn't about Disney Policy, it's about the movie. I was enthralled from the beginning. I was very much anticipating the movie and was afraid I might be disappointed, but my friends knowing me well, assured me that I wouldn't be.They were right. The cast was top notch. The special effects were on point. The camera work was fun to watch. The emotional roller-coaster had me in tears by the end. I was impressed with all the work that was done and really enjoyed the story for what it was intended to be. I'm a bit biased on Star Wars material, and I would have really gone crazy if they had stuck to the Legends Story line a little better, but it was close enough.And unusual fashion, there was that ending. Not the usual celebratory ending of the Lucas Films gone by, but a silent scene with spectacular views and an absolute intention to continue the story.Very impressive.",1
1933,"A great film. OK, the death star plot again was tedious, but the new characters are great, and there is a new vibrancy to the direction. JJ Abrams had a difficult task - Appease the fans of the original trilogy, while taking the story forward in a new direction. He has already tied up a few loose ends and the subsequent movies will hopefully create a new canon for us to be excited about.",1
1934,"Well, there are two ways to take this movie. If you expect a genuine sequel (to the previous six), then you will be disappointed. This is, essentially, a re-boot/re-making (which shouldn't surprise, given it is directed by the maker of the Star Trek re-boot). If you take it on its own terms (i.e. not as episode VII), then it is a decent re-working of the original. The visuals are easily the most stunning in the series, realising what the first trilogy could not, while avoiding the CGI-fest of the second (prequel) trilogy. This is basically what Lucas would have done, if he'd had the tech 35 years ago. The music is decent, though I feel Williams doesn't quite match the originals (the most memorable and moving moments are whenever the old musical themes occur). The pacing is a little off: the film is roughly the same length as the originals, but somehow it appears rushed, and lacks the moments of reflection and exposition that punctuated the first trilogy. That its plot is basically IV, with a few additions from V and VI, goes without saying. The new lead characters are good, though Kylo Ren is no Darth Vader. I do, however, feel that some of the most negative criticism is suffering from 'rose-tinted spectacles' syndrome. To consider a few. 'Plot holes' - this is sci-fi fantasy, and the original trilogy is full of them (in IV, Leia's ship just happens to be attacked over Tatooine, and the droids just happen to land within a short distance of Luke and Obi-Wan; although the Falcon has to plot a careful course through hyperspace, it is incapable of recognising that the Death Star, floating in open-space, is not a moon; in V, the shield has to be briefly opened to let the rebel ships escape, but does not prevent the imperial walkers from landing, while at the same time, despite being powerful enough to deflect all orbit-based attack, its generator is taken-down by a couple of laser-shots from a walker; in VI, a shuttle's worth of rebels and a neolithic band of teddy-bears, take down an entire defence-station and an 'entire legion' of the emperor's finest troops; the new Death Star is 'fully operational', yet still requires protection from a moon-based shield that can be destroyed by half-a-dozen explosive charges; space is three-dimensional, and yet the rebels decide to attack the new Death Star in a narrow two-dimensional plane, and directly in the line-of-sight of the Death Star's main weapon [why not attack from the other side...]...). 'Acting' - overall, it is generally better in the new release: outside of Cushing and Guiness, and Ford, there were horribly amateur and hammy moments throughout the original trilogy. So, I understand the criticisms of the 're-make' feel; but I do feel that quite a lot of the criticism is coming from people who are viewing the new film through the lens of an attachment they most likely formed in their childhood or adolescence (and nothing can ever replicate that)...",1
1935,"It was a good movie, though the quest-type plot was a little predictable.  I don't think it lived up to the hype but on the whole, it was a good starting point for this phase of the overall story started oh so long ago.  Even the feel of many of characters hearkened back to the original movie.  Despite its slight predictability, it was nice to see a few familiar secondary characters. I did have a few problems with it though -- the plot seemed a bit thin:  the search for Luke Skywalker (who is only seen in the last two minutes of the film).  The New Order was just another Nazi re-hash of the old Empire.  Even Kylo Ren -- the new ""Vader"" -- is really only a pretender 20-something with enough teen angst to make him merely unlikable rather than evil.  Even the ""unforgivable"" act he commits near the end of the film will most likely be forgiven by the third movie in this trilogy (and even though I didn't see it coming, it did make sense, especially given all the parallels to ""A New Hope""). The only big question the movie leaves unanswered (hopefully to be answered in the next film) is ""Who are Rey's parents?""  Is she Han and Lea's lost daughter?  Is she Luke's daughter?  Could she be Obi-Wan's long-lost granddaughter?  I suppose any answer will ultimately be disappointing, so maybe we're better left wondering.  Just like many of us are wondering why this movie wasn't any better.",1
1936,"This Review Contains Spoilers I'd give it a 7.5 if I could but even so a 7 seems appropriate. Driving home with a friend after seeing the movie we described it as ""liked it, wanted to love it,"". So much could have been done with this universe that Lucas created but all I was left with was A New Hope rehashed. The possibilities, the writers and this is what I was given a story I've seen before. I don't hate this movie but the overly positive reviews I don't understand, what do you love about it? They blew up another space station called Star Killer which we laughed at and hello Force Unleash. The station had a glaring weakness and was knocked out by a handful of pilots and a few guys. A space station larger then the death star  protected by a massive army and fleet was again knocked out by a few people and a handful of ships. I understand the struggle of good over evil, overcoming the obstacles of a superior force but it felt lazy and I just joked I've seen this happen 3 times now. If you wanted to refresh the birth of the series which I understand why tell the same plot lines. Do you want to know what it was like to stick it to the bad guys? Watch New Hope, that's what a fan would do. Its a progressive story so why do we need to go back. If the republic is alive again why is it still called the resistance? wouldn't it just be the republican army? The New Order general thought his troops would be better then the clones, based on one of the greatest bounty hunters ever to live? Every time they said Supreme Leader I was reminded of the Peoples Republic of China. I understood the context but it still put a smile on my face, Ren I'm on the fence about I understand what they tried to make him to be but in the end he came off as a child whining about the world and he never got me interested, I wanted to smack him and tell him to suck it up. I feel with a different actor I could have felt this man struggling to become like Vadar never knowing if he was strong enough but I never seemed to find that spark. All in all it wasn't a bad movie, it was funny, it had action, had the boring parts but still good. I respect the pressure Abram's was going to have writing this, you can't make everyone happy. A lot of questions still need to be answered and its only the first movie but I hope it can only go up from here.",1
1937,"I saw the opening of the Empire Strikes Back when it opened in Hollywood at the then Graumann's Chinese theater. I waited in line for 3 hours. 35 years after that opening it's the only movie I've gone to see a record 5 times before it left the theaters. Today I saw its equal. Just the most awesome continuation of the authentic Star Wars spirit! Wow! Space movie CGI back in the 70's was of course state of the art. This is 2015! Holy Moly its got 2015 CGI, a great continuation story, a connection with the past iconic characters, and John Williams soundtrack. This is only most awesome!!!",1
1938,"I was very skeptical from the new Star Wars, with that said, hear my rant on what I think of the new movie....Star Wars: Force Awakens was a movie that if you were skeptical, a movie that if you don't like Sci-fi, a movie that simply looked mediocre to you, well, your wrong and you should see it. It was the magic that the first trilogy captured audiences around the globe. Maybe more so this time. There were so many moments that mesmerized me begging me for more. This is the Star Wars movie we have been waiting for. I as a huge skeptic who waited this long to see it, am excited to see the next one in the series. Rey is now my favorite character in all of the Star Wars universe. Fin pulls a strong second. The development on these characters are so well written that the only disappointment I walked away with was the movie ending. I want more, nay I Demand more! Pony up the cash to go see this movie, do not let it slip by. It will be the best movie you see in the theaters for years to come.",1
1939,"This movie is just a whole lot of fun - great new characters who are as good, if not better, than anyone in the OT, exciting action scenes with an emotional punch and a satisfying story. Easy 10/10.",1
1940,"Don't pay any attention to the 0/10 troll reviews on here - they were created by a handful of individuals using multiple accounts who are trying to force Disney to re-instate the Expanded Universe........LOL. Sorry chaps but that's never going to happen. Nice try anyway. I especially like the way they've up-voted their own multiple reviews with their own multiple accounts.On to the film, as a 40 year SW fan, I can say that this entry is the equal of the OT, and in terms of enjoyment it's a 10/10. I think its fair to criticise the lack of originality in the story, there's no defence there, but personally I think it was the right move to get back to basics for the first in the trilogy - I would expect more innovation in the story for future entries. Despite the recycled plot elements, the new characters make the whole thing seem fresh and new, and the good stuff outweighs the flaws.",1
1941,"I've seen all the movies more then twice some of them even 6 times.I started with the movies when I was 4 and since then I'm hugh star wars fan. So as a big fan I can tell you this is one of the most amazing star wars movies I have seen after the prequels. I can also tell you that its one of my favorite, so I'm asking you to just watch it yourself before reading all the haters on metacritic. You will not regret it!! Spoilers!The moment the intro came on the screen and the music started I got goosebumps. I had goosebumps until the end of the movie!I almost wanted to scream when Rey says ""that one is garbage"" it was an easter egg to Luke calling the millenium falcon a piece of junk, so I knew that when the screen turned the millenium falcon would stand there and I was right about it. The battle between Kylo and Finn was amazing and also said about the battle between Finn and the trooper. For the rest I would give the movie a rating between 9 and 10 but because of all the haters I'm giving it a 10!!",1
1942,"Mostly Felt Like a Damn roller coaster Like how The Amazing Spiderman and Mad Max Furry road was like. This was indeed like a roller coaster everything was great and Mindblowing like when Han Solo and Chewie appeard or How Rey found Skywalker that was just amazing. And indeed number one of the best movies of 2015 along with Inside Out, Mad Max Furry road, Furious 7, Ex Manchia",1
1943,"The movie has great set pieces and battle scenes. The characters are interesting though I would like to see what stories do their lifes tell before the movie, for example who are Rey's parents (I think I w=know who they are though) The comebacks of iconic characters like Han Solo adds a layer to the story. I feel like Kylo ARen ruins it all, I would like it way more if he kept his helmet on....",1
1944,"I can't fathom why this film is getting ""0"" by many of the users. I did not like the prequel trilogy, but I still gave them scores of 3,4, and 6, respectively. I put this film right up there with Jedi, as the third best film of the Star Wars cinematic universe. The new characters are fresh, diverse, and most importantly likable. The Force Awakens does a great job of balancing the old guard with the new crop. The film is rather funny, and definitely an emotional ride. Sure, it mirrors lots of what A New Hope did, but why does that matter? I rather have a rehash of A New Hope, than boring stories about blockades, negotiations, and everything political. The 7th episode brings Star Wars back to it's roots. Fun, hilarious, emotional, and adventurous. I gave the film a 10 to balance the scale up. 8/10 - Great.",1
1945,This Film was amazing and while being safe it sets up risks to be taken in episodes 8 and 9. This film was oustanding with a classic story and amazing visual effects combining to make a masterpeice.,1
1946,"Shameless fun. Anyone who denies that fact has no heart, nor a relevant opinion. I've seen it twice now, the acting is superb. The new cast is going to flourish over this next decade. Just because something is different than what you may have imigined -  It doesn't make it bad. Film is perfect in every way - Just don't expect anything new, beyond the characters and their adventures moving forward.",1
1947,"This movie is a lot better than I thought it would be. The connections between the new characters are heart warming, and the characters that reprise their roles from the old films do a fantastic job of transitioning back after all of this time. The special effects are cool and don't interrupt the pace; and my oh my is this a beautiful film.",1
1948,"I honestly find most of the criticism which is leveled at The Force Awakens to be a bit puzzling. Some people protest, for example, that this movie is a ""carbon copy"" of A New Hope, yet they express anger and frustration because J.J. Abrams departed from the original trilogy and, unlike Darth Vader, created an antagonist who is conflicted about his morality from the moment we meet him. Others complain that Kylo Ren isn't powerful enough, or that Rey is too powerful. My answer to that would be, give the directors and writers a chance! This is the first movie in a planned trilogy. The entire point of The Force Awakens is to introduce Kylo Ren and to provide an impetus for his final conversion to the Dark Side. When we meet him, the antagonist is in a sort of liminal state, neither good nor bad, and certainly not at the height of his powers. Again, this is one of the many subtle things which set this work apart from its predecessors. As for Rey, well, we know next to nothing about her character; the reason for her abandonment, her relationship to Luke Skywalker, all are a mystery. There are precedents for individuals manifesting Jedi powers without training – Anakin Skywalker comes to mind – and to simply write Rey off without being privy to her backstory is both unfair and shortsighted. Josh Rottenberg spoke rather insightfully on the topic in a recent LA Times piece: “Abrams opened up the ‘Star Wars’ universe in an unprecedented and important way through the breadth of his casting, which is no small thing. And he and co-writer Lawrence Kasdan came up with some interesting twists on familiar ""Star Wars"" archetypes, whether it's John Boyega's morally conflicted Stormtrooper Finn or Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, who is more like a misguided, screwed-up school shooter than a one-dimensional embodiment of pure villainy. The fact is, ""Star Wars"" is not a vast, open-ended cinematic universe. It is — and has always been — a single story of good and evil centered around a single family and animated by a single all-encompassing spiritual system. While a larger expanded universe has developed outside of the films, ‘Star Wars’ on the big screen is not as unbounded and infinitely renewable as something like ‘Star Trek.’ Unlike the James Bond series, you can't just toss in a fresh villain each time out. Unlike a superhero franchise, you can't cross-pollinate it with characters from adjacent fictional worlds. If you just look at the titles of the first two sequels – ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the Jedi"" – you can see that from the start the story was already looping back on itself. For better or worse, some amount of repetition is just baked in.” Star Wars “fans” need to just settle down, in my opinion, and wait for the consummation of this trilogy before passing final judgment. The Force Awakens shows a lot of promise, both in terms of its use of practical effects, a dynamic cast that has far more chemistry than the stilted characters of the prequels, and a return to the themes which have always been at the heart of the Star Wars universe, e.g. the ties that bind families together. I’ll take that over the trade negotiations and fart jokes of Phantom Menace any day.",1
1949,"SPOILER FREE AND SHORT. Star Wars: Episode 7 is absolutely amazing. It's not better but is just as good as Episode 4. Thankfully, it's nothing like the prequels and is oddly funny. Sadly, the story structure follows a new Hope way too much with just a few things done differently. The new actors do a superb job and Kylo Ren (the new Villain) has an interesting story and feels human, he's thankfully not shallow and is not a Darth Vader clone. The film also has fantastic twists. Oh and all the old actors that were in the originals are great and feel like older versions of their characters and not just the same person. The film is a good return to the franchise and hopefully the next two films are even better. Go see the film.",1
1950,"At the premiere , I had one of the best experiences of my life . It was great to see the audience react and get excited each movie reference . The film summarizes what is best in the franchise and still manages to present Star Wars to a new audience . I can say without doubt that this film will be remembered for generations to come . Thank you JJ .",1
1951,"I have to comment on the vicious backlash this film has recently received. It seems to me a case of intense buyers regret, in which the deeply emotionally invested buyer (literally viewer in this case) has soured on his purchase...mainly because the expectations were so epically great . In my experience, no film or franchise has borne as much feverish emotional freight put on by its legion of fans or amassed such longing and expectation as Star Wars. I'm in as fairly decent a position as anyone to surmise that much of this dates from the release of A New Hope. I was 8 going on 9 back in the Spring of '77. And for well over the ensuing year Star Wars and its alternate universe completely enveloped me. I saw it over 20 times in the theater. It's a very significant point that we may easily forget now, the unbridled joy that Star Wars elicited at the time. It was made and viewed in a spirit of play and discovery. All the things which have become the baseline requirement for even minimal success, and which have more and more work to do to penetrate the thickening hide of jadedness and cynicism pervading the film-going public, like fantastic worlds and special effects, were so much fun at the time because they were at the glowing periphery of what was essentially a great old fashioned adventure story. The original Star Wars still holds up so well because it's light and quick as an old Erroll Flynn movie and the miraculous thing is it stays that way despite everything being presented as if in a different galaxy. And it is similarly miraculous to me that with the crazed weight of generations of accreted expectations placed on the latest film, all stemming from a desire to re-spark that original joy...it succeeds so well , not just in restoring so many of the aesthetic qualities that made the first so captivating, but in staying so true to its own lightness and freshness . The film is completely about these bold new characters, is always focused intently on their motivations and desires despite the return of the original characters and actors. They're never used simply as obligatory props to support an exercise in nostalgia, as the film is being unfairly judged now in its second week of release. Many sequels have been made where the narrative structure is borrowed heavily from the original . In some cases the results are predictably disastrous. Take Jaws 2. In other cases the  borrowed framework is used as a means to provide a sort of thematic echo, a contrast requiring comparison. A great example is The Godfather 2. The entire narrative structure of much of the sequel matches the original in so many ways, an unthinking and unfeeling viewer might easily declare it totally unoriginal . I'm of the mind that something else is going on with the critical backlash other than condemning it for rehashing a prior story. The response is so vitriolic , not just dismissive. Where is the hate coming from? Perhaps it's much easier emotionally for a jaded cynical mind to stay that way . Much easier than to trust that a new generation of filmmakers might want to blow on the old embers and start their own fire, infused with genuine hopeful excitement and enthusiasm ... easier to completely distrust this new energy as ersatz, mercenary, decadent.I actually think it is both absurd, ironic  and then very sad that they all believe the new film is a cynical imitation  of the original precisely  because it has succeeded so well in capturing its spirit. And if that is in the spirit of freshness, boldness, and newness, how can that be but the opposite of imitation?",1
1952,"As good as Episode IV and V, The Force Awakens is amazing. Forget the kids trying to look cool and hate this brilliant movie. Star Wars is back, and it is amazing.",1
1953,Such a fun and enjoyable film. A classic and easy sci-fi storyline filled with lots of suspense and action. I really enjoyed everything about this film. The chase and fight scenes are flawless.,1
1954,"One of the best Star Wars movies ever made... but saddly, Rise of Skywalker ruined a movie that should be a 10/10 to me.This was the first Star Wars movie that made me cry. But it doesn't matter anymore, because after the ending of this new trilogy, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi were thrown in the trash by Kathleen Kennedy or JJ Abrams or whatever was responsible for Episode IX.",1
1955,"A Star Wars movie that can be enjoyed by more then Star Wars fans. Episode VII sheds a fresh breath of air to the universe of Star Wars. Adding more elements of drama and comedy then others in the series,it still played its part of being a decent movie.Some more character development could have been shared, other parts you could have a educated guess as to what happened next. Still these little components didn't deter me from enjoying the film. Made me think back and remember the times seeing Star Wars with one of my step-dads. Memorable.Looking forward to the next two in the series and the development of the main characters.May the Force be with You.",1
1956,"Simply epic. Period. For a movie like that it's only important to know what type of feeling it causes inside of you. With all the high expectations and pressure on their shoulders, they still managed to cause the best feeling ever inside of me: the best memories of my childhood, packed into the best audiovisual presentation that's possible these days. I will watch it again, and again, and again ... like the original trilogy. Thank you for making me forget my popcorn until the movie was over!",1
1957,"Ties with Empire Strikes Back as my favourite Star Wars movie. People complain about similarities to A New Hope but I personally liked it because it still felt fresh and exciting, the acting and the characters were very well done as well as the action scenes. The only problems I can think of are absolute tiny nitpicks that hardly detract from the overall movie. People will complain about it borrowing from A New Hope but no one other than attention seekers or haters can deny that this is a brilliant film and leads a very bright future for the franchise",1
1958,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend. Both of us love star wars. I have read every Star Wars Comic series, I own and have watched every movie and tv series and boast an impressive collection of Star Wars memorabilia. I enjoyed the movie very much and give the same rating I give A New Hope. Was the movie perfect no, was it entertaining and riddled with interesting pieces of information that left me wanting more? Yes. I did not like the prequels at all but I did enjoy Rebels and The Clone Wars, and the comic book series for the expanded universe have always been a fun read so for me. Star Wars has never really gone away as I have been reading and watching all the releases up till this newest movie (that includes the Christmas special as well Droids, Ewok adventure, etc) so everyone that is talking about a Star Wars come back is misguided as it has regularly been releasing media since 1978, in addition anyone saying that this movie will cause Star Wars to die is also equally foolish. Go to the movies have fun with your friends and family and stop over analyzing everything you two bit Simpsons comic book nerds and generation Y blow hards. This movie was an enjoyable movie theatre experience with quite a few gripping scenes but this is not a Kubric masterpiece or Joderowski mind bend its sci fi action adventure and succeeds at being a good one.",1
1959,"Seven or eight? In the end it squeaks an eight. As a non Star Wars fan (still not seen either Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi all the way through though my other half dragged me to the poor prequels) I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Harrison Ford really does well but good turns by the actress who plays Reay and the main baddie do make the film worthwhile. The right amount of humour, action and quieter moments really drew me in. Good job not breaking it!",1
1960,"As a huge fan of the original trilogy I was expecting a lot from this movie and eventually, the movie checked all the items on my should have list.The movie delivers what it is expected to deliver, nothing less, nothing more.The spirit is here, the humour is here, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is great. There are some negative points though:- The movie is not a standalone, it doesn't live without the original trilogy and it isn't complete without a sequel- The pace is too fast, you won't get bored, but you won't have the time to immerge yourself in this new universe where the events of the original trilogy became legends.- Only the scores from the original themes are good, all the new scores are forgettable.- These is nothing really new/original to offer. I see a lot of criticism about this movie, but whenever they are valid, the reviewers should remember that it could be applied to the original trilogy too. In a way, this new movie took the good points of the old movies, but also their flaws. Nonetheless, I had a huge smile all along the movie. And it sets a great foundation for the following movies. The impossible mission of doing a sequel to Star Wars has been accomplished, and this achievement alone deserves a 10. Yes, the movie is missing some elements that would have made it better, but these elements have never been a requirement to me.",1
1961,"This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Good;-I like character that looks not strong, looks weak, very beautiful, cute, no skills, not perfect, isolated but managed to make it. I don’t like invincible, strong, bulk character.-Not too many characters.-Three blade sword Very different characters. Attractive black man as main protagonist with sword, female with sword. I have never seen that in previous movie. Movie reminded me of some Alien 1979 and Mulan.Daisy Ridley was so pretty. Bad;I don’t like SW white cloth soldiers. They are always very weak and stupid.I felt unsatisfied. I wanted enemies to be more difficult and strong. I want enemies to be stronger than protagonist. Movies like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween. I like weak protagonist. It gives me a more thrill and scary. I wanted boss to be much more stronger, smart, and scary.Not much strong villain characters, quite boring. The captain was disappointment. I wanted that character to be strong. Why didn’t Hollywood make Star Wars more earlier. I want to see movies like this and Alien. I don’t want DC, Marvel, Avatar, or Harry Potter .",1
1962,"SPOILERS. I have been a fan of the series since the 80's and I must say that this is the best in the series since Episode V, no doubt.  You will find endless ""red"" reviews with 0's and 1's and 2's and this is RIDICULOUS FANBOY GARBAGE REVIEWING.  YES, the movie has quite a bit in common with Episode IV (which is not a bad thing).  YES, some of the climactic events (a.k.a. spoilers) are predictable but not in an annoying or let-down way.  YES, some of the characters that were built up didn't have a huge place or hours of screen time (e.g. Captain Phasma), but then again, neither did fan favorite Boba Fett.  YES, Rey becomes a badass immediately (so what?  it's the Force -- this is how ALL Jedi are -- they don't realize they have powers, so they don't use them (much) and then someone tells them they have powers and BOOM they're badasses (but just low on a spectrum of badassery)).  The fact that Rey can own Ren in a fight I think speaks more to Rey having quite a bit of potential and perhaps Ren not quite living up to his (dark) potential quite yet.  I love how Ren is the opposite of Vader -- Vader was pretty much all dark but with just a twinge of good left in him that ultimately was pulled out in Episode VI.  Ren goes the other way -- very conflicted.  He WANTS to be dark but still is pulled by the good (instead of the dark side winning him over like with Anakin, he WANTS to be dark and it is the good in him that is pulling him, conflicting him).  I LIKE that Ren shows human weakness and isn't a ""creature"" under his mask as Rey suggested.  He is a confused and fearful (exactly what the dark side plays on) and scared of the future and ultimately I think that this will push him into being a truly heartless horrible bastard in the next 2 trilogy films. Overall, the FEAL of this movie is perfect.  Hits home really nicely (the same way the Star Trek reboot did).  Sound effects and music spot on.  Just enough humor.  Just enough sadness.  Just enough carnage.  Left with a cliffhanger scene (almost literally).  Can't wait for Episode VII (or whatever prequel side story is supposed to come out in the interim...).",1
1963,"Perfection. Great movie, however felt like a bit of a mash up of 4 and 6. Wish that Leia's role wasn't so generalised, she needed more character in her.",1
1964,"I've seen this film twice now, and without a doubt, I can say that this is truly the most amazing and emotional and intense movie I've ever seen. I LOVE Star Wars, and with this movie, the franchise is back, and better than ever. Is it flawless? No, even though there are few flaws, such as some plot points being VERY SIMILAR to the other films, notably A New Hope, I love this movie, and these flaws are so minor it doesn't kill my enjoyment of the movie. The characters are memorable, the performances are excellent, the visuals are beautiful, the story is good, and overall, the movie is spectacular. Disney did everything right with this film and the franchise as a whole. I can't wait to see where the series goes next. 10/10 :)",1
1965,I can't for the new era of Star Wars video games. RPG games would be great something that let us live this huge universe and learn more about different races.,1
1966,"In recent years, Star Wars fans have been forced to endure the dreadful prequels; prequels, I must add, which did not reflect the charm, humour, excitement, and true brilliance that was the original trilogy. Surprisingly, JJ Abrams' next instalment sees that once lost brilliance return to our screens: excellent acting, likeable characters, and a healthy mix of practical effects and modest CGI. Furthermore, is the things fans of the originals had grown to love: the story. A relatively simple premise of good versus evil which Episodes 4, 5 and 6 followed closely has returned. While debatably a ""reboot"" of Episode 4: A New Hope (an 'empire' is in search of a droid which contains valuable information; the said droid comes into the possession of the protagonists, hence battle), it is something which had to be done. The disappointed fans needed this rehabilitation. We must understand that this is a storyline that worked, and if it needed to be shown again however similar than so be it. In short, and to avoid spoilers: see this movie. No words can describe how important it is for fans of original Star Wars, who had their childhoods destroyed by the laughable prequels.",1
1967,"A fun movie, which sets up the series well for the future, even though it's a bit generic and repetitive (in the larger sense of the Star Wars world).As a former Lucasfilm employee, I feel this respects Star Wars and keeps the series going in a good direction.",1
1968,"Like many fans I was disappointed when I realised that everything from the Expanded Universe was thrown out, even if I understood the reason for it.Still, J.J. Abrams did an amazing work establishing new loveable characters and starting a new amazing journey for the fans. The movie is not only filled with homage to what has been before but also gives us a nice beginning for a new trilogy.",1
1969,"Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens focuses on Nostalgia of the original trilogy using elements and aspects from the original trilogy to introduce both old and new characters. The original storyline parts mesh well with borrowed aspects, Disney played safe for sure when making the movie, regardless it came out well. Although some of the new acting choices are questionable, its still an enjoyable beginning of a new trilogy.Both new and old Star Wars fans will enjoy this new addition to the Star Wars universe.",1
1970,"I would say the average user score (~7) is about right where I feel about this movie. I genuinly enjoyed much of it, in particular the Rey character and the little droid as well as Han and the Wookie. Ben's most frigthening moments come when he is trashing walls in anger - otherwise he is almost as poor of a villain (or semi-villain) as is the hapless general (what is it about poor leadership choices with the Empire/First Order?!) and this Snoke (really?!) guy who seems to come right from the Hobbit universe. And dont get me started about that stormtrooper guy - I mean we knew those are hapless chaps but boy is he hard to watch! Honestly I dont know if we really needed that look behind the stormtrooper helmets? Overall the old guard along with Rey and the droid are more than just saving this movie from being awful..",1
1971,"Lots of implausible nonsense but still enjoyable.Feels like the film makers decided to not be serious and try to have more fun with it.Rey and Finn are fun new characters but unbelievable how adept they seem to be at everything that is so hard for everyone else in this universe.Kylo Renn was a bit over the top, making him relatable also makes him less menacing.",1
1972,"As an absolutely magnificent comeback for this timeless franchise, Episode VII provides stunning visuals and new characters to the winning formula that is Star Wars. It would honestly be a contender for my favorite entry in the series if it wasn't for the sheer lack of chemistry between the main cast. Regardless, it is a greatly compelling film that accomplishes a lot in nearly every other aspect.",1
1973,"Kylo Ren? MORE LIKE, this is easily one of the best Star Wars movies and if you think it's a copy of A New Hope you don't understand stories or how movies are made. Which means you are in fact, a dumb dumb.",1
1974,La película esta buena y es entretenida. Pero en serio hacía falta traer los mismos conceptos de antes? Es casi la maldita misma trama que Star Wars I y III. La hace predecible y decepcionante.,1
1975,"After the new trilogy (episode 1, 2 and 3) this movie should be at least comptent, and it was but it was really bland and generic. The only thing that I really like about this movie it's Rey but she is a copy of Luke. At least the movie doesn't look like it was shot on a soundstage.",1
1976,"Han solo dies, yes that right the fan favorite comes to a end in this copy of a new hope with just remodels graphics and new faces the story line feels to similar to ever be classed as one of the best star wars films",1
1977,"The Force Awakens is clearly just a stepping stone to The Last Jedi. But it still manages to create interesting characters in newcomers Rey & Finn, who are Star Wars character tropes turned upside down. With series' mainstays, the film creates an excellent tone for the next few films, which are inevitable at this point. Even its similarity to A New Hope is just enough to carve out an interesting enough villain to sustain a new trilogy.",1
1978,"STAR WARS LE REVEIL DE LA FORCELes Amis je veux le revoir avec vous encore!! Tellement c'est du génie!!!-Un film de JJ.ABRAMS l'un de mes réalisateurs préférés !! Réalisateur de Star Trek; Star Trek Into Darkness; super 8; mission: impossible III; Lost, les disparus; le  scénario de Frindge... JJ.ABRAMS est un passionné du temps, de l'espace et de lumière. Ses trois principes se retrouvent toujours dans toutes ces  productions!-POUR CONCLURE !! SANS SPOIL !!Ce n'est pas un film FAN SERVICE Abrams à su prendre l'essence même de Star Wars pour en faire quelque chose de meilleurs donc que vous aimer ou pas Star Wars ce film est fait pour vous la prélogie n'ai pas une obligation d’être vu !!!!!!! ;)Les base sont poser à quand le prochain ??? !!! ;-Star Wars est pour moi une série de films qui a changé les standards du cinéma. Ils sont, a eux seuls révolutionner le monde de la science-fiction (au  niveau cinéma). Il y a Jadice 38 ans (Star Wars, épisode IV :Un nouvel espoir) à révolutionner le cinéma en intégrant des triches ou technologies comme  les monstrueux vaisseaux impériaux reproduit à échelle raisonnable qui accrocher par des câbles parcoure, devant un écran bleu. Mais cessons de parler du ""PASSER"", mais parlons du ""PRÉSENT"" avec cette STAR WARS 7-Dés sa scène d'introduction est imposer un grand respect, une excellente maîtrise de se qui nous a toujours fait plaisir dans Star Wars. [spoiler]    Les robots    [/spoiler]    , les  angles de vue qui nous font perdre l'orientation, les lumières, les déguisements, les planètes, les vaisseaux...(j'en passe tellement et des meilleurs)je  n'oublie pas non plus l'UNIVERS. Nous retrouvons [spoiler]    un semblable de R2D2 appelé BB8,    [/spoiler]    la encore les blagues sont si nombreuse... Il a été fait pour vraiment nous faire rire. Son design est  tout à fait surprenant ce qui permet de lui faire faire des choses totalement improbables. Nous découvrons énormément [spoiler]    de nouveaux monde, races, créature, mimique    [/spoiler]    En découle une histoire qui se dévoile lentement mais surement. L'intrigue est bien gardée, les personnages se dévoilent au fur et à mesure que les effets  spéciaux se multiplient sans accro. Une Décadence de l'univers est remarquée. [spoiler]    Nous passons d'un environnement chaud, désertique aux couleurs orangées où se désine tristesse et pauvreté ou notre regard se pose. À un environnement plus sombre (car on en apprend plus) mais vert et plein d'espoir. Pour terminer dans l'obscur blanc, froid et sans  couleur car tout espoir disparaît lors du déroulement d'une bataille sans piter fait rage (remarquer le travail des lumières). Puis on retourne dans un environnement propre éclairé d'un ciel blanc (le blanc aurait la  signification de terre pure) sur une île.    [/spoiler]    De multiples rebondissements qui ne m'ont pas choqué à la connaissance et l'analyse de toute la filmographie de ABRAMS. Mais suffisamment surprenante [spoiler]    pour  terminer par une scène tout à fait remarquable. Cette dernière scène ou nous voyons Luc et Rey sur une ile ou Rey tant sa main avec le sabre laser à Luc a ce moment le plan est filmé d'une prise de vue aérienne la terre ne bouge pas tandis ce que l'eau défile à l'écran ce qui indique que pour JJ le temps  est liquide donc que le temps avance vite. J'imagine que le prochain épisode ne reprendra pas tout de suite après, mais quelques années plus tard....Entre  nous tant mieux je ne veux pas la voire apprendre devenir jeudi George Lucas n'avait pas fait l'erreur donc ... Une 3D qui ne force pas seulement le respect, mais impose son nouveau standard Elle est tellement puissante !! (Coeur lège ne vous mettait pas au 1er rang). Alfonso Cuaron avec son ""Gravity"" vient d'être surpassé sur ce point. Des débordements d'image, une profondeur réglée au micron. Génère des batailles en  vaisseaux Spatiaux digne des plus grands chefs d'oeuvre hollywoodiens. JE ME SUIS ÉCLATÉ !!!!! -Dans les défauts, car il y en a toujoursJe regrette que John Williams n'est était plus inspiré ;) Pour un prochain Star Wars je choisirai comme compositeur Michael Giachinno",1
1979,"Yang kasih rate 0-3 berarti sengaja menjatuhkan karya orang lain, lu pikir bikin film itu mudah ? lu pikir penilaian sebuah film bagus atau tidak cuma dinilai dari plot nya / ceritanya ? kalo mau kontribusi kasih rate yang objektif lah, pertimbangkan aspek2 lain dalam film tersebut (unsur2 intrinsik film).  Saya pribadi sangat tidak suka dengan orang2 yang tidak menghargai karya orang lain, dengan melakukan penilaian hanya dari aspek2 tertentu, tidak menilainya secara keseluruhan (semua aspek yg ada dinilai) serta memberikan penilaian secara obyektif, bukannya berdasarkan emosi/perasaan sendiri semata, alias subyektif.",1
1980,"This was a great way to start off the new trilogy. It plays it safe and borrows several plot points from A New Hope, but has interesting new characters (and some returning old ones who have grown since we last saw them), and as a result, it still able to stand on its own. And if the reception to The Last Jedi is any indication, playing it safe was a good choice, despite what a rather vocal minority might say.",1
1981,"Great Star Wars movie. Best one of the new ones yet. I don't know why some people think The Last Jedi is better, it's not.",1
1982,"People complain that it's too much like A New Hope, and while yes they are very similar. Is that really all bad? In my opinion, no. A New Hope is a fantastic film and this film is pretty darn close. Is it as good as A New Hope? No. It's not quite as good. It has some plot conveniences that you can nitpick about and I suppose a new fresh film would have been better. But the new characters are amazing and I just can't help but go on this journey. I really do love this film. A",1
1983,"Thirty years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, the galaxy faces a new threat from the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order. When a defector named Finn (John Boyega) crash-lands on a desert planet, he meets Rey (Daisy Ridley), a tough scavenger whose droid contains a top-secret map. Together, the young duo joins forces with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to make sure the Resistance receives the intelligence concerning the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last of the Jedi Knights.",1
1985,"It's mostly a retread, but it's a fun and watchable one. Abrams makes up for the lack of originality in his film by filling it with a whole lot of heart.",1
1986,"It's a worth return to Star Wars, while the movie follows some of the classic storylines, opens a lot of new ones, there's a lot of mysterious around the new characters (much more in the villians) and i know a lot of people is expecting what all of this is going to turn into. I would loved that some of the scenes didn't seem forced, but is something of the bad points on it, also it seems like some of the new IMPORTANT chaaracters do not have a path to  follow or purpose to be involved on the storyline so we could say it's like they don't fit well. Despite this, those are problems that could be  solved in the upcoming movies, so talking in long-terms this (and this new hole trilogy) can turn better than we are thinking.",1
1987,I had a blast when I saw Episode VII back on Christmas Eve 2015. What a thrill to see Star Wars on the big screen again. Not as good as the Lucas movies but a lot of the Star Wars magic was there for some reason. I also enjoyed the subtle slapstick humour as well as most of the dialogues. The fact that Episode VIII was such a disaster made me want to come back to give this one the rating it deserves.,1
1988,"The film itself is very good, acting, effects, music, direction, structure and production. It is very dynamic and fun. ON THE OTHER HAND, it puts the canon in a difficult situation by copying episode 4, causing The Last Jedi to be a divisive movie. If you hated episode 8, you should think that this movie put the star war canon in a bad way.",1
1989,"Star Wars the Force Awakens is amazing! Although the storyline is a bit like A New Hope and has some plot holes, it is the re-entrance to the franchise everyone needed. Rey is the main character and it took everyone by surprise when she became the jedi, not Finn. If you were hoping to see Luke Skywalker, get ready to be disappointed. Luke has no lines in the entire movie, but it is nice to really get to know the new characters. The entire movie has you sitting at the edge of your seats, waiting to see what happens next to our heroes. It is rated PG-13 due to the death of a certain character (I CRIED) and the intense battle scenes in general. But this is a very mild PG-13, and if you are a fan of the star wars trilogy, GO SEE IT. I gave this a 10/10 because this was not only the best possible thing that could have happened,but it was the first star wars movie I have ever seen in the cinema. And for those reasons, 10/10!",1
1990,"JJ Abrams Star Wars: The Force Awakens was one of the most hyped films I've ever heard of. Least to say, this film definitely deserves that hype. JJ Abrams once again directs action scenes really well. I really loved the new trinity of characters, Rey, Finn, and Poe. The music is still iconic and is very great. I really, really loved Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. He was so developed and fleshed out. I guess my main complaints are a few plot conveniences and some parts that just copied the original Star Wars film. In the end, I absolutely love this film, and I'm going to give it a 9.6/10",1
1991,"It was a good kick-start to the new trilogy, still, I missed some explanations, but I guess they will reveal soon in the universe of SW.",1
1992,"Pretty good. Daisy Ridley steals the show in this one for me, her performance is sublime. Boyega I'm not so sure about, some of his funny scenes weren't landing and overall his performance lacks conviction. The film makes an enthralling start that is very engaging, but the second half is a different story. Although equally soaked in action, it doesn't convey key moments nearly as well as the first. Despite this, as someone not familiar with the Star Wars franchise at all, The Force Awakens does a good job at kindling my interest. Nothing mind-blowing here though.",1
1993,Having seen it’s poorly done successors in no way lessens this movie’s appeal. A well made entry in the Star Wars canon.,1
1995,"EXCellent movie, much much better than the last one, it set ups for very promising things to come only to be ruined by the sequel movie",1
1996,"AWESOME! This is the best SW film ever. Technically, the movie is pretty good, with good action scenes, and decent aerobatics with the various spacecraft involved whether they're flying in space or in atmosphere.",1
1997,This movie brings up new and likeable characters to the story while including many of the original characters. I think it was a huge mistake to kill off Han Solo. I would have preferred that they kill off literally anyone else. But other than that I think it's a great start to a new set of star wars movies.,1
1998,"This movie is overall pretty awesome, with interesting, likeable new characters. The best thing about it is how well it fits into the Star Wars universe. Ray explores a Star Destroyer, and lives in a fallen Imperial vehicle. Visually, this movie is pretty great. It also has a lighthearted sense of humor that works pretty well and sets a nice tone for the movie.",1
1999,"its an amazing movie it has its flaws but its pretty good and i can,t wait for the next one",1
2000,"The Force Awakens will be damaged in retrospective by the horrible The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson wanted to show with The Last Jedi how awesome and outstanding he is as a director and writer. Yes, he will go down in the history books, but not as an ingenious director, but as a director who has brought one of the most beloved franchise to fall. The genius of his subversive and with plotholes and stupid humor only so brimming film is that he has thus also damaged all previous films.  If you've seen The Last Jedi, you'll never want to watch a Star Wars movie again. I hope Rian Johnson will NEVER come anywhere near a movie set, either as a director or as a writer. It would be a great relief for everyone! By the way: I liked The Force Awakens, it was a fine start for the new trilogy. Tragic, everything is ruined now!",1
2001,"to me, she is royalty..Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force AwakensEven though being of 136 minutes, there hardly is a minute where you will wander off the movie; this is JJ Abrams at its best after Star Trek: Into Darkness. The sense of urgency is the key to this masterpiece where all the characters (whether it be new or familiar ones) with all the throwbacks and some perfectly mesmerizing scenes that can only be imagined in a fanboy's dream is executed with all the devotion.",1
2002,"I'm a Star Wars fan, but not a die hard fan. Maybe that's why I really enjoyed this movie. I was never bored and the characters were very likeable and well written and I liked the plot. Perhaps the die hard fans are being too hard on this movie because it didn't give them what they had imagined.",1
2003,"I know a lot of people have complained about The Force Awakens, but I don't care. This film did everything I wanted it to do. Is there another Death Star-like base? Yeah, but I don't mind it. After the (first two) prequels, I believe it was the right choice to give us something familiar before going off to do something very different. Even when that happens, people STILL like to complain. The Force Awakens is full of fantastic effects, rich character personalities and development, and a great introduction to a great new future.",1
2005,"Awesome movie and storytelling, so much interesting cliffhangers, I just hope Rian Johnson won't drop the ball on the next one. Update: Rian Johnson did drop the ball on the next one...",1
2006,"Its lack of risk to allow Disney's trilogy to possibly transcend to new heights is its downfall, however its homage to the force, and its intriguing new characters still makes this a unique film. Also, Star Wars is back!",1
2007,"great movie. Good acting, good direction,good music, good plot, somewhat reminiscent of A New Hope, and the Rathtar scene wasn't all that good.",1
2008,"Star Wars is back! At least that's what I thought after I saw this delightful movie. )Of course it has since died because of the The Last Jedi). The old characters were brought in well, but more importantly the new characters were so much fun, charming and likeable (in contrast to Holdo, Fin, DJ). There were some elements that were unoriginal (another Death Star? come one!), and the set up with 'resistance' and 'First Order' echoing the OT was ja shame. But so much of this film and fun and exciting! And of course, it almost doesn't need to be said, but John William's soundtrack is amazing.",1
2009,"Yes I know the plot is horribly derivative of the original Star Wars (come on, ANOTHER death star equivalent, that's all you could come up with?), but I watched it spell bound, and relived some of my favourite childhood moments again with this movie.  Above all, JJ Abrams did a fine job of rebooting the Star Wars universe, it captured the feel and essence of the original trilogy, which was not an easy thing.  It introduced many new and interesting characters, and started to build out their development and story arcs - it connected well with old ones and used them (mostly) well.It was respectful of most aspects of the Star Wars universe in not being too absurd, and it set me up to spend the next 2yrs in anticipation of the (sadly awful) sequel.  That's a good Star Wars movie in my books, one that you enjoy repeatedly - there's a lot to love about this film, it gets a 7.5 from me and only not higher because the core plot wasn't imaginative enough.",1
2011,"Excellent execution, but let down by the lack of originality. I really want to rate it higher, but I just can't because the story is too similar to Episode 4. But apart from the rip-off story, if I imagine myself never seeing a Star Wars movie before, I would rate it 9 out of 10.This movie is excellent in many ways. The plot (let's forget about the rip-off problem) doesn't seem to have any significant problem. It has a clear objective, character transformation, and a classical ""Hero's Journey"" type of story. It's not a complex story, but there's nothing wrong with it.Much praise for the actors' performance. Abrams did a great job in selecting the right actors with the right casting. This is the first Star Wars movie that has a female main character, and it proves to be effective. Rey is a lovable character and has the innocence of Luke.The main antagonist, Kylo Ren, is something that is totally different from the previous Star Wars villains. His impulsiveness is his uniqueness. I'm a bit disappointed that he took the mask too early because I would like his real face to be revealed in the climax of the story.There's chemistry between the characters. The friendship between Poe and Finn is very emotional, even though they just met for a couple of minute. The same goes for Finn with Rey and Han. Another thing to praise is the stunning visuals and music. It displays Abrams' impressive directing skill. I like how everything is quick-paced, which is compatible to the story style. Almost every scene is emotional.There are some few things that annoy me, like how Maz Katana was able to obtain Luke's lightsaber, which he lost during the battle with Vader in Episode 5. Unlike many people, I actually don't have any problem with Captain Plasma's lack of background story. She, like Bobba Fett, is just an instrument in this movie and not meant to be an important antagonist. Overall, a masterpiece. Would've been a lot better if the story is more original.",1
2012,"Super exciting for long-time fans to see the saga return to form, but the retreading of ideas brings down the replay value. Still a solid movie.",1
2013,"The Force Awakens is a fun Star Wars film! It's sure not a great as the classics, but I would take it over some of the prequel films and definitely The Last Jedi. Throughout the film, there are several fun action sequences, some likable characters, and the return of old favorites. Unfortunately, there are some flaws including some characters being completely underdeveloped, and the plot is very derivative of A New Hope. Also, the villain for me in this film is a very unlikable characters. I also hated the scene where Han Solo died which killed off Han Solo in the worst way possible. While not holding up as great to the classic films from the past, The Force Awakens delivers quite a fun Star Wars film.",1
2014,"The movie is extremely fun entertaining and packed with amazing special effects. 2 problems though, the movie is a new hope but in 2015 and with new characters, if the story was more original i would love it. And the main character is a little too good at the end of the movie, seriously it's a little ridiculous.",1
2015,"The Force Awakens borrows heavily from all three movies in the original trilogy, particularly A New Hope. I happen to like that ~because A New Hope was a fantastic sci-fi opera~ but you don't get more points for doing the same thing twice.While enjoyable, the movie is not groundbreaking. It's 'good' but not 'spectacular' as I had hoped it would be.",1
2016,"There isn’t much to say about this movie, other than that there was no better way to open the series back up like this! The only thing I didn’t like about the movie is how they would later fail to reunite all the main core characters (Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Lando) but this might be resolved in Rise of Skywalker, so I wouldn’t complain!",1
2017,"The Force Awakens is an amazing Star Wars movie and an amazing movie in general. Sure, the plot feels like A New Hope but it’s really not all that similar. It’s called paying homage. The Force Awakens for me, revived the Star Wars franchise after the dissapointing prequel trilogy. This movie had great characters, amazing effects, fun action sequences, and a great story. The only thing I didn’t like about this film was starkiller base, which is basically a third Death Star but bigger. So overall I love this movie and I think The Force Awakens is the best Star Wars movie that Disney has released so far.",1
2018,"It's good, but it falls short on story. If it wasn't as much of a ripoff of A New Hope, then it would be much better. I can understand why it's almost a direct copy, but whatever. We got what we got.",1
2019,Un retour joyeux mais une fin bien tragique pour Harrison Ford. Ses le premier star wars que je suis aller voir au cinéma et je n’est pas du tout été décus. Adam Drive détruit tout les autre acteur dans sont rôle de Kylo Ren. L’idée de gardé Snoke en hologramme durent tout le film est une très bonne idée.,1
2021,"One of my favorite Star Wars movies, this is a fantastic, epic movie, filled with great action scenes, breathtaking visual effects, solid acting, good writing, a fantastic score and sound design. This could be a 10/10 if the plot wasn't a rehash of the original 1977 Star Wars, it almost feels like a remake of that movie, which would be fine if it was marketed that way but it isn't, but that doesn't make it a bad movie, it just feels like they played it safe with this. Sure, also some kind of illogical things like Rey just knows how to use the force without any training or things like those but those are minor things that maybe hardcore fans will find annoying, not me, but I noted that.I like the fact that this movie almost feels like a semi-reboot, because it's basically Star Wars for a new generation, we see new heroes in a new story to save the universe again.And thank God that this wasn't a borderline cartoon to sell Star Wars toys like the prequels were, the prequels are cartoons for me because they were filled with cheesy dialogue that sometimes became cringe, melodramatic and over-the-top acting and awful CGI that didn't age well. Sure this movie still has some cheesy stuff but it's not as bad as the prequels were.I love this movie! As a fan of Star Wars movies and good movies in general, I really consider this an amazing movie worth watching. Obviuously it's not Oscar-worthy and we all know that some people might not be interested in movies like Star Wars but if you like Star Wars or action space movies, this is a must-see.",1
2022,"The Force Awakens is a great movie, but loses a couple of points for being slightly derivative.",1
2023,"Great way to kick off the sequel trilogy, the user score for this should be much higher. Not worth listening to all the sequel haters that cling to the original trilogy and won't expand their interests. The character development is fantastic. The relationships between Finn and Poe, and Finn and Rey are very well done. Han Solo brought back feels just like the Han Solo we all remembered and loved. Kylo Ren is an intriguing villain. The action sequences are done very well, it feels like a pure star wars film. The film though does lack some originality as the plot mirrors that of A New Hope too much. JJ Abrams played it very safe, although there's enough new moments in this movie that allow me to forgive the lack of originality. The ending duel between Finn and Rey vs Kylo is great too. Great film and a must see.",1

2028,"Your response to The Force Awakens will likely depend on what you’re looking for in a new Star Wars movie. If you’re looking for something completely new then I’d look elsewhere, if you’re looking just to be entertained then this surely fits the bill. It does for me at least. JJ Abrams lacks ambition with his storytelling but makes up for it in general with his delivery and new set of characters. Aesthetically this looks and feels like classic Star Wars; there’s powerful and, for some, emotive imagery plus it’s a breezy affair with great action and humour throughout. It does go too far with its simplicity and for me the final third of the movie is far too similar and done not as good as the classic 1977 original. However this is a refreshing back to basics for Star Wars with interesting new characters, particularly Rey and Kylo Ren, and old faces, Han Solo. The Force Awakens is not as iconic as Empire, as heavy hitting as Sith or is able to deliver the high thrills of Jedi, however it is still a nostalgic thrill ride that entertains immensely and what it does well it does very well. Long time fans may find themselves craving more whilst for a new audience this should do quite nicely.",1
2030,"Super safe approach of J.J. Abrams and the need not to anger fans made Force Awakens incredibly boring, predictable and disappointing. It is New hope remake with tons of fanservice and agenda that is as obnoxious as it is obvious.",0
2034,"Protagonist goes from learning about the force to mastering it over the course of a couple days. Antagonist is an under developed whiny gimmick and the actor who plays him (Adam Driver) has the most stiff and uncoordinated chirography I've ever seen in a star wars film.I can force myself to re-watch Episode 1 and find moments in the film I enjoy, the same cannot be said about this episode.",0
2036,"I am watching all the Star Wars Episodes again and this is for sure the worst movie so far: There are boring actors, especially the main character got her job only because of her gender I am sure. The story is very boring and simple. Do you remember the complex story of episode 1-3 with the dense political backgrounds, this was great. But here you have just action, shouting, nice special effects and dumb dialogues, that do not touch at all. Fun for the dumb masses, but not for people with brain. In addition the story is not comprehensible, when you see a 50 kg woman, who just know her jedi powers is fighting a male veteran Sith and can hurt him. Fairy tale, feminist propaganda, **** you can call it, how you want. Oh, and dont forget, some stormtroppers are black...You remember Episode 2? The stormtroopers are clones and the white man Jango Fett was the original. There is another thing, that people with brain dont understand. The empire is dead in the end of Episode 6. Where did the new lord came from and why are the rebels so weak again? Just to tell a new simple story?It is interesting also, that this movie is rated with 8.0/10 on imdb right now. How is this possible? And look at the reviews here and on imdb, that are rated as helpful? Most of them are negative. Did Disney pay imbd? Or did they hire some people to make accounts on imdb to push the ratings and by this sabotage the system here? This review isnt event online there, so I will write and rate to metacritic only.",0
2038,If you don't love this movie you are the kind of person who will never be happy. This movie was everything it needed to be. Took the best of the original movies and made it more current and epic,1
2040,"This is how you should start a new trilogy. After the prequels we lost hope that there would be Star Wars movies that feel like the original trilogy. This movie gave us fans what we had hoped for and yes I admit that this is basically like a remake of episode 4 A New Hope. It uses the same structure, similar characters and story arcs with good variations. This is a two-sided thing. It can be rated as homage that wants to get the fans back or as creative sellout. You can never please all fans. Some want changes and new stuff others want only more of the same with at max slight variations. For me I like the mixture of old and new and the good set ups for the follow up movies. I could not imagine that everything was wasted there but that will be described in my review for The Last Jedi and has nothing to do with this movie. I will explain what this movie does well: The set up and characters. You create a new scenario and nothing is more interesting than that Luke Skywalker has vanished without a trace as the remnants of the Empire have grown in power as the First Order and threaten the galaxy again. It creates a mystery that we care for and a threat we know is a deadly menace. Of cause there is the split in the former rebels that formed the New Republic. Leia was cut of from power as the other leaders became lazy and blind for the threat. She had created her own organization with those loyal to her or aware of the threat. They have not learned from the past. Again something that is realistic, believable and creates a good setting. The story is about the new characters and their journeys. Let start with Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is a strong and good character that was harden by the battle for survival on a dessert plant. There is the critique that she is a Mary Sue character (= Perfect and flawless avatar that is far better than everyone else). I will defend that this is not true in this movie. With the follow up movies I must admit defeat. There she is a Mary Sue. She gets thrown in something she would have never expected and grows on the journey. There is John Boyega as Finn. I would say he is the hidden star of the movie. He is a Stormtropper that is horrified by the First Order and defects to atone for his sins. You can see his struggles and I will praise the actor. Then you have Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron. He is an ace pilot and star of the rebels;-). For the bad guys you have the big bad Supreme Leader Snoke played by Andy Serkis. He is like it should be in the first movie of a trilogy. Mysterious, powerful, impressive and threatening. Again a good set up because you want to know more about him. Then you have Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. He is a Darth Vader fanboy that wants to be like him. That sounds negative but is actually good. He fights the battle of the persons he is vs the person he wants to be. Then another good new character. Domhall Gleeson as General Hux. He is a high ranking leader in the First Order and a rival to Kylo Ren. He is really skilled (got demoted to incompetent moron in the sequel) and has the disadvantage that he can not use the Force. Their dynamic and rivalry is remarkable and again a good set up for the future. The old characters were used less but mostly good. Leia had a fitting role and does a really good job as aged but still will-strong leader. I must mention that Han was discarded after he had a satisfying role. The most fitting description I have seen was on YouTube at the Nostalgic Critic. He made a parody that Leia made Han sign a live insurance and gave him a red shirt before he left (Dialog: Wrong franchise. No, also rebooted by J. J. Abrams so it is valid;-). It is so true and foreseeable. Chewbacca is Chewbacca and always good. Overall I will praise J. J. Abrams. He knows how to start a trilogy and the set ups are superb. This had so much potential and had revitalized the Star Wars movies. But then came the sequels and I must warn you. I would rather watch Jar Jar a Star Wars story or the in famous Star Wars Christmas special (George Lucas would destroy every copy if he could do it). Bonus Star Wars knowledge: There is the Darth Jar Jar theory that he is a master manipulator and Sith Master that uses this persona as disguise. There is a lot to it. He falls up the ranks, is always at the right places at the right time, shows some incredible abilities and survives dangerous encounters that got other far more capable people killed. Just watch the video. It is the most you can get out of that character and was entertaining.",1
2044,"The first nail to the coffin of the SW franchise. An empty shell of a film that pisses on the lore of its predecessors out of simple laziness, with a cheap copycat storyline (plagiarism of a film from your own series), goofy slapstick humor, single-facial-expression protagonist who succeeds in everything effortlessly, and other issues. If you truly wish to explore the many reasons why this movie is an absolute failure watch MauLer's in-depth analysis of both Ep VII and VIII.",1
2045,"The Force Awakens is not a bad movie. The action and visuals are great. A few of the new characters are great. The main problem with this movie is the story, which borrows heavily from A New Hope. Because of the cliche story, the film lacks the originality and freshness that it should have. The film also raises questions which ultimately aren't answered, or at least answered well, in the later films.",1

It looked like a bad fanfic but I had hope after I've seen Rey on a behavior more alike a SW character. Hold watching patiently it until the Falcon flight, that was pretty good. Then, the teenager reaction after it was way too cringe, never that a scavenger or a soldier would react like that. I gave up, rewatching the prequels was more entertaining than this.",0
2050,"The Force Awakens continues to make the Star Wars franchise one of the best movie franchise of all time and one of my favorite movie franchises of all time. Not only does this new movie feature my favorite characters and actors from the first three (Harrison Ford as Han, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, R2-D2, and Chewbacca) but it add some of the most amazing new characters to the franchise. This is my favorite Star Wars movie and is one of my favorite movies of all time. The cinematography was executed very nicely. The visual effects, puppets, and animatronics were gorgeous and fantastic especially BB-8 and R2-D2. The writing, story, and screenplay were spectacular. The costumes, makeup, and hair were beautiful. The acting performances from Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Harrison Ford, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Domhnall Gleeson were stupendous. The voice over performance from Lupita Nyong'o was great. Mark Hamill's cameo was perfect. Also I loved the musical score composed by John Williams it was amazing. A+",1

J. imposes a raw harsh style on this new Star Wars trilogy and starts a story that's occurring perhaps too early than one might expect. Aside from its strong sense of wonder and endearment towards these new cast of characters, Force Awakens scrapes along anxiously, never quite taking flight the way you'd like it to, and even when it does, still leaves so much unfulfilled. But as it is, Force Awakens is still an exuberant, authentic and dynamite of a Star Wars movie that's maybe the most raw movie of the saga since the originals came out in the late 1970s and early 1980s. When it's intent is to invigorate a new generation of Star Wars fans, really is just a throwback for the so many who miss what it used to be.",1

No Nuance, No real threat, No life lessons or morals. Just a Mary Sue protagonist perfect at everything and a ""villian"" who throws temper tantrums and pouts in every scene.This film is a joke, it's up there with Anakin complaining about Sand and Tuskan Raiders.The only thing it has going for it, is it's pretty.

2074,"The movie thrives on practical effects,splendid CGI and great new actors which are both a breath of fresh air from the prequels. However, this movie is basically a shot for shot remake of the the original New Hope movie. The main protagonist grew up on a desert planet, the Jedi are dead, a galactic empire(2.0) is the big baddie,there's a dark robed antagonist with a robotic sinister voice, a droid needs to get to the rebellion while carrying important information, there's a death star. There's even a freaken trench run! A sequel does not retell the original story, it's supposed to build off the franchise, continuing where it left off.It also hurts that this movie undid everything the rebel heroes gained in between episodes 4–5–6.And some of the new characters where very lacking orr very bad... Kylo Ren is one of the worst villains I have ever seen in a movie, bar none.This is a man-child and I really,really don't understand his motivation. If you have parents like Han and Leia and you grow up in the resistance, I can understand being neglected sometimes. I honestly get the feeling that I could take him one-on-one with a lightsaber. I seriously wonder how the bad guys were able to build such a super weapon when it is obvious that they lack the power or the competency to pull anything like that off without Leia and the New Republic knowing about it? Why are the New Republic armies called the ""Resistance"" when they won the galaxy thirty years ago.Rey, at first introduction is a scavanger girl with a giid heart(tohugh she was gonna leave BB8 behind AFTER saving him) the nas the plot progresses she comes out as annoyingly PERFECT? There's no inner turmoil,no adversity,no power struggle and no really great trials or effort on her part to accomplish things.She picks up things way too quickly and it lacks the sense of someone even trying for example… How doesn't she know how to work ships when she's only been salvaging Star Destroyer parts? How can anyone remember that scene where she force mind controls a stormtrooper to basically do everything except bend over and take her lightsaber up the arse. Her lack of experience or rather suspiciously too much of it. Kylo Ren was a flawed character but at least you could tell he HAD training in how to use his powers and lightsaber — you don't put a toddler in charge of an Empire do you?TFA relies heavily on random ass coincidences to propel its plot more than any other star wars film, even including TLJ. And it is certainly derivative and lays a shaky foundation for the new trilogy in some ways. But on the whole, it created massive potential for TLJ and the sequel trilogy to go in a new and interesting direction. TFA is a good film to enjoy but as part of a franchise the worst new addition. I feared the franchise might be heading in the wrong direction. Boy was I right.",0
2075,"The best in the new trilogy, it sets up alot of good characters sadly the next two installments didn't carry it through.",1
2076,"This movie is phenomenal! It feels like classic Star Wars, but with new characters and new settings. The reason why this movie has gotten so much praise from both critics and fans is because it’s a great movie. There really aren’t many people who dislike this movie for good reasons. Most of the hate this movie gets is from conformists who like to trash popular things just to look “cool”.There is also a subsection of anti-SJWs who feel they can’t like this movie because they see it as “feminist propaganda”. Look, I’m very anti-SJW, and I think modern feminism is a joke. However, there is no SJW or feminist agenda in The Force Awakens. Just because a movie has a female lead doesn’t mean it’s “woke”. Calm down, anti-SJWs! You make us all look bad!As for the people who dislike the movie because you think it’s derivative, that’s fine. That is a valid criticism. Even I acknowledge the fact that there are a few similarities between this movie and A New Hope. It doesn’t bother me, though; I personally see it as paying homage to the original trilogy, and I really don’t think the two movies are all THAT similar. There’s nothing wrong with disliking a movie because you find it flawed. But disliking a movie just because it’s trendy to hate it or because it has a female lead is just stupid.",1
2077,"The movie is everything wrong with Disney owning Star Wars. J.J Abrams preys on nostalgia to sway the opinion of audiences. This is shown by Rey’s costume being resemblant to Luke’s, Kylo Ren’s costume looking like Darth Vader’s costume, Fin wanting to run away from the danger just like Han Solo in “A New Hope”, the crew having their own droid to follow them around just like R2D2, the existence of a planet-destroying space station, and The first order stormtroopers look like the empire’s stormtroopers. The movie doesn’t do much original and it leaches on its past success without adding anything new. The film also presents our beloved heroes from the originals’ efforts as a failure in an attempt to milk Star Wars dry. This film is enjoyable but for all the wrong reasons",0
2078,"The Force Awakens is about as original as Jurassic World. The characters, worlds, and plot are ripoffs of the original Star Wars. The only difference is that the writing is worse. Whereas in A New Hope Han talks down to Luke (""Who's gonna fly it, kid? You?""), in The Force Awakens Rey one-ups Han at fixing his own ship. Rey speaks every language, uses the Force without training, and wins a duel the first time she picks up a lightsaber. She lacks any weaknesses or character growth.",0
2080,"The movie opens and we immediately have a rather serious problem, in that the first order make rather little sense as a faction in this universe. Thirty years ago in the universe, the second death star was destroyed, the imperial fleet was shattered, and all of the empire's leadership was killed. The entire galaxy rejoices, and the resistance goes on to form a new republic. Except that that's not actually what happened. The first order is arguably stronger than the empire ever was. They have an army, a fleet, and a planet-sized death star that can destroy a star system with a single shot. On the other hand, Luke has seemingly trained zero jedi, the republic, if it even exists (we aren't told this) are very weak, to the point where they allow the first order to kidnap children en masse to swell their ranks, with impunity. Leia is commanding a very underpowered ""resistance"" instead of serving as a senator, or chancellor, or general of the republic military. The point is that after their triumph in episode VI, this movie wants us to believe that it was just a minor setback to the bad guys and that the good guys have done exactly nothing since then. Here we see how the general nostalgia-bait in the sequel trilogy comes around to hamper it, as continuity is completely thrown out the window.Kylo Ren is great in his first moments. Stopping the blaster bolt from Poe with the force was undoubtedly impressive. Then he bungles his interrogation of the old man, makes poor decisions that allow the good guys to escape with the very thing that he wants more than anything, assaults a messenger for telling him something he didn't want to hear when he was the one who allowed it to come to pass and takes his anger out on a computer console like a child. For what is supposed to be our new Vader, he comes nowhere close.Rey has proven to be a controversial figure and for good reason. In this movie she can speak wookiee despite never having met one, perfectly fly the Millenium Falcon through the skeleton of a Star Destroyer despite never having flown it before, and can beat an experienced force user in lightsaber combat the first time she uses it. It is an established fact in Star Wars that you have to learn how to wield a lightsaber before using it because you are much more likely to kill yourself with it rather than do anything to your enemy. Finn is guilty of this too, but at least he loses his fight with Kylo. Rey is a character with powers and skills she hasn't earned and are unexplained. The rules of the Star Wars universe and the plot of the sequel bend to orbit around her and this does, in fact, make her a ""Mary Sue"", which is a term you have no doubt heard. No, it is not sexist. I am not a fragile white man, in fact I am none of those things, I am someone deeply passionate about storytelling and movies. Rey is here to push a political agenda and as someone who already aligns with that agenda for the most part, I'm not a fan. She is poorly written, uninteresting and what could amount to decent conflicts are squandered.Finn is interesting, but woefully mishandled. It is legitimately an interesting concept to present what amounts to the epitome of a faceless henchman actually being a real, complex person. But 5 minutes later he's happily mowing down his fellow child soldiers in a TIE fighter and unfortunately doesn't get too many impactful character moments after that. Still, John Boyega's performance was one of the positive aspects of this film.To round off the review, some more things I liked. The film was very visually impressive. The action kept me engaged even if the plot couldn't. Han Solo is always a win in my book.",0
2083,New and interesting characters portrayed by the talented and diverse cast bring fresh humor and energy with the outstanding visual beauty that the effects bring to the action are able to overcome the film's frustratingly derivative plot that lacks something to be desired.
