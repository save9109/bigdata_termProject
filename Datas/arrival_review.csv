0,"Just like Villeneuve's other films, this one has proved that he is one of the greatest director nowadays. The way that he approaches a common theme in movies is almost revolutionary.",1
1,"An 'alien' film to leave you totally alienated! This is so self-important and ponderously dull that it makes Ingmar Bergman's depressive dramas seem like comic farces. The screenplay is all **** and pretension in which Amy Adams' language specialist amazingly deciphers the black ink vocabulary of the extra-terrestrials in record breaking time. A feat that only ever happens in the movies. The creatures themselves look like a cross between giant squids and an elephant's foot, and it's no exaggeration to state that their presence is underwhelming. The first ten minutes promise much but we never get that film. Instead as soon as the alien pods arrive degeneration in to boredom is immediate and sleep inducingly effective. Praised by the highbrow critics, make no mistake this is alarmingly over rated. A totally confused and uninteresting example of the sci-fi genre. Arrive? It certainly did. However, I couldn't wait to leave!",0
4,"Nothing here that hasn't been done a thousand times. Simple time loop paradox. If you're looking for a movie about aliens, this is not it. It really has nothing to do at all with aliens. It's a weak tug at heart strings depicting a story about a parent that loses a child. The chemistry between the two main actors is non existent. Just a terrible waste of 2 hours.",0
6,"boooooring. As a big fan of Sicario and Prisoners i expected better. paint dries more entertainingky than this. like watching a kid draw with an etch a sketch for 2 hours. Even Forrest Whitaker sucked. Jeremy Renner often sucks, no surprise there. it felt like they were afraid to wake up the audience.",0
7,"The movie preview showed aircraft flying overhead.  This was the only action in the entire movie.  A low budget, slow, out of focus movie.  Watching paint dry has more action.  A rare film that wanted to make me demand my money back.",0
8,"This was on my must see movie list.  The movie starts out very slow, then gets slower until finally I started to doze off. The movie makes absolutely no sense. There's no suspense or any action. Other than Amy Adams performance the rest of the cast is nothing as they mailed their parts in. The ending is beyond ridiculous. Avoid unless you have insomnia. You've been warned.",0
9,"Arrival is being called one of the best Science Fiction films in years. It is one of the best rated and reviewed films of 2016, and is drawing comparisons to Close Encounters of The Third Kind, but I have a question, did they watch the same film that I did? I wasn't crazy about Close Encounters, but that movie was leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Twelve alien crafts land in random places all across the planet, and the people are in a panic. Some countries react with hostility, but the U.S. Government decides to act cautiously (yeah right), and send Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the best linguist they have, to figure out a way to community with the aliens. The aliens, turn out to be giant octopus, whose language turns out to be ink that they squirt into the air. This movie features flashbacks and flash-forwards, that seemingly make no sense, until the end when you finally figure out what they mean and once you do, you realize that you just wasted two hours of your life. If that wasn't bad enough, the film moves at an absolute snails pace, I mean you could take everything that actually happened in the film and squeeze it into about twenty minutes. The rest is just people talking to each other about the same damn thing over and over again. Trying to figure out the same thing over and over again. Worrying about the same things over and over again. The characters have no personality whatsoever, and you might think that it's one of those slow moving weird films that all comes together in an amazing ending, but no, it doesn't. Once you can see the whole picture, as one lady in the theater so eloquently shouted out, ""really, that's it, that was so stupid."" Her uncontrolled outburst really sums up this entire film. Honestly I think the slower and more artistic a film is, the more the critics love it, but I am one critic who isn't fooled by great actors and emotional music, this isn't the best film of the year, this is the biggest turd of the year, and it should be avoided at all costs!",0
10,"Viewer be warned.  Preview contains all the ""excitement"" of this supposedly ""clever"" sci-fi movie (very sad).  Actually, this has been grossly overhyped by professional film critics.  I would like to have my money back if possible.  Dark, slow, incoherent plot that challenge you to stay awake.  Tried my very hardest to enjoy this movie, but failed to do so.  One film critic graciously rated this as: wait until it comes out in DVD.  My vote: skip this movie and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.  In summary, I feel scammed by the professional film critics, similar to the many fake reviews on Amazon.",0
11,"Phenomenal movie. I wouldn't have watched this movie if I hadnt known about the intriguing ending (yes I was spoiled but I don't mind). I've never been a fan of Amy Adams in Superman or Jeremy Renner in Marvel but the story, delivery and slow pacing really punches this movie high. I wasn't disappointed at all. It has never a dull moment and there are many parts I can rewatch many times just to think about how they unfold. Lots of small details to look out for too like Abbot's actions before something happens. This movie is right up there with District 9, Contact, The Martian and Interstellar.",1
12,"There are generally two different types of ""good"" sci-fi in my book: Straight forward that uses the film's setting to its advantage (Aliens, Terminator 2), and cerebral which makes the viewer think about new ideas and old ones in new ways. Arrival falls into the latter.It's a little slow for multiple viewings, but it poses an interesting idea and a mystery that you'll be as eager to figure out as the characters.",1
13,"This movie is not for everyone. If you wanted a science fiction action blockbuster then you will be disappointed. However it is one of the most brilliant plots in scifi. I won’t spoil the details but once you understand the twist it’s just magnificent. It is a movie worth to discuss with friends and very memorable because it does something completely different. The ideas for follow up stories are basically endless. It is based on the book “The story of her life” if I am correct. Also all actors were the right choices for their respected rolls. I think this will be a forgotten masterpiece because it is not mainstream enough. Sorry for not going in in details, but it will ruin the movie. Think about the twist in “The sixth sense”. If someone spoiled it for you the movie would be less good (or a lesser experience?).",1
14,"I don't think this movie is about that ""what makes us human"". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (""For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned""). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully.",1
15,"Perhaps perfect in its writing and direction and utterly dissimilar to any of its alien-themed predecessors. Arrival is smart, but slow and wholly touching and exciting so.",1
16,I finally got around to seeing this one and I am so glad I did!  An interesting premise and cerebral plot more focused on language and geopolitical relations than the aliens themselves.  The movie also respects the science that it dives into and doesn't use it as a simple plot contrivance like many action sci-fi movies do.  I was left with a feeling of hope and intrigue after finishing it.,1
17,"Arrival is one of my favorite Sci Fi movies of all time.The movie doesn't need flashy action sequences or superficial Drama to deliver a thoughtful and emotional experience.Even the ""plot twist"" if you may call it that is in clear service of the story and not just a plot twist for the sake of it.Arrival manages to connect with me every time I watch it. I think this is some of the best that Sci Fi has to offer.",1
18,"Arrival is a sci-fi film only in presentation, as the film explores deeper themes of human communication and aggressiveness. While Arrival’s initial presentation may seem jarring and somewhat flawed, as the movie progresses and the twist is revealed, the editing choices and the pseudo-confusing sequencing end up contributing to the movie's meaning as a larger whole. Arrival explores various linguistic and psychological theories and takes them to an extreme, even using them as the crux for its storytelling. While it does benefit the viewer to be familiar with psychological concepts, especially linguistic determinism, the film does a good job explaining the fundamental concepts the story is based upon. Arrival is not only a cautionary tale but also a hopeful one. Arrival purports that through cooperation and coordination, i.e. through avoiding competition, a future which benefits more to a greater degree can be achieved. In this way, Arrival is a greatly anti-capitalist film presented in a widely digestible way. Villeneuve is a highly-skilled director, and, with Arrival, he shows that he can blend genres and excel while doing it.",1
19,"The best thriller/sci-fi film I have ever seen in my life. The work behind the camera by Denis Villeneuve is majestic. The concept behind the origin and the meaning of the ""aliens"" is absolutely original in every shape. The work made by Joe Walker in the sound editing with the beautiful shots made by Brandon Young gave that little touch to the film to make it feel smoother.",1
20,"Really amazing movie with great visuals,the characters in the movie were described beautifully and intelligently.Arrival in my opinion did everything right what other alien invasion movie ruins,it is a perfect response to bad movies",1
21,"After seeing Arrival, I understand my dog better. So for all owners of a young dog, the movie is quite worth your while ;)Okay, this is a strange intro to my review but fits. The film is all about communications and different senses. And its execution is great.The movie is a very intelligent one that sells its seemingly impossible message quite plausibly. It's also a slow and quite movie. Those craving for lots of actions and explosions maybe should elsewhere.And miss out on an impressive experience, of course.",1
22,This movie was so dull that I’d watch Barney Reruns while eating whatever I can find in the garbage bin rather than sit through all two hours of this severely underwhelming story again.,0
23,"Dialectics, metaphysics and anthropology are sciences that are structured by a simple and complex tool: language. And that's what the pelucla is about, to build, through communicative language, space, mind, time and the elements that surround us. All with a loose but useful anti-war discourse. A wonderful movie from start to finish.",1
24,"I will put this movie one of the best Sci-Fi movies, same level with Interstellar. The eerie atmosphere and mystery kept me the edge of my seat. Also the scenes of the movie is beautiful and gorgeous and so is the soundtrack. Amy Adams? She nailed it.",1
25,"What humanity needs is to strive for a common goal. I love science fiction because it can paint somewhat realistic scenarios like ARRIVAL, in which our planet is saved by extraterrestrial intervention. But more real than our first alien contact is the way ARRIVAL depicts a planet divided by invisible borders and nations unwilling to cooperate. God I love this movie.",1
26,"Arrival is a beautifully complex film that centres on the role of humanity in this world rather than the ""arrivals"". With this, the movie brings a new look to the sci-fi genre, as it deals with themes and emotions that many can relate to in the modern world. Arrival proves to be one-of-a-kind and one of the best in the genre, not just for pure action or the cliches we tend to see in such movies, but for its creativity and thought-provoking ideas it presents to the viewer. It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself. Crafted with great cinematography and moving music, this was a deserved Oscar-nominated film, and truly one for the ages.",1
29,"Arrival is intelligent, dramatic, scary and heartfelt from beginning to end. The main character's quest to understand the mystery behind the alien's purpose is extremely engaging. With each twist and turn the film kept me begging to know more.",1
30,"wow.  record breaking boring for an alien movie.  disappointing from top to bottom.  almost unwatchable.  pretentious, slow, dry.  i seriously thought of asking for my money back on the way out.  sheesh.",0
31,Ultimately a boring yarn that resolves on a 'twist' that a presumed flashback is actually a flash forward.Dull and ambiguous but lacking in mystery. Flawed.,0
33,"It's a good movie, but not quite as good as the critics are painting it. The film tries to tie in two big concepts, one about communication, and another about time. In the end those concepts get somewhat muddled and open a number of plot holes that were obvious even on a first viewing, and would be positively glaring on repeat viewings. The atmosphere is great and the acting is spot on, but the film is a bit hampered by a script and plot that starts off strong and then begins to droop towards the end.",1
34,"Arrival is an excellent offer by sci-fi director Denis Villeneuve, and I think he is going to be our generation's great sci-fi director. A beautiful script that makes this alien visit so personal and yet so grand at the same time, Arrival plays like a parable about communication and the human condition. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner give GREAT performances, and Villeneuve's shots are nothing sort of beautiful. People who are not science fiction fans might have difficulty getting into Arrival fully, but once you're in, YOURE IN!",1
35,"I love sci-fi. From Star Wars to 2001 (my all time fav), Alien, although not so much Aliens, The Abyss, 12 Monkeys, Blade Runner, The Thing, and Gattaca to name but a few, and just to show the range that appeals to me, a sci-fi lover.So far I have read reviews stating Arrival is about big ideas, it's a character study, it's sci-fi for the mind, thought provoking, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Well, that last part was true. I was on the edge of my seat all through the movie, but only because the remote was just out of reach. The rest? Well, I'd like to know what the **** you people were smoking to get anything out of this bilge. I have never, in my life, watched such garbage. A film about nothing. And I got it. I understood it. I know what happened, and why. I just couldn't give a flying ****, about any of them. A pretentious movie, with pretentious Aliens, where nothing happens.What the **** is happening to people?",0
36,"Unlike other sci-fi extra-terrestrial first contact films, Arrival is much slower paced. It focuses on contemplation, thought rather than action. That is not a bad thing, and in fact bodes well for the tone. It manages to be both suspenseful and intriguing, though it has the potential to expect more from its audience. I see many similarities between Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan; both of whom create visually striking scenes with a deep story to back it up.",1
39,Such a complex beautiful creation perfect delivered by a rising talent that's Dennis. With Jeremy and Amy's consistent performance make this a 2016 best film contender. Enjoy.,1
40,"quite interesting movie, I like it very much because it is ""alien"" movie but it focuses more on how we communicate with them, not shoot them.",1
41,"Alors, lapin compris ? je fais comme dans le film, je parle un double langage qui tente de noyer le poisson sous des allures intello-pédantes bien prétentieuses et quelques relents de naïveté bien naïfs ; je secoue le tout au shaker et je balance à l'écran très lentement sous couvert de poésie moralisatrice.Alors, Amy et Jeremy sont très bien, là n'est pas la question et les effets spéciaux sont judicieusement exploités ; par ailleurs la musique planante qui vous plonge dans une sorte de transe hypnagogique est très relaxante (je crois en fait que le film entier a transformé le peu de matière grise qui me restait en gelée). Mais tout de même, ces extra-terrestres qui ont l'air si avancé sont en vérité tellement cons qu'il faut tout reprendre à partir du cours préparatoire : ""té-lé-phone... mai-son..."" et bien sûr, ils sont un peu neuneus et durs de la feuille, voire carrément gagas : gentil extra-terrestre, gentil, gentil... ah mais attention aux méchants humains roooo... Denis Villeneuve nous déroule donc sa petite fable écolo béate à deux balles sous Lexomil pendant deux plombes mais nous, on veut sortir de cette mélasse !!PSLapin compris ou pas ??",0
42,"We must ask ourselves before asking to aliens,: ""What is our purpose on Earth?""",1
43,"Excellent movie, was a bit strange certainly liked it better on the second viewing. worth it if you have the time to pay it full attention.",1
44,"What initially seems like a sci-fi film about an alien takeover is really the starting point to explore deep themes of unification, connection, and the unique emotional experiences that bridges us as humans beings which transcend time and space. A beautiful, moving, and complex exploration of nearly spiritual themes of the human experience. The aliens are really just a way in but it's less about them and more about us. Great movie. Loved it!",1
48,"Took nearly 90 minutes to figure out what this movie was really about. I will never get that time back. This is a love story and about time, with aliens.I will never get nearly 2 hour of my life back.",0
50,"Let's face it, a story like this hasn't crossed the paths of viewers only once before, right? I thoroughly enjoyed the actors in this production. Kudos for the CGI (thank goodness there was a lot of grays available). Question me this: Why did her hands shake? What was said to make her husband leave? How could she figure out what was being said? Was it ""flash back"" or flash forward"" or ""flash sideways""? Why was Costello dying? Why did the story take the audience through the back door (again) to find us at the beginning? Did this happen? Was it going to happen? Did one of the last lines allow us to think that maybe the end results that have been seen will be changed? As for the production: Why were the interiors so dark? To save money. Go NFN whenever possible, right? There are several more questions to ask, but I do not want to actually ask direct questions that no one will answer of this movie. I do not know what movie the other people who commented were watching on this site (and a few others), but the one we just watched is far from being “Oscar” material as one person mentioned. The idea of the visitor… Well, I suppose it was an easy way to “communicate” to the persons portrayed, but come on,really? Did the writers answer any questions? No. There is a whole lot more, but I can easily state (and without reserve), I would rather have watched “Gravity” again. I mean no disrespect to the actors. It should have started and finished. The script was created –middle – “present” – middle – “present”. The comments of those few people who saw the movie today were walking out saying “huh”? There was a chance at the first few scenes to make this a gripping idea. Then...well, we were all inked!",0
51,"I don't get all the praise heaped on this movie. Maybe if I knew more of what to expect going in, because I expected sci fi/thriller type along the lines of Prometheus and Interstellar. While this movie starts out very promising with a lot of intrigue about the alien visitors, it soon drags, devolving into a commentary on human existence that really isn't emotionally moving or anything. There is a twist to the movie that was mildly interesting but seemed very copy cat of Interstellar, and then it ended very abruptly. I hated the ending. Basically there was no explanation of the reasoning behind anything and you are left hanging. It's just supposed to make you appreciate your humanity and question your life choices I guess.The one positive though is the acting throughout is superb. Even the dialogue is fine, just the pacing and ending are awful.",0
52,"I'm sorry I don't know how this movie got such good reviews. It was dumb dumb dumb and boring. I would describe it as a chick-flick sci-fi movie. Don't bother seeing it and these high reviews are way off. Must be the ""different"" effect. Different does not = good.",0
53,"“Arrival” stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker in this sci-fi drama written by  Eric Heisserer based on a novel by Ted Chiang (“The Story of Your Life”). The film was directed by Denis Villanueve who, together with the writer and the editor, if there was one, must take full responsibility for the 2 hours I wasted watching their product. The movie is slow, confusing and complicated and the scenes float back in time and place without ever clearly indicating what was intended by its creative team. Ms. Adams can do no wrong for she is a talented actor but somehow she got placed in this amateurish attempt at a modern day “ET”. The film is not only a disservice to Ms. Adams’ talent but to the audience that must suffer through the picture  as well. I must have looked at my watch at least 5X during the course of the film and, in so doing,  found the hands on my timepiece more interesting that that which was being projected on to the screen. What amazes me most is that so many professional critics found this movie to be worthy of their highest rating, again proving that being paid for an opinion doesn’t mean it has value. I give this film a 1.0 rating and if I hadn’t been in the company of my wife and friends, I would have walked out of the theater mid way through it. The only recommendation I can make about this film is to respectfully suggest to Ms. Adams that she  hire a new talent agent..",0
55,"I've never seen a movie so tedious and suspenseful at the same time with such a letdown in the end. Although the acting was superb, unless you like art for art's sake, don't bother with this one. The critics really got this one wrong. It won't answer most of the questions you'll come up with while watching it, including the one that makes the whole story unnecessary: just learn their language the same way your children learn English. Duh!",0
56,"I attended this movie with a friend and we were looking forward to seeing it.  When it was over we both looked at each other and asked 'what was that movie about ?  The flashbacks to her child and the confusion of future and past events made us spend more time trying to figure the scripts meaning.  We could not understand the complexity of the movie and what turned the evening into a chaotic movie was truly disappointing and hours later we were still trying to figure it out.  If it could have been less entangled with the past, present and future it would have been wonderful.  It was a waste of hard earned money.",0
57,"It’s the end of the world as we know it! A much discussed and sometimes feared story has come true which, honestly, always sounded a bit ridiculous to actually happen in the real world.I am, of course, talking about this new sci-fi drama „Arrival“ where mankind is greeted by huge alien spaceships in the sky who seem to be coming in peace… wait, did you think I was referring to Trump becoming the next leader of the free world?But yeah, these two events have a very similar plot summary so it’s only fitting that I had the chance to experience them in the very same morning.Directed by Denis Villeneuve – the man behind „Prisoners“, mindbending „Enemy“ with Jake Gyllenhaal, „Sicario“ and currently filming „Blade Runner“ sequel –, one could expect „Arrival“ to be a thinking person’s sci-fi. And one is not wrong.It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills. If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan’s „Interstellar“ crossed with Terrence Malick’s „The Tree of Life“. Robert Zemeckis’s „Contact“ (1997) would not be very far either, because „Arrival“ also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste.I haven’t read the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang that „Arrival“ is based on. Wikipedia says that the major themes explored are determinism, language and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which sounds mighty dry and mostly sci-fi geek friendly. So it’s nice to witness movie makers adding some mainstream appeal which comes mostly in the form of Amy Adams’s great performance. She truly holds the movie together as a woman going where no-one has ever gone before. You will believe her hesitations, the tears, and also the silent determination when the going gets tough. This kind of role is tricky because of the need to play it out mostly alone, often in close-up where every detail and tone has to be clearly seen and felt. Think Matthew McConaughey's mighty turn in „Interstellar“ but decidedly less showoffish.So it’s mostly Adams’s one-woman-show, and a quite rare chance to see her doing something memorable and worthwhile on screen. She accepts too many decorative pretty girl roles, even in more ambitious projects. The all-male supporting cast is good too, especially star players such as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. As stated above, I don’t know the original story but ""Arrival's"" message is rather spiritual and not ""dry"" at all. Essentially it is a reminder that mankind’s future depends heavily on our ability to understand and connect to the world, rather than attacking and overpowering everything we find foreign or downright alien. It’s a call to rise above the inflexible ego-based mind the western society so dearly values, and to find balance with our intuitive side.Overall, „Arrival“ is a good movie although I wasn’t especially happy with the final act which seemed rushed. It felt like somebody grew impatient near the end and wanted to add something „impressive“ just in case the people were not happy with this slow-moving tale. I do not want to talk about it here in detail but, for me, it lessened some of the movie’s overall impact. Mostly because there was not enough time to play it out as properly as the stuff that had come before.But yeah, if you are into more intelligent sci-fi and don’t prioritize explosions, „Arrival“ is good to go.",1
58,"Dealing with heady ideas on an intimate scale, Dennis Villenueve's Arrival is an emotionally rewarding, intelligent, beautifully acted and gripping sci-fi film that isn't afraid to dispose of the generic conventions of a modern blockbuster in favour of a more slow-burning, cerebral take on the arrival of aliens.",1
59,"I went to see “Arrival” sort of reluctantly because I am not into sci-fi movies with aliens coming to take the world over and a war ensues between the good guys (us) and the Bad (the aliens) and we always win. It was a choice of seeing this movie or “Rules Don’t Apply” and I am not a fan of Warren Beatty’s and I understand it is really a flop so I decided on “Arrival”.The main reasons I was interested in seeing “Arrival” was because I am becoming a big fan of Amy Adams and on YouTube I saw a video titled “Arrival Ending Explained” which intrigued me though I didn’t watch it until after I saw the movie.The first hour of the movie was like watching a foreign language film without subtitles and didn’t hold me interest at all. The second hour with the 12 egg-shaped UFOs all over the world set up the standard them versus us but that isn’t where it goes.Amy Adams is Dr. Louise Banks, is a language expert, who had a daughter who died at the age of 12, and is called on to help make contact with the aliens who are named Abbot & Costello by the theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner, who brings the  very rare humor in the movie. They work together in ways not exactly up to what Colonel Weber, (Forest Whitaker) and a CIA agent played by Michael Stuhlbarg want from them.The film revolves around Adams and Renner with little time for the other actors except for an important cameo by Tzi Ma who plays the Chinese leader though it is Adams who holds your attention every time she is on screen which is through the whole film.The film is not about them versus us but about time and how it can be looked at in different ways. We see many scenes with the mother and daughter from birth until her death 12 years later and by the ending these scenes all are looked at in a way that we weren’t aware while watching them.The ending is done subtly by the director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer instead of hammering the audience over the head but I really wished I had watched that YouTube video before I saw the film.Adams performance is constrained, as it should be, where it could have been melodramatic. When it comes to her what it all is about she calmly accepts and understands what is happening and what happened. Renner is very strong support for her performance.This is not an ‘entertaining’ film in the sense you can sit back, munch on your popcorn and enjoy aliens invading earth but to which you have to think.“Arrival” for the most part is a boring film except for the last 15 minutes and I didn’t think the time invested was really worth the first 101 minutes and time is what the film is all about.",0
60,"Look, if you want the Hollywood version with explosions and shooting watch Edge of Tomorrow, which is actually a good movie also. Arrival is an intelligent and beautiful movie, simultaneously a story about the meaning of communication and a meditation on the value of life and choice. Like all great film you're not the same after seeing it as before. More prosaic and lacking the epic sweep of 2001 (the greatest film ever), reminiscent but more accessible. I've now seen Sicarios and Arrival and I'm sold on Villeneuve - I'm interested in anything he makes now.  I have to laugh that the one negative review is from Trump's son-in-law's paper. Imagine a super advanced alien species arriving on Earth and Trump representing us!",1
61,"Arrival offers a vastly different experience than you usually get in the alien invasion genre. By replacing explosions and action with captivating dialogue and conversations, it gives us arguably the most intriguing film of 2016.",1
62,I continue to think about this movie days after viewing it. Its themes resonated with me and I found it to be thought very provoking as well as very engaging.,1
63,"Typical dead child of cancer (hollywood typical **** the movie tries that you feel sad about the child but you don't get to know her so you don't care, nothing happens in the movie, boring. I want my money and time back.",0

71,"A breathtaking film. Fantastic acting, brilliant story. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. One of the most impressive films I have seen in a while now. A must see! All the low reviewers clearly don't know a good movie if it slapped them in the face. Watch it now!",1
72,"Gotta say this is some brilliant work! I started watching thinking one thing and finished the movie in another state of mind, Amy Adams was breathtaking, the end with such an unexpected twist and still beautiful... they changed the ""sic-fi"" of an alien invasion and did something new, where there not so much sic-fi as you would expect from an alien invasion movie",1
73,"Excellent movie! The jumps in time seem to make it somewhat hard to follow for some, if I can go by reactions I heard from people in the theater. It's a lot better than I expected going in. It' probably the best take on really different aliens I've ever seen. Heptapods, never heard that before. The space ships, the influencing of time, it's different all right. I understand some people being quite confused at the end of it all, but this is just not your generic X-files aliens movie. It's a movie really worth seeing, but you have to keep paying attention to the time jumps, which turn out to be flash-forwards instead of flashbacks, or you're going to be left quite bewildered at the end. If you're looking for something like Independence Day, then you're not going to get what you want. You have been warned.",1
74,"Amy Adams and JR gave good if not great performances, but beyond that there's nothing here to keep a serious sci-fi fan interested.  As others have said, it's slow, boring, and intellectually uninteresting.Ask yourself how a race from the present or future that is capable of time/interstellar travel can't figure out a few basic languages before they get here?  And the needless gravity manipulation?  Why not rotate the ship and use a ramp? More goofy parlor tricks to keep the FX folks busy.  The time travel wrinkle was just a way to get out of multiple plot dead-ends.Villeneuve's oooh, ahhh direction is just ridiculous stalling when a better script was necessary.",0
75,"This is the BEST realistic what happened if movie, if aliens visited earth. I wished there was alittle more story while I was watching the movie. It did feel alittle boring and dragged on.",1
76,I thought the beginning half of the movie was fairly good and I was interested in the story. The ending was so bad it actually made me angry and I yelled at my TV.,0
78,"Arrival is a beautifully enthralling sci-fi thriller, which masterfully balances an actually intelligent 'alien invasion' story with heart-wrenching emotion. Amy Adams is sensational.",1
79,What a moving film. A first contact movie that makes you think rather than just relying on the latest CGI effects. They enhance rather than carry the movie.Amy Adams is perfect as the interpreter. All her emotions are there to see.If movie length CGI battles are your thing then this probably isn't the movie for you.It's how I would imagine First contact would be like.,1
80,"Arrival portrayed a whole new approach to a subject seen many times in sci-fi, first contact with extraterrestrial life forms. It is beautiful because not everything leads to war and practically all the answers are with a language expert. The film is based on Ted Chiang’s short tale Story of your Life; the director and screenwriters succeeded taking this great story, but developing a mild yet interesting plot, by adding the pressure of an imminent war (the book is a bit slow and hard to follow without that); deciding to represent the Heptapod’s spaceships like a semicircular shape and the language in a circular form (much more clear that the book). Another great choice was addressing the main conflict from multiple points of view, but keeping doctor Banks in the spotlight, with her own conflicts and the way she embraces this new communication style. One big problem was the way in which it is revealed the gift that learning the language gives, both in book and film are forcibly explicit. So here we face a reflection about clash of different forms of consciousness and the paradox that arises when incorporating free will to the equation. The construction sequence of the movie is very coherent to the developed theme, and it is understandable when the gift is acknowledged. Here Amy Adams consecrates herself within the great actresses of cinema; the rest of the cast is pretty good too. Strong direction, bold script and unsettling score of Johann Johannsson. One of the finest films of the year.",1
81,"I was nearly in tears by the end. For those who say this is what Interstellar wished it could be, you're right. A beautiful, complex story. Amy Adams is fantastic.",1
84,"The visuals and acting are great. And the initial interactions with the aliens were fascinating. Unfortunately, emotional flashbacks (forwards), which make little sense, are becoming a bit of a cliche for humanizing these kinds of movies. I wish these directors could accept that the geeky aspects are enough to sustain a kick-ass sci-fi movie (if done well). What next: faster-than-light travel powered by a mother's love for her child?",0
85,"Great atmosphere, nice actor playing but script is totally screwed. All characters looks like decoration for one main character and at some dramatic moment people just start laughing.",0
86,"Arrival's deliberately slow pacing may serve as a turnoff for some; but it's incredible bits of tension and terrific performances provide an interesting look into a complex world of grief, love, and wonder.",1
89,"Arrival is a solid project that benefits not only from some great directing, but also from a strong plot that comes to genius conclusions, a strong performance from Amy Adams, and an undeniably outstanding score that will absolutely leave you in tears. I wouldn't be surprised if it was nominated for a lot of Oscars.",1
91,"Meh. No doubt adapting this material to the screen was challenging but the director's self-love really sucked the juice outta this. The too visually dark settings & blah blocking of action made it less than a pleasure to watch.This could have been a sweeping, magical visual treat but it just seemed to lack imagination. The score was often trite & overwhelming & the schmaltzy ending seemed to go on forever. Interesting story, but it could have been told with more humor, energy, tension, etc.",0
92,"I was really looking forward to this movie for a long while. Unfortunately I left the theater with much disappointment. The movie had me going for about 1/2 way or little more, then I started figuring out some things, and really didn't care for how they ended the movie.... weak. The movie could have went so many different ways and could and should have been awesome.  As it was... turned out to be a slow, anticlimactic, prophetic love story of sorts, that ends up saving the world with a phone call.",0
93,Sci-fi once again shows it's hope for humanity. Excellent film that left me with plenty to think about. Don't expect laser blasting space battles; it's a movie about us humans and our ability to progress as a species.,1
94,"Don’t waste your time with this unnecessarily protracted pseudo-science-fiction drama about first-contact with aliens.  Instead, see 1977’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” or even better the classic 1951 original, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""",0
96,"a must see experience with a touur de force performance by the incredible Amy Adams ,a showcase of technical brilliance and the most cinematography of the year.what the movie lacks in action scenes and thriller sequences is made up through the breathtaking plot twist at the end of the movie which will stay with you and follow you for days after watching Arrival, the best movie of 2016 by far !!!",1
97,Very disappointing film.  I found that it was boring with no suspense.  I didn't care about characters or the aliens. It was not believable that Amy could not recognize that the symbol that the aliens were using was the same as  symbol on the book she had written.,0
98,"Arrival es la nueva película del aclamado director Denis Villeneuve (Conocido por películas tan interesantes como Enemy, Prisioners o Sicario) y pelea con grandes argumentos por alguno los puestos más altos en el género de la ciencia ficción.Críticos como Roger Ebert han hablado mucho sobre el rumbo que están tomando las películas de terror con ejemplos como “Babadook” o “It follows”, donde se rechaza el modelo del “jumpscare” (subidas de música e imágenes impactantes) por un estudio de personajes y el tratamiento de temas más profundos como la depresión o la angustia existencial. La cinta de Villeneuve así como Interestelar de Nolan o Prometheus de Ridley Scott son un ejemplo de este mismo modelo aplicado a la ciencia ficción. Arrival o La Llegada (como ha sido denominada en países de habla latina) es una película que rechaza el modelo de invasión alienígena de acción y decide realizar un estudio del personaje de Louise, una experta lingüista que obtiene la oportunidad de intentar mantener una conversación con los “visitantes”. Y esto lo realiza dando respuesta a preguntas realmente interesantes como ¿De que modo nos enfrentamos a aquello que nos aterra?Es difícil hablar de Arrival sin correr el riesgo de revelar parte de la trama pero si podemos definir aquello de lo que trata esta película es probablemente la comunicación. La cinta nos recuerda la importancia desmedida de esta capacidad y explota este hecho tan aparentemente sencillo de un modo realmente inteligente.  En el reparto encontramos probablemente uno de los puntos más destacables de la película junto al guión, y esto es sin duda la actuación de Amy Adams como Louise. Se trata de una actuación que esta recibiendo muchos rumores de Oscar a mejor actriz principal y no son infundados ya que de algún modo toda la película carga sobre los hombros de la actuación de Amy Adams y en lugar de flaquear consigue hacer, si cabe, aún más destacables algunos de los puntos más interesantes de Arrival. Sin embargo en el reparto también hay uno de los puntos más flacos de la película y se trata de la actuación de Jeremy Renner que aunque está principalmente correcto, logra que algunos de los momentos de más importancia de la película parezcan algo cursis y melodramáticos. Da la sensación de que Renner creía estar actuando en una película diferente y con menos aspiraciones.La cinematografía de Villeneuve a manos Bradford Young es sin duda otro de los puntos absolutamente sobresalientes del largo y nos regala planos que quitan el aliento. Del mismo modo que utiliza planos cerrados aportando un sentimiento de opresión y tensión palpables, también utiliza planos amplios con mucho espacio para respirar y empaparse de la imagen en aquellos momentos donde nos revela información imprescindible. Juega muy bien con esta dicotomía que sin duda hace de esta película una pequeña y extraña joya.En definitiva Arrival es una cinta ambiciosa que logra mantener muy bien su tono y sus aspiraciones, y nos cuenta esa historia que hemos oido tantas veces con una perspectiva nueva y fresca que no deja a nadie indiferente. Tiene algunos de los mejores momentos cinematográficos del año y probablemente la mejor actuación de la carrera de Amy Adams desde The Master. Villeneuve se está forjando un nombre en el panorama actual del cine comercial haciendo películas con tintes indies que le hacen uno de los directores más interesantes del momento.",1
99,Excellent! The Arrival is one of the best films of 2016 and is a must see! The film deserves all good reviews and at least one Oscar. The film might get them waterworks going and will help you reflect on your own life.,1
100,"The Arrival is one of the best Alien SI-FI movies to date; with excellent performances, amazing cinematography & smart plot line. Someone give Amy Adams an award! The arrival is a must watch of 2016.",1
102,"A rare type of Spielberg-Nolan style science-fiction drama full of metaphors that is steep in its specific themes told in a sense of realism. The film is an unusual discovery, it starts emotionally, moves in a deliberate pacing, slowly builds up a puzzle of complex paradox and ends up stunningly impactful, amplifying the questions of existential dilemma. It does not need any action sequences, it is all about life, language and unity that bring to the twisted concept of the overall plot development with several hints throughout the entire story, further surprising audiences to view it from different fascinating ways. Amy Adams gains respects for her brilliant performance as a believable thinker and expert communicator while her emotions are handled well in order to engage the entire structure of the film. The theme song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" in both the opening and ending of the movie, as well as scores composed by Johann Johannsson enhance the the atmosphere of the film especially the thrilling suspense of invasions, the horror moments during the contact and the emotional depth on life perception. The arrival of the extra terrestrial amazes viewers on how creatively a science fiction may diverge from its generic aspects and link to life - telling us that life is a journey without destination and to live as if the answer is, even if you have known everything about the future.",1
103,"Well damn.I couldn't stop thinking about this one and may not for awhile. ""Arrival"" is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've seen in this year. Everything about this film was just top notch that I can't put into words without going all over.So let put it like this:Amy Adams was wonderful in this. A very grounded and real performance. Probably her best. Same thing that can said about Jeremy Renner.And how the aliens were part of the story was fascinating and quite clever. Without spoiling anything, they had a unique look to them. Like spiders. Although out the film, you feel their presence. A presence that's both scary and yet remarkable.Denis Villeneuve is my favorite working director. He can release a movie every year and still be close of making a masterpiece. Villeneuve delivers a haunting and heartbreaking story that leaves the audience with a experience that will stay with them. A beautiful, thought-provoking, Sci-Fi film that isn't an action or war movie. And I'm even more excited to see ""Blade Runner 2049"".And how can I forgot the amazing score, astonishing cinematography, intelligent script, and the tearjerker ending that left me in pieces.I honestly can't say anything else. Please do yourself a favour and watch it. For now, I'm dumbfounded.",1
104,"""Arrival"" was an interesting, moving and very intelligent film, the plot was very good, and the exceptional development of Amy Adams was very correct and very passionate, this film is always loaded with emotions.",1
105,"Captivating buildup but the ending is totally disappointing. Horrible, wasted opportunity to entertain - it is a fake sci-fi film packaged as a ridiculous love story.  Avoid wasting time and money on seeing it in the theater like I did, it is worthy perhaps only as a viewing on Netflix.  I feel totally scammed by the professional critic reviews, I really really want a refund and my time back, extremely disappointed. :(",0
106,"Watch this! Watch this!  Watch this!It isn't the best science fiction movie you'll ever watch. But this has gut and heart and soul. This is Denis Villeneuve's best work. And yes, I watched Sicario. But this is.. Watch it.",1
107,"A deep movie, not for those who are looking for special effects of a modern sci-fi genre. This movie is for all the others who want to feel and to immerse into the noble and greater ideals of humanity within the new coming era.",1
108,"All I can say is WOW!I sincerely blew me away. Caught me off guard and got intended reaction to poignant and powerful film. They don't make them like this anymore. Prisoners astonished me, Sicario impressed me and Arrival blew me away.",1
109,"I really, really enjoyed this film, Arrival is a very innovative and smart science fiction film.  This had some great writing, fantastic cinematography, some really good performances and plot twists that will really warrant repeat viewings.  It has been so difficult to talk about this without going into spoilers, but I think this film is coming out at the right time for the right audience and it tells a very interesting story that will resonate with a lot of people.  I would say, for the visual flair alone, this is one film to try and see on a cinema screen since I don’t think it will play as well on a Television screen.  It’s really cool, really interesting and I don’t think there will be another film like it for the rest of the year.  Check this one out.",1
110,This is a brilliant screenplay with wide sweeping breathtaking shots. The more you think about it the better it gets.  Denis Villeneuve is really putting himself as one of the must see directors of our time.  I love this film my current favorite film of 2016.  A,1
111,"ARRIVALTHE REVIEWScience Fiction with a brain. Its not common to have a movie like this anymore, there were few and far between lately. Sunshine, Midnight Special, Edge of Tomorrow are few movies that come to mind. Even the last one I mentioned is a big spectacle movie, it was still very smartly written. This movie deals with one of the most existential question of our time. What would happen, if aliens landed unexpectedly, not just in one spot but across the globe. How would we behave as species, both as regular people and as the governments in general. This movie manages to balance those questions and more, in this tense sci-fi drama.There are quite a few notable things about this movie, obviously the actors and Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner both give fantastic performances in which they enter this new reality both with what they know as a linguist and a scientist, but moreover as almost childlike wonder, as no one could prepare them for the exhilaration of the first contact, and what it means to them as just human beings. Both performances are subdued but there is enough tension that you just can't wait what happens next.Forest Whitaker plays a colonel that recruits Adams' and Renner's characters to help them communicate and ultimately translate the ultimate question that anyone who would get in contact with an alien species the first time would have: “Why are you here”. He plays a skeptic with an open mind (oxymoron I get it), but he lets them proceed with how they believe would be the best way to get to the final answers.Another big character in this movie is a music, which is very operatic, and with some could say somewhat religious overtones, which should have been detracting but actually adds the layer of suspense to the entire movie, and the aliens themselves. Direction in this movie is great, and that is very important in a movie like this. Mostly because it is not played out to be  shoot them up action blockbuster, Dennis Villeneuve of Sicario and Prisoners fame, finds a perfect balance where even the explanation part of the movie is very tense, and never boring. This is very important in this movie as they could become “talky” and go over the heads of people, with people losing interest and that's not what we here, its very well balanced.Overall the movie is a fantastic watch, and quite a break from all the big blockbusters of the summer, and shows that an alien encounter movie doesn't have to be all about big explosions or monuments falling, but actually be about finding out about ourselves as much as about the aliens.4 out of 4 stars",1
112,"The problem with intelligent sci-fi is that it turns off...well, you know what sort of people it turns off. Arrival is a sort of linguistic Independence Day made by someone intelligent. In fact it might even be considered a pioneer movie in the linguistics sci-fi sub genre. And because the topic of the movie is actually people learning to communicate with an alien species, rather than blowing them up with nuclear bombs like we do in almost every other Hollywood sci-fi, the movie has an odd pace to it. It can also be a little confusing here and there, particularly once the aliens start communicating through ink circles. It's a tough process to sell in the movie medium, but I think the director does a good job of it. And once that's over with Arrival is also an emotionally engaging affair. Although, again, somewhat confusing until the end.If I have one complaint it is with the usual underlying, globalist political message it ends with. It's all good and well to be politically correct and wish for human unification. But there would be a government then as well, even more remote and out of people's control than the national governments we currently suffer under. Somehow this globalist turd sandwich has to be included in all science fiction that isn't utterly braindead. It's disappointing. I miss the 80s, when independent, private people were the heroes in movies while the government posed as the villain. That seems a lot more healthy to me than what we're getting these days. Always, always more government, bigger government and just an end to all differences between people. Boring. Also dangerous. And sadly the most obvious message in Arrival. On a more ridiculous but less intrusive point, Arrival presents the mad Americans, invaders of the world, as the reasonable ones, while the Chinese and Russians get to play gun toting madmen as usual. Flip the roles and you have a more realistic movie immediately. It's not a big deal and you sort of the expect it from a US propaganda organ like Hollywood. But it's still comical. The USA are not the good guys. I repeat, not the good guys. Sorry if you had to find this out on Metacritic.Arrival has other, more interesting messages too though, so I guess I'll suffer through the US war propaganda this one time. Diverse subjects like time, suffering and isolation are handled remarkably well. And I don't think it's pretentious either, which is a much repeated criticism of the movie. Although I guess to some everything is pretentious unless you blow things up with nuclear bombs and have comic relief while doing it. And yes, that was another Independence Day reference.",1
113,"This is good old fashioned cerebral, heady, thought-provoking science-fiction. It's also a somber picture; one that tries ambitiously to meld the heart with the mind. It mostly works, though in spite of what many are calling a formulaic plot (it's necessary, I think, and part of a larger theme).Amy Adams is basically herself but with the usual variations; this is her as stern, determined, soft-spoken thinker, broken or maybe always has been. It's a subtly engaging performance, the kind Adams has been doing great work with for a while now.The score is foreboding and ominous, fitting in not just with sci-fi history but also the kind of emotional tinkering Arrival plays with. Villenueve is a master of slow building suspense using striking and casual compositions in alternating rhythms.I wish Renner had been given more to do, more depth, more anything really. And I really wish the decoding of the language wasn't glossed over in a montage. It was built up as an incredibly complex and nearly impossible task, and then suddenly they had made really good progress with it. A few more minutes could have done wonders here.",1
114,"Really good movie. How the music theme blended in was the best part. Rarely you get movies where they show the real problems of an alien first contact.My friends don't like Sc- Fi movies at all, but I managed to get them in the cinema and, surprisingly, they loved it.Explaining even a tiny bit about it would just ruin it. I recommend to watch it without reading too much about it.",1
115,"Direction and cinematography is ordinary, what gives this movie a push is its plot and new idea. but the movie lacks closure, after building up this great it needed more, feels like half feed. but decent and must watch for any scie-fie fan.",1
116,"Looking back, Arrival will certainly be one of the best movies of 2016. As a sci-fi flick it fascinates with its focus on humans instead of aliens, with the meta-theme of communication. Villeneuve also combines the content with his cinematic devices of narration. Finally, it is impressive to realize how much this movie is thought through as a whole.",1
117,"One of the best movies of the year! The story of the film and the point it wanted to make, makes the viewer think. The atmosphere of the film was brilliantly made.",1
118,"I am giving this a review of 10 just to offset the ones that feel that this movie is anything less than a 6.  I found the pacing at the beginning of the film to be very fast and also found the fleshing out of supporting characters to be a little thin(disclaimer, big fan of Donnie Yen), but this is a great popcorn muncher that tells the story of those who stole the DS plans. The critics are right when they say that the cg characters may take you out of it a bit, but you can forgive that considering the level of technology. This is a Star Wars story and you do feel good leaving the theatre.",1
119,"Prior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many like to call a ""thinking person's sci-fi"". If you're going to watch this, I beg that you dedicate your utmost attention to it, as it is truly one rewarding experience, one of the smartest, most well-constructed science fiction marvels of recent years. 'Arrival' is Villeneuve's magnum opus.Firstly, to put your mind at ease, I won't be analysing the plot, thus avoiding the use of spoilers. This decade, Villeneuve has crafted some fantastic works of art in the form of 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and now this science fiction gem, and here's hoping his career further develops with more movie masterpieces coming our way. In a world where mysteries remain and the possibility of extraterrestrial life still stands unanswered, 'Arrival' approaches this with it's cliché-free take on the genre.The relatively unknown Bradford Young provides the film with some of the most stunning cinematography ever conceived, taking advantage of the twilight hour to give the film its somewhat unique look, supported magnificently by Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson whose score is both haunting and beautiful. If you're someone looking for a science-fiction tale that keeps you guessing and thinking throughout, with fantastic performances, cinematography, music and near-flawless direction, then 'Arrival' is the film for you. The masterpiece of 2016!",1
120,"Arrival is a creative, fresh, and new film that is beautifully shot, acted, and written. The trailers and the first few minutes may seem cheesy, but don't be fooled. Once the plot is unfolded it is so much more.Characters/Acting: One of the only complaints I have about the movie was that Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker didn't get to do much. It's more of a showcase of Amy Adams' character. It still worked out fine, but I would have liked to see more of the co-stars. Otherwise, it is well-acted and the characters are strong enough to care for.Cinematography: The direction of this movie is beautiful; beautiful shots, beautiful angles, and so many beautiful little things that made the atmosphere eerie and creepy.Music: The score is one of the best ones I've heard in a long time. It's suspenseful, eerie, and sends chills down your spine. How it was not recognized with an Oscar, I have no idea. The score was more ambient and abstract, rather than a traditional score with normal music, and it pulled it off well.Plot: The plot twist in the end was not predictable, chilling, and amazing, reminding me of The Sixth Sense. It wasn't a ""hah, you thought this but it was actually this, get rekt"" kind of twist, it makes you think more and figure it out. Like Sixth Sense, you may recall certain scenes after finding out the twist and think, ""huh, that does make sense with the twist applied."" Some say that the plot is paced badly, and I can see where they're coming from. There were some slower moments, and the movie is in no rush to complete itself. There are a few scenes that even I agree went on for just a minute or two long, but did set up good tension.Visual Effects: Despite a moderately-sized budget, the effects were not the greatest I've seen in a while. There are a few scenes where the effects were obviously not prioritized, but almost everything looks convincing enough so it doesn't take you out of the movie.Overall, Arrival is an excellently-crafted, thought-out movie. Do I think it deserves many of the nominations it received? Definitely.",1

123,"Smart, thoughtful, engrossing, realistic.To people who say it's slow, I say, ""You're slow."" It's science fiction that relies more on its ideas than on its special effects. How is that bad? Sorry if you need bright, flashy lights and CGI to hold your attention-span-of-a-housefly. This movie isn't for you.",1
124,"Do you remember why you loved the Matrix trilogy then hated it? It's because it was a love story masking as a kick-ass sci-fi story. Similar thing here, ""Arrival"" is a love story masking as an alien contact story. I want to rate it a ""1"" because of its deceit, implausible plot points, and feel-yourself-age pacing but it gets a ""3"" because of its production values and A-list cast. It also messes with the flow of time, not time travel, but its sequencing. While that's laudable, it can be very confusing and inevitably leaves you feeling ""had"" or conned story-wise. It's a pretty mess resulting in a waste of 2hrs of your time.",0
125,"Grossly overrated movie. The plot is nearly non-existent, and what there is makes little sense. Huge questions, such as - Why have the aliens come? - are answered in about 6 words. The screenplay isn't a screenplay; it is a rough sketch, one that leaves many story elements undeveloped. Honestly, I don't know what they needed two hours for if this is all they had to deliver. I could, if I wanted (I won't) ""spoil"" this movie for you in about two sentences, as that's all there is in terms of content. The rest of it is spent on dull shots of the giant floating rock of an alien ship, and repetitive scenes of our cast learning to communicate with the octopus-like aliens. Add two hours to your life and do not see this movie.",0
127,I was excited too watch the movie after all the hype i heard about it. Now i regret ever watching it. A whole lot of nothing going on in the movie. First 70 minutes and absolutely nothing happens! I'm a fan of the main cast but this movie was absolutely dreadful. I kept watching something exciting or something that would make me think would arrive. But nope. You can only watch silent octopus aliens for so long. Use 2hr of your life more wisely and watch something else. If you have a taste for some sci-fi go watch the classics.,0
128,"If you are looking for something like ""Independence Day,"" or ""Aliens"" then you will be disappointed. If you enjoyed ""Interstellar,"" ""Contact,"" or even ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" then you should find this movie very entertaining, and thought provoking. The film is carried entirely by Amy Adams - while the other actors did a fine job (including the special effect aliens) they (like the Sci-fi theme) are all incidental to Amy Adams character.",1
129,"What a terrific film, The trailer was intriguing and boy did it impress. Amy Adams gives a stellar performance and Denis Villeneuve directing proves again that he can direct a damn good movie.

139,"I have watched Arrival four times to find any redeeming qualities to it.  I felt the acting was fine but over rated since the movie was so low key and not particularly entertaining.  My first problem with it was the way they portrayed the aliens. It is the same old thing, make them look like monsters who have no hands ect., making it totally unbelievable they could build anything to travel anywhere. The movie is more about time than anything else. It is unlike any other movie I have seen so saying there were cliches I found to be inane and won't use that.  The soundtrack droned and was very distracting sometimes eclipsing what the actors were saying. The language shown would have been impossible for a linguist to figure out in such a short time.  A friend compared it to a Tibetan circle language yet upon investigation, the linguist that created it said nothing about it being anything more than made up.  It's a love story in a way but done in a very boring way.  I didn't find the movie interesting or thought provoking because the subject matter within it...time isn't linear is old news. Amy Adams did a good job with what she was given but it wasn't much.  The movie simply is not entertaining and leaves one with unanswered questions. Unless one is very cerebral this will not be able to hold the attention of most viewers for long. I was very disappointed and have watched hundreds of science fiction movies. I have also read a number of reviews around the net and no one person got the same thing out of this film.  Good luck to anyone who tries to sit down and make heads or tails of it without extrapolating on it like most critics have done.",0
140,"Other sci-fi flicks tend to be generic, bland, and cliche movies that doesn't generate any kind of hype or impact to a typical moviegoer's preferences, imagination, and critical thinking.Arrival transcends expectations from those typical sci-fi films because this one provides ambitious storytelling, talented protagonist and deuteragonist, humane themes, and an amazing film score.The movie can be quite confusing at some points because of the illustration of the ""so-called time concept"" but it's plot and themes are comprehensively well-crafted that engages it's viewers to explore and indulge the interesting central idea that the film wishes to share throughout a long, almost 120 minutes (2 hours) of running time. The film can be tiring to watch because of its enormous running time but the overall storytelling of the movie is a great piece of work that deserves credit.One of the best movies of 2016, in my opinion. Recommended to be watched.Rating: 8/10 -> 4/5 stars",1
141,"Blather.Mumbo-jumbo.If you understand these two simple terms in English (as opposed to heptapod), there is no reason to see this movie--I've just summed it up for you.Huge disappointment. Love the director, cut my teeth on sci fi. Still, I'd have been better off staying home and bingeing on The Crown.",0

144,"""I've almost forgotten how it feels like to hug you""Arrival probably the Oscar winner! I think so.I want to start from the beginning of the film.It starts not with flashback or with present time,it starts with flashforward,but on that moment I thought that its flashback...So,the film beginning is about Amy Adams daughter and its about how she died..Amy Adams life changes when colonel Weber comes for her help.All film main heroes trying to translate,but if you think that its true-you are the fool,because all film-show about Amy Adams character fight with herself and her minds.And I want to give you an advice,if you are reading this and wavering between the desire to go and to wait for the release on disc,i suggest you to do both things.Even for me the end twist and the ending in general is very incomprehensible,because of that twists with time.But with that twists film becomes better.I think its 10/10 and its future Oscar winner",0
145,"I enjoyed the idea of the film, though the plot moved at rather a slow pace.  The alien's language was interesting, and the human side of the story had a nice emotional payoff.",1
146,"This movie was totally meant for me! ""Time"" is the most important thing to me and this movie hit it on the spot!!  People who are giving this movie a 5 or less is because they want a sci-fi to be action packed like Guardians of Galaxy or Transformer.  THIS IS NOT IT!!  This is an adult movie who is looking for more thought provoking ideas and understanding.  The people who gave it low scores did NOT understand the premise of the movie...  Also, people who felt it wasted their time obviously missed the entire movie! I am giving it a perfect 10 because it had all of the elements of a great movie - DEEP STORY, PLOT, Character development, and etc.  People think slow equates to no action.  Action does not mean fast.  Because you can have a lot of action but it can be a really slow movie.   People who are looking for some Interstellar, Transformer, or some Alien gun slinging movie this is NOT it! If people are looking for a real story, love, and understanding of how time. This is a must see movie of the year!!  Amazing as a my girl said this movie was meant for me!",1
147,"Arrival is one of the rare movies of today that challenges the audience about what's happening and that's what I liked most about it. Smart, complex and meticulously crafted, Amy Adams strong and vulnerable performance lead Arrival to be one of the best movies of the year.",1
148,"What’s it about?Aliens make contact with Earth and Amy Adams is the only person who can speak their languageWhat did I think?An incredibly tense and engrossing film, Arrival subverts the traditional Sci-Fi blockbuster with a gorgeous mix of cinematography, direction, and really solid narrative. Add Amy Adams’ absolutely stunning performance and you have one of the best movies of 2016.",1
149,"Very good movie. It's one of those rare movies where you leave really confused, but you know it's a really good movie (like Inception, for instance). Would have been a 10 if more explanation was given for why the root event occurred.",1
150,"A deeper and more mysterious sci-fi drama about humanity itself. Not the arrivers.The marketing of 'Arrival' was greatly focused om ""them"". But the film takes multiple different steps inwards. It's all about the human perspective and their reactions to the unknown. Humanity is the main character here, not the aliens. It takes time to understand the story, and for some of you; a rewatch might be a good thing, since it's not a pure linear film. It's a slow moving drama that got much to tell about the basics of humanity & morality. If that isn't a thing for you, then pick a different film. Amy Adams as Louise Banks is the major player, and this might be her best performance to date. Natural chemistry and over the top mother-daughter depth is a wow! Character inside might be a lacking aspect in the first act, but the film is heavily focused on build-up, and most of the inside doesn't arrive until in the final act. The character inside develops greatly throughout the film, it follows the non-linear storytelling. Sure even more inside to side-characters would’ve been great, but the focus lies greatly on Louise Banks for sure and we get a lot of inside to her! But we don't really get that much to Ian Donnelly for example. 'Arrival' got a clear structure and a stunning build-up. The film takes one step at a time and generally never felt rushed nor uneventful. Sure one rushed moment did exist on a personal level, surrounding the understanding of the aliens. I felt that the editors missed an important plot-point. Another nit-picky aspect can be the uneven pacing at several places throughout the film. But it’s not a flawed film. No way. The third act is a major part of the structure. It’s where the basic plot and characters blend together into a higher purpose. Some aspects of it did however come off as a bit flat -- the film showed several inventive moves, but some lesser ones did appear in the ending. Once the basic plot was revealed; there wasn’t that much more to be excited by. The film fights hard ethical and inventive questions, but it does on the other hand have several a bit too simple moments. It’s pretty much the same with the expositions -- who the writers integrated very well into this flick, but they were a bit too noticeable throughout the story. Arrival is a huge groundbreaker among other sci-fi films of 2016. It’s one of those slow-burners with classical sci-fi elements like time, morality, culture, religion, humanity, who we really are, and what is the nature of humanity really? Who’s the real antagonist; them or us? ’Arrival’ might take inspiration of previous sci-fi works,  but it’s one of a kind -- and let’s not forget the stunning direction from Denis Villeneuve. Just the visuals alone might bring an Oscar to this stunning sci-fi flick.Personal rating: 87/100Critical rating: 84/100",1
151,"Immediately we are grabbed from our seats into the journey of Dr. Louise Banks and her discovery of what it means to be bound by time. Played vulnerably by five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams (American Hustle, Doubt), Dr. Banks is weighed down in life by the loss of her daughter to cancer. While a sixth nomination for Adams is unlikely for this role, Arrival still gives a richly tense and starkly imaginative allegory to the coming end times, as paralleled by the inner demons of past trauma.In her present state, she is a college professor of English. At one of her teaching sessions, the lecture hall is suspiciously low on students. There are alerts on their mobile devices about unidentified objects landing across the globe, each one shaped like a large perpendicular shell. This causes for mass evacuation away from these objects, with only authorized authorities supervising and investigating what they are and where they come from. At this point, it feels like a rip-off of classic alien invasion thrillers including Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Day the Earth Stood Still. While it certainly obeys the tropes for the most part, creative liberties are still taken to ensure an exhilarating experience.Why did they land in these specific spots? That’s the question the American government is trying to answer as they conduct an organized approach to interacting to whatever thrives inside these things. Their solution in interacting with this unknown is to bring in Dr. Banks to apply her English knowledge, a highly discomforting task for her, as well as the audience. The unpredictability and danger that she is thrown into hits you right where you feel, especially when it comes time to approach the inside of this vessel.Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) proves yet again how much skill he has in disorienting you without having to manipulate the screen with IMAX magic, as his choices of framing gives an overwhelming feel of scale in comparison to this unidentified object. The color palette used by cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) gives a stark feel of loneliness in a world separated by language barriers. The stressful sound effects complement the sad melodic music scored by Jóhann Jóhannsson (Sicario, The Theory of Everything).Inside of the object, the gravity is perpendicular to our own; then at the end of the object, these eerie, faceless, squid-like lifeforms behind a white veil await the approach of human investigators. Dr. Banks leads the interaction with these beings, later named “Heptapods,” who communicate through painting abstract black rings that make up their language. So she, as a college professor, applies her history in English to vigorously study their language, which they call “nonlinear orthography.” The process in figuring out their form of communication is absolutely brilliant and inspirational in how it’s created and discovered.As real as this small-scale epic feels, its treatment towards the other countries is still rather problematic. Essentially, they are treated like outsiders from America whose first resort is to rage war against the unknown, unlike those in the richest country in the world who rely on communication past language barriers to solve problems. Based on what I’ve seen in the news recently, this is not how things have played out.There’s also an issue I have with the portrayal of Dr. Banks’ daughter, who is absent for a large portion of the film as if she’s not really that important to the story. If she were mentioned more consistently through the first and second acts, she would have strengthened the conflict between the key characters.Yet the reminder of our relation with family issues and the passage of time may just as well be the push forward that we need to communicate with one another despite the inconvenience of language differences across barriers. It is through interaction and compromise that we will arrive at where we intend to go.",1
152,"I was not at all hopeful for this movie, there are too many below average alien movies (looking at you Independence Day) but I am most certainly glad to be proven wrong in this case. Such a refreshing take on alien invasion movies, thoroughly enjoyable. The story is excellently told, beautiful music, the visual effects for the aliens and their language are stunning. As always Amy Adams is terrific and it's been a long time since Jeremy Renner gave a performance that didn't make me want to punch him in the face. A definite recommendation.",1
153,"Arrival immediately cements itself not just as a sci-fi classic but a remarkable cinematic achievement and 2016's greatest film, as Denis Villevaude delivers a mind-blowing attack on the senses that will leave you emotionally and intellectually exhausted, with an exceptional, Oscar worthy Amy Adams at the center, tying it all together. A exhilarating, astonishing must see.",1
154,I don't understand how this movie got such good reviews!!!This movie is incredibly stupid and boring!Not worth watching even if you have time to spare!Acting - 8Plot/story - 0Suspense - 2Action - 0,0
156,"Human, profound, thought provoking and creative. The acting is superb, the storytelling style and presentation is excellent, it is a powerful and beautiful movie about life, the human condition and the reality of our world today.",1
157,"La mejor película de temas espaciales desde Interestelar. Sin duda un gran espectáculo unipersonal, sobre como un evento MACRO define lo MICRO. Lo mejor del año en Sci-Fi",1
158,"it is a well told clever story, i love the fact that it is one of the best combination ever of sci-fi with a great transition from Novel to movie, is hard to see such a good translation and specially on a sci-fi flick, didnt give a 10 mostly due to be a bit pretentious on ""im a such a smart movie i will spin you around and around at each twist"" when it is not that much",1
159,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? If you are current or former military, you will appreciate the attention to detail when it comes to how the US Army is presented in this film.  IE, the uniforms, equipment and lingo is mercifully accurate, allowing you to enjoy the movie instead of getting caught up on the stupid stuff.  It isn't a military movie, it is a movie with the military in it, presented accurately.Civilians might scoff at the idea of upping a film's score for this fact, but you can't fully appreciate how bad of a job Hollywood does with what should be an easy task.  It truly isn't difficult or expensive to get these things right, which is why many of us are dumbfounded by the lack of effort in many other films.As to the movie its self, I think it was the best thing I've seen all year (2016).  The trailer didn't give the whole thing away, and it was built as a vehicle to deliver an idea, where each shot is composed using thought and care.  It isn't just people standing center frame reading their lines, interspersed with over the top VFX that fail to contribute to the story.",1
160,"Arrival features truly beautiful cinematography, strong acting performances across the board, and an intriguing slow burning story that delivers a punchy ending. The only criticism that some might level against it is that it is fairly languidly paced and light on action, which may irk some viewers. Nonetheless, it is easily one of the best sci-fi films in recent years.",1
161,"Villeneuve has done it again, after last year's thrilling ride through the cartel in Sicario, now he brilliantly brings us the Arrival of sci-fi masterpiece. For Nolan & Spielberg's fans, who's craving for twists, you shouldn't miss this.Breathtaking cinematography, mind blowing plot, heart pounding sound & spearheaded by Amy Adams's spectacular performance. Adams will be a strong contender for this year's Oscar & so does Villeneuve. The nominations Arrival deserves : Sound, Best Actress, Best Director, Cinematography, Score, and hopefully best movie..",1
162,"Thoughtful. Eric Heisserer follows the classic formula of a script (adapted, this time) from a personal story with something bigger, but in that case works because of the nonlinear puzzle of history. Moreover, Villeneuve (Director) directs the film masterfully, Bradford Young (cinematographer) delivers an excellent job, and Amy Adams is fantastic in the skin of Dr. Louise Banks",1
163,"This movie is all I yearn for in science fiction and so rarely find. Its not about fabulous technologies, or operatic galaxy wide conflicts of good versus evil. That's just sparkle and glitter. The best science fiction challenges us to ask. Who are we? How do we see and understand the world around us. How do we balance joy and loss. And this movie does it all without drowning ideas with the usual sci-fi pitfalls. All the creatures, tech babble, stunts, CG work and the rest are firmly tethered to the plot. No, wow I designed a wicked cool spacecraft, it's got to go in somewhere. Science fiction has so much potential as a genre. It's nice to see a movie that delves into that potential for once.",1
164,"It should really have Oscar! It was without the big explosions, destroyings, lasers and big pieces of fire, but it was the best kind of science-fiction film. Plot was very nice, Amy Adams is very good (and very beatiful of course). And simple, but very interesting history, which tricked spectator. But without history of aliens, film will be beatiful too.",1
165,"This is not an action movie.  It is also not a movie for those who want to have the plot and the main points spoon fed to them.  Amy Adams delivers another great performance.  Jeremy Renner is fine, but his character is really a fairly thankless supporting role.  The movie is likely over the heads of most people, as, at its core it is really a reinterpretation of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, which is a largely discredited linguistics theory.  If you know this going in (and I seriously doubt the majority of people do), it takes the main critique of that theory and makes it inapplicable as it is not being used to explain differences in human cognition based on language, but whether differences in alien and human cognition are based, in part, on language.  The other deeper issue explored is time.  Humans' existence is special and temporal.  For us, reality exists in linear time and we relate to the rest of the world in terms of three dimensional space.  What if there was an alien species for which time and space are not perceived the way we perceive them?  Again, these ideas are not simple and the movie does not successfully answer them.  But the fact that it even brings them up is more intellectually stimulating than most films I've ever seen.  Not that all movies need to be that intellectual.  I like other movies for other reasons.  But this is a smart movie that challenges viewers.  Again, it is not for everyone.  But I really liked it.",1
166,"It's definitely one of the more restrained and intelligent sci-fi films in recent memory, but nonetheless, this makes for a pretty compelling watch. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) ventures into the sci-fi territory quite seamlessly and Amy Adams is at the top of her game in this with some additional great supporting turns from Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker. The unique visuals and effects also served the film well. Really my only complaint is that I found myself a bit underwhelmed by the film's twist as it felt somewhat predictable and lacked much of an impact both on me and for the film. Overall, I absolutely wouldn't go as far as some have who claim that this is one of the best sci-fi films in years or even of all time but it still remains a solid and compelling film for the most part despite the twist not really doing much for me.",1
167,"4.8/5. I'm glad I gave this a chance because I completely misjudged and underestimated this by trailers and can honestly say it's one of the most complexly beautiful films I've ever seen. I am completely in absolute awe of the sheer amazing intertwined emotional story that bends comprehension. The way this was executed from start to finish by Denis Villeneuve was near flawless and his message of love and peace was magnificently conveyed with glorious vision. He is definitely one of the greatest directors around right now. Adams and Renner were outstanding and the most fascinating aspect were the aliens obviously which you will have to see this to truly understand. Imagine the best elements from ""Contact"" and ""Interstellar"" and you'll get this mind blowing emotionally driven Sci/fi drama new age classic.",1
168,"A fantastic film that will have you talking for a long time after, it also has original elements that are subtle but refreshing. if you are a Sci-fi fan this is required viewing.",1
169,"Phenomenal. Captivating. Gripping. Everything - the acting, story, cinematography, sound design, score - was excellent. I can't wait to see it again. What a film.",1
170,"Without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Its suspenseful, atmospheric mood, along with its profound metaphysical message, heartfelt narrative and understated performances, combine to deliver one of the most impressive, thought-provoking pictures to come out in years. This edge-of-your-seat, edge-of-your-consciousness sci-fi thriller succeeds where predecessors like ""Interstellar,"" ""Gravity"" and ""2010"" failed. It left me awed and speechless, and, if you approach it with an open mind, it just may do the same to you.",1
171,"Arrival is basically the Michael Crichton version of a ""story by"" Chris Nolan & Carl Sagan sort-of-remake of Close Encounters and/or Contact.  Villenueve is one of my favorite directors right now, and this makes it all the more awesome that he's helming Bladerunner 2049. It looks like some people are slamming this for not being big and loud (and dumb) like a Transformers movie, which is spot-on because Arrival is thankfully the complete opposite of those in nearly every way (and don't forget- as revered as Bladerunner is as one of the greatest, if not cult, sci-fi (and Ridley Scott movies for that matter) of all time, it tanked at the box office and isn't exactly paced like Raiders or Empire Strikes Back).  If you tried to watch Close Encounters recently, you might've found it to be a fairly tough watch for its insanely slow burn pace, but in its time it was riveting, thought-provoking, and powerful, which is essentially what Arrival pulls off for our modern age. And much like Contact, I don't see Arrival being the movie I rewatch as frequently as The Incredibles, the last 3 Mission Impossible movies, Fury Road, or any season of Game of Thrones or Hannibal, but man it's a fat-free, compelling as hell watch the first time around from beginning to end... though it won't hurt if don't go into it expecting Interstellar, The Martian, or Gravity.  Again, your 60-something favorite Uncle or under-30-something semi-millenials would probably be much happier watching Dr. Strange (which I kinda almost loved), Hacksaw Ridge, or Jack Reacher 2, but Arrival is clearly the one most likely to (hopefully) nab an Oscar nom.",1
172,"As other have commented, Villeneuve is a good director but this is a step in the wrong direction for him. I hate to use the B word {boring}, but Arrival is a real endurance test even for fans of serious, thought provoking movies.qweqwedwqeqweqweqweasdasdasd",0
173,"Its rare that I give a film a 10 review; saying this I found no faults whatsoever in Arrival. Amy Adams beautifully plays Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor who is tasked in communicating with an American landed alien space craft. This film is beautifully directed, scored and acted and is brought to life by its original and compelling script.",1
174,"'The Arrival' is a science fiction film based on real science like Chris Nolan's 'Interstellar'. The basic story is that aliens arrive on earth. The aliens are truly alien and look like creatures that astrobiologists have already suggested might look like and that communication with is almost impossible.  Humans react with both wonder and fear as the two lead characters played by Amy Adams and Jeremy Remmer attempt to find a method of communication.  Their communication attempts hide another discovery about the aliens and human beings which will not be apparent until the film's ending. The film is complicated by film editing which will confuse viewers until the end of the film, but will make perfect sense if you have been paying attention or if you watch it again.",1
175,"Who: Amy Adams, Hawkeye, and someone who agreed to be in Taken 3 as, Colonel WebberWhat: Another phenomenal addition by Denis Villeneuve that makes me wonder, is he the best director of this century?Where: Earth. I wanna say...Scotland? When (Can I watch this again): Arrival will be a sci-fi gem you can watch over and over again. Why: If you loved the unrelenting suspense of ""Prisoners"" and the feeling of utter futility ""Sicario"" shoved down your throat, then this film will blow your mind in a completely different way from his previous films.",1
176,"One of the most beautiful movies made to date that effectively tells its story on time, humanity and the meaning of life. It can change a viewpoint and make you realise that each moment is worth living.",1
177,"This movie feels like a giant metaphor for communication and language and how each of those changes and affects all of our lives. I really enjoyed this film (especially the ending), and if I had to name any problems, it would probably be some of the editing (they don't change a shot for more than fifteen seconds) and some tonal issues.",1
178,"This one is for sure one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. It's a full package, a great plot, screenplay and meanfully story, Oscar's worth sound effects, and an achievement on directing. It's messenge by criticising nowadays human relations and forgetting simple things like dialogue and comprehension is beautiful. Whatsmore, it's not just a typical story about alien invasion, but a story about a mother and her strugglings for her proufound love, which feeling Amy Adams captures with a deep acting. Obligatory must-see. ABUSOLUTELY LOVE IT.",1
179,"A smart, dark, brilliantly entertaining, wonderfully interpreted and surprisingly unforgettable mix of impressive storytelling and magnificent drama. Sci-fi fans will not be disappointed.",1
180,"It was a perfect contact, but troubled at the communication.The film was decent. Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.The eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.When the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.To me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence. So it is a one time viewable film and you will get everything in that attempt itself.7/10",1
181,"Surprisingly calm film about a fascinating encounter with intelligent alien life that takes place on Earth. The film doesn´t have big visual showings and the pace is pretty slow. But it doesn´t take away from the quality. The theme of the film is language and how difficult it would be to communicate with such strange forms of life. Above all that, the film is an emotive story about a woman´s life and passion for her job and her loved one (you´ll have to see to know who I am refering to). Amy Adams does amazing as always. And you can expect a few twists. But nothing too big. It is about emotions and making us think. We have to improve and educate ourselves more and more, and especially be more sympathetic with others, including other species (go vegan!). A solid 8 out of 10.",1
182,Slow and nonsensical.  Learning the aliens language allows you to see the future?  Time travel in your day-dreams?  Everybody's stupid but the heroine?  Subtitles for the alien's language?  Close Encounters did a vastly superior job of imagining first contact.  I fast-forwarded through most of it just to see if the positive reviews made any sense.  Nope.,0
183,"I love the fact that this is about first contact with an extra-terrestrial live form minus the repetitive Hollywood action frag fest when everything blows up as if it was Michael Bay-ized stashed together with a bunch of product placement (*cough* TF4 *cough*)Instead, it concentrates more on a more grounded sci-fi concept of communications as two different civilizations are trying to understand each other. Some people may dislike it to the core for the lack of action. And yet, they don't realize that 'Arrival' focuses on the concept of time as a sort 'loop' rather than the normal linear perception (being the default order of Past-Present-Future) Furthermore, what was considered the highlight of the show was that the flow of the story is almost representational to the alien glyph, in such a way that 'the ending of the turns out to be its beginning', like a sentence arranged ina circular pattern without a full stop.  Given its strength, however, the movie is not without some of its weaknesses. >>> SPOILER ALERT",1
184,"Well acted, superbly directed, poetic story, amazing score and soundtrack, film editing was great! A movie wirth seeing again and again.",1
185,"Thoughtfull and moving Scifi from Denis Villenueve. The movie centres around the idea of communication. In this case with visitors from beyond. It sets up as a ""Independence Day"" like scenario but plays out very different. Great visual shots, good acting, nice twist towards the end. Overall very well made movie.",1
187,"Looks like most people are judging this movie without having read the short story upon which it's based. There was a lot of rework of the plot to make it a movie, and in doing so the beauty and best parts of the story were discarded.  All that's left is a sappy mess which causes the first contact part of the plot to feel awkward and out of place.",0
188,"The movie is just a non sense trailer with non sense flashbacks, it's an argue who starts good and finish with a non sense... thing, the director just make and experiment with a wrong trama",0

192,"One of the best of the year so far.  This is one of the most engrossing films I've seen in years -- kept my eyes absolutely glued to the screen.  I had a few issues with the film lingering too much on the ending and not trusting the audience to figure out certain things, but as far as major sci-fi releases go, this is one of the greats.",1
193,"'Arrival', along with 'Hell or High Water' (2016) is one of the best movies of the year. Director, Denis Villeneuve ('Sicario'), this film brings in some uneasy tension and atmospheric moments that will keep you hooked through its 1 hour and 55 minute run-time. Amy Adams stars as Louise Banks, a linguist who is selected after twelve strange extraterrestrial spacecrafts have landed in 12 different parts of the world. What they plan on doing seems unclear to everyone, until Louise manages to find a way to make contact with these strange extraterrestrials. She is brought in by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) who informs her that she might be able to help communicate with these strange species. Along her journey, she also meets military astrophysicist, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who remains to trust her the most when she is searching for answers. The movie creates this uneasy mix of tension and surprises, like most of Villeneuve's work, it is deliberately paced, but this makes room for some well crafted and carefully handled scenes that are pleasing to the eye. Our main character, Louise, seems emotionally distant from time to time, but we discover her backstory more and more as the film goes on. The sound editing is some of the best I've heard since 'Gravity' (2013), where anything that is loud is loud, and whenever the atmosphere is quiet, it is quiet and remains that way. There are no gimmicks or any unrealistic artificial sounds to make it an easy watch. Everything you see and hear is real. The movie should get Oscar consideration for its sound editing, not to mention that this might just be Villeneuve's best directorial work yet. He should receive a ""Best Director"" nomination for his work here. If you love mysterious sci-fi with added tension, and even some occasional drama, with some of the best piece of filmmaking ever seen... you owe it to yourself to see 'Arrival'.",1
194,"So, if you take the cerebral elements from ""The Fifth Element"", the time travel element from ""Interstellar"" and parts from ""The Lathe of Heaven"" you'll have something that closely resembles ""Arrival"". A very cerebral, thought-provoking movie with stellar acting by all the major characters. As a sci-fi buff, I indulge my guilt gigantic, transforming robot on robot mayhem as well as the deeper movies like this one. It is a solidly, suspenseful movie that has a surprise twist near the end. Go see it.",1
195,"When going to the movies tonight, I was afraid that I would be definitely let down due to my high expectations after watching all trailers, reading into the material and, of course, being quite the Denis Villeneuve appreciator. After walking out of the cinema with my significant other, both of us agreed that this was probably one of the best movies we had seen in a long time. The lack of unnecessary action, the brilliant story telling, the beautiful pictures combined with a much more than just suitable cast, made this film an amazing experience - and to round this up it send the audience into the night with a beautiful message - working together in desperate times for the greater good will always be the solution. L.K.",1
196,"This was surprise at how good it was. I entered the movie thinking ""how could they make another alien encounter film and make it good?"". But they did! It had a fresh approach, keeping  within the behaviors you would expect from military and professionals, and then threw in great plot twists that reminded me of Nolan's Interstellar.",1
197,"I just watched the movie and frantically looked for my iPad leaving my comfy bed to leave a review, why? To save others from watching this horrific movie and save people . I want my money back. I want the two hours of my life back. We watched the movie since it had good review on metacritic.....now I think reviews here are fake. No one in their right mind would write a positive review for this cheesy none sense and boring movie. I won't ever reply on metacritics again . Reviews could be paid for, this movie was horrific and on,y one person to blame, the DIRECTOR for even thinking the writing is good enough to put these poor actors through it. Such a waste of time. I've hyped for no reason!!!",0
198,"Just a beautiful film from start to finish. Can't understand how anyone found it slow - I was riveted from start to finish, but then again I loved Tree of Life which Arrival reminded me of to some extent as well as Close Encounters, Contact, and The Day the Earth Stood Still (original).",1
199,"Powerful! This movie is really powerful. I can understand some people might not like it because, for most part of the film, you have no idea of why some things are happening or being shown to the audience, but neither do the characters in the movie, it is like we are trying to solve the big puzzle about what the aliens are doing on Earth together. If you are like me, that is very engaging. I felt so immersed in the events of the movie that I did not see time passing. Then you finally starts to figure and it is awesome! Everything fits together very well! And of course, for the slow ones, they literally draw what is the answer of it all at some point... I loved it, and I must say that, because of the reviews and the trailer, I had tremendous expectations, and still I was not prepared for it this feature offers. Now, to be fair, there are a few things (nothing important for the story, just minor details) that kinda turn you off, such as lines by the scientists/academics that just reveal that those characters were written by people who don't really know how academics really are... However, these are just minor pieces that I could totally forgive at the end because it was so good! RECOMMENDATION FOR THE VIEWERS: don't look to much into what the movie is about, and avoid spoilers. I would not say that the twist is that surprising and mind blowing like the 6th Sense, but the experience of watching it as a blank page is very nice. Piece!",1
200,"This is a very special film. A hugely unique take on first contact, Arrival is one of the most intense and cerebral experiences you’ve ever had at the movies, requiring full concentration, an open mind, and patience for a slow-moving, but utterly enthralling story. Featuring exceptional performances, astonishing directing from Denis Villeneuve, a near-perfect screenplay, and a mesmerising score, this is a truly exhilarating film to watch, and one that will leave you thinking and pondering long after the credits have rolled.First off then, suppose the most important thing to say about this film is that you have to have your brain turned on. This is not even in the same league as the likes of Independence Day or even Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, but is instead a dark, heavy-going drama that only uses a science-fiction setting to tell a gripping and emotionally powerful story about humanity.Much like all of Denis Villeneuve’s films, Arrival is at times a soul-destroying experience, portraying some utterly devastating forecasts of how people around the world would deal with first contact, but that’s one of the reasons that it’s such an arresting watch.Villeneuve himself does an exceptional job at directing this film. It’s the first massive-scale project we’ve seen from him, but his astonishing ability to create a stunningly eerie and tense atmosphere at every single moment in this film, whether it be in the unnerving sweeping shots of the alien spacecraft, or the smaller, more claustrophobic moments centring on the human characters’ efforts to deal with them, is testament to what a talent he is.And that tense eeriness carries over brilliantly into every other part of the film. For me, one of the most memorable elements of Arrival was the score by Jóhann Jóhannsson. Staying effectively silent for so much of the film, Jóhannsson takes an incredibly unique and experimental approach to the music of the film, often making it appear as if it is sound coming from the real world.At times, the aliens’ cries and speech become pieces of musical score, adding significantly to the sense of danger and tension, which was stunning to see. At others, however, he uses some powerful instrumental tunes to heighten the drama of the characters’ emotions, and although this is a film in which you can hear the score, it plays such a significant role in shaping your experience that it’s a huge positive.Along with the music, the performances are another key element that make this film so stunningly intense. At the centre of it all is Amy Adams, who is astonishing from start to finish. Dealing with a very complex character and story, she brilliantly powers through and portrays a huge range of emotions, from her character’s crushing depression early on in the film, to her determination and strength whilst attempting to communicate with the alien beings. It’s not the normal Amy Adams we know and love so much, but a far more battle-hardened and intense performance, but that deviation from her more typical roles is spectacular to watch, making this easily one of her best ever performances.And finally, we come to the screenplay. Based on a short story, the writing here is an exceptional display of ingenuity and intelligence. The heavy-going and slow-paced nature of the movie becomes a virtue because of the writing, giving you as a viewer the time to think about everything that is going on and understand it deeper, whilst also taking on some incredibly complex ideas and themes and making them work almost perfectly in the context of a science-fiction film.In the end, however, this film isn’t so much about the aliens as it is about its human characters. The story is very difficult to talk about without spoilers, however I can say that the way the film’s narrative unfolds throughout is genuinely one of the most unique and brilliant things I’ve ever seen, and it makes for an astonishingly powerful development of emotions towards the finale. It does require an open mind, but with that comes a truly incredible and thought-provoking story.Overall, I was blown away by Arrival. A masterpiece of directing, scoring, acting and writing, it’s a truly exhilarating watch that will take you on a devastating rollercoaster of emotions, but with an ingenious and utterly enthralling story that you will not forget in a long time.",1
201,"Congrats to the scriptwriter, director, and Amy Adams for making an extremely sentimental film that didn’t make me want to throw up in my popcorn. Amy Adams is really quite amazing as she pulls off a role where she is part brains and part feeling – and she manages to make them mesh and make sense. It’s almost a miracle. As usual, Villeneuve has made an original film that is also an interesting genre film with an excellent cast. Unless you only like blood and guts or only like real weepies, you should see this film.",1
202,"Arrival brings a somewhat unique spin to the overly done and cheesy typical alien plot. Visually, this movie has beautiful, yet simple shots that seem to abruptly change style throughout the movie. The writing was clever throughout, but at times is very corny and transparent.   Amy is absolutely amazing and singlehandedly swayed me to rate this movie at least a star higher.",1
203,"Arrival is a truly excellent movie.It gets every element of filmmaking right. The script balances a strong scifi plot with an even stronger human story. I was so impressed with how riveting and cinematic the work of a linguist was made. The acting hits all the complex, layered notes just right as it tells a story that demands a lot of nuance from Amy Adams in particular. The cinematography and direction work so well in creating wide, haunting shots that make the characters feel small and vulnerable and then close, intimate shots that make us feel sympathetically claustrophobic. The music is haunting and memorable. The effects are stylish, subtle, and well-executed.My friend and I left the theater talking about so many elements of this movie and now, a week and a half later, I still haven't gotten sick of discussing it.",1
204,I made an account just to say that this was the greatest movie I have ever seen. I have been having an existential crisis since i saw it two days ago. Please see this movie,1
205,"A superb, cerebral experience, with sublime cinematography and a storyline which is subtle, complex and captivating. This is an exceptional film, with performances that are both nuanced and powerful - Adams is brilliant - and the careful pacing coupled with a soundtrack that uses silence to enhance tension means that you're completely entranced throughout. This is not a fast paced action film, this is a masterfully crafted drama which I will be watching again. 9.97/10",1
206,"I already knew going in that it was something special, that it wasn't focused on conflict or shiny technologies or visual effects, but I still didn't expect it to be this good or to go into serious existential questions like it did. Excellent movie, one for the collections.",1
207,"Having read the story on which the movie is based, I pretty much knew what to expect. I thought the treatment of the complex language issues at the heart of the story was excellent. I didn't mind the action inserted at the end of the movie, even though it wasn't in the original story. 10/10 for me.",1
208,"Arrival is a remarkably unique film about an alien invasion and the language barriers that come with it. The story follows Dr. Louise Banks, a university professor who is called upon to help communicate with the aliens when they 'arrive' (pun intended) on Earth. She meets Ian Donnelly, who she begins growing close to as they work together to communicate with the aliens. The film introduced a really cool way of how the aliens speak and use language. The story continues to get more and more interesting as the characters unravel new information. Because of this the writing and direction were really great, especially how everything comes together in the ending. Casting Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner as the leads were solid choices, they both bring really great performances to their roles. I also really dug the musical score, it was haunting yet very unique and worked well. Arrival is a fantastic movie that is guaranteed to surprise and impress. Definitely don't miss it!",1
209,"This is a deeply philosophical movie, so many parallels to life.   I thought it was ingenious and inspiring.When I watch a movie, I'm not watching it through a ""critical"" eye, like what I like and don't like about the movie, but I'm weighing my own experience, my goal is always a vicarious experience.   I got that with Arrival.  I give the movie a solid 9.   I've only give a few movie a 10 in my life, so a 9 is really high for me.",1
210,"It is official. Denis Villeneuve is my favorite working director. This could change, but my Lord is Arrival brilliant. Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and now Arrival are all some of the best films of this decade - no, century - and each has an indelible respect for the audience. It trusts that we will follow along as Villeneuve spins a web that, though it may not make sense initially, will craft a gorgeous vignette of some element of existence. Arrival is most certainly a part of this collection now and is one of the best science fiction films in a while with stunning visuals, chill-inducing brilliance, and incredible performances.Admittedly, however, Arrival missed the mark for the first half or so. It seemed so different. So unique. Nothing truly made sense from the opening with this daughter that seems out of place for the film I expected to receive, plus the weird narration scene by Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). It just seemed so haphazardly put together that it seemed wholly indigestible. However, after this halfway point, the film is pure brilliance. Even better, it opens up the world of the first half to the point that you realize that - even if the narration is still a moment that I cannot wrap my head around -  everything else adds up. In this second half, Arrival soars with the grace and beauty previously only experienced by eagles.A confusing, nonlinear film, Arrival follows Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the country's best linguist in the aftermath of the arrival of extraterrestrials. In the interest of determining their purpose, Louise is tasked with cracking the code of the heptapods (the aliens). What transpires is film that can often mirror Dances with Wolves in its respect for language (Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well to a degree for this) and Contact for its similarities regarding the military and its approach to, again, language. In many respects, Arrival is a science fiction film, but it is also a film about destiny, free-will, and the beauty of language.Through language, worlds open up. One can weave a beautiful sentence that can move readers to tears. Others can craft a speech that sways people to believe one thing or the other. Language allows people to express feelings, emotions, thoughts, or simply converse with others. Language, as discussed in the film, is the foundation of a civilization. In many ways, it is the foundation of humanity. Arrival delves into this sheer beauty of language throughout the picture. Villeneuve brilliantly allows this elegance to take centerstage with long drawn out sequences of nothing but communication between Louise and the heptapods.Yet, the film hardly stops there. Through showing the possibilities the language of the heptapods can reveal, Arrival hits a peak. Once we learn that the heptapods language allows the speaker to see the future, Arrival's philosophical explorations really take hold. This is the part where many will be lost and why I am skeptical as to film's acceptance amongst general audiences. However, the film's nonlinear storytelling is incredibly revealing and really works. Through the nonlinear storytelling, we know the end of Louise's story. We do not know that we know this, but by the end, it is clear what her future is. Louise knows it and though she keeps it to herself in the present, we know the future is something that is simulatenously her past. It is already a part of her and one she cannot escape. However, it is clear she does not wish to escape her future. It is one filled with challenges, but filled with equal joy and love. Films have previously discussed the concepts of free-will and destiny (hell, Oedipus did this in the BC's) and yet, Arrival brings a warmth to the discussion. Though Louise may know her future, she chooses to head into it with no hesitation. Yes, it will bring her unspeakable pain and tragedy, but it will also bring sheer ecstasy. For Louise and many others, this is more than acceptable. However, Arrival does not hesitate to ask: If you know your future, would you try to change it? This is certainly a fallacy, as I believe Arrival showcases. The heptapods knew Louise's future. How? Because it already happened. There is no time, there is no free-will, there is only destiny. For the world of Arrival, the possibilities of the world are not endless. You are on a path and destined to complete this path.Arrival often mirrors the language it discusses, not just the heptapods' language, though. Language, as Louise states frequently, can be messy and confusing. Yet, it opens doors to the world that were previously locked tight. This is very similar to the film as a whole, as it is a complex puzzle and my initial hesitation to the film's world was because I only received small pieces of a large puzzle. Once they started fitting together and the image became clearer, the film became a truly awe-inspiring, striking, and beautiful experience.",1
211,"I truly enjoyed this movie. Everyone will take away a different meaning from this movie due to their own current life circumstances.The movie is well paced with the right level of tension and suspense building throughout, and the cast do a great job in portraying the scenario to the viewer.Ultimately, the movie is about language and meaning. The notion that we humankind are living on the brink of war day-to-day, due to the division of language, and yet we use language to bring meaning to our lives as well as using it to convey our humanity. This speaks on many levels and Villeneuve has managed to capture the essence and importance of language. The very same language that changed minds of millions of people to elect a new president. The same language that brings peace to millions worldwide through prayer. That same language that can be both beneficial and destructive to humanity.",1
212,"I enjoy the movie. However, I could not help but thinking the theme has been repeatedly used for the past 2 months. Miss Peregrine, Doctor Strange, and now Arrival.I enjoy the way the movie is being shown with constant 'flashback' and it did set me up.As a research student, I understand the pain how the character Dr Bank has to deal with the military, it is pretty much what happens to scientists (to deal with politics, admin and such) on a daily basis.The deep philosophy behind the movie is also interesting as it demonstrates the conflicts within a human which comes into contact with 'new' things (and or world). In addition, because I am a bilingual from two very different cultures, Chinese and English. I understand the frustration of being an interpreter. And indeed, the more you understand the language and cultures of both sides, explaining a sentence or phenomenon to one side of people can be difficult because it takes time to think a way to translate the meaning and be able to deliver the concept which is indeed harder than you think. Because there is something more than the factual meaning on those words but the interpretation which is the key of a communication.(Let me give you an example below.)Back to the movie, note the general public is scared in such situation as they recall history and they are aware they are on the other side of civilisation, some of them would like to bring peace, some of them would like to fight them off.As a scientist, we are naturally curious, understanding of something new would be the greatest achievement of all, and hence explain how Louise and Ian approach the alien.I understand in most sci-fi movie, physicists are often involved as the part of movie since it involves paradox and time, but it would be nice to get an organic chemist role because it would be interesting for organic chemists to learn new organic molecules from alien if they exist.If anyone reading this comment and happen to know physics, could you tell me where can I learn more about time, event horizon, general relativity on a conceptual level coz I don't know much maths, thanks! Ok, the example of language and culture.For those who don't know Chinese, here is an example.One of Australian friends used to learn Chinese, he told me what he learnt. The first thing he learnt is 'How are you?' in Chinese which is fine.But here is the problem. Most Chinese do not greet with 'How are you?' Chinese ask all kind of questions from 'Where are you from?' (stranger/new friend) to 'How is your family/work?' (close friends/relatives)My understanding at that point is, there is no harm learning those phrases, but it is not particular helpful if you really want to interact with a Chinese. I quickly suggested I could teach him Chinese, but because there are tests and exams so I understand he would rather stick to whatever the teacher taught him.In contrast, for whose who do not know too much English, 'How are you?' is greeting, and they actually don't care how are you, it is in fact pretty meaningless.From my understanding, learning a language systematically (through a book/class) is quite ineffective. I argue the best way to learn a language is to interact with that person who is speaking in that particular language. Learning from items, to phrases, to sentences (like how a baby learn a language). And one day, your brain will 'click' and understand, like how Amy Adams understand a new language in the movie.I can tell you from my experience. I have learnt English for almost 20 years of my life, until I have interact Australians for an extensive period of time, I realise what I have learnt from my textbooks back from Hong Kong is virtually useless. Same thing if someone feel like learning Chinese, go interact with a Chinese, learn and practice and you will pick up the language and understand how they think fairly quickly.",1
213,"Breathtaking, majestic, and yet still somehow grounded and real, ""Arrival"" is an absolute monument of a film dedicated to the power of hard science-fiction storytelling and the human spirit as we understand it. High marks definitely go to Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker for their valid efforts in making this situation feel so authentic, but make no mistake, this is Amy Adams' film and her poignant, deeply moving performance is nothing short of career-defining. Also at the apex of this masterwork is director Denis Villeneuve, whose trademark penchant for tension and realism helps propel this film towards the stellar heights that it reaches. Truly, the best science-fiction film I've seen in years. Handedly.",1
214,"Wow.Nice update metacritic. I saw this movie because of the director. Yes. He directed Sicario, one of my favorite movies ever. Back to arrival.There's a pretty big twist at the end.It's not on the level of say Bioshock Infinite or Spec Ops:The Line but it is new to my knowledge. My predictions were wrong as to what will be revealed or happen next. One of the best parts is when the aliens are revealed right as the Sicario(yep, similarity for those who are looking. Well listening) esque music blares up. You'll see some aliens almost as cool as the reapers. It's good sci-fi stuff and Amy Adams looks great. I guess that's about it. I could go deeper but nah(pronounced ""na"" not ""noh"") Too bad Denis isn't directing Solando. And Emily Blunt isn't in it! But then again, Benicio Del Toro's character can be captivating. ""Go ahead,finish your meal""",1
215,"Have you ever discovered something that just captured your curiosity to the point where you wanted to learn everything about it? That's the effect Arrival had on me. Every new development filled me with a sense of childlike wonder and caused my interest in the film's otherworldly visitors to grow even deeper. Tensions understandably rise as twelve spacecrafts arrive across the globe and humanity races to find out why. It's far from an original set up for a sci-fi movie, but what sets apart this quest to discover extraterrestrial motives is the approach taken. You'll notice the familiar elements of human paranoia and governmental mistrust running in the background, but Arrival's main focus is on the establishment and discovery of communication. That is what makes all the difference.The imaginative and complex method of conveyance crafted for this film is nothing less than brilliant. It really sells the outer space lifeforms as real, intelligent creatures. Of course that is also helped by how good the film looks (minus Amy Adams' CGI spaghetti hair). The film's core idea of deciphering a dialect and written language unlike anything we know seems like something that would be an insurmountable challenge, but it reminds us that this has been done before when humans discovered each other living on completely different sides of the planet. Arrival's intelligent handling and understanding of linguistics makes what could have been a boring process something that is fascinating to watch unfold. The big reveal is one heck of a revelation. It causes the final leg of the film to take an interesting turn. While it goes off in a different and kind of strange new direction, it speaks to something so human that it's hard to not appreciate it. This is of course bolstered by the incredible performance from Adams. She's got other talented people alongside her in the cast, but it's really up to her to carry the movie. Something she does so exquisitely that the lack of even a nomination for an Oscar is baffling. Arrival is such a breath of fresh air for the sci-fi genre. It shows off a level of intelligence and believability that feels all too rare, and it manages to do so with the old ""are they friend or foe?"" approach that's been done so many times before. Something that speaks highly of Denis Villeneuve's ability and shows that apparently there are ways to mine new depth from even among the most overused concepts. In closing, Arrival is absolutely captivating and it might just be the best sci-fi film I've ever seen.",1
216,"""Everything happens for a reason"" is the exact moral of the story.A film like this was not what I expected, and I couldn't be more amazed. Something you may have to watch twice to fully get the story, but boy, does it melt your brain on how brilliant and unique the whole thing is.",1
217,"This movie is absolutely amazing. One of the best in the last 10 years, maybe comparable in complexity only to Interstellar. Thy way the whole store comes into one all from the back to the beginning, is astonishing. I was slowly growing suspicious of the little hints given to us during the whole movie, placing them in wrong time all the way up until the end. Brilliant. If it only was possible though. One thing I didn't like though (not enough to take away a score point) was the portrayal of the rest of the world. US good, rest of the world stupid and crazy. It shows the typical American state of mind and their own opinion of themselves, as the good guys, that was really, really annoying.",1
218,"Undamaged & Superb Insurrection For Hollywood Science FictionThe vastness of human pragmatism that science fiction can encompass is unheard-of. It's been circumscribed erroneously with the epigraph about the impossibility of its acts, it's paradoxical to look back and itemize any minutia of our history emerged with a ""that never will happen"" or a ""this is impossible"". And here we're, where was such a the conception of logic and fairness when a group of German Jews and Aryan citizens decided by 44% of utilitarian votes that a midget beast to head up Germany and the selfsame world into a cyclone of blood to the unforgiving netherworld? Or, where was equal, liberating and fair American people who asserted equality and pluralism when they elected a Republican Presbyterian with a citrus wig to lead the crux of the universe?, There is where the literary and film well-known adage glow to its highest expression: ""reality surpasses fiction"".   As its title suggests, the plot revolves around the unplanned landing of twelve alien spaceships, which are likened the 2001 monolith of ""A Space Odyssey""; spectral figures, extraterrestrial resources, those who have arrived with own aim. The ship in which the story focus is one that touched down a few meters away from the greenish surface of Montana, USA. It's so like the American people to first examine and then proceed, using the head rather than the force; thus the US government decides to hire seasoned in dead and alive languages, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) in order to investigate succinct stimulus of its visit. However, they stumble on more unknowns than elucidations due to the harsh context where they're. May do ""they"" use some kind of informational exchange? How will ""they"" discern what they want to express? May do ""they"" grasp human reasoning? It's right here where previously treated space-time works, blended with a linguistic atmosphere which portrayed, in the background, paranoia, and informality of human reaction facing a critical contingency. We're involved in Louise's circumstances, but suddenly, we may feel reflected as in her indigo eyes as in Ian's or anyone's eyes who may be experiencing such an event; the film is about finding a ""why"" about ourselves, not about them. Will we be the threat?""I don't believe in starts or finals"", with this direct thought in voice-over is shaped in front of us a so-called muddled narration; the confidences were within our reach, however, the only thing we did was continue to attest the shortcomings of our language, cemented in times as yesterday, today and tomorrow. Everything makes sense with the concluding scenes of diegetic meaning, clearing up the general purpose of its arrival, donating a gift as harmful as utilitarian for a society who is at Apocalypse's edge. In that moment, we noticed that in the same way she did in ""Nocturnal Animals"", Adams has teased our intellectual coefficient, has attained that we continue under a spell the MacGuffin for, in the last snap, reveal us that was something more intimate, something about you and I that exceeds the rational, something more complex that one invasion; It's a musing about humanity breaks points, and that actually, is the role of Villeneuve's fiction: elucidating by its semiological proposal, the flaws of communication and understanding of the human race, our contraction against fate, our damaged governmental organization, our lack of sensitivity; We're human because someone gives us such seal, but in the cruelest truth, we're primitive societies adorned as organized.A calm pace, measured action, and limited literal entertainment; they want we read about above-mentioned by the language of the celluloid in a noticeable way, it's said that ""reading is work"", the speaker sets a code to which the speaker and receiver assign it the same meaning, there's no a common code, the listener shall decipher the code of the way in which the statement reveals it. They don't want you go to see a film, they demand you watch a reality.An experience that must be pressing for that sci-fi fan who based its passion for rational causes and effects, besides, it ratifies Amy Adams' overwhelming acting ability and thrives on the potential of its director and team resulting in a work worthy of being appended beyond fiction stories, where's the raw essence of cinema. A story glides through few settings with meager lighting, giving priority to the language and the context, discarding dispensable technical terms and CGI sequences to reveal caustically in the last five minutes that nothing has a start and a terminal; paraphrases aren't always put on the table. Why are they here? The gift bequeathed to us was a simple tool, which serves as a duct to carry out sublimely moral, emotional, political, human, philosophical and, at the last stay, cinematographic choices.",1
219,"Arrival is the story of Humanity's first contact with an alien species that shows itself by stationing twelve objects at different locations around the planet. Amy Adams is a linguist who is assigned to attempt communication with the aliens.There are many things I love about this movie. If this was a sci-fi book this would be called Hard Sci-Fi. Based somewhat in reality and real science. The story moves at its own pace. There is a definite tension throughout. But, along with that is a feeling of wonderment. How would we speak to alien species that has little or nothing in common with us? And, as the film's tagline asks, why are they here?There is little to no physical action in this film. There is violence, but it is off screen for the most part.. That being said, I never felt bored or lost. The story moves in the dialogue and the actions of the characters in the story. This is a smart movie. It doesn't spoon feed the audience with TOO many details or nuance. You may have to fill in a few holes with your imagination. Which, honestly, could hurt how someone feels about this movie.The plot moves very well leading into the finale. I was completely satisfied with the resolution/revelation at the end of the film. If you are expecting an alien mothership/ Death Star exploding action climax..you may be disappointed. But if something a bit more cerebral and heartfelt is more to your liking...you may be pleasantly surprised.Amy Adams is GREAT in her leading role as linguist Louise Banks. Her journey, physically, emotionally and mentally carries the movie. Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg all shine in their supporting roles.Besides Denis Villenueve's amazing directing (He continues to impress after Enemy, Prisoners and Sicario) I have to give praise to Bradford Young's cinematography and Johann Johannsson's music. This is a beautiful film to look at and the soundtrack is stellar.Arrival, at the moment is tied for my favorite film of the year along with Moonlight. Two movies at first glance that may have nothing in common. But, on a deeper level they are two sides of a coin. The celebration of the human spirit and the ability, despite our flaws and foibles, to become something better than what we are.",1
220,the film was a little too long. there were some bore parts and some interesting parts. amazing performance from amy adams as per usual. it kinda sad how the film ends once u get the picture of how the main character's life and the aliens are linked. pretty damn original story but there were some over repetitive things on the script and some scenes could be edited in order to get a smaller runtime,1
221,"Sci-fi. Linguist specialist gains prominence when aliens visit the earth. Effective special effects and decent acting do not save this ponderous, over-rated sleep-inducement. Not one to watch again, and only worth seeing once so you can have an opinion on it.",1
222,"A fresh and ingenious insight into what first contact could entail, which gave me an unshakable feeling of excitement throughout. Action movie-lovers stay away! This one has well-thought out plausibility to offer instead. The story always has deeper layers of causality and explanation to delve into; I am still discovering it after watching it three times!",1
223,"An interesting story and good execution. Definitely confusing at times, but it pays off at the end, when you understand the non-linearity of the plot. Great to see aliens that aren't savage monsters, for a change.",1
224,"Intrigante, una película de extraterrestres que se sale del cliché que suelen cometer este tipo de películas. Algunas actuaciones un poco inexpresivas, pero no le quitan lo Increíble a esta película.Y Amy Adams, Maravillosa!",1
225,"slow but intense. great performances, especially from Amy Adams. Don't go into this movie expecting to see any sci fi alien invasion action scenes or moments like independence day or war of the world cause there's not any. Story may be confusing but it makes you think about it hard. loved it.",1
226,"An incredibly emotive showcase for Amy Adams acting abilities, and a directorial masterclass from Denis Villeneuve. This is one film that has everything: it's terrific visually, has incredible sound design, a killer concept and execution of its plot and the acting and direction is top class. This is as close to flawless as it could ever hope to get.",1
227,"arrival is one of the most important movies of the 21'st century directed by my current favourite director Denis Villeneuve, i consider him as a coming of a great artist, even though he was making movies since 1994 it's really with 2013 that he started building up his style of film making and with his latest movie up to this day, arrival.arrival is a sci-fi film but concentrates it's narrative on the philosophy rather than it's science counterpart. alien space ships came down to earth but did not attack any territory but rather just stayed in their places and welcomed anyone who dared enter their realm. now with our main character louise a linguistics expert that was sent by the government to study and understand the language of the aliens. arrival was really a fresh story considering how much popular movies focuses on action rather than it's message, arrival explored how can any kind of organism can communicate with the right amount of exchange of information and how lack of understanding something can be as equivalent as not understanding at all.by the ending of arrival, a twist that was unconventional, the language of the aliens was not just a way to relay information but an outlook that once you understood you can perceive time the way they did which was looped like how the aliens spoke louise was able to perceive time as a loop rather than linear which made her able to see the future or rather see it as her past.at a glance it may seem like arrival's main theme was the perception of time is an illusion but that is just a part of the big picture that was about the unconventional ways of relaying information or rather, ""a weak translation of a truth is a lie""",1
228,"Although the movie starts off quite slow, the plot quickly picks up pace and the development and the little bits and peices that we are challenged to put together along with the protagonist lead to a very engaging plot that has you on the edge of your seat due to anticipation for the next events. The twist at the climax just leads you to question everything you ever thought you knew, and it carries a very endearing lesson about life itself.",1
229,"It is refreshing to see an alien movie without a single man pulling the trigger. Dennis Villanueve attempts, successfully, to adress one of the main concerns of today's concerns, the lack of empathy, which leads to the absence of communication and the grand consequences of hating what we don't understand.",1
230,"This movie certainly moved my heart, I couldn't hold back the tears and the rollercoaster of emotions I felt at the cinema when I watched it. As a language student this topic was very touching and wonderful for me. Congratulations.",1
231,"Warning: This is not a creature feature/alienscentric film. Although most may think that from the title/advertising, this is more of a character story that happens to have some awesome aliens. As a lover of all things sci-fi and horror related I went into this thinking one thing, then came out the other side bawling my eyes out......wait, like... WTF..... BAWLING my eyes out. This is a well made movie that has great FX as well great character development. If you can't hang because of the lack of face-huggers, get over it, and stay with it. BUT IF you want straight up alien sci-fi then you may get bored. This movie is more then that. And it is so good.",1
232,"(94/100)Loved the movie, concept, excecution and cast. Denis showed that he can do sci-fi, amd good sci-fi.",1
233,"This movie matters: an unmatched success at integrating emotional inner monologue narration and flashbacks, calmly spoken and seen, with relentlessly building life-or-death tension. Intriguing questions subtly drift into our consciousness as strikingly violent threats surround us--drenched in beauty and answered with mind. This film answers the question: is it still possible for a character's whole person, their existence, to be turned into a minute-to-minute crucial experience for the viewer? Yes, twelve times--Yes!",1
234,"Arrival is, if you'll pardon the expression, one the best cinematic mindf*cks I have received in a while. It's a truly cerebral film, which might not be to everybody's taste. If you're looking for action/adventure Sci-Fi look elsewhere. If you are looking to be engaged, asked to think, pay attention, and read between the lines, you'll find this a plot worthy of your time and effort.",1
235,Not sure if the best sci-fi in years but certainly the best of 2016. I can understand why critics would love this as it does not follow normal popcorn bucket plot lines. Good acting and wonderful cinematography will make sure you enjoy this film.,1
236,"I went in not expecting much. Walked out very surprised and deep in thought. This is one of the shows that you need to watch very closely... or plan on seeing it 2 or three times. Kinda like Inception. I walked out and some people were saying, ""Did I miss something?"" Fortunate for me, I got it right away... which is rare for me. Being a single, full time dad and going through my fair share of trials, this movie had me thinking and pondering for hours after. It really has you asking yourself the final question that Amy Adams asks Jeremy Renner at the end... which is really the point of this movie. There really isn't a poignant, relevant, thought provoking movie out there like this. It's truly one of a kind.",1
237,"Another Win for Denis Villeneuve. If you are complaining that this movie is too slow, then you have to get a life. Not every movie needs action to keep you entertained. This movie is smart and moving. Amy Adams kills it.",1
238,"Denis Villeneuve once again showing us how to do a film, his Arrival is very important for all of movie lovers.Arrival is such a masterpiece, everything in a Villeneuve movie is in Arrival, great perfomances, specially Amy Adams, doing excelent job once again, great and emotional story, incredibly beautiful looking and also outstanding special effects and Alien designs.Denis Villeneuve is here to share with us all how to be a filmmaker and how to make a movie, because he is a important filmmaker and Arrival is the best movie of 2016. I can't wait to see the Blade Runner sequel with Ryan Gosling =)",1
239,"Villenueve makes his own, ingenious version of a close encounter sci- fi adventure. The SFX does not hamper the story, supported by worth roles and a schivering score.",1
240,"Such a beautiful, well-directed film.This director knows what he's doing and it shows.  Nearly every moment hits it's mark/purpose.Amy Adams shines and her genuine, unguarded loving was surprising and refreshing ... it taught me something new about acting (for example when she plays with her daughter near the start of the film).The science man isn't as good, but he's ok in terms of acting.  He's a bit distanced ... I can't really connect with him somehow ... I'm not really sure what he offers to the mission actually (it's mainly Amy who does it all).I was a bit irritated that they had a bird tweeting all the time, when what Amy Adams was trying to do was listen to the sounds the aliens made, so why have a bird tweeting away interfering with the noise?  Can't they get a species of bird that doesn't tweet, as their oxygen-monitor?I didn't really understand the bit where there was gunfire outside the alien ship, but I can look past that, as the rest of the film was so awesome.I loved the bit at the end where you see Amy rewarded for her work ... good on her.Beautiful low-key lighting sometimes in the defence base... beautiful directing and creative choices there.I like how they mainly hide the shape and look of the alien object until Amy actually ventures to it.Nice beautiful pacing ... I like how they immediately go into the ship soon upon landing.I would really like to congratulate the director",1
241,"It's absolutely a jaw dropping experience. Tension building to its finest, great cinematography, great storytelling, great acting. Denis Villeneuve is impressing me more and more.",1
242,"Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is a study of how humans communicate and attempt to understand each other. It examines human relationships that are endured through time, bringing into perspective the intricacies of our language and our interactions with something we don't understand. Only lastly is it a sci-fi movie about extraterrestrial life.Villeneuve has proved to be a director of utmost talent and diversity, but also the one that surrounds himself with equal talent, the Arrival being no different. Young's (Selma; A Most Violent Year) cinematography and style in depicting the research groups enter the mysterious ships produces some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi scenes that have ever been shot. The ships themselves look like timeless, shapeless monoliths. They defy the laws of physics and seem to have their own atmosphere inside. It is truly a grandiose, terrifying, unknown object. The Aliens inside those ships as well as the surroundings seem to raise more questions then answers, while the ships gloriously 'stand' on the backdrop of incredible landscapes, such as oceans, mountains and panoramic plains.Jóhann Jóhannsson is a long time favorite of Villeneuve, producing scores for Sicario and Prisoners. In Arrival his score elevates the scenes, adding tension utilizing mostly classical, timeless sounds. It is some of the best work Johann has done to date.Most importantly however Arrival brings a story that is original, beautifully ambitious and most surprisingly relatable and real. Real enough to believe that if this had happened tomorrow, the outcomes would not have been much different. It might however be that ambition that sometimes separates Arrival from being a true masterpiece.We witnesses the Arrival of the Alien ships through the eyes of a linguist professor, Dr. Louise Banks, convincingly played by Amy Adams. Louise is constantly haunted by a series of flashbacks depicting her daughter's life & early death. It is unknown how this is connected to the Arrival, but this relationship establishes the infrastructure for what Denis is possibly trying to convey, the pain and joy that language, time & communication bring.The aliens don't seem to be hostile; rather, they are trying to say something that a human can't translate. This is where Louise is required, trying to communicate with the aliens to understand the purpose of the arrival. However as the inability to understand grows, so do human frustrations, leading to inevitable disputes, wars and drastic actions.In Arrival we see China as the first country to decide to take actions against the aliens, with no apparent reason. In a comically ironic scene, we see the Chinese leader give the Aliens 24 hours to vacate before starting the attacks. Communications stall as all the research groups go offline, while Banks and her team race against time looking for answers.Some parts of the Arrival echo the Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers. There, Aliens have come and left, leaving behind mysterious 'zones' filled with objects that only 'Stalkers' dare to explore. The metaphor that humans perceive aliens similarly to how insects perceive humans & human objects, imagining a group of ants stumbling upon an abandoned roadside picnic, full of mysterious objects and sights.Yet the message of the Arrival is different. It originates from a kinder place, it projects the need for working together, for using language to try and understand others. In this sense the sci-fi aspect of Arrival can be seen almost as an allegory to say that as humans we owe it to each other to communicate more before taking actions, regardless of how painful the outcomes might be. I fear many will critique The Arrival for this 'kindness', for deviating from a more traditional resolution, but it's refreshing. That a director is able to portray an Alien arrival in such a rational, artistic and melancholic way is a tribute to his strength of character.",1
243,"The movie was provocative, makes you think, and has you asking questions afterwards.  This said, it's not a movie that is easily comprehensible, and can be easily forgettable with time.",1
244,"Great cientific movie, makes you think.The plot and the alien stuff is really well run. Discusses very interesting scientific and philosophical topics and also has background message.",1
245,"My wife and I went to see this on a date night last Saturday, and was wowed by the opening scene, the wild and fun dance number on the overpass. Wonderful!",0
246,"When twelve mysterious spacecraft land in different locations around the world language expert Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is recruited to try to communicate with the occupants and find out why they are here.Cleverly written and anchored by the fantastic Amy Adams Arrival is a terrific film that manages to tell a personal, and emotional, story amongst the sci-fi spectacle and further confirms director Denis Villeneuve as one of the best talents working in Hollywood today.",1
247,The best sci-fi movie of the year and possibly of the decade. Amy Adams was Oscar worthy. The film speaks more about ourselfs and this is why it makes it so important to everybody to watch it,1
248,"Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie is gorgeous, though provoking, compelling, and an emotional ride. For me, that is the full package, it has a slow and thoughtful pace and isn't boring. I highly recommend this!",1
249,"So in my experiences living around the world, I have already come to theorize the concept this movie was based off on. I have for a long time thought about how language affects the way we think. This movie takes that theory to another level and will a little background and experience of linguistics I feel like I got a deeper understanding of this movie. Understanding the underlying concepts of this movie made it a lot more enjoyable. People compare it to Interstellar but this apples and oranges. I will say if you like and understand theories of spacetime you most likely enjoy Interstellar more, same can be said for Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.",1
250,"I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it a lot. It has a slow and building argument that finishes in a metaphysic meditation. All mixed in a context of international tensions and near-war situations. Just excellent!Even if it's different from Interstellar, it gave me the same sensations as a viewer. It isn't as slow as that movie though, but it's still not suited for every spectator. I heard some unhappy people after the movie talking it was boring. You must know if you are the kind of viewer willing to sit, relax and think a little with a movie.",0
251,"It's all too rare these days that studios partner with adept filmmakers with clear visions. Denis Villeneuve is one of those upper-tier directors whose previous works have ranged in genre and style, yet authenticity is central to their premises. This is his best film yet and comes at a time when, perhaps, we need it the most. My favorite film of 2016.",0
252,"It's not sci-fi, it transcends any genre. It's the kind of movie you're hooked from the very beginning and you miss it from the moment you leave the room",0
253,"I loved this movie from its first frame to its last! Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and also made me cry lmao. Amy was robbed of her Oscar nomination!",1
254,"La LLegada es una película que durante estos últimos meses mucha gente a catalogado de obra maestra. Pero que dado a como es la academia de Hollywood nadie ha metido en su quiniela para levantar la estatuilla a mejor filme. Pero es que, ¡La Llegada es un peliculón como la copa de un pino! Y lo es gracias a un magnífico guión durante toda la película. Un guión que trabaja tanto el desarrollo de personajes, como los diálogos y, por supuesto, la trama. Una trama que es de ""Alienígenas"" la hace incluso creíble. Pero sobre todo en esos giros, en el GIRO. Por no hablar de la fotografía que vuelve a ser puro Villenueve, preciosa.Los actores están sensacionales y liderados por Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner y Forest Whitaker (este actor es de mis favoritos). Amy está de Oscar. Increíble su personaje.En definitiva, 'Arrival' es mi película preferida del año 2016, de momento. Y, por comparar me gusta más que Interestellar. Un sobresaliente.",1
255,"There are two types of viewers responses, those that are looking for an Independence Day type of shallow blockbuster, and those who think and feel a bit more deeply and are looking for an interesting story that is heartfelt with surprises. This films delivers to the latter- and I am quite amazed at some of these negative reviews. I will say, you need to stick with this film to the very end- and I could see why some people say it was slow moving, if judging by the first half of the film. I am rarely so positively affected after a film (as in this case) where I will be emailing a friend late at night to recommend it. It is also interesting that most viewers either love or hate this film- no middle ground. I need to learn to love the haters.",1
256,"Such a wonderful movie. It is something I could watch over and over again, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. The special effects are incredible and the ending is one of the best I've had the pleasure of witnessing. Some things did annoy me, like the pacing of the movie, but the cure to that is patience. Just let it tell its story and you will enjoy it.",1
257,"The first mistake you can make before going into this movie, is buying you some popcorn. At first, the movie might feel a little slow, maybe even boring, but this is some part of the message of the movie. It isn't about telling you as much as possible in a short period of time, it want's to tell you a specific thing. In my opinion, it clearly did tell you what exactly what it was ment to tell you, but I won't spoil here, so go watch the movie as soon as possible. I think that the movie can be seen in two ways; Interested in the meta and in the consuming way, while the second way of watching this movie will be a pain in the ass. You won't get the idea of this movie, which doesn't want to tell the most complex story or shows off all of the techninical talents that have been working on this movie. In my opinion this movie is a critic to almost every filmaker in the modern Hollywood, or even to modern filmmaking itself.A movie can give you three things; 1. Good Story/Dramatography, 2. Good technicial craftmanship and, last but not least, 3. A message/a plea.I think this movie gave you a very strong message as a viewer, to the filmmakers it sure was a huge appeal, plus the craft was more than incredible. Some might say, that the camera was too restrained, but I think that this was it's biggest power, though it adapted the speed of the story within it's movements.Just the story was a little of looser to the message, which could end up in a total mess-up, but all in all, even though the story was on the second step this time, as I said in the beginning, the message and appeal was told and it's not even that hard to understand.What I think was good:- Acting by Amy Adams- Cinematography- Direction- Visual Design and flare of the scenes witch unknown species- MusicWhat I think wasn't good/was bad:(- Story is too linear and predictable [in big parts])In total I can't really think of much more than this. There isn't really something that bothered me, there were just things, that weren't as perfect as the things I named, though they might have been great in other movies, if they were used the exact same way as in this movie.Go watch the movie, you won't regred it, at least if you don't plan on having a date watching this movie together for the first time, you shouldn't do it. Just ruins the evening, 'cause neither one of you will be able to think straight anymore after this movie and it's idea of (would be a spoiler).",1
258,"This movie was absolutely disappointing! There are almost no aliens and it''s just about talking problems...it''s a drama movie no scifi movie. No explanations or scientific facts, no suspense or thrilling storyline. Compared to other ""new"" scifi movies like moon, elysium, life etc. it''s a huge disappointment with no story. Totaly overhyped for ""talking about life"" - perhaps a movie for students' club.",0
260,Preposterous ending ruins an otherwise decent movie.  (One of the worst convoluted endings to a movie ever.)  and I really liked the movie up until that point.,1
264,"Though it is much better than a majority of science fiction movies coming out. ""Arrival"" does not stack up to the directors previous works like ""Sicario"" and ""Prisoners"". The writing for the movie just does not have the punch i think it needed. However, looking at the writers previous work, i'm surprised the movie didn't turn out like absolute crap like the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" remake or ""Final Destination 5"".",1
265,"This is a fairly entertaining film which rides primarily on the very capable shoulders of Amy Adams while striving to elevate the film beyond the mundane through the intimate experiences of her character Dr. Louise Banks.  Whether or not it succeeds depends on how one weighs the film's flaws, much the same shopping list as appears in nearly every other ""first contact"" film.  The militarists naturally see the aliens as a threat.  Extremists make an attempt at replacing order with chaos.  The mysterious aliens have a mysterious purpose and provide our Dr. Banks with a mysterious ""gift"" which is never fully explained.  And of course very little is done to illuminate just how exactly language experts go about deciphering an unknown language.But if you like our Dr. Banks you'll probably like the film.  Just don't expect any profound revelations about life, the universe, or much of anything else, including aliens.",1
266,"When I saw this film earlier this year, I had heard it was good by a few people, so I gave it a watch. I loved it. The soundtrack fits the tone of the film very well. And I'm glad some of the soundtrack ideas were carried over into Blade Runner 2049's score. The visuals are awesome too. The CGI feels very polished and well done, which is great. The acting is very good, from pretty much the entire cast you can tell they are trying their best. The script that the film is drawing from is a very good script too. The plot makes some interesting twists and turns during the film's run-time. And the directing is interesting and clever too. So, overall, a great movie that I would recommend to anyone who likes movies.",1

269,"I, like many others, suffer from skepticism with any science fiction that grounds any plot in reality. Star Wars, Star Trek, Guardians, sure I can jump right into the world. But if I am supposed to believe that aliens could be landing next Thursday during my team rundown meeting, you can lose me. Arrival opened with some the strongest cinematography of the season, (mainly because ominous fog is my aesthetic) and I was a believer. I believed in the tension and even the potential reality of close encounters. I was all in, up until the main reveal, which to me seemed ridiculous due to the sheer magnitude of the twist. Even in comparison to some other crazy futuristic sci-fi plots. Despite my wavering beliefs towards the end, it was beautifully shot and exceptionally acted, despite my general lukewarm feelings towards Jeremy Renner, I think we learned that he is best received as a supporting man under a stronger lead in Adams. 8.2/10",1
270,"My review talks about the movie so I guess it is a spolier: I have never felt the need to review a movie before.  Some I really liked, some I disliked.  I am a movie person.  I love them.  Haven watched thousands of movies in my life.  I was super excited to see this movie, but had to wait until it came to video.  The premise of the movie is that Aliens come to earth to share their language because somehow that gives you the ability to see into the future....sorry they lost me right there.  Soo many plot holes.  What do the ships do when they get someone to learn their language?  Of that's right they simply fade away.  That is really it.  I know their is a theory out there about being able to see the future or something and while I am a huge fan of theories revolving around what the human brain can accomplish the idea that learning a language allows time travel is a little too big of a stretch IMO.  The entire political angle is also over acted and comical really.  I have never seen a movie that got such praise be one that I found so incomplete..almost comical in the holes the writer left.  I can only shake my head.  First review on this site and most likely the last unless some other extremely mediocre movie gets immense praise.  And just for the record the parts with Amy Adams and her child in the movie are extremely heartfelt.  Having 3 kids of my own those scenes did tug on my heart strings, but it did nothing to help the score of the movie from my perspective.",0
271,"I give this movie some credit for holding my attention for most of the running time.  Unfortunately by the end it completely falls apart.  Worse still, it makes many of the supporting characters dumb just to pretend the main characters are intelligent.  I guess worth a rental but ultimately unsatisfying.",0
272,"No me esperaba ese final, bastante abstracto pero te hace sentir que es bastante insípida y tediosa la historia, avanza muy lento y al final con una soluciona que no dice nada.",1
273,"This writer gets no cred on the street I live on. Read ""Story of your life"" by Ted Chaing. Get real with yourself. Look in the mirror dogdamnit.",1
278,The film is visually stunning. I thought the innovative camera work and use of light offer something new and unexpected by extending the disorientating experience to the audience. The story is engaging and a unique take on the traditional alien invasion flick but the narrative changes direction suddenly towards the end resulting in a lackluster conclusion that bothered me.,1
280,"At half way through the movie it felt terribly boring and it was like just the quest to find the signs of aliens but that ending changed my opinion suddenly it went to the peak!Awesome score since start of the film i was too much into the music awesome score,acting.most of time it felt boring even though the suspense of whats aliens try to tell and ending makes it a good movie!",1
281,It was a short story and a great one at that. So it's understandable that the movie makers have to fill in details. It's in those details that lessen this movie for me.,1
