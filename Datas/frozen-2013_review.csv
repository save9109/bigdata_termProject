0,"Frozen is fantastic. Flawless animation and terrific songs combine to make it the best Disney movie in a decade, as well as one of the funniest. This is one I will watch over and over.",1
1,"While we all love Disney and the happiness it brings to everyone, sometimes it over-shows ideals to young girls that might not come true in reality. ""Frozen"" addresses the meaning of love right from the start, with an adult Anna, who  being separated from reality for her entire life  has no idea what love truly means. .As an avid Disney fan, and as someone with two sisters, this is a movie that people of all ages will love to see.",1
2,"I love CGI animation movies since I saw Toy Story in 1995, and I must say this is by far the worst I've ever seen! After Pixar excellent pieces in the 90s and 00s, as well as the Shrek series, you would have thought that the era of purely child-oriented, one-dimensional, cheesy fairy tale princess stories interrupted by musical pieces is clearly over. Apparently not. I am frankly shocked how many raving reviews this calculated, heartless and unfunny movie got both from critics and users. Clearly something must be wrong with my taste. The initial premise of separating the sisters is totally stupid, the anticlimax in the middle feels forced and unbelievable, there is no real villain, the romance feels incredibly stale, and the music is annoying as hell (even though so forgettable I couldn't remember any of the tunes 30 min later). This is a huge step back for the genre of animated movies, and the saddest thing is that with these kind of reviews, we're gonna see more of this garbage in the future.",0
3,"Having loved Tangled, and seeing all those glowing reviews for Frozen I fully expected to enjoy this one, but alas I was severely let down by it. I have two major problems with Frozen: the story and the characters. Simply put, they're mediocre. Where Tangled had a very funny and well developed heroin, Frozen tries to juggle two heroins and fails miserably at it. None of them end up being developed at all, they come across as very generic and forgettable, which is not what you would want in a movie centered on characters. Same thing with the supporting characters, all very bland and generic except for Olaf, he's hilarious. Next the story, it's an absolute mess. In the first 20 mins, we experience three major dramatic moments and a 15 year time jump. Only to then have the rest of the movie with NOTHING going on until the last 20 mins. There's also zero world building, we see nothing of the world or the people inhabiting it, whereas in Tangled we did get to travel across the world and go on an exciting adventure with our characters. Here we see  a castle and a mountain, and that's it. The themes of the story are also muddled and don't come through at all like in Brave for example. In the end Frozen felt rushed, unfocused and boring. A major step backward for Disney.",0
4,"Holy hell what an over-hyped movie.  My kids love it but they can't even do basic math or even read a map.  Disney sure did cop out with the ""no bad guys"" throughout most of the movie and that the villains were basically created out of thin air at the end.  They should have gone with Walt's original plan to have the Ice Queen as the bad guy.  We keep paying for BS like this and they're just going to keep making it...",0
6,"""Frozen"" is a fantastic story about two sisters and the power of the love between them. It is about letting go, being yourself, and having faith in someone even though they don’t have faith in themselves. All great messages for people to live by. The themes and moral are handled well through the film and not once does it become preachy or grating. The film is superbly directed with great attention to the script and character development. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee keep us on our toes by slipping in some smart humor and just as intelligently placed moments of true emotions. The film is paced pretty well, but in certain key moments, particularly the ending, it tends to rush through it. However, it’s not rushed in a jarring way, but I did wish the film would slow down at certain points. A sharp script gives us well rounded characters and themes that we can all learn from. The two leads are given equal attention to and their relationship is handled incredibly well, especially in the intro of the film. The beginning of the film does a great job of introducing the characters and setting up their relationship. I was literally tearing up because of how real and honest the bond between the sisters were in the beginning and throughout the rest of the movie. Characters are great in this film. Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, is one of  the two leads. She’s probably the most awkward and quirky Disney princess we’ve ever had. She’s a bit of a spazz, always tripping or bumping into things and fumbling over her words when she’s nervous. It’s quite cute and a joy to watch such an honest and real character. A lot of her flightiness comes from her being sheltered in a castle for such a long time with little interaction with other people. However, she’s also determined and very open to meeting new people and helping her friends. Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, the other lead is the complete opposite of Anna. She’s more reserved and her actions are always calculated to a tee. She has magical powers, but due to an incident that happened when she was younger, she fears that people will loath her for her gift. She doesn’t talk as much and usually prefers to be alone. The relationship between the two is really the highlight and it is heart breaking to see them rift away. One last character that I want to mention is Olaf. This character is probably the most worrisome part about the film for most people as Disney can sometimes be hit or miss with their side characters. However, here we have a huge hit with Olaf. He’s a bit oblivious, but he’s also incredibly likable and sweet. He gets some of the best lines in the movie and he’s just a joy to watch because he doesn’t try to steal the spot light from what’s actually important. The rest of the characters are great and defined very well. The animation in the film is gorgeous. The characters move fluidly and the expressions on their faces are where some of the most intense emotions of the film come from. Elsa’s magical powers are used well and there is both beauty and danger to it. The colors are vibrant and the use of blues and other colder colors really makes us feel the chills of the eternal winter. Like many classic Disney movies, this one is also a musical and a great one at that. The musical numbers are some of the best since the 90s films. Robert and Kristen Lopez did an amazing job with the soundtrack. The songs range from ballads to showstoppers to sincere to fun, but not one song feels out of place or stops the movies progression. My two favorite songs are “For the First Time In Forever” and “Let It Go,” both are powerful ballads that really give us a sense of what the characters are like and what they want. “For the First Time In Forever” is a duet between Anna and Elsa. I enjoy the contrasting lyrics as Anna is excited and Elsa is more afraid of her inauguration. “Let It Go” is the big showstopping ballad about Elsa, finally liberating herself from her frustrations. Idina Menzels’s voice is so powerful that I had goosebumps by the end of it. The rest of the songs are great as well and quite memorable with strong lyrics and powerful accompanying music. I bet you’ll be humming and singing the songs long after watching the film. Overall, “Frozen” is a magnificent film filled with gorgeous animation, relatable and well-defined characters, toe tapping music, and a story that will melt even the coldest of hearts. Some people might be upset that their isn’t a strong central villain in this film, but I think it is a plus because then we can focus on the struggles and strains between Anna and Elsa. It is easily the best animated film of 2013 and a future classic that we’ll all watch over and over again. I give it 4.5/5, beautiful movie from start to finish.",1
7,"I've read some critics of the movie and I must say there's a bit of everything here. It's true that the constant singing gets annoying after a while, but there's actually a lot of merit with the villain turning out to be prince Hans. Plus, the love between Anna and Kristoff doesn't get to be the most important relationship in the movie which is quite an achievement for Disney movies. At the end, the little princess and the ice trader end up being just a normal couple which will not necessarily become a marriage. So, despite the recoil with the singing, this movie brings a lot of new things, and breaks with many of Disney's patterns. A great movie without doubt.",1
8,"This film is exactly what a Disney film should be, cheesy, cute, beautiful and charismatic with a collection of fantastically catchy songs, lovable characters and a moral at the end.It's a refreshing plot with a satisfying ending and though i went into the movie fearing the worst considering recent animated films that have come out, i was happily shown i had nothing to fear.I love Disney, but i have to say this is perhaps their best musical film since Beauty and the Beast and i can easily see it becoming a classic.Whether you have kids, are a kid, or just have a kid in your heart you need to see this film. Couple of notes, this film is stunning to look at, with some of the best digital snow you'll ever see. Also the character models are wonderful managing the style of Disney whilst looking like completely original designs. The casting is phenomenal with no weak performances to be found. THIS IS WHERE THE SPOILERS KICK IN: People have written some negative reviews challenging these aspects of the plot and i want to put right what they said. Elsa is not cursed, she was born with her magic, it is never 'explained' because no one in the film understands it themselves. The simple fact is the worlds that Disney create are magical. Also Elsa does not ignore her sister for no reason, she distances herself to avoid hurting her again like she does at the start of the film. Of course there are small plot holes around the place, but none that in any way effect the enjoyment of the film. The ONE complaint i have is that they didn't utilize having Jonathon Groff in the film nearly enough, give him more songs!!!!",1
9,"Frozen is Disney's best animated movie since The Lion King with its refreshing musical numbers, funny yet touching script and its likable characters.o",1
11,"The theme of Treason in Disney Frozen - A major imporatance. Among others, Treason is a major theme of the movie. It has a tad of importance in bringing tension to the story. It is the gateway used to captivate and avails the audience attention. There are three main causes of treason in Frozen; Elsa’s ambiguous treason to the sisterly love between her and Anna, Arendelle’s miscomprehension of Elsa’s attitude, and Hans’s treason towards Anna. The first impression of treason in Frozen plays an important part by which the story unfolds to the climax as it helps the audience to better understand Elsa’s fear, overprotective character and personality. It happens at the end of the coronation day when Elsa neglects Anna’s pretense of true love and asks her to leave Arendelle. At this moment, we are able to better understand the gap in the relation they share since Anna’s childhood accident.  This is in fact the result of the translucent but real love that Elsa has for her younger sister. Her excessive want of protecting Anna from her powers makes her the reckless, inappropriate and non-caring sister for Anna especially at this moment of the film. The most important act of treason which hovers around the climax of the movie though is Arendelle’s miscomprehension and reject of their newly coronated Queen whom they consider as a terrible monster and threat for the Kingdom. The way Arendelle responds to Elsa adds up to her fear which causes her to escape the Kingdom, to settle and alone herself on the North Mountains where she believes to be free and evacuates her long concealed fear. This feeling of treason continues to exist till the end of the sequel when she is imprisoned and sentence to death by Prince Hans. Further in treason, Hans clearly shows his real motivation of loving Anna when he refuses to kiss the latter in hope that she will die since she has been struck to the heart by Elsa. By this means would make him heir, hope and King of Arendelle.  This act of treason helps to expand before its conclusion one of the major theme which is Love. It gives much more meaning to Anna and Hans’ song “Love Is An Open Door.” Anna’s quest for affectionate love and Hans’ who seeks only in establishing himself in a Kingdom completely outmatch the audiences’ hope of true love one might thing the two of them would be sharing. Hans’s treason also provides scope for the newly discovered but early developing true love between Kristoff and Anna. Treason is not only a theme which covers the plot but also an important feature which makes the conclusion of the movie much more beautiful as it is said that “Love will thaw.” Certainly, at the end Love prevails upon treason which seems more like a mere oblivion in the conclusion of the movie.",1
12,"Despite its conclusion which doesn't reach its potential,Frozen remains a rock solid addition to the Disney canon with a handful of memorable songs, interesting characters and a refreshing tale of love.",1
13,"What is perfect about ""Frozen"" is that it brings back the classic Disney Magic, phenomenal music and great script that warms the heart. The opening song immediately grabs audiences attention, similarly the same effect as in ""The Lion King."" The soundtrack is flawless, the characters are fun and relatable and the overall design is stunning.",1
16,One of the most overrated movies in history frozen is easily Disneys worst movie frozen is just another generic princess movie at least big hero 6 and zootopia saved my interest for non marvel Disney movies,0
17,"Quite possibly the best regular Disney movie ever made. This is a groundbreaking movie for Disney and not only is the story fun and creative, but the music is amazing itself. You may find yourself singing the songs long after you've left the theater.",1
18,Stunning exploding-ice visuals that renew your faith in computer animation. Soul-rousing musical numbers that you've likely heard at least one hundred times already. A compelling story that sends an honest message about the nature of love. Quite possible Disney's best movie yet (Not counting Pixar). Well done.,1
19,"It is an amazing movie for any age. Good story, good characters, and amazing songs. Notice how every single bad review about this movie has been about it being a ""musical"". Personally I loved every song and think they were beautifully done. Not to mention that the animations for the movie are amazing. As an 18 year old male I can honestly say that I loved the move and would love to see it again before it leaves theaters.",1
20,"Frozen is a solid step forward for Disney with a strong plot, great characters, memorable songs, and impressive animation despite its reserved climax.",1
21,"Long time since I got this kind of Disney feeling from a movie. Great animation, music, songs, characters, and overall atmosphere and character development.",1
22,"Like vintage mythical animations of Disney had done, Frozen will gift a fond memory for audience long after they leave the cinema. It's filled with stuffs childhood memory is made of; loveable characters, witty humor, great soundtracks and pleasant graphic. A few 3D animations have seen success with the newer technology, but Frozen tops them all with near magical feel which is almost forgotten in recent years. This is one movie that everyone, despite age and preference, can universally enjoy. The art has certain Disney aesthetic look; it's the best fusion of the old 2D nuance in 3D setting they've created so far. Games and other movies have superior graphic prowess, but there's something subtly captivating about Frozen's art direction. With plenty purplish azure dye in the transparent ice and quite elaborate designs in its detail, it's easy to appreciate the soft yet intricate wintery nature. The use of 3D effect helps the surreal environment, as the movie progresses the visual adapts to its tricky details, such as the falling snow, into astute part of the story. Its ice castle and vast snowy plain give feeling of majesty and also a hint of loneliness. Characters are simply loveable. Anna, the younger princess, is seriously lacking grace, but her brash and naive demeanor will surely captivate audience. She's downright adorable; it's a near impossible feat not to cheer for her. Elsa, the older one, is more mature and restricted. Her character has the most self-doubt and sadness; in a way the movie is about finding one self and acceptance from others, two things that might not go hand in hand, Elsa embodies the struggle perfectly. It's not often there are two princesses involved, however they have their own expressive personalities and their sisterhood bond is an uncanny delight. Kristoff as the rugged stud provides some chuckles and rather odd pauper prince role. He appears to have the most common sense and it's pretty funny to see him interact with odder characters. Sven, the reindeer, and Olaf, the magical little snow man, have plenty of humor amongst them. Disney always has the humor relief role, this time the honor goes to Olaf, who is ridiculously naive down to a life threatening fault. His lines are full of puns, out of place clichés and awkward impeccable timing. He delivers more laughs than I expected his corny appearance could do. The writing is absolutely superb, both for the tender moments, the humorous ones and also the musical soundtracks. Songs are beautifully made, they fit the moments amazingly and the cast deliver fantastic job performing them. It's been a while since an animated movie with such excellent heartwarming story, memorable characters and brilliant artwork grace the theater. If one compares Frozen to Lion King, Mulan, Tarzan or any other Disney classics, they wouldn't be wrong. Frozen is a timeless journey.",1
23,"I'm not a huge fan of animated movies, and gone to cinema because friend told me so but I'm actually grateful.It's one of the best things I've seen ever. It deals with freedom, or rather lack of it, love, fear, loneliness, and duty. It's terrifingly deep even for disney.Moreover, a lot of great humor, catching songs, great visuals, and really, really good 3D effects.Full 10/10 I'd not change a thing in it. Watch it, you won't regret these few bucks.",1
24,"One of the two best movies I've seen in quite a while (along with Catching Fire). It has spectacular visuals down to even the most minute details. The story was very well focused, without seeming rushed. The jokes were funny, but used in proper moderation. The voice acting perfectly conveyed the emotions of the piece, and so did the animation. The songs were frequently amazing, especially when Idina Menzel sang, but Kristen Bell did a shockingly good job singing as well. I loved both of them as fitting their characters as well. Elsa (Idina) and Anna (Kristen) are two of my favorite characters in an animated movie ever. I only expected to see a pretty good movie, but even if I had sky high expectations, it would have exceeded them. This movie restores my faith in Disney's animated movies. I really can't say enough good things about it. Watch this movie.",1
25,"I thought Frozen was a great experience in the cinema. The journey that Elsa and Anna go through is worthwhile trip after an arguably shaky first twenty minutes Once it gets going it really takes off  my two daughters (4 & 7) were transfixed throughout and discussed the sisters on the long journey home For my own tastes, I thought some of the musical numbers were a bit average (although a couple of great ones) but I can't remember the last time I was so entranced by truly wonderful animation",1
26,"Somehow Disney has made a throwback movie that felt both new and a classic at the same time.  I was impressed with the simple nature of the characters and the heartfelt storyline.  Although the scope gets rather big at the end, what I really liked about this movie was the absence of a truly evil main character.  Having a character that is pure evil, driving the plot, often removes the feeling of hope and warmth that comes through clearly in Frozen.  This is a great movie for all ages, fun, beautiful to watch and wonderful songs to top it off.",1
27,"Great animation and music, wonderful story.   The song ""Let It Go"" is powerful and moving.  This wasn't my first choice when my wife were deciding which movie to go to but I'm glad I saw it.  Thoroughly enjoyable.",1
28,I agree the storyline is unique and creative the songs had original melody and the characters had original personalities however the chink in it was that olaf is a trying hard comedian at least in my opinion...,1
29,"The whole movie basically makes me really irritating and frustrated, especially when you expect a Disney animated movie to actually deliver the quality of a Disney film. The characters and the songs all make my cringe and that made me not want to watch this movie again. Disappointing.",0
30,"Beautifully animated, wonderfully crafted music, great voice work, and also intensely re-watchable, Disney's ""Frozen"" is a brilliant, brilliant movie.",1
31,"Okay let me say this. This movie is a guilty pleasure to me but I will explain why. I did enjoy the movie and BUT still, there are a couple of things that bothered me while watching. I think the visuals are really stunning. It feels like they put a lot of effort, time and even magic into the graphic designs of this movie. Kristen Bell is awesome as Anna and has a wonderful singing voice. I think the problem I have with this movie is on the story level.It feels like the writers didn't quite know where to go with this movie. It has no clear direction and purpose from the start. Of course, it is difficult to have a story with two main characters so it does not really 'work' that way. Although I really LOVE Anna as a character, maybe focusing on Elsa controlling her powers would have been better. Most of the characters are well done but it takes more than good characters to make a good story and I thought this animation was an example of that. I'm somewhat disappointed in the way they handle (or don't handle) pay-offs in this movie. Like Kristoff's obsession with ice should wind him up with Elsa, you would think... And there's the cool love song between Anna and Hans before... all of a sudden he turns out to be evil. I love a good twist in a movie but a twist should be traceable if you watch the movie again. There's absolutely no reason why Hans should have been a bad guy since Anna met him completely by accident. And she's not even the crown princess. So how do you motivate it to be premeditated foul play then? This felt a bit like lazy writing to me. ""Let's make him evil all of a sudden so she can date the other guy without remorse."" And why would Hans lock Elsa up if he could have killed her. He must have been planning to anyway as he always intended to become king and had no knowledge of Elsa's powers or what would happen. Why lock her up and let her escape? Why lock Anna up and tell everyone she's dead too soon. Everybody knows that's bound to lead to troubles. If one of the themes of the movie is True Love, then true love should be celebrated by cool songs, not false love. Also, there is little romantic tension between Anna and Kristoff, other than her rational consideration that he might love her because the frozen puppet tells her so (based on what actually? And what's the function of the puppet other than obvious 'comic' relief and potential for expensive children's toys?). They want to put so many perspectives in this movie, so many stories, that they lose track of the main story. And what is the main story anyway? Is it a classic love story? Is it the story of two sisters who care about each other? Or is it about Elsa trying to manage her powers and a kingdom? I would say it's mainly about those last two and in that case, focusing on Elsa would probably have made more sense. What if she had run away and had ended up traveling with Kristoff? What if in the meanwhile, Anna, who was never meant to become queen was having trouble handling an entire kingdom with the product of a day-long relationship? That would have made an interesting story. Having some match-making trolls sing a forced relationship into being doesn't quite do the trick for me. But hey, maybe I'm too critical. I notice a lot of people simply loved this story and that's a good thing! For me, though, there were a lot of loose ends in this story that made it difficult to really feel for the characters. If I compare this movie to Tangled, I think it doesn't match that level of storytelling by far. The story of Rapunzel was strikingly better written (even improved the original a lot), the lyrics were awesome while the songs in Frozen were rather forgettable. I noticed Alan Menken did not compose the music for Frozen only after I watched it and I thought: ""Yeah, that makes sense"". You have this fairy tale frozen wasteland that could have had a soundtrack like Edward Scissorhands or Narnia and yet you don't quite feel the magic. I watched Enchanted the day before, another one that remains great after many times. The music of Enchanted is witty and wonderful and the story is full of great humor and has a perfect pacing and structure. Frozen made me discover once again that great narrative build-up and Alan Menken make an unforgettable Disney movie. Without those ingredients, you get a fun Disney movie that does not even closely compare to the others when it comes to emotional impact and music. Also, I think the message this movie sends (if that is important at all) is a rather cynical one. Sure, it's great that true love is that between sisters for once (no big original surprise for me while watching). But basically it votes for love forced by shared experience and silly troll songs and states that love on first sight doesn't exist. Still, Frozen is definitely a 'to watch' because it looks gorgeous! Although I wonder if the makers used subliminal messages or hypnosis to cause this fan hysteria. Best Disney ever? Definitely NOT for me.",1
32,"This movie is so overrated. The pilot make me confuse. I just don't get it: how did Elsa get her power, how can the rocky -thingies  talk and have magical power , why can Olaf talk. This movie is all about the music.",0
33,I loved this movie & when I saw it I just had to write a review about. You can honestly go see this movie by yourself like I did or take your kids  Either wa y you'll enjoy it and its amazing graphics. Not to mention the funny moments.,1
34,"Let It Go...one of the infectious movie soundtrack since 'My Heart will Go On', of Titanic fame, buoyed this picture...the best Walt Disney animated film, outside of Pixar, since the Lion King. After more than months, it's still a hit in Japan. People will get sick of it, but it is a great film..filled with great characters, TWO princesses of all things, and great songs. It also updates the Disney formula to the modern age..the princesses are definetelly more independent, not relying on their Prince Charming to save the day. Great entertainment.",1
35,"Beautiful animation, a masterpiece. A very unique plot that is not cliche at all. The soundtrack is also fantastic! Disney has produced another ageless film!",1
36,"'Frozen' reminds you of what cinema is about: an original, dramatic story, loveable characters who almost come to life and beautiful images that make you wish you were there.argonautis.eu",1
37,"This movie was just...wow. Everything is simply perfect. The music is phenomenal, the voice-acting and singing is top-notch, the animation is incredible, there's a huge plot twist towards the end you won't see coming, and it's simply one of the most hilarious movies I've watched in the past 5 years. There's really not much else to say other than ""go see it as soon as you can"". I don't care how old you are; this movie is a must-see.",1
38,"A charming, delightful movie. Not in the same league as Beauty and Beast (what animated movie is?) but a solid addition to the Disney canon, which continues an interesting evolution in their approach. The plot is little weak, but the characters are fine and the songs are good to excellent. Kristin Bell's Anna is a tsunami of adorableness  I hope to see a lot more animation voice work from her. Her character has a delightful song-and-dance number early on that is staged exactly like in a 1940s romantic comedy (I suspect it was actually performed that way live and shot in motion capture). One bit that is extremely effective, but also an obviously calculated central element of the project, was Idina Menzel's Elsa delivering a knock-em dead, show stopping, power ballad ""Let it Go"". The parallels to her ""Defying Gravity"" in Wicked are blatant, the theme of the song is identical (a magical girl deciding not to hide her power any longer and let the chips fall as they may). Clearly the whole project was built around her and this song. But if you don't see the movie watch ""Let it Go"" on YouTube. Its that good. Disney's evolution away from the old-fashioned (and tired, out-dated) girl-seeking-true-love story line continues. In Brave we saw the princess reject the need for romance (at least, right away). Here they tease and confuse the audience with TWO possible love interests for Anna, while in the end going in an entirely different, and emotionally satisfying direction. The goofy animated snowman Olaf, whom I had sort of dreaded from the promotions, turned out to be delightful with a very funny song, and the source of some good lines from other characters. (The Mickey Mouse short before the film... ran too long. Once the 3-D gimmick was revealed it got old fast, very fast, with a surprisingly unimaginative stagnant repetitive action sequence. I hope these shorts become standard with the regular feature, there are few showcases for short films, but I hope in the future they are up to the standard of the positively stellar Paper Man.)",1
39,"Excellent. The soundtrack was very memorable, the humor was well done and didn't detract from the plot, and the story was great. What more can be said? Disney has finally remembered how to make a good movie. Highly recommend this.",1
40,"Frozen oozes with fancy computer generated imaging and high detail close ups of crystal snowflakes. The amount of eye candy in this movie explodes as even the minute of details can be seen. Viewers will be in for a ride as Disney takes its watchers on a journey to a Scandinavian world where Princess / Queen Elsa has insurmountable power to create objects out of thin air with snow and ice but becomes lonesome and isolated due to her gifts and Princess Anna who can be seen as the cheerful gullible type that turns into a brave heroine. The movie has a number of songs that makes Frozen a musical. They set the tone very well between the growing up scene of ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"", to the fun and lackadaisical ""In Summer"" sang by  Olaf. As well thought out as the pieces go, there were several places in the movie where the song's execution were awkwardly put in. Some examples of this would be when Anna reaches the ice castle and where it was a serious confrontation only to be changed forcibly by the introduction of a song. Those moments of confrontations where it should further develop the plot were stained by some of the song pieces. Otherwise, the vast majority of songs and their placements were well executed. The story was also a nice change in pace from the modern Disney franchise movies. The movie sets a good tone that family, specifically sisterhood, is the most powerful force of all that can get through any hardships. If there was anything that can be felt out of equilibrium it would be the beginning wahere it felt rushed to establish why Elsa / Anna never grew up together for the vast majority of their childhood. The plot twists weren't that surprisingly and many scenes were ""Disney-fied"" (i.e.- person X doesn't get murdered even though they tried to murder person Y, or an impossible event happen where someone shouldn't be able to survive, survives). Overall it was still a very entertaining story. Frozen tops the chart of many modern animation movies. It excels not only in its graphical fidelity and the story telling; albeit, a little rough on some areas. It was still an excellent movie that shouldn't be missed on the 4K digital screens of movie theaters or IMAX/3D. Parsimony gives this movie a 9/10.",1
41,"All I got to say, watch this movie. You will not regret it. The songs are great, the characters are great, the story is one of Disney's best and the animation in smooth and nicely styled like Pixar movies. It sure teaches little girls not to be blind about love and such. Not going to spoil anything though. And for the first time in forever, you should watch this movie.",1
42,Overall it was a decent Disney movie that I believe will become a Disney classic.  The only issue I really had was there was too much singing but besides that it was a great movie.  Great plot that kept you involved until the end. This movie shows the power of Disney and how relevant they still are.  Even though there are too many songs I still believe the song choice is great.  Besides all that this movie has a great comic twist that is regressing to the movie itself.  Not the best Disney movie but one that will go down as a classic.,1

Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell both did phenomenal jobs voice acting Elsa and Anna.  Josh Gad's character Olaf, also added a nice infusion of comedy into this amazing movie.",1
45,"Disney has really out done themselves with this movie. Hands down one of the best films in a very long time from the studio. In my opinion, way better then The Lion King. One of the best animated films ever, really one of the best films of all time.",1
47,"Amazing animation, music, songs, characters, and story...all top notch. Disney Renaissance 2.0 This film along with Tangled seals it. Disney is definitely back. Looks like a new generation gets to experience what the 90's brought us from the studio.",1

49,"I'm a HUGE Disney fan, but this movie is the worst! I was so disappointed when I walked out of the theater in December that I haven't seen it again since. The movie and its songs are so overrated. ""The best Disney movie since The Lion King""???? Yeah, right! It wasn't even the best movie of 2013!! Absolute trash. And don't even get me started on the terrible morals in this movie. Encouraging girls to cheat on their boyfriend/fiancé? Stay classy, Frozen.",0
50,"Okay so I went in with low expectations because the commercials just gave me that feeling it wasn't going to be good. Granted it did say musical so when I finally sat down to watch it I forced myself to be optimistic thinking it might be like a typical disney musical which end up good (ex: Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc) but I was let down and if I could give a negative score I would. I have no idea how so many people like it but whatever. Although the animation is decent (it's pixar) and the scenery is nice those are its only saving graces and it's not enough. The constant singing by people who can't sing and the songs about nothing important are grating and annoying. In the opening sequence of about 20 minutes  (there are three dramatic moments in this amount of time btw) into the movie there are 4 songs and only one of them should have been there. Due to being annoyed I can't find myself able to care about the characters and although I ended up turning it off after 20 minutes I am going to force myself to watch it until the end. I can tell right now however that the characters will be severely under-developed due to all the singing which will prevent you from getting to know them and feel for them. As for the story.... from what I've heard it's very bland and the supporting characters that have been introduced already are forgettable.... In short, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they're up for a bit of torture...especially if they're a musician as the songs compared to the normal quality of Disney songs are very poor and a major step backwards. Of course the whole thing seems like a major step backwards for Disney.",0
51,"The prologue of the movie is the best piece of cinema in quite some time. It is well-paced, conveys lots of information to set up the story, and is a rollercoaster of emotions. Elsa injured Anna, Anna's memories erased, Elsa have to conceal her powers, the sisters grows apart, Elsa losing control of her powers, Anna growing lonely, their parents died; all that plot points happened in around FIVE minutes!  and then there's that amazing music behind the sequence that made the experience so much better. The animation is great, it's an improvement since Tangled and Wreck It Ralph. The voices were great. The music is great, some of the songs are really good (some layered with subtext which you could only understand on a second viewing), while some I just thought is a bit unnecessary. The biggest problem of this movie is the inconsistency in quality. The first 30 mins of this movie is just superb, while the rest of the movie just couldn't live up to the expectations set by them. (Don't worry, they're still good; just not THAT good.) The beginning of a movie is supposed to set the tone of the entire movie; the first half hour is fast-paced, serious, dramatic, and wonderful, then you go from that to basically just two people walking in the snow. (I'll have to admit that I may be a bit biased on this, as I'm more concerned about Elsa than Anna; her story/character is just more interesting.) Also, due to the dramatic tone set by the beginning of the movie, some comedy (like Olaf's, even though how funny he is) feels a bit out of place. Anyway, great movie. A bit inconsistent in quality/tone in some parts, but overall pretty good. The songs are really good and I end up listening to the soundtrack a lot soon after watching the movie.",1
52,Disney animation has done it again.  Frozen is easily the best animation of 2013 and with Wreck-it Ralph from last year Disney not Pixar gets top billing. A,1
53,"Disney is back with ""Frozen"". I'm very glad with Walt Disney Pictures because they are showing us that they're working hard with a renewed face. ""Tangled"", ""Winnie the Pooh"" and ""Wreck-It, Ralph!"" are truly jewels but ""Frozen"" is The Jewel. It's a perfect cyrcle, ""Frozen"" seems a Broadway musical. Now, I hope with Disney.",1
54,"The early marketing made me think that Frozen was just a cash grab for Disney. While I thought the clip with the snowman and the reindeer was funny, it felt like Disney was making a B-Grade animation that would be good for kids, but no one else. Then the full trailers came out, and I heard the musical numbers, and I got a taste for the story, and suddenly, I was hooked. I could not wait for this movie. The first two acts of this movie were amazing. I was brought into the world of Arendelle, and into the lives of estranged sisters Anna and Elsa, whom were compelling enough for me to really care about them, and what happens to them. The song ""The First Time in Forever"" really stood out to me as one of the highlights of the movie, but the real show stopper was the song ""Let it Go"", preformed by Idina Menzel (Elsa). It is a beautifully written, beautifully preformed song. Another high point for the movie was the snowman Olaf, who shows up during the second act, and brings most of the movie's humor. The only problem I had with Frozen was it's third act, or more specifically, the second half of the third act seemed very rushed, and felt like a quick, easy wrap up to an otherwise great movie. Overall, Frozen is a very good animation, not just for kids, but for adults as well. It brings back some of that Disney magic you felt as a kid, and leaves you smiling.",1
55,Frozen is by far the the best animated movie I have seen in a long time. They have blended music and action perfectly. The attention to detail is amazing. There are some predictable moments but over all it is amazing.,1
56,"Disney's latest takes place in the fjords, where the newly-crowned queen freezes the entire country with her powers. Her sister sets out with burly Olaf to save the day. The plot moves quickly with lots of action and a few short, tuneful songs. The characters have pluck and the wacky snowman (voiced by Josh Gad) is the latest delightful Disney sidekick. What stands out most is the animation: simply beautiful ice and snow design, lovely lighting and wonderful inventiveness. The story is romantic and adult, but the pace, visuals and personality may help it appeal to kids. There's a clever opening short featuring an early Mickey Mouse AND one last gag after the credits.",1
57,"Disney's latest animated princess tale feel different from their past works. It feels like a more mature work thanks to it's sadder and somewhat darker tale than the average animated Disney movie. While this will help it become one that older audiences can enjoy just as much as the younger ones, it also leads to a lot of slow and sometimes boring moments. Truly this leads to the movie having a noticeable slow start, but it does pick up fairly quickly. There are also a lot more musical numbers than I was expecting. The first half of the movie ends up coming off as a musical until the songs almost completely disappear from the second half. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is one of the factors that lead to the movie feeling somewhat disjointed. That being said the typical Disney magic does help the movie succeed in the end. With it's great story, charming characters, funny moments, and top-notch animation, the movie does prove to be an enjoyable experience. Not all of it's parts come together well in the end, but overall I did enjoy it. It personally will never stand among one of Disney's best movies in my eyes, but the moments where it's tale defies what you would expect form it make it enjoyable and occasionally impressive. You would also have to be dead not to laugh at Olaf. So in the end this is yet another animated Disney movie that proves to be worth the watch, even if it does have it's flaws.",1
58,"An updating of the Snow Queen fairytale this is a charming Disney animation that harks back to the glory days of Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Great characterisation, with two strong female leads, and catchy songs, the only way it could be improved would be with a lot more Olaf",1
59,Frozen is one of the best Disney releases in a long time and reminds you of what they are capable of. The story is interesting and the songs make the movie a delightful experience.,1
60,"It looks like the whole world wants to bring the kid out in me between Christmas, Hanukah, Santa Claus, “Elf” the touring Broadway musical, the touring company of “The Wizard of Oz” not to mention the gifts and all the good wishes. How could you walk around without a smile on your face? Should none of that help run to see Walt Disney’s “Frozen” “Frozen” is loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson’s “The Snow Queen” going a few steps further with the modern animation available today. This is a movie  ready for a big, wonderful Broadway stage.  There are original songs written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez with “Let It Go” sung by Idina Menzel and “Tomorrow For the First Time Forever” sung by Menzel and Kristen Bell particular standouts. The screenwriter Jennifer Lee, working on the story by her, Chris Buck and Shane Morris, present a princess, Elsa (Idina Menzel) who becomes a queen, and her sister Anna (Kristen Bell), adding two more memorable female figures to stand beside Cinderella, Snow White in the canon of  Walt Disney’s loving, lovable and strong women. What would a Disney film be without some lovable creatures? “Frozen” has them but I want my own Olaf the snowman (voiced by Josh Gad) and the reindeer Sven or I’ll even settle for one of the trolls. The story is simple with Elsa having the power to freeze her country and Anna wanting to thaw her sister’s heart. Would it surprise you that love solves all the problems? I didn’t think so. We have a prince Hans (voiced by Santino Fontana) chasing after naïve  Anna while Kristoff (voiced by Jonathan Groff), the youngest of 13 sons and owner of Sven, who is an ice dealer and will lose his income if everything is frozen. The production rates in the same class as “The Little Mermaid”, “The Lion King” and “Beauty and the Beast” and it is not hard to see “Frozen” on stage. It is also not hard to imagine every little girl, and a few older ones, wanting Elsa’s blue ice gown. This is an animated film for the whole family which will entrance the kids and hold  the interest of the adults and more than one will be buying the soundtrack, including me, just to hear Idina Menzel belt out “Let It Go” along with her and Bell doing “Tomorrow For The First Time Ever” which is a song you sing walking out of the theatre and/or on the shower. For the record Jennifer Lee is the first woman to direct an animated film, produced by Disney, along with co-director Chris Buck.",1
61,"This is hands down, one of the best Disney movies of the decade. The animation is flawless, the music incredible and there are some really great moments that hit the heart.",1
62,"Frozen is Disney's best film in over a decade (excluding Pixar & Marvel releases). Initially I wasn't overly intrigued or interested in watching this film, but following the long running world wide box office success, I grew curious and decided to give it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised and with each and every viewing I've grown to love this film more and more. At last Disney seem to have found the balance of mixing the old with the new. It revives the traditional princess fairy tale but with the addition of humour, fun characters and sing along songs that will entertain both children and adults alike. The overall animation is absolutely stunning and the quality of the story telling is Disney at their best.",1
63,"While I do think that, in my opinion, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" is a bit of a better film, ""Frozen"" is still a very great film to watch because of its wonderful story, great characters, fantastic animation, and great songs.",1
64,"This was amazing! Disney's ""Frozen"" had great music/songs, animation, characters, etc. But the story plot is kind of similar to ""Tangled"". But overall ""Frozen"" made me feel like I was there. The little Mickey Mouse short (before the movie) was actually pretty funny, just like ""Frozen"". Keep up the good work Disney. I'm giving this an 8.4/10 or a B.",1
65,"I want to give this movie an 8 because this has not really given a solid plot or at least a storyline that is as epic as most Disney films. However, I will give it a 9 because of the musicality. Everything else about the movie is very refreshing and delightful. It may not be perfect but this is truly an unforgettable film.",1
66,"This is a great movie worthy of being rated among the pantheon of Disney heritage such as Aladdin and Lion King. The main songs beautiful and well done, the animation is beautiful, the story is endearing and touching and a wonderful subversion of the normal true love trope. I have some minor gripes dealing with continuity, and a couple of the songs are actually pretty lame, so no 10/10, but this is a new classic to be sure.",1
67,"I love this movie. It's wonderful. The songs are beautiful (let it go) and the characters are unpredictable, which is something that no other disney movie has done. The humor is subtle but perfect, and the moral is great for kids. Definitely see this and bring your kids. One of the best Disney films to date.",1
68,"Heartfelt, picturesque, surprisingly amazing, and filled with very memorable catchy soundtracks. This is what Disney's Frozen is made off. A newly engaging popcorn flick that tends not only visually but awesomely a fun time you will ever watched in this year. Rating: 3.5 / 4",1
69,"There are few movies I would give a 10 but Frozen definitely deserves it! Disney departs from their usual fairytale formula but unlike Brave, Frozen capitalizes on the change up. The movie looks absolutely stunning and is filled with humor and charm, courtesy of Olaf, from beginning to end. The songs in Frozen are biased towards the first half of the movie and more duets between the sisters or another solo for Elsa would have been appreciated. With Idina Menzel offering a spectacular vocal performance it was too bad she only had one big number. Anna (Kristen Bell) and Olaf (Josh Gad) also stun with their vocal prowess in singing and character voices respectively. In short, Disney has never filled a movie with more magic than they did with Frozen.",1
70,"Wonderful story and nice musicCan't wait to see what comes out of the short filmHope they can make a wonderful sequelFor me,this is the best movie i have ever watched",1
71,"I watched this movie after hearing so much hype about it. I went into it honestly not expecting it to live up to the hype, because a lot of the times, something hyped up that much fails my expectations. The animation is spot on of course. The storyline was pretty good. It never really gives any explanation as to why Elsa has her powers which is a bit of a let down. Maybe in a sequel? The characters are well written, especially Olaf and Sven, my two personal favorites. I had a lot of laughs from those two. The only gripe I had was the singing in the first half of the movie. It was over kill. I get that the movie was trying to be like the Disney titles of old, but beating us over the head with ""Hey, we got songs in this movie!"" was ridiculous. Thankfully after the titular ""Let It Go"" which was the best song in the film, the songs died way down for the very serious second half of the movie. All in all, it was enjoyable!",1
72,Amazing movie for both children and adults.  It combines great characters with a great story and very catchy broadway style songs.  I seriously can't understand why anyone wouldn't love this movie!,1
73,"Frozen is a great family movie that gives the audience a witty and funny script, great sing along songs, and an unique story. Frozen differs from the typical Disney movie by making the good guy the bad guy. Overall Frozen is another great Disney classic!",1
74,"This is one of those movies you have trouble with to review it.You know that there will be people who hate you because you give it a incredibly high score, and then you have the opposite of that.Frozen has really some good elements.The presentation of Frozen is just great. Everything has been made into detail and the characters look believable. Everything is very well animated.The story is good but not great. I undersand that they want to create something totally new but i didn't had the feels on the ending. It could have been a good ending, but its sadly too much cliché...The voice acting is again great and believable. The singing voice of Idina Menzel is great and ""Let it go"" gave me a goosebumps moment.The villain is probably the worst part in this. You don't know who the villain is. I was confused at some twists, but i thought that we could get an amazing villain.I would give this game a solid 8/10. I know that most of the adults and kids like this movie because of the music... but i liked the movie because of its beautifull setting and great animation.",1
75,"Disney certainly made up for ""The Princess and the Frog"" with their movie Frozen, which has unforgettable songs that you can't help but sing along with, dynamic characters (especially Elsa),  and a wicked plot twist in the end. ""Frozen"" strays off the usual ""Boy Saves Girl"" path and instead strolls down the ""Girl Saves Girl"" path. We're talking two sisters who have been isolated from each other almost their entire life. Drama galore, Right? Anyways, the songs are just magical. ""Let it Go"" is just over the top, and obviously deserved it's well-earned Oscar. Don't even get me started on ""For the First Time in Forever: Reprise"", which really shows the changing mood in the movie, and shows us basically what happens when somebody shuts another person out. Olaf the snowman is really annoying, however, which is why I gave this movie an eight out of ten, and I rather disliked ""In Summer"". Kristoff and Sven are cute. Oh man, I almost forgot Hans. He is a suckish piece of smelly poop! Overall, I love the movie, especially the plot twist at the end.",1
76,"Very good movie, greats songs and the real meaning of love. Lots of humour and excitement in a great film. The only problem is, is that some parts of the movie don't make sense. But it is still so fun to watch, and it deserves good feedback",1
77,"Frozen wasn't the cup of tea that I wanted but it was good at the least.  It offers a good lesson to kids, a so-so story, and has some great characters (especially you Olaf).  If your kids want to watch this movie so badly, just set them up in the living room with some snacks and the DVD/Blu-ray. Rating: 7/10Grade B- Decent.",1
78,"If you don't like musicals, then this movie is not for you. I was not expecting so much singing. Though the dialogue was a bit corny and not well written, it still had a warm Disney feeling.  Outstanding animation, plot, and character development.",1
79,"Okay, I'd precisely give this about a 68/100, but since that isn't an option I'll just go 7. The movie isn't very original, and the music is overrated, but the animation is wonderful to look at, it's colourful, and there are likeable characters, especially Olaf the snowman. Although not as good as many people say, Frozen is still enjoyable and fun for kids.",1
80,I love this movie the animation is so beautiful. the songs are terrific.Olaf and Elsa have to be the favourites. If you have kids and love Disney this movie is a must see,1
81,"One of Disney's better ""princess movies"". The story is more interesting than most and, although everything is indeed set right in the end by ""true love"", it's not the true love you typically expect. The animation and 3-D effects are outstanding. The only weak spot was the score; the lyrics and melodies did not stay with me (unlike say The Little Mermaid). My grandchildren (boys 7 and 9, girl 14), my wife, and I all loved it. The grandchildren cannot stop talking about it. If you have children or grandchildren of an appropriate age, or if you just like good animation, I recommend Frozen very highly.",1
82,"This movie restored my faith in animation. Before actually seeing the movie, I thought it was going to be a dumb flick about a snowman, just like every other pandering kids movie that has reared its ugly head lately.  Thankfully, the advertisements were very inaccurate. Frozen follows the tale of two compelling and relatable sisters who are both struck by chaos when the older sister, Elsa accidentally freezes over the country with her ice powers. The younger sister, Ana, goes to break the curse and reunite with her sister. Everything about this movie hits the right chords with me. There are nostalgic nods to previous Disney movies through subtle pieces of background music and through the animation itself. It also provides fantastic musical numbers that perfectly convey the tone they try to provide. While I'm more of a 2-D animation fan, this movie perfectly displays what can be done in a 3-D structure that couldn't be done in a 2-D movie.",1
83,Easily the worst Disney movie ever. It's like a hybrid of Tangled and some old Disney classics (not Pixar movies). Overloaded with the most annoying songs (especially Let it Go). But the snowman (he has a very weird name) is cute,0
84,"This movie beautifully reflects elements of classic Disney movies, yet it also has that modern feel to it. Unlike many other Disney films, this one doesn't focus on fairytales or romance  instead it focuses on more relatable and modern topics, such as fear, betrayal and family. The casting choices were amazing, and major props go to Idina Menzel, who steals the spotlight with her Broadway experience. I haven't seen a movie that I loved this much in YEARS.The music is beyond incredible  rather than having the music there as an underscore, they add another dimension to the film. Having said that, ""Let It Go"" is undoubtedly the most beautiful moment in the film, when one of the film's protagonists finally accepts herself as who she is. Those disliking the input of music need to go and watch The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and Beauty And The Beast; these movies along with Frozen are true Disney classics.Frozen will cater for all ages, and I highly recommend it.",1
85,"The Disney studio should be in happy for this year’s Academy awards nominees. They got this movie in the short list of the best animated movie. The live shot ‘Saving Mr. Banks’ and ‘The Lone Ranger’ got nodes to compete with others in different categories. Whether they win it all or not Disney people will be more than satisfied for the nomination tag for their movies which will stay forever. A decade ago, people called Disney is done and dusted but in recent couple of years, it was a great come back for them. ‘Tangled’ put them on the track, now with this wonderful family movie they are more confident. Yeah, I loved this movie a lot for many reasons. It was fast, sentimental, romantic and had adorable, cute 3D character models. I think Disney studio is following on the footsteps of Studio Ghibli. I believe they found their strength in the name of the young girl’s role in their recent movies. Like Rapunzel for ‘Tangled’ this movie had Anna. Both the movies backed by pleasant music and admirable animal character with awesome facial expressions for humorous in parts of the storytelling. I had seen all the nominees of this year’s animation movie, except Studio Ghibli's ‘The Wind Rises’. I liked ‘Monster University’, it was fun, but ‘The Croods’ attracted me a lot. I was hoping French animation ‘Ernest & Celestine’ could win, but after seeing it no doubt on why it got the honour. So I am happy for this movie's win at the big event. 9.5/10",1

90,"Lovely, funny and solid. Includes animation and songs that combined make this movie one of the greatest in animation. Personally, I really appreciated Elsa's paper during the film. It just shows what Disney is all about.",1
91,Best Show of the Year. I can't blame those people who dislike this movie but this a message for those who dislike FROZEN is that they are trying to make it possible for kids and adults.,1
92,"Wonderful music, animation, plot, characters, story and clean humor! My favorite movie of 2013. Tangled is one of my favorite newest Disney films and Frozen is now the best. Highly recommend. Great movie for the family!",1
93,"Really Good movie, one of the Best of Disney since a long time. It's a movie based on music, so there approximately 7-8 songs and they are all good. There are awesome. Only thing is there is no strong villain. Fantastic movie I recommend to every person at every age !",1

95,"Frozen is a beautifully animated film by Disney about two sisters, Princess Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) and Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), whose kingdom has been unintentionally trapped in an eternal winter by Elsa and her snowy powers.  Anna joins Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), an ice harvester, Sven, his reindeer, and Olaf (Josh Gad), a talking snowman who dreams of summer, in a hunt to find her sister and end the winter before it is to late.  The most memorable scene in the movie was when Elsa sang ""Let it Go"" on top of the mountain, after leaving her kingdom for what she believes will be forever.  I loved this film because it is a heartwarming story with lovable characters and an amazing soundtrack.  I would recommend this to people of all ages because it is an inspiring movie that is sure to capture the hearts of the entire family.",1
96,This is actually one of my favourite movies of the year. The music is some of the best Disney music since the Lion King the animation is beautiful and there's many lovable characters. Please go and see it.,1
97,"This movie is a magical, humorous, adventure that keeps the viewer usually at the edge of their seat. The songs are breathtaking and some are inspiring such as Let It Go. The characters are made with amazing qualities (Except Hans and such), this is the best Disney Movie ever made since the Lion King. And, it teaches you that you don't always need a man's help, just remember to hold on to your sister. You never know when she may leave.",1
98,"The hype is real.Nostalgia is a very strong thing..But if you remove it from your mind this might end up being your favorite Disney film ever. It blew me away. Worth the ticket for Elsa's 'Let It Go' alone, steals the whole show. Well done Jennifer Lee",1
99,"Many of the movies I saw in 2013 were epic Sci-Fi adventures, with battles and stuff. Even though I saw Frozen in April (and have been obsessed with it ever since), I still count it as 2013.

101,"Frozen has surpassed the audience’s expectations of a cliché Disney movie. Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee transformed the typical love story into a love between sisters. This is one of many reasons why this movie has done so well in the box offices, as well as in the eyes of the viewers. Frozen’s incorporation of memorable songs only brought this animated film to another level. Unlike most musicals, there was not an overuse of songs. In fact, they were strategically placed to evenly break up the movie. Also, it was easy to follow the plot line, without being predictable. Through out the entire movie, your interest is captured. Although Frozen had an intended audience for children, when people saw the movie it was hard not to fall in love with the characters and the message of sisterhood. This movie revamped the term “princess” by giving us two independent and headstrong young ladies. Sisters Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, and Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, were in conflict for a majority of the movie. By making the journey of these two princesses the main focus, Buck and Lee made the movie less about the romantic aspect between Elsa and Hans, voiced by Santino Fontana, which I think puts a refreshing spin on Disney movies. Instead of creating another movie about a princess needing a hero to rescue her, we have been given an animated film where the princess saves not only herself, but her sister and the city of Arendelle as well. While Frozen did teach the audience about the love between sisters, it also sent out an important message about self-acceptance. Throughout the movie, Elsa struggled to come to terms with who she truly was. She was so afraid of anyone knowing the truth about her icy powers that she shut out her friends and family. Anna strived to prove to Elsa that she can conquer what she thinks is impossible. She made Elsa feel like she had someone on her side no matter what happened. This sent a very powerful message to the audience, especially for children at an impressionable age; everyone should learn to accept who they truly are because to live a life in hiding is not a good one. People of any age could enjoy Frozen. The intended audience for this film was for children, but many teenagers and adults have found this move in their hearts. For the children in the audience, Frozen was a magical movie with fun songs to sing along to and clumsy characters, like Olaf, to laugh at. This movie also taped into the older generations’ childhood and their love for Disney movies. Anyone who loved Disney movies as a child could have seen this movie and been brought back to that time in their life. As for the adults with children, it was hard not to love a movie that taught the importance of family and self-acceptance. Major criticism for this movie was that the songs were not inspiring and did not leave a memorable impression. I disagree. I found that the songs were catchy, fun, and easy to sing along to. The songs varied in topics, moods, and messages. Some songs rhymed, others did not, but all contained remarkable lyrics. With such a wide variety, at least one song could of found its way stuck inside someone’s head. Going beyond what the songs were about, the placement of these songs played a huge role in the success of them. Each song was carefully placed in order to break up key moments in the movie. Without any of these memorable songs, especially “Let It Go” by Idina Menzel, this movie would not have reached it’s full potential. Another major criticism for this movie was that Olaf, the talking snowman voiced by Josh Grad, was an extraneous character and did not add to the plot and was therefor useless. Olaf’s role in the movie was very legitimate and necessary. When Anna first came across Olaf, she was looking for her sister in the mountains. Since Olaf was a native of the land, he helped her find the way. For the rest of the movie he was her friend and helped her save Arendelle. He was no more important that Rajah for Jasmine or Flounder for Ariel; they were characters that became the princess’ companion and helped guide them along. Olaf also added a humorous element to the movie; he was by far the most comical character and brought a necessary element that none of the other characters could provide- innocence. He was childish at heart, and therefor had a major impact in the mood of the story. Whenever something started to become too serious, Olaf jumped in and automatically brought the story back to what the audience can relate to. Without Olaf, the movie would of felt very incomplete. Overall, the directors and the voices behind the characters did a great job with this Disney film. The fact that this was a non-traditional princess movie is what set it apart from the rest. This movie can bring a smile to anyone’s face, regardless of age. Frozen had all of the qualities of a 5-star movie: catchy songs, powerful messages, and personable characters.",1
102,"This movie sucks. The story is horrifying, the songs are terrible, & the characters are very unlikable! Elsa, who has ice powers, must be given a lesson. This is also an extremely poor copy of Ice Age. Characters like Olaf, Sven, Anna, & Kristoff are very annoying and not funny at all! See any other Disney film out there. I can't believe how bad this movie is!!!! I give Frozen 1%. Score 0.0 F--- Unwatchable!!!!!! >:(",0

106,"The entire story of Frozen is lazy and inconsistent. There are massive holes in the story that could have otherwise helped the entire story. The characters are lazy and completely forgettable. The Ice Queen could have easily learned how to control her powers, instead she was locked up. She shows she already has major control when she freezes an entire kingdom and makes a castle out of ice. Wouldn't it have been easier to teach her self control? The snow man is the worst example, being there specifically for comic relief. No one really knows where he came from, even the Ice Queen is surprised the stupid character is ""alive"". Yeah, we get it, he represents their lost childhood or whatever, but there still wasn't any attempt to make this character any more deeper then a puddle of water. It's painfully obvious he was designed to sell toys. Frozen is bad, it's bad for everyone and I hate it.",0
107,"Frozen is a great movie, the visuals are amazing, the story are not so predictable, the movie surprised me, and it's very fun, a great movie, the songs are great, it's one of the best animations movie that I have ever seen.",1
108,"This movie impacted me in a way that tangled, and princess and the frog, and every movie since beauty and the beast could not. It was absolutely phenomenal. The music (which is the best since the lion king), the humor (funniest disney movie of all time), and the not so typical ending. I was expecting it to be cliche, but it was truly a story of family, and how the greatest love of all comes from family (In this case anna, and elsa). The music, the beautiful animation, the laughter, and the amazing story all help FROZEN to be one of my favorite movies this year. You would be more than sorry if you missed seeing this on the big screen.",1
109,"Worst movie ever. Seriously. The songs are freaking annoying, the animation is bad, the storyline is quite... stupid. Most overrated movie ever. EVER.",0
110,"Frozen has great music,superb animation,a horrible story,horrible character stories(If there was any that is),and of course horrid Characters.Disney desperately tries to make another classic musical,succeeded on the music department,but fails in everything else.How Frozen won an Academy Award is beyond me. One thing is clear though,Frozen would of made a good Fantasia(without the ridiculous story and characters that is).",0
111,Frozen is the worst movie ever.It is so bad don't see this movie cause all you will see is pain while watching this movie.This movie is a waste of time.I give this movie a 0/10.,0
112,"I was afraid I wouldn't like this movie because of the fact that it is kind of a musical. But honestly, while I wasn't really into that whole idea of the singing aspect, it still plays off pretty well and reminds me a little bit of good old Disney movies like ""The Lion King"". What really struck me was Josh Gad's portrayal of Olaf. He's one of those characters who's more of a comic relief type of character, but at the same tie plays a big part and brings a lot of heart and love to the role. Overall, Disney animations are coming back! I give it a B+.",1
113,"This movie tries to make us have fun, but all that it delivers is a horrible script, boring musical numbers (except for let it go), and a plot that is so ridiculous that turns to be Disney's worst film till now.",0
115,"Generally bad, predictable, unoriginal storyline. After the brilliance of Tangled, Frozen really disappointed me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that it was over-hyped and wasn't good enough for many. However, I think that everyone who pretends to like this film is only doing it because they expected it to be better.",0
116,"I can pull out such a giant list to prove why this movie is bad. Don't you just hate it when they repeat the same old repetitive songs such as.. ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"" or ""Let it Go!"" and man, I sure wish I had some of those equipments such as headphones so I don't have to hear them singing those songs ever again. Disney sure did the worst mistake in 2013, but hey, it isn't a 0.",0
117,"Now while I do have problems with Frozen I really enjoyed it. It may not be their best but its one of their better ones. The story is cliché and slow at times but it makes up for it with a nice message and some nice twists on a story we’ve heard several times. The characters are likeable nothing amazing but I enjoyed them. The presentation is nice but nothing spectacular. What stands out in this movie are three amazing songs the best I’ve heard from Disney in years! I will admit it is not as iconic as The Lion King or Aladdin but hey it is hard to make a masterpiece and for what they did they did a pretty good job. It is hard to take the Disney formula and constantly make it feel fresh and new but they managed. The reason why some people may not like it is because they enjoy other variations of the story. Also, these guys aren’t Pixar nor do they have the original team that did the 90s Disney movies. I will admit it is not Disney’s best but it is still an enjoyable film the best of the year in fact and the best animated film of the year thus far (although The Wind Rises will probably win). If you are a Disney fan you’ll enjoy yourself and if you are along for the ride you’ll get through it ok. As for me this the best of the new age of Disney and it is a shame the film is being marketed as a dumb comedy. It may not be their best but has some great stuff in here that impressed we in ways that Tangled didn’t. Frozen didn’t have the greatest animation or funniest side characters but its story engaged and surprised me and had some fantastic songs and atmosphere. While Pixar’s films have declined in quality (from excellent to good/ok) Disney’s films have gotten better. They aren’t the greatest but it is enjoyable to see it done again and well if I might add. Really enjoyed this film and cannot wait for Disney’s next flick Big Hero 6.",1
118,"Excellent show, absorbing, entertaining, perfect animation, colors, and music. When it is needed to get away from tensions and dull movies there is no better than Frozen.",1
119,"Frozen is the less Disney type movie from the Disney Animation Studios. As Wreck it Ralph this film breaks the Occidental paradigm of animated pictures, although in this case is not the idea of villain that is destroy; is one much more bigger and rooted, the true love. Which is achieve by breaking another archetype, the one of Prince Charming. Other thing that is important to mention is that Frozen explores a new relationship instead the typical of prince and princess, which is sister and sister. This is an innovation however different relationships have been explored in recent movies like Tangled and Brave, which are mother and daughter. With all these new things, the massages that are transmitted by the film are more rich and according to the current times, where the true love is a relative term and the happily ever after is a myth. The theme song Let it Go is really enchanting and the animation is excellent; only the character construction is not so good, making them bad defined.",1
120,"A lovely animated film whose plot points are at times refreshingly unpredictable. Funny and full of great characters, it also contains some very nice theatrically styled songs which are pulled off with aplomb.",1
121,"A  fabulous film! Wonderfully crafted & beautifully animated! The story of Anna & Elsa is both beautiful & touching. ""Frozen"" assures the fans that disney still has the magic.",1
122,"Frozen is a movie about two sister-princesses named Anna and Elsa, who was inexplicably born with the power to manipulate ice. Whilst playing she accidentally injures her sister with her magic, causing her hair to gain a strip of white. The king and queen take her to the friendly trolls, who erase Anna's memory of Elsa's powers and tell the king and queen to make sure Anna is never struck in the heart in order to prevent her from freezing forever. Upon hearing this the royal parents isolate Elsa in order to help her learn to control and maintain her powers. This seems to be working out until the parents, in traditional Disney fashion, are tragically killed in a storm. Three years pass and Elsa is becoming queen of Arendelle, and Anna meets a man named Hans who appears to be the love of her life. The two wants to get married, but Elsa denies it because they met each other that day. Anna gets upset and yells at her sister about how she always shuts her out and is never there for her, and incidentally causes Elsa to expose her powers. Elsa runs away in shame, and Anna goes to find her. Besides the two princesses, there is a slew of side characters. One being a bland explorer named Kristoff who helps Anna get up the mountain, a comic relief-reindeer named Sven, and an actually funny talking snowman named Olaf. The story of this movie is very good, and it also throws traditional Disney fans a lot of curve balls. There are a lot of things you think will end up happening, when in the end they really don't. The story is essentially the bet part of the movie for me, while everything else is just mediocre. Besides Olaf the happy go lucky snowman and Anna being a bit of an awkward ditz, all the other characters were very bland. Hans turns into a stereotypical villain who just wants the throne, Kristoff is incredibly bland, and the reindeer is only there for comic relief. It does get a laugh here and there, but Olaf provides a lot more. Even Elsa is very boring, being really anti social and irrationally douchey to her sister. The voice acting on  all the characters is great, except for Idina Menzel as Elsa. For me, she felt really disconnected from the animation, talking or singing. The songs in this movie are my biggest gripe. The lyrics are iffy, the transitions from talking to singing are awkward and poorly handled, and the pacing of all of them is very wonky. There are about three songs at the start and two in the middle, leaving the third act completely barren when it comes to songs. Animation is incredible, pairing classic Disney charm with modern animation techniques. Overall this film is great, but it's full of little nitpicks I have that really prevent me from enjoying the full experience. Here are a slew of nitpicks I had.  Why does Anna sing the lines ""Do you wanna build a snowman?"" a scene after their parents die? Their parents just died! Why in the world would you ask if she wants to build a snowman!? The song ""Reindeer Are Better Then People"" is incredibly stupid and all for filler. The way Kristoff talks for Sven is dumb, but I'm trying to decide if that's better then Sven actually talking. The old man character from Wesselton was idiotic and for the most part unnecessary. Overall, Frozen has a good plot, funny moments, and strong themes, along with a feminist twist that will please many. On the other hand, there's awkward writing, some unimpressive characters, and poor song handling. However, it is a Disney movie, so you've probably already seen it regardless of things you've heard.",1
123,"This movie is one of Disney's best films of the decade. It's funny, awesome and highly entertaining for both children and adults. There are no flaws at all, just great magical things that we never have seen before. This film is wonderful and touching, no need to say more! Frozen gets an 8.5/10.",1
124,"I'll be brief here. What makes good movie a great one for me?Five things: good story, amazing characters, some well-timed pieces of comedy, beautiful visual appearance and most importantly, the music. With one of the greatest Disney soundtracks, this movie had it all. It was propably the best movie I've seen in years. Thank you, Disney.",1
125,"This movie is awesome if we are looking at it through a child eyes. Finally this Disney movie doesn't try to concentrate only for beauty and marriage. This is not about getting a husband, this is about family which makes it a lot better than other Disney movies.",1
126,"The very first thing that caught my eyes was the level of details. I have not noticed such details of simulation even in a large budget film. The story and the screenplay were well written. It was a complex topic said in way that anyone would get it. I found the theme to be ""Never be afraid of your Fears"". It was a well directed Animated film.One dialogue I cannot get over is when a mother tell her some ""The Queen has come up age"" and the kid reply's ""Mom, that's not my fault"".",1
127,"Frozen from the creators of Tangled is amazing smart not really fun I mean this story is sad by the time ""Do you want to build a snowman"" is one of the sadist song's ever. The story those is so intense and Elisa is the most human villain I ever seen but I mean she is not the villain",1
128,excellent animated feature! It revives the traditional musical and fairy tale style of Disney but with unexpected unpredictable resolution to the story.,1
129,"One of the best Disney films. The songs are top-notched. The storyline was awesome. The characters are distinguishable, has its own role and fits perfectly to everything else. I would watch this several times again.",1
130,"Frozen is an adaption of the Hans Christian Andersen story, The Snow Queen, however since it's a Disney film you know it's going to stray from it's source material. But that's not a bad thing because Frozen is still an entertaining film for what it is, however I didn't really find this film to be as enjoyable in comparison to some of Disney's other films. But I will still give my verdict on the film. First off, the animation is great as always even though I will still forever miss the charm that traditional animation has. The characters are enjoyable and I like how they are fairly relatable when compared to some Disney characters in the past, despite some characters being good I also think there were some characters that we could have done well without; In fact the main villain of this movie was very disappointing and probably my least favorite Disney villain of all time now. The story is also fairly good but I do think it was a bit shallow at times, and I did notice a few plot holes here and there. Some of the songs in this film are good but there were others that I felt where trying to hard to be like some of the more classic Disney songs but ended up not doing as well of a job. Now despite my criticisms, I do like that this film's moral is a bit different then other Disney films but really it's not enough to make me like the film anymore than I already do. Overall this film is good but I felt that it could have been much better and I really am not looking forward to this film's sequel.  This film has also been called the year's ""best animated film"" but I would actually prefer some other animated films that came out this year over this one like Despicable Me 2, Monster's University and The Wind Rises. Despite my critical feelings towards this film, it will definitely entertain your children and some adults with the Disney charm that it has.",1
131,"For me it's the best Disney film in a long time. The music is great, the characters are memorable and it just has that feel of magic that the Disney films of old had. The fact I've had it less than a a week and watched it a few times already says a lot about it, again I haven't done this with a Disney film for years and years. Really wished I'd have caught this one at the cinema. The only small complaint I have is that I wish there would have been a memorable villain in there! A great film kids will no doubt enjoy the most but also for fans of Disney films everywhere as this is a welcome return to form.",1
132,"I thought that this was one of the best Disney movies in a long time. I think if Walt Disney came back to life Frozen would be the only thing that made him think about maybe not killing himself. Frankly, everything from Walt Disney since The Lion King has sucked ass! Meaning, The Lion King was the last good movie for a long time. Frozen is the first, at least, slightly good movie since The Lion King! Elsa and Anna were all true to there selves. It wouldn't be a the movie it was without the silly snowman, Olaf. I give this movie a 9 out of 10!",1
133,"This is a good story that is focused on a sibling relationship first and a romance second, which I find refreshing. The two lead female characters are unique and strong (no dainty princess tripe), and the music is great. Overall, I found this to be a very good animated movie...",1
134,"Beautifully animated, gorgeous visuals as well as amazing vocal performances by the cast. Definitely would put it amongst the best Disney films ever made.",1
135,"Disney has not lost their touch when it comes to making animated movies. Now the combination of Pixar's 3D imagery style and Disney original studio's story and character design from the original animated series brings forth a mega stellar hit known as Frozen. Amazing animation, music, characters makes this the best Disney movie so far this generation and the results and revenue they have made since its release shows how successful this movie has become.",1
136,"Before watching the movie, I knew this was going to be great. And it was. The film is hilarious, touching, beautiful and it touches on many different aspects. It's a very fast-paced and enjoyable animation. Oh, and the soundtrack and songs are just incredible.",1
137,"An animated, amusing and delightful Disney musical.I really liked the songs, especially 'Let it Go'' performed by Idina Menzel.One of the good works by Disney but way behind Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph.",1
138,"This could be the only Disney film that teaches you these two things.1. It takes a long time to know a man before marriage.2. You don't always need a man to save you! Your sister is the one that has your back no matter what!I believe the Oscar goes to this film for sure.",1
139,"Great story, greats songs, Great characters, Great message. Great animation movie.Disney has added another classic to it`s collection of great movies.",1
141,"Being the animation/Disney/art student geek that I am,  it adds a few points to what score it might have been otherwise. It starts off strong with its opening song, which made me perk up attentively in the light of recent disappointments from the studio; unfortunately that 'vibe' doesn't last for long, though really, it's a cute movie, a shrug of the shoulders. Olaf is great, if anything I'm glad I watched the movie and got to see him. Also a touch of positive commendation for the male protagonist who is, for once, not really gun-ho about wooing the female lead. The younger audience will definitely enjoy it, and it's a pleasant pastime for the older folks.",1
142,"Frozen is beautifully animated, full of heart, and laugh out loud funny in places. Idina Menzel knocks it out of the park with 'Let It Go' a more than worthy choice for best song of the year.",1

149,One of the best animated films out there I have seen a lot of animated films I'm a big fan of Disney films because of that and let me tell you I went into this film with high expectations from what I heard from a lot of people and was not disappointed in fact I was surprised by the unexpected plot twists and was also surprised by the beauty of the ice powers that the ice queen used (it was pretty bad a** even by my standards I'm also a big fan of action and superhero movies) and even more so the emotion that was present in this movie its easy to become attached to the funny likeable characters and also easy to hate the hateful characters and although like a regular human being I wanted the bad guy to get killed his conclusion that only a Disney movie could pull off left me laughing and grinning those are all the positive elements and as for the negative there really isn't any except one and that's a personal opinion the only thing I thought was a little negative was the many songs they had and I would be more concerned if they were bad songs but the fact is they weren't they were catchy some were funny and others were cute all in all Frozen is definitely going to be watched by me again and gets a 10 out of 10,1
150,"This movie is absolutley fantastic. It's hilarious, heart-warming, and beautifully done. Disney defenitly made a different kind of princess movie- the princess falls in love with an ice picker... Instead of the traitor prince. I love the characters, Olaf is funny, Anna is silly, Elsa is like the mysterious one, Christoph is the shy guy, Hns is the traitor, and Sven is the animal friend.The whole story line I feel is great. It's quite interesting and I've watched the movie 5 times and I'm still intrigued. I love how they incorporate the songs into the scenes. The songs are absolutely amazing- Let it Go even won an Oscar! Their songs hit home and you can feel the emotion from the characters.Disney does a very good job of making Hans sound truthful. I love this movie for the fact that the protagonist doesn't end up falling in love with a prince. It makes it stand out amongst the other disney princess movies, along with Tangled and Brave. Overall, I think this is an amazing movie and people of all ages would enjoy it :).",1
151,"Certainly one of the better movies Disney has made, in a long time. There is a great mix of all the emotions throughout the film, which really keep you hooked, right until the end. The sound track is also excellent, I would happily listen to it all day long!",1
154,"The movie was different from what I was expecting - although at the start it felt rushed, in a sense, everything was happening too fast without much back story, later on it eventually continued in a normal pace. As a whole, the movie has a few ignorant mistakes such as constant and overwhelming musical numbers, which are fairly common. It's not that they themselves are bad in terms of quality, however their quantity easily averts attention away from the plot/scene at hand. Another let-down for me is how short the film felt. Don't get me wrong - there's enough to go on, but it still felt as if something could be something more added. People tend to dislike the film because it doesn't meet the standards of a Disney tittle, which is not in any way fair - the entire project should be considered as a whole, that is, Frozen is a wonderful film for people of all ages and will most certainly leave you misty-eyed at the end. I would definitely recommend watching it.",1
155,"Disney's Frozen is Fantastic,Nice Animation,cute and adorable characters combine it with an amazing soundtrack or songs that may stuck in your head for a long time! frozen has some plot holes and some nitpicks But you don't care..",1
156,"The best Disney movie since the 80's at least. Frozen brings along a new premise, that women don't need men to live. And with (in my opinion) the best ever Disney song, I am of course referring to ""Let it go"" it easily grabs a 10. (Plus Elsa's pretty fit)",1
157,"If you decided not to see the film after the first trailer with Olaf the snowman, this movie's much better than you probably expected it to be! Definitely a great flick that you'll genuinely enjoy! Fantastic music and great acting help it rise to the top and become one of the greatest Disney films!",1
158,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. Beautiful animation, awesome music, and a wonderful story. A perfect movie for me. If you like Disney movies, you will love this.",1
159,"'Frozen' is the 53rd feature from Walt Disney Animation Studios and the 7th Disney movie executive produced by John Lasseter (director of 'Toy Story' (1995) ). The people at Disney went all out with this movie, offering beautiful animation, spectacular songs, a well-written story and more colorful characters for kids to love. 'Frozen' is a loose adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" in which it follows the story of a Queen named Elsa (voiced by former Broadway star Idina Menzel) who was born with the ability to freeze things and make snow appear. She has a young sister named Anna (Kristen Bell) who she accidentally zapped in the head during childhood and had to have her memory erased of her sister every having powers. In order to protect Anna, Elsa locks herself in her bedroom and avoids any kind of contact from Anna. Anna feels like that she has done something to Elsa to cause this divide, but Elsa's anxiety and depression causes her ice powers to overwhelm her. It's clever how the people at Disney changed the Snow Queen from making everybody the victim of her powers to becoming somebody who is the victim of her own powers. During the coronation, the gates to the castle finally open after years of being locked, Elsa is crowned the Queen of her kingdom since their parents died (typical Disney). Also, Anna meets a handsome man named Prince Hans of the Southern Isles (Santino Fontana), they plan to get married and ask for Elsa's blessing, but Elsa doesn't want anybody to live in the castle, not when she has these powers that she needs to hide, and doesn't think that Anna should marry some man she just met. Elsa accidentally exposes her powers in front of the guests at the ceremony and they all believe that she is some sorcery villain that performs witchcraft. Kind of like the Snow Queen in the original fairy tale. Elsa runs away in exile and it's up to Anna to bring her back and make things right. Obviously, the movie is famous for that ""Let it Go"" sequence, while the song is great and Idina Menzel showcases her best singing talent, the animation behind it all is stunning. This is some of the best animation I've seen since 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003), we get a lot of tracking shots, establishing shots and high-angle shots as Elsa builds her ice castle. The color palette is mostly limited to blue and white...it's ice and snow, there's not many colors to use. On the way, Anna meets an ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) who agrees to help Anna find her sister and they bump into a small, talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad) who offers plenty of laughs thanks to his perfect timing and whispering instead of shouting his jokes. If there's one thing that this movie does, and a lot of good animated movies do this well, is making the characters believable and make you forget that you're watching an animated movie. You forget that you're watching a bunch of drawings that have celebrity voices, these characters are arguably more real than the live-action characters from the ""Transformers"" sequels and the ""Twilight"" franchise, those characters are archetypes and are one-dimensional...but not these ones. Walt Disney's 'Frozen' is a handsome and absorbing movie that whisks you away into its magical world, the music is great, the animation is great and the characters are great. I did not know what to expect in Disney's 53rd feature, but not an experience this magical.",1
161,"Beautiful story! Funny moments, teaches kids about love, & the characters are very lovable! Elsa, who has ice powers, must embrace what makes her different. A great lesson to teach everyone. Characters like Olaf, Sven, Anna, & Kristoff are very funny! Excited for the sequel.",1
162,"I love FROZEN. Amazing characters and great story line. I love the concept of ""Act of Love"". Olaf is so cute :-*",1
163,"This movie is god-awful. Seriously, the songs are so frigging annoying! The storyline is stupid. The characters are bad (except Olaf). The voice acting was terrible. This movie is one of the worst Disney movies of all time. It is so overrated. Don't watch it. Watch Alvin and the Chipmunks instead.",0
164,"Let's face it. Disney is trying to bring back the old in a new, modernized style way. So did they succeed? Unfortunately, not entirely. One of the flaws of Frozen is the characters and how they are played in the film, which seems odd, as Disney princesses usually work well in its film. With the high hopes of Elsa into play, she unfortunately has very little to do in the film. Her character grows, but not in a way that seems realistic. Along with this, Elsa and Anna's relationship occurs for 2 minutes, (at the scene of the party), and for the rest their relationship develops quickly at the climax that feels off. Sadly, the main protagonists are supposed to have a relationship that should develop from hatred through a conflicted passageway to friendship, but it only happens instantly in this film. No development. However, there are still characters that succeed in a way to interest people such as myself. Olaf, one of the ""sidekicks"" that are present in all Disney films, is a delight. With funny lines and with a original song that brings laughs, I liked him. Unfortunately, NO purpose of him was in the film. According to the directors, Olaf is supposed to connect Anna and Elsa, but he just doesn't. I also really enjoyed the twist at the end with Hans, which purposes the commonality with ""perfect"" princes in Disney films. Kristoff, Anna's eventual love interest, is also interesting to watch, with growth that feels genuine. The plot is a fairy-tale, so it's obvious how it ends. One of my issues with Frozen is that the plot, forgets what it tries to explain. The main plot of Anna remembering Elsa is forgotten, Elsa's powers are not explained (which was disappointing to myself), characters like Marshmellow were forgotten, and the side antagonism of the Duke not well developed. Despite this, what I still liked about Frozen was the comedy and the emotional lines. One of the parts that still touches me is that true love is an act of a loving deed to one another and not just a true love kiss. That was touching.. One of the things that saves this movie is the music. The music is beautiful in Disney Fashion. The score flows, it moves, and it makes you feel. The original songs in the film are better than Disney's attempt with ""Tangled"", but I don't see it even close to matching past Disney film songs. The problem remains, the songs lack similarity. When you listen to Belle's songs in Beauty and the Beast, you hint that there are similar tones and rhythms that play into them, but when you listen to the songs in Frozen, they are completely opposite to each other. One song ""Frozen Heart"" sounds like an opera song, while ""Love is an Open Door"" is a modern pop song. ""Let it Go"" is an amazing Broadway song, while ""In Summer"" is a comedic song. One song that once again interests me is the combination between ""Let it Go"" and ""For the First Time in Forever"", which is beautiful to listen to. Overall, Frozen has the factors of music and the animation to help itself redeem its lack in characters. The twist and turns in the film add to a nice touch that makes this film, for myself, an enjoyable time.",1
165,"wonderful story line, great animations, graphics and characters. The only negative thing here is that there was to much music. If there was less music in the movie, I would have rated it a 10, but it is a 9 due to the amount of music.",1
167,"Stopped this movie at 45min in and probably will never see the end. As a big time fan of animated motion pictures this made me sad (probably because it got a lot of hype), because I hate musicals and basically this movie is made around one song. The first animated movie that adults probably won't enjoy in my opinion. If this gets a 8.2 i give the musical mama mia a 10, because at least I could finish the movie... maybe a 0 isn't suited either but that score has to go down, it's very misleading again, just my opinion",0
168,"This movie is CRAP!!! It just goes through a bunch of deaths, and that dumb song, ""Let it Go"" Is so freaking annoying!!! If you're thinking about watching this, DON'T!",0
169,"Another DISGUSTING film by Disney.Prepare to let your Sanity go by listening to ""Let It Go""! Prepare to listen to your kids scream these songs at you on Winter, by them screaming the song ""Do You Wanna Build A Snowman"" in a satanic tone. This terrible movie gave me headaches and made me want to f***ing jump off a cliff with its over the top annoying as hell actors and songs. Screw disney, I have hated them for so long! Don't watch this unless you dont give a f*ck about your mental health.",0
170,"""Frozen"" is a solid Disney film.  Yet another Princess film, even though Disney announced a few years ago it was going to stop doing Princess films.  The animation is excellent, the 3D is excellent, but for me it wasn't funny enough to elevate it to greatness.  They also copied a little from ""Tangled"", a superior film.  Tangled was funnier and had better songs.  As you might recall, Tangled had the comical horse.  Frozen has a moose with the same personality (but not quite as funny).  The Mickey Mouse short at the beginning was excellent, especially in 3D.",1
171,"I'd heard all the glowing reviews about this film, which has done fantastically well both commercially and critically. However having watched it I was slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film and ticks all the right boxes - the score is great and the animation is amazing. The lack of a proper villain or conflict and a few odd plotting moments spoilt it a bit for me. The queen's power was never explained and the snowman appeared from nowhere with no explanation. Nice to see a great animated Disney film with lots of songs - the things I miss from Pixar/Dreamworks films.",1
172,"Great movie for girls, really positive messages, that is why I gave it a 9.  For myself, I doubt I would have given it above a 3. As a father of two girls, I was very glad that it was a story about two sisters. **minor SPOILERS in the next few lines** I actually had to talk with my daughters (both under 10) to make sure they got that it was an 'act of true love' that saved the day, and not the true love's kiss. I don't think they fully got it that it was the relationship between the two sisters that was essential.  Hopefully they will see it again (probably a few times) on video and that message will fully sink in, but I am glad they saw it in the theatre. For me it was something very different.  I am a huge fan of animated movies that can entertain both adults and children, Pixar being my favorite.  I dragged my wife to see Pixar movies before our children were born.  But this movie did not work for me, I might have enjoyed a few moments here and there, but otherwise I was bored.",1
173,"*SPOILERS* Well, I got a chance to see Disney’s “Frozen,” and I must say, it’s pretty cute, but the story did not provide enough details to the lesson(s) that can be learned between Elsa and Anna.  The only problem with the story is that it pays too much attention expressing emotions between Elsa and Anna, plus the characters show off with sing-a-longs and a few gags just to bring laughter and joy.  However, the animation is overall tremendous and the 3D effects are amazing.  And as for the songs, none of them kept on pace with the story.  Most of the songs show off, except 1½ of the songs such as “For the First Time since Forever (1)” and “Let It Go   Even though the movie does show some lessons to learn, but it was not descriptive enough to support the lessons. The story did not live up to its momentum.  It only expressed emotions between two sisters Elsa and Anna.  Plus, there’s a bit of a slip up.  In the scene “The Party is Over, Close the Gates,” Elsa should’ve used her other hand with her GLOVE on, instead of her bare hand which revealed her icy powers.  This slip up proves that the story pays too much attention to the emotions.  When you look at the whole story, you can almost see a retelling of Disney and Pixar’s “Brave” based on character references, besides the story. Speaking of the betrayal of Prince Hans, there are twists in the story.  What is twisted about the betrayal of Prince Hans is that prince charming was supposed to save the princess, but instead betrayed the princess for her kingdom.  Another twist is Anna choosing between Kristoff, since they love each other, and her sister Elsa who was about to be killed by Prince Hans with his sword.  She chose her sister since she truly loved her. The animation has a lot of snowflake effects, especially when you can see a floating snowflake in 3D.  You can almost capture it and see it melt upon your hand, but noticed that it’s all 3D and not real.  Disney is an expert on creating real 3D effects to make it look real.  The icy power strongly reflected Elsa’s emotions, but did not comply with the story.  But for the record, the animation on her icy powers was fascinating, especially for self defense against the Duke of Weselton’s bodyguards. The characters in the story truly kept on pace with the story, but sometimes show off from each of their point of views.  Of course, there’s one character who truly supported Elsa and Anna, and that is Olaf the snowman.  Despite his purpose to spend time with summer in his song “In Summer,” not only he gives warm hugs to people, but also gives hope to keep them going.  Some minor characters, such as the Duke of Weselton and trader named Oaken, almost even the odds but provided small gags.  The main antagonist, Prince Hans, brought the twist at the last half of the movie.  He provided the climax for the story.  The Abominable Marshmallow was Elsa’s snow guardian.  The king and queen in the story were quite short, but did provide a bit of drama in the beginning.  The trolls played an important role in the story since they help restore people from any kind of danger.  But throughout, the trolls mostly helped Anna since she’s the only person who got help by the trolls (except Kristoff kind of raised by the trolls).  The main characters in the story are Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf.  Elsa is almost the main protagonist in the story since she possessed the icy powers within her, but the real main protagonist was Anna since it is up to her to bring Elsa back to her kingdom and bring summer back as well.  Kristoff, with his reindeer Sven, not only saved Anna from a pack of wolves after they left Oaken’s place, but more importantly brought her to the trolls after she got a frozen heart.  Speaking of Sven, he reminds me of Maximus from Disney’s “Rapunzel (Tangled),” since it acts like a dog than an actual deer.  Olaf is a supporter to Elsa and Anna.  He helped Anna escape from the library to get to Kristoff and Elsa. When characters sing their songs, most of them show off, but Elsa and Anna provided an important song, “For the First Time since Forever,” and a bit of Elsa’s song, “Let It Go.”  The song, “Do You Want to Build a Snowman,” almost stayed close to the story based on the age shift from young to adult on Elsa and Anna, but more on a relationship between sisters after Elsa was forced to conceal her icy spell from Anna’s sight after her accident when she was young.  However, the last part of the song was a bit sad after their parents’ death at sea.  Most songs are showing off.",1
174,I didn't believe the hype this was probably the most praised movie I've ever seen and amazingly it wasn't disappointing I loved the characters and the music that there's a lot of in this movie the story wasn't anything new but then again everything new has already been done it managed to have a completely unexpected twist which did surprise me and as for the animation of this movie its probably the best I've ever seen this movie would be worth watching just to see how visually impressive it is Elsa is probably the prettiest of all the Disney princesses and the most unique making her my favorite of the Disney female characters overall Frozen is my favorite animated film and gets a very rare 10.,1
175,"I love CGI movies, but this was a big disappointment! 1. The animations were nothing new, it seems like they haven't done anything new in over 5 years! Even some of the textures were low resolution! 2. The musical pieces seem, just like a filler in the movie. 3. Story? there was no story, it was a copy of the lion king. 4. This is another example of a Disney movie, that should of went straight to Blu-ray release!",0
178,"Seeing this movie made me mourn the late Howard Ashman all over again.  The lyrics in this film were so trite, the songs so mediocre (at best) I could hardly watch it.  With the exception of the good (not great) ""Let it Go"", the songs are what kills the picture for me, though some annoying plot lines and story structure issues plague it as well.  I know I'm in the minority, but we've grown to accept such low standards these days.  The art direction, however, was stellar.  It was just such a missed opportunity on many levels.  It could have been great, it just wasn't.",0
179,This movie was surprisingly good and to me was not like other predictable Disney movies. IT had a lot of singing but I really enjoyed watching it. Olaf the snowman was my by far favorite character.,1
180,"I can't stop watching Frozen right now because this. This is the perfect icing on the cake and for so many years of fantastic animated work with a blend of unforgettable adventures, I'd say move over Simba because Queen Elsa and Princess Anna might get your number. Frozen is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time since the 1989-99 Disney Renaissance era and I couldn't be more happier than singing in the movie theater than listening to the song ""Let It Go."" Every time I listen to this song, it becomes a theme song for fans everywhere to see what magic lies ahead when fear and love meets adventure in so many places. That's what Disney is all about, keeping their promises and start rebuilding a new generation of Renaissance after a past decade of good and bad movies that almost ruined their reputation for success. But 5 years have come gone by since The Princess and the Frog and just like any movie musical has to offer. Disney, I hope you should make more animated musicals in the future. Kudos to both Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell for putting on a phenomenal performance as Anna and Elsa. I hope they should make a Frozen sequel or a short film really soon. The cold never bother me, anyway!",1
181,"Amusing in its storytelling and rousing in its musical stylings, ""Frozen"" further hammers home Disney's absurdly satisfying understanding of the animated family comedy.",1
182,"The character development, the finer and smaller details and the writing are what make this movie shine. It does what an excellent movie is supposed to do, make the characters and plot go by effortlessly to an untrained eye. The plot's also very good and suitable to children, while still being appealing to adults.If you have a kid under 16, watch this with them. If they're not interested, watch it alone.",1

184,Frozen is a fun and adorable movie. I feel like they could have done a bit more but I was satisfied overall. I'd like to also say I like warm hugs as well.,1
185,"This movie with out a doubt was an amazingly fond film. Disney did a great job. Aside from some of the ""musical"" elements in the beginning it was very good but a very predictable story though with a twist. I really enjoyed and I think you would too. It's great and touching too. I give Frozen a 9.8/10. -.02 for musicals. So overall a 10.",1

188,"There is so much hype for this film. Everyone is singing the songs, everyone is quoting dialogue - and that isn't always the kids! So I had to get around to watching it at some point. The music is pretty top-notch and I'm not usually a fan of musicals. There is quite a lot of it though and some transitions into and out of them are a bit scruffy. It does also seem rather rushed overall with its rather odd pacing, but its charm should melt many a frozen heart",1
189,"With all the praise Frozen had been getting, I decided to go and watch it. From the trailers, it seems pretty terrible, some story about a snowman and a reindeer. But when I sat down to watch it, I was completely blown away. It's other-wordly good. I've really got no words to describe how much of an impact this movie can have. It's so emotional and so perfectly executed. I've never watched a movie so many times before, and yet it gets better and better every time. It's truly once in a lifetime that something can have such an effect on you. I was expected much, but the animation, the storyline, the drama, the RIDICULOUSLY GOOD musical numbers make it not the best disney animation I've seen, but by far the best animated movie I've ever seen and ever will see.",1
190,"As a 90’s child, I have grown up watching all of the Disney movies. All of the princess movies are the same as in they all convey a message that true love exists and that it is okay to give everything to a guy you just met. This message has harmed my generation, but Frozen changes that idea. Yeah, I know, I am a guy and I will admit . . . I watched the princess movies. In all honesty, Frozen is one of the best ones yet and I am now 19 instead of 7.  Frozen, the most recent Disney success is meant to redefine the definition of “true love” that all the other Disney films have created.  It also teaches hidden lessons to children such as: get to know someone before making any big decisions, a disability is not a curse no matter how bad it seems, and that hiding from your problems does not make them any easier to deal with. This movie was extravagant and included some of the best songs I have heard in all my years of watching Disney films.The movie is based on a fictional location called the kingdom of Arendelle.  Arendelle is ran by a family of four a king, queen, and their two daughters Elsa and Anna. Elsa, the older sister, has this magical ability to create ice and snow.  Anna is the younger sister who is very energetic and full of life. The kids begin their childhood not knowing anything but each other, and then the two are forced to spend time apart out of a fear of Elsa’s powers harming her sister.  The two girls reunite at Elsa’s coronation about ten years after they are split up. The two girls are excited to see each other, but Elsa is still fearful and Anna is ready to explore and rebuild a relationship with her sister.  The two girls get in an argument and Elsa flees to the mountains. Anna goes after her and meets a mountain man Kristoff, who guides her up the mountain to her sister’s hideaway. Anna reaches Elsa, but Elsa’s fear of harming her sister becomes reality.  Anna becomes ill and goes back down the mountain to get to her kingdom. Elsa is captured and brought back to Arendelle as a criminal.  Elsa gets scared and escapes captivity using her skills. The main characters find themselves out on the frozen water searching for one another. By the end Elsa figures out how to control her powers and the hope of the sisters’ relationship is restored. I’m going to be honest, I’m a guy in college and Frozen seemed a little too childish for me to go see, so I waited till my little sister made me watch it with her. The film immediately captured my attention with a heart-wrenching backstory and I soon realized that this film was much deeper than the commercials and advertisements.  The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Even on parts that were not meant to be so exciting I was captivated by some aspect of the film. This film was all inclusive and politically correct as well as telling a deep story. The political correctness comes from an encounter Anna has with the store owner and his family on her journey up the mountain. The store owner was a bit feminine and when the film flashed to give the viewer of his family, the viewer saw another big guy surrounded by little girls. The older audience caught on that the big guy in the back was his husband and the girls were “their” children. There is no other film that is this deep, politically correct, and this sound. Frozen is also one of a kind when it comes to the expertise in the musical soundtrack to the film.  The film always had a song to go with the emotional parts and kept the audience’s attention by captivating them with songs.The film taught many lessons, but there are three in which I personally found. The lesson of getting to know someone before making any decisions comes with Anna and Prince Hans “falling in love”. Anna became really upset with Elsa when she said no to their marriage, but by the end, Anna had fallen in love with a completely other man.  Another lesson that came to my mind was that a disability is not a curse no matter how bad it seems. This lesson is learned throughout the movie as Elsa learns to use her “powers” to her advantage and figures out how to control them. Just as if a man with a vision impairment was not able to see, but when he learns to use his other four senses in a way in which others cannot, then he is at an advantage to normal people versus being able to use all five in the average way. The last lesson I obtained in my time watching this film would be that hiding from your problems does not make those problems any easier to deal with. As Elsa was locked in her room for over 10 years she was unable to find out how to control her powers around others because she was afraid of hurting anyone. That is like a kid being afraid of a roller coaster but will not try it to see what it is really like. In all, there are many lessons taught throughout this movie and this is barely a scratch upon the surface.Frozen is a fantastic and lesson-filled film that is perfect for people of all ages! Personally, I h",1
192,This movie is just boring i love Disney and their classic character's like Mickey Mouse Donald Duck and Goofy and the rest but this is just **** torture.,0
194,"I don't normally like these types of movies, but seeing all the acclaim I expected good things, but I was disappointed, with cheap attempts at humor, underdeveloped characters, and the fans that worship it, it is truly one of the most, no the most, overrated movie of all time, as for the positives, the animation looks nice, and the singing was tolerable.",0
195,"So, we watched Frozen recently, and I just have to write a review about it!! Ken and I had some mixed feelings about this film.  While it was good overall, I was kinda bummed about some aspects of it. The good: --Most of the music.  Let It Go is an epic song, and Olaf's song is hilarious! --Olaf!!  He is HILARIOUS!!  I adore his character, and his lines were epic :) --Kristoff's conversations with Sven.  I do that all the time with my pets, and it was awesome and laugh-out-loud hilarious to see it in a movie! The disappointing: --Hans.  I mean, really??  I did not see that coming.  I also did not like that twist. --Elsa being the ""I don't need a man"" kind of woman.  I loved the direction it was going when there were two guys and two girls - each girl gets to be with someone who loves them, and are able to be sisters again. The bad: --Nothing!!  I didn't find anything bad with this movie.  It's awesome, and while I would have changed the ending, it's just a movie ;) Our Alternate Ending #1: Since Elsa is Winter, Anna is Summer.  Elsa had knocked Anna's powers out when she hit her with the snowball as a little girl, and Anna gets her magic back when Kristoff takes her to see the trolls.  Then, she's able to stop her sister's eternal winter, by bringing summer.  The sisters then find that they need each other to be balanced, and are able to be best friends again.  Elsa doesn't have to fear her powers, because she has her sister to thaw everything back out again. Anna is actually the true love of Hans, and he's not cold-hearted.  Kristoff ends up being Elsa's true love, and both girls find themselves able to be close sisters again, while also each having their true loves.  All 4 live happily ever after! Our Alternate Ending #2: Kristoff ends up being Anna's true love, and Hans ends up being Elsa's true love.  Each guy balances their girl out: winter to summer and vice versa (think about it: blonds with red-heads...winters with summers).  They all balance each other out, and with the help of her new love, Elsa is able to control her powers. Overall: This is definitely a movie I will be watching again and again, and will soon become part of our home collection, I'm sure.  If you haven't seen it yet, you should!!  If you're a fan of Disney movies, enjoyed Tangled, or just enjoy comedy and a good story, be sure to give Frozen a shot!",1
196,"Too be honest I was looking forward to watching this but Disney, how did you win a Oscar? the story was just the same as lion king which was a great film but with princesses and everything was predictable. the only thing I liked was some of the songs but some like first time in forever was terrible!!!!",0
197,"This movie is obnoxious. I liked it at first(kind of), but looking back on it I do not understand why I ever watched it.It is one of the most overrated crap ever. come on disney your better then that.",0
198,"I have always been a big fan of Disney ever since my childhood, and the image of Disney in my mind has somehow been chipped by “Frozen”. The movie lets me down in various way, including storyline, character development, and music. The storyline of “Frozen” is quite a straight line. There is hardly any surprise or thrill from the beginning to the end. The movie does have a climax  probably the part when Hans intends to kill Elsa  but it is more the climax of a hill, not a real big mountain: Anna is capable of covering such a distance in a tic-tac to save her sister; Hans miraculously, and ridiculously, is blown backward and knocked out as if a bomb goes off in front of him. All of those actions happen at an unnecessarily slow pace, and with almost no noticeable sound, which totally kills the excitement. There are many ways to make “Frozen” more ‘heated’. The trolls waking up from the guise of rocks, which is quite a surprising idea, is used twice  not to mention how boring the second time is, and whoosh, the surprise just dies; they could have saved the wake up for the second time only, and first time may be just their eyes glowing in the dark before the troll leader approaching the girls’ father. Also, both the exposure of Elsa’s power and the fight in the ice palace are just too ‘peaceful’; why don’t the crowd make more loud noise, and act out their anger? Why doesn’t Elsa show more desperation? Why only two soldiers confront with her later? Why do they all seem so relaxed and ‘polite’ in such a fight? Nonetheless, the climax is still the biggest waste, as it could have been improved easily with the addition of just some minor details: Hans could have been much crueller, Elsa’s pain could have been reflected by more extreme weather, stronger background music could have been played, and Anna’s defrost could have been more glorious and bright. The advertisement about music production for “Frozen” is not a bluff at all. Indeed, many songs such as “Let it go” or “For the first time in forever” are excellent to listen as singles. However, collectively, the music of the movie is not really successful. First of all, the distribution of songs is not appropriate. Within only 17 minutes, from 8’20” to 25’30”, there are three songs all of which are over 2 or 3 minute long, and which outweighs conversation; while in the latter half of the movie, there are only a few songs. Also, in my opinion, the song “Reindeers are better than people” are not needed; meanwhile, such part that needs atmospheric music like the climax is almost mute. Character development is another remarkable problem of “Frozen”. The movie is very successful in terms of heroic female characters; however, the development of antagonists is unfairly shallow and unnatural. It is very creative of them to pull “Frozen” out of the common “prince saves princess” theme and to portray Hans as a traitor. But there is a somewhat inconsistency in his actions, and his image is quite weak compared to other characters of “Frozen”, and to other villains created by Disney. The movie would be more exciting if Hans changed side once more at the end, or at least appeared more cunning and cruel. The same misfortune happens to the Duke of Wesselton, who appears in the movie very shortly, and seems to have no impact on the storyline.",0
199,"This movie is god-awful. Seriously, the songs are so **** annoying! The storyline is stupid. The characters are bad (except the villain). The voice acting was terrible. This movie is one of the worst Disney movies of all time. It is so overrated that it is even worse than The Wild. Don't watch it. Watch Chicken Little or Ice Age instead.",0

201,"A very fun and imaginative movie; Frozen manages to tell a nice story with likable characters, compelling scenarios and top quality animation... its downside is the fact that, in typical Disney fashion, it doesn't take any risks due to their target audience but is still a fun movie to watch, it's a shame that the best elements of the story are downed in favor of being more family friendly...",1
202,The movie was predictable a Hans= hi impact games Christophe= ready at dawn since ready at dawn writes better stories in their games. HIG can only design ratchet but not Jak but ready at dawn can design Kratos and jak.,1
203,"I am a huge Disney fan, but this film was quite disappointing for those expecting the same attention to detail their films are known for. However, for children, this film will bring great joys. Their first faultier was in the character design of Anna, their primary character. Her design was far too familiar and heavily resembled Tangle's Rapunzel. She bore the familiar round eyes, thin innocent smile, and quirky let-it-loose innocence. The trio of Anna, Christoph, and Sven also felt familiar to the trio of Rapunzel, Flynn, and Maximus in Tangled. Their second questionable decision was the extent (and way) in which they added musical scenes. Two or three pieces of music done correctly would have fit perfectly. However, the music was a distraction. The opening piece didn't excel vocally to set the tone as it should have, and Idina Menzel (Elsa) took us outside of the film and onto broadway. She has a beautiful voice, but the execution in which her voice was utilized took away from the quality of the story. Another huge gap would be the connection between the audience and the King and Queen before their passing. It wasn't as heart-wrenching as it should have been because the audience didn't have that moment where we saw a ""smile-worthy"" memory in relationship to them and their children. (Perhaps a scene where the whole family played in the snow?) A final detail of concern is that Disney has not noticeably recognized the culture in which Disney Princesses stories are told, however, I had hoped to feel a little more of the Norwegian Culture. Perhaps by having a norwegian cast, instead of the popular celebrities.",0
204,"Never have I been so shocked an appalled at a film. The advertisements displayed a lovely little romp involving a snowman trekking through the ice mountains in order to find his elderly mother named ""Kristoff""  (a total milf btw). The reality was a movie which droned on for all eternity and was insanely as interesting as my seventh grade history teacher. Instead, the story was about two high-pitched prepubescent imbeciles who live in Chicago  during the great depression, and like to sing depressing songs of the absence of their mother. Safely, I can say I have never EVER walked out on a film 3 minutes after it had begun.",0
206,"The best animated movie I've seen so far, ""hands down""! It's not just the great music, super voice acting, amazing animation, and well developed story, it's more than that. It's the true realization of disney's vision of children movie.",1
207,"One of my favorite Disney movies to date.  Might sound blasphemous to say in this day & age for a new one but it really gets everything those classic movies did right & more.  Not only that, but the characters are all likable & even realistic at times with how they interact.  They even make fun of a couple Disney tropes, though in a loving way.  Really the only thing keeping me from rating this a 10 is that there were a couple unnecessary scenes/songs that just slowed the movie down for me & took me out of it for a while.  But this is still a great one. (For my full review, look up ""Spin It Reviews"" on YouTube.  I'd appreciate it.  And don't worry, no spoilers.)",1
208,"Tava com um pouco de desconfiança sobre a animação porém no começo fui perdendo isso. Resultado:  divertida, a história não  grande coisa mais  divertida graças a seus personagens.",1
209,"This movie is great, for a Disney film. It has likable characters, stunning visuals and great music. That's really all a Disney film needs, and it deserves an 8 for it.But the movie isn't superb because many parts of the story don't make sense. Why remove Anna's memory of Elsa's magic and keep the girls apart? Wouldn't Elsa hurt anyone else like her parents as well? Even so, the girls couldn't have become that estranged living under the same roof unless Elsa was locked in her room all the time, which isn't the case since Elsa was seen somewhere that appears to be a hallway. Also, you can't jump off a sled in the midair. In the real world, you can't marry into the throne. Anna would be the queen if Elsa died and if they both died, the crown would be passed on to their cousins. If that's how the fictional system works there would be people trying to do what Hans did the moment the King died. Anna wasn't the queen so she couldn't have left Hans in charge of the city and even if she could, people wouldn't be loyal to him enough to sentence the queen to death, which is plainly ridiculous. The part where Anna saves Elsa is even more absurd. Unless Elsa is deaf, Hans is deaf and blind, or Anna is Sonic the hedgehog, I don't see how that part works.As for the rest of the story, it's mostly OK. It's typical, but still enjoyable. I love how romance isn't the love that unfrozen Anna, and how Olaf was willing to melt for Anna probably because of how dedicated and fearless Anna was. Overall the movie is great.",1
210,"It's a very good movie to watch. Your can watch it with your family's, friends, or anyone. Two sisters were the queen and the prissiness in there country named Erindale. The queen was Elsa and her little sister was Anna. When they were kids Anna was hit by Elsa power. Elsa power was frozen power. That can frozen anything that she hold. That day they made there own cute snowman named Olaf. He wanted it to be summer but he didn't know is that he would melt. Ten he became alive and started to talk with everyone plus he is A VERY CUTE SNOWMAN!!!",1
211,"Though the animation is arguably Disney's best yet, the story falls short of its expected standard. The characters are stock and hollow with no real personality. The story is heartfelt at times but is overshadowed by the plot's lack of logic. Fun and enjoyable, but not a Disney classic despite its inexplicable box office success.",0

216,"This movie is ok, but some parts were just horrible. The worst line: Hey we just met, let's get married. I was like ""bulls***!"" I was like what the crap is with this we just met let's get married business?",0
217,"BEST movie ever, I would definitely get this if I were you! I love the movie, even if it is a little sad at the end. I LUV FROZEN!!! It has everything anyone could want in a movie, so why are you still reading. go buy it. or atleast watch the trailer. blah blah blah blah blah blah. let it go, let it go. cant hold it back anymore, let it go let it go!! turn away and slam the dooooor I don't care what they are going to say, let the storm rage on the cold never bothered me anyways. I also luv the catchy songs!!! MMM, dum di dum dum dum dum dee dum de duuum, dum du m dum dumda dum dum di dumdum dum di dumdium",1
218,"After looking forward to seeing both ""Epic"" by Blue Sky Studios and ""Frozen"" by Disney, I saw both of them this weekend. The main character of ""Epic"" looks like a twin of the main character of ""Frozen"". Also, one movie deals with cold vs warm and the other deals with decay vs growth. Finally, both movies rely a lot on beautiful nature shots. For these reasons, I felt I should review both together. ""Frozen"" was much better than I expected. Frozen reminded me a lot of traditional Disney classics like Snow White, Dumbo or Bambi. Yes there was singing, but the singing was surprisingly traditional without sounding corny and outdated. Unlike in most cartoons that involve singing, in ""Frozen"" it enhanced the experience rather than being a turn-off. ""Frozen"" also had a rather well-developed story. It wasn't a traditional good-vs-evil story where the good were perfect and the bad haven't got a single redeeming quality. It also wasn't yet another generic ""we must remain ourselves and fight tradition"" story like Mulan, Brave and so many others out there. The characters felt more real than I'm used to in a Disney flick and combined with some humor that actually works, that makes ""Frozen"" one of the most entertaining animations I've seen in a long time. ""Epic"" was an ""epic failure"" in all of these area. The characters were bland and generic. The story was bland and generic and felt like they mixed ""Arthur and the Minimoys"", ""Antz"" and ""Ferngully"" together, then filtered until nothing interesting was left. The humor didn't work either. As silly as the talking snowman in ""Frozen"" may look, he actually did work as a comic relief. His actions were funny, his words were funny and he complemented the heroes of the movie well. In ""Epic"", a snail and a slug served the very same purpose, only they were annoying as h***. Think Jar Jar Bing annoying and worse. The only thing that works in ""Epic"" are its visuals. If I just wanted to look at pretty pictures, both ""Frozen"" and ""Epic"" would be equally beautiful. The problem is that a movie is more than pretty pictures. A movie is entertainment and needs to entertain. While ""Frozen"" was much better than I expected, ""Epic"" was much worse.",1
219,"I didn't like Frozen one bit. The movie progresses very slowly and unless your a little kid, it won't keep your attention for more than a few minutes. None of the songs were good and the story has been done over and over again. Even with Pixar stubbing the last few years, Disney has yet to make an animation film worthy to stand amongst Pixar.",0
220,"The scoop for dads&boys. Its a musical and they spemd wayyy too much time singing mediocre songs and not enough story.if you like  i sit when i pee and i gotta be free""  type music then go see this.. The trailers were basically the only highlights of the movie -the rest was all singing. I think girls& mommies will love it. But don't get roped into seeing it if youre a guy. They could have done so much better with the story. Elsa has a curse. They don't say how she got it or why or anything. Kristoff is shown as a kid for 5seconds and suddenly is a man who comes out of nowhere. The one sister ignores the other with no explanation to her. Big story. Not. My five yr old could have wrote a better story. I would wait to rent on dvd.",0
221,"Some elements in Frozen were good, such as individual characters and even the songs are okay in their own little ways, but the story was lackluster and uninspired, the only moments I felt any sort of story was near the end, and went very slowly through the beginning. I've always been a Disney fan but Frozen just didn't keep my attention and quickly got boring. It's slowly progressing and anti-climactic, and unless your a little kid, it wont keep your attention for more than a few minutes.",0
223,"Never before have I walked out of a film. I don't understand why this film is advertised and sold as yet another well rounded hallmark Disney animated film. Instead this is a female centric story focusing on sisterhood, aimed at a female demographic with unnecessarily long songs. Instead of having a story focused upon on the ice queen or her sister, they try and do both. It fails especially because the sister, Anna, is a lonely young girl yet is well adjusted and unrealistically happy in her situation. Her clumsiness and the ridiculous timing of Prince Hans' interactions with her is exactly what we'd find in a romantic comedy; i.e. a cliched silly, clumsy girl being lovestruck with the perfect gentleman. To top this off in the first 20 mins we have to endure 3 long songs, 3! As if 1 isn't enough. Admittedly I loathe singing in cartoons (because they are a distraction, elongate film, serve little purpose and/or are a cliched introspective moment where a character finds resolution in song) but I wished the trailer showed this film for what it really is.",0
226,"This film made 1.2 Billion? I'm not into musicals, so I thought hey maybe the storyline is great which is why its so popular... But no. The film has the most typical boring cliché storyline, and you know whats going to happen 30-40 mins into the film. I wasn't expecting the best storyline in the entire world on a scale of The Matrix or anything like that. But they could have done a lot more. Not to mention the overall animation could had been a slightly better as well. The characters aren't interesting either, nothing really appeals to me about this film. But hey, if you like musicals then you'll love this film to death I guess.",0
227,Perfectly formulaic no heart no brain a semblance of a strong female lead to inspire girls to buy fads . Not a  single creative song full of negative stereotypes . universal acclaim no should be disdain. Let it Go starts empowering but ends in a negative passive aggressive manner .,0
228,"Frozen, a story of family, love and beating the odds.  The movie starts out with the loss of parents, a fight between sisters and a town cast into a perpetual winter.  Elsa, the queen of Arendelle, has been trying to keep her magical powers a secret.  When Anna, Elsa’s sister, and Elsa get into an argument over a potential engagement, Elsa’s secret becomes public to the whole kingdom.  This leads Elsa to isolate herself in the forest in an attempt to “protect” those she loves.  Anna bands with a mountain man named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven, in an attempt to protect the kingdom.  With twists, turns, and adventure throughout the movie.   With a race against time Anna proves that an act of true love is what is needed to end the winter.  In an attempt to safe her sister Anna almost gives her life.  This ultimately leads to end the curse of the perpetual winter and the restoration of unity between sisters.Even though the summary of the movie seems like it would be a heart wrenching classic, Frozen’s overall performance was quite mediocre. Starting with the positive aspects of the movie. One’s expectations with a Disney Film would be flawless animation, this is where Frozen delivered. Throughout the film you can see articulate buildings, houses and castles fitting the Scandavian region the movie is depicting. The buildings were not the only thing that caught my eye, the patterns and colors in the clothing each character was wearing were beautifully elaborate. One of the amazing scenes took place when Elsa was created her castle with her powers, as each spiral rose up from the ground it created a glow that was immaculate.  If the castle was created in real life, it would be classified as one of the great wonders of the world. The animators had a task in front of them with variety of different characters that would be in this film such has a human with magical powers, talking snowmen, rock trolls, giant snow creatures and many more. With each character they were able to create flowing movement, facial emotions and real life actions to give it the appeal that this could be real.I grew up singing along Disney movies such as The Lion King, The Jungle Book and other classics which sometimes you can still catch me singing today. The music in Frozen was very catchy and upbeat just like the Disney classics. At the same time it was a little different, it almost had a Broadway or musical feel as Elsa, Anna and others sang solos and duets. With this style of music, it aloud a greater audience then just little children it appeal to those who are fond musicals. While I was watching the movie I saw this little six year old girl who was singing every song, I couldn’t help but smile and try to sing along. My girlfriend, who loves musicals like Wicked and Beauty and the Beast, loved the music so much that she went out at bought the sound track, she puts it in when she wants to be in a better mood or just to sing along. I believe that is what Disney is trying to get out of their movies, are happy feelings that make you want more.As in most Disney movies such as Finding Nemo, there seems to be a tragic start usually consisting of a death to a parent but this time it seemed to be almost wrong. Both parents were killed leaving behind two young girls to grow up in a castle by themselves due to Elsa’s fear of hurting others with her magical powers. The two girls become isolated from each other, which the depiction of being held captive against their will for different reasons. A plot of murder, greed and lust is underlying in the movie with one of the characters.  Is something that children should be exposed to at such an early age? I think not! You might as well let them watch Lone Survivor at least it had some deep moral value to the plot.When we think of Disney we think of romantic princess love stories like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White to name a couple but Frozen’s love story was a disaster. Anna who wants nothing more to be in love, is betrayed by the man of her dreams. Not to mention that Elsa has no love romance in her life, even though she just became the queen of Arendelle. The end left you still sad about the whole situation there wasn’t a “Happily Ever After” ending that is Disney’s trademark.I would say that this will not be one of the great Disney classics that everyone cherishes and passes down to their children. I was left with a sense of emptiness towards the whole film. I would give this film 2 out of 4 stars because I know that Disney is capable of so much more. You don’t need to go to the movie instead go buy the soundtrack and sing out loud with you children, friends and even your girlfriend.",1
229,"So overrated. I swear to god, this movie is tedious and mediocre at it's finest. It's bland, boring, predictable, and the songs suck. I'm sorry Frozen fans, but I can never ""Let It Go"" (Get it???). The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it looks nice and flashy, but so does EVERY ANIMATED MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!! I seriously think that Planes is better than this, and that sucked. This is a pure example of my conspiracy theory that DISNEY IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD!!!! (or at least entertainment) I mean, people are saying this movie has the ""Classic Disney Magic "" that all the others did, and that's complete garbage, and they know it.  Disney bribed all of those reviewers to give an average movie amazing scores so they wouldn't give it the scores it deserves. However, that isn't stopping me! (Haha I won't blame you if you don't believe my theory; but you can't deny this film sucks) I must tell the truth! I must show the world what a crappy movie this is! The ""Melted"" Campaign will begin! (OK, I have gotten way off topic). The point is, this film is overrated, and there is nothing anyone can say that will change my mind. THERE!",0
230,"What can I possibly say about Frozen?!? It is one of my favourite animated movies. The music is everlastingly catchy and I now sing the songs constantly. I also refer to lots of quotes in every day life. Why? Because they are brilliant of course! This movie is a must see for Disney lovers, musical adorers and children everywhere. It is light and heartwarming. The characters are beautiful and the scenery is so well done. The story line is beautiful and shows that true love conquers all and not always in the way you expect. The plot twist was great! No spoilers though. So watch it!",1
233,"Lame songs, Cliche after Cliche, been there done that story....  Shut me out, good prince, bad prince, talking animalt-hings, TRUE LOVE.... blah blah blah....",0
234,"I took my 5 year old son to see Frozen and he loved it, because it's animated. He loves anything animated. I love animated movies but I hate musicals, and this was unfortunately a musical. I simply cannot understand why Disney would force this movie as a musical. The best animated movies of our time has demonstrated that singing and dancing simply doesn't add any value. Every moment they can, someone bursts out in a song. Why? Why does someone have to sing how they feel. This seems to be a lazy person's strategy to tell a story. It is lame and outdated. This movie could have been done without it. Otherwise, the animation was good, story line was average but movie was far from edgy. Only for kids really. Pixar has mercifully shown us that the Disney classical animated musical is dead and useless, and that animated movies can be for adults too. Disney, please tell your story without some lunatic bursting out in a song.",0
235,"I'm putting this down as the most overrated film of the year. It's a purely artificial film with a full collection of very forgettable musical pieces. It's like Disney thinks they can simply whip up a bunch of great singers, superb computer graphics, and whimsical characters and everything would work. It doesn't. You can't make me care about characters with no depth. If it wasn't for the Olaf character, this movie would easily get a big fat donut. The only thing this film accomplished is making me want to go back and watch a masterpiece in Beauty and The Beast (10/10). After you watch this film, you'll see the similarities and why Frozen doesn't hold a candle to it.",0
236,Frozen is a masterpiece in animation this was one of the best animated films I have ever seen. the musical moments was amazing the story is funny and charming all at once. This was truly one of the best films I have ever seen.,1
243,"First things first: this movie is NOT bad , not at all. It has nice characters, the story is pretty good and has nice twists that I actually didn't expect, the comedy is not invasive and the side characters are also very likeable. But it has 3 big major flaws that really drew me back and I couldn't enjoy it at all. 1) Too many songs! I grew up with Disney, so did a lot of people, so hearing songs in a Disney movies is nothing new and some of my favourites are actually from Disney....but here, it's just too much. I could count at least 3 or 4 useless song during the entire movie (even more, but I have a reason for that), and it slows the pacing of the movie instead of increasing it. Some songs are good at least and those few that fit DO really fit. But ""Quality over quantity"" next time please....oh, and ""Let it go"" is decent. 2)This should have been a 2D animated movie. I'm sorry, but it should have been, because the characters are obviously drawn for representing a 2D animated movie, not a 3D one. Don't take me wrong though the movie is FANTASTICALLY well done, GORGEOUSLY animated and has some amazing designs despite the lack of colors (It's mostly white). Still....I just couldn't stop thinking how better it could have been if it was a 2D cartoon, and not only because  of the characters being just too similar to normal people, but mainly because it's not realistic and it's thought to be likelike that, yet it is 3D, very realistic, and in the end it's so unfitting I couldn't stop thinking about it...I mean, would you think the same of a movie such as The Little Mermaid or Aladdin, if it was remade entirely in 3D? Infact, this leads to my biggest flaw of the movie.... 3)It.Is.Forgettable. I saw this movie yesterday and I already forgot about it...and that is the worst sin a movie could do nowadays: being ""bad""  that it's forgettable. But it's not a bad movie, so why did I forget it just after watching it? Because of the 3D graphics being boring...despite being VERY good. It's ironic I know but, like I said, this movie would have been so better if it was made in 2D, because the movie ITSELF is actually thought to be a 2D movie. Or, if they wanted to make it 3D, then make it completely realistic like The Polar Express or A Christmas Carol: those work, because characters aren't made to look like 2D animated characters, but thought to be actual people and that's why they impress people. Frozen instead just becomes a vague memory the moment you turn off your dvd reader, because you've seen the same 3D stuff everywhere (if not better), better jokes, better humour...and better stories. Am I being unfair? Probably, but I was very curious about this movie and I'm sort of glad to have watched it...but I highly doubt that I'll watch it again in the near future, If you loved it, good for you and don't take my opinion as a personal matter: it's just opinion. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to watch some lion becoming a king or something....",1
244,"Frozen takes me back to the days of the Disney Renaissance with it's music, imagery, and the magic of fantasy and fairy tales. The two stars, Anna and Elsa, are wonderfully played by Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, respectively. Love is provided a different meaning this time around compared to previous Disney films and its not just about love between a princess and prince or anything related to that. Of course, there is a eventual relationship between one of the main girls and one of the main guys. However, that is besides the point. The film shows that there is more to true love than we usually think of, which is pretty nice. There is a lot of examples of girls feeling empowered, besides the obvious one when Elsa sang ""Let It Go"" after running away from Arendelle after exposing her ice powers to the public. There's a lot of likable characters in this movie, including Olaf who provides most of the humor along with the clumsy Anna. The music is wonderful and it re-creates that Disney magic that I have not seen in a while, in terms of Disney animated musicals. The atmosphere and imagery of the film is incredible and makes the area of Arendelle vast. The animation is pretty cool, especially the snow effects, which proves central to the film's story and characters. Overall, very good movie and for those who have questioned whether Disney Animation Studios has lost its magic, here's your answer (along with Tangled).",1
245,"A bravura and toasty comeback to the zenith of Disneyland, FROZEN, the freshly BEST ANIMATION PICTURE crowner in the Academy Awards, has already swept the globe with its colossal box-office gross and the ultra-appealing theme song LET IT GO, it also signals the first time for our beloved animation tentpole, a lovey-dovey boilerplate of a princess in the quest for her Prince Charming is preponderated by the bond between princess Anna and her sister, the Ice Queen Elsa, a more broad and wholesome act of true love. Step into the shoes of the cutting-edge sub-brand Pixar, whose BRAVE (2012, 8/10) heralds a trend whereby a female heroine can break the shackles of looking for male suitor as the one and only goal for life. FROZEN goes for a more ambitious yet crucial route to accentuate the courage of embracing yourself as who you are, no matter how different you are from the rest, shut down your heart and lock yourself up in an isolated kingdom is not a way out. Such a valuable message can be widely assimilated among viewers while the roots remain Disney-esque, tuneful and catchy musical numbers with routine delivery, prominent sidekicks fittingly align with the protagonists, like Olaf, the snowman naively thirsts for summer and sunlight, the contribution of Josh Gad’s voice cannot go unnoticed. Veteran animator Chris Buck teams up with the first-time director Jennifer Lee, together they construe Hans Christian Andersen’s popular fairytale (The Ice Queen) into a visually variegated adventure, minimize the cliché-ridden flourishes which commonly embellish the leitmotif (no redundant sub-plots to slow down the narrative pace). The story progresses in a wonted and linear approach, yet the whole journey is never in deficiency of enchantment, while the plot is fairly more twisty than Disney’s usual fare, a key revelation against the grain can blindside audiences without a hitch. The voice-cast are enjoyable despite that Menzel’s voice is overtly too old for Elsa, it is also a plucky move to cast an openly out actor (Groff) to dub the valiant reindeer rider as Anna’s genuine soulmate and love-interest, along with the connotation for a more nondiscriminatory society extracted from the pith of its tale, FROZEN is a cinematic hero of our times, a film reaches a much broader demography and transcends its general raison d’ être, it may indeed positively refine our world into a more civilized tier and it is no end of virtuous achievements!",1
246,"Some absolutely gorgeous visuals and some of Disney's best music in a long time. Aside from that there really isn't much else that special about this movie. While all the character are well designed and acted, they are simply not as developed as they could be. Even the two protagonists feel a little shallow in their development. Plot is extremely flimsy and what little there is is over shadowed by one musical number after another. The music, while gorgeous, is just too prominent and makes this feel more like an over budgeted sing along. Overall:Criticisms aside, Frozen is still allot of fun to watch and does live up to Disney's high standards, it's just a shame as there clearly was greater potential here for something greater.",1
248,"Frozen has fun songs, and an exciting and lovable snowman. That is unfortunately all the animated film delivers. More of the same. The writers devious attempt to disguise the plot with catchy tune didn't work on me. The 'Classic Disney Magic' that i have seen in the past is repeated again in this pathetic plea by Disney Animation Studios to make a modern movie musical. They fail. The reason is in the past. Why use the same plot twist more than once. Does Disney Animation Studios think i'm an idiot. The ending didn't seem to go anywhere. It seemed that all people hated the queen because she had powers. By the end for some odd reason, they all loved her. Nothing occurred to give them a reason to love her. The creators of this film oddly decided to combine Shrek and Tangled. They took the plot of Magical spells, and ""true loves kiss"" from Shrek. Just about everything else from Tangled, musical edition. Anthropomorphism of horses and reindeer, and love found in unusual places. This film is the epitome of unoriginal. It had the potential to be good. If it wasn't so good at being a copy cat.",1
249,"A simple premise of an ice queen that is misunderstood with the support of her family, sprinkled with musical scenes throughout the movie. Entertaining watch for the whole family that adjust the Disney formula just slightly to stay fresh and current while wow the viewers with spectacular icy visuals.",1
251,"Finally a Disney film not about being rescued by a prince. Very touching a beautifully done. Some of the songs are a bit cheesy but hey, that's the nature of this film.",1
252,"Frozen is overrated, yes, but two things I've seen it's bugging some people. 1) Why would you watch a musical if you don't like musicals and then say ""I didn't like it because it has many songs? I mean... Does MUSICAL says anything to you? and 2) Many people say it's a ""copy"" from the Lion King don't realize that if we compare all the movies the way they do, 99% of the movies ever made will be a ""Copy"". Please don't use that argument, it's just dumb. Let's be critical here. I liked the movie, it's not awesome, but it's good, you can't say it isn't good or else you'll not be objective. Disney follows their predictable formula on story telling, yes, it has a nice final and different touch in message when the ""charming prince"" turns out to be the ""bad guy"" so that is new for Disney. In characters, Elsa, it's probably one of the best characters ever created in a Disney movie (I'm talking about her as an individual character) and, as I said before, the Charming Prince being not so charming is a good addition. The characters I really dislike were the trolls, the design is just plain, they could have done something better with their story and design, I personally hated them, specially their song, it gives nothing to the storyline, the lyrics are not good, nor the composition, it's just basic. Overall the songs are not iconic, except for the obvious two ""Do you wanna build a snowman?"" and ""Let it Go"", this last one having a great composition, you should listen to it with your best headphones to discover the greatness of this song and of course, the kinda cheesy, but empowering lyrics. So if you like musicals and animated movies with good visual effects, watch Frozen. If you don't like musicals and Disney, just stay away from it.",1
253,"i hate to hate this movie. it's very good except for the comedy aspects. they tried to take a more mature and emotional but fail with its childish and unfunny jokes. i would watch this again for the really touching and deep parts of the movie witch it gets down pretty well. the movie lacked comedy, it goes from such a deep and compelling story to jokes that feel like they where meant for 5 year old's. i have to admit that some jokes in frozen where funny but most to all jokes made by the snowman (forget his name) feel very inmature and not funny. all in all i think it was a OK movie and if it kept with more mature jokes that where meant for kinds and adult it would have gotten a 8 or 9 out of 10 in my books",1
254,"In particular, I really like the animation is of high quality and has good music, and that's why he won two Oscars, and did not see anything wrong, except the songs. Personally, I did not like the letter, why do not they care disney lyrics of his songs? problem that did not affect too but this detail does not give you 10, but it is a great movie and I recommend it to fans of adventure.",1

257,"Disney’s “Frozen” tells the tale of two royal sisters, a younger, rambunctious Anna, and her regal older sister, Elsa, who possesses magical icy powers. As children, they share a close bond, but one night, after Elsa strikes her sister with her powers, they are separated. When Elsa is coronated, she reveals her powers to the public, and runs away to the North Mountain. Princess Anna, with the help of a visiting prince, a tough ice-harvester, and a talking snowman, discovers that love will thaw a frozen heart. It’s not uncommon to see good animation, but luckily, Walt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS) does their homework when it comes to movies; “Frozen” is no exception. Staff travelled to an ice hotel and walked through snow in dresses. After all that, four programs were developed specifically for “Frozen”. Adding to the realism of this fantastical movie, the colours and graphics bring the detailed environment to life. Emotion is conveyed especially well thanks to detailed facial animation. The movie’s first act is highlighted by a short montage that almost manages to reach the standard set by Pixar’s Up. The second act is typical of adventure-themed movies, although it lags in a few places. The action scenes are disconnected from the rest of the movie, boring viewers instead of keeping them on the edge of their seats. There’s also a major plot point that may leave eagle-eyed viewers confused – how can a visiting prince hold more power than the reigning monarch?  . Sadly, the musical is relatively front-heavy, which occurs due to the action picking up drastically in the much-too short final act. Some arcs are wrapped up quickly, while a few are left hanging. Although its flow and plot are of passable quality, “Frozen” relegates the common “good versus evil” theme to the backseat, replacing it with the much more effective and relatable one of “fear versus love. As much as it’s mentioned, “Frozen” is not the first Disney film to show that women can be independent. “Frozen” subverts many traditional “Disney themes” – “love at first sight” or a prince/princess relationship. While “Frozen” evolves themes, it stops short of revolutionizing them. Even though a relationship can’t happen after one hour, it can still happen after one day apparently. Regardless, “Frozen” does well with its roots growing from familial, not romantic love. Its heartwarming themes are accompanied by meaningful symbols – doors, gloves, and Olaf. He evolves from the all-too-overused comedic relief to an important, epiphany-inducing character who symbolizes the bond between the two sisters. Aside from an adorable snowman, “Frozen” features not one, but two princesses as its lead characters. Both are multi-faceted and have a tragic background that will quickly evoke sympathy from the audience. Anna is clumsy, joyful, and entirely un-princess-like, a Disney Princess that young girls can relate to. Her sister, Queen Elsa, is far from perfect as well. Accompanying the two female leads are three main males: Olaf, a talking snowman, Hans, a model prince, and Kristoff, a bulky, pragmatic ice harvester. These unconventional characters make “Frozen” what it is – a ground-breaker of animation. The voice actors of “Frozen” are not well known in the film industry, but rather at Broadway. Luckily for everyone, “Frozen” is a Disney musical. Their voices shine in their respective roles, each voice fitting their character perfectly. Emotion is conveyed excellently, with each character’s nervousness and fear coming through – a common trait of the heroes. Thanks to song composers George and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, as well as score composer Christophe Beck, “Frozen” is accompanied with a glorious soundtrack. While Menzel’s leading song, “Let It Go”, is a defining power ballad, the reprise of “For the First Time in Forever”, shows off its own literary power and keeps Disney tradition in mind, driving a significant amount of character development and plot. Although most songs are amazing, two songs – “Fixer Upper” and “In Summer” could have been removed in order to cut down on its 102-minute runtime. The movie has an excellent score, but the “Epilogue” track stands out from the bunch, reprising both “Do You Want To Build A Snowman?” and “For the First Time in Forever”. It’s one of the tracks that can be listened to without context, a property that few scores possess. “Frozen” earns its place amongst the magical movies of the Disney Animated Canon by proving that “the power of family is the strongest magic of all”.",1
258,"Even if the plot and both main characters are not quite develop as they have to be, the movie overall is great. The song ""Let it go"" won an Oscar not for nothing and it's in my mind for days!",1
260,"I am a fan of Disney films and even musicals, and this is in a way the best of both worlds. This film is kind of overrated being called ""The Best Film of the Decade"" but even if it is, that by all means doesn't make it a bad movie. I enjoyed the different approach that Disney took with this film and even how they wrote the characters. My only complaint is that the villain was kind of stale and predictable from the beginning but it doesn't taint the film in the slightest. The soundtrack is outstanding and so is the animation and storytelling and I defiantly recommenced it for ANY fan of musicals or animated films.",1
261,"All Characters, Actors, and Music are good. But what's Wrong it's 80% Funny. Not Really Much Funny Stuff in the movie, but Olaf is not really a funny snowman.",1
262,It's been 3 years since the last Disney movie and 18 years since a good one. This is probably the best Disney movie anyone could ever ask for. This has also been the fist time that Disney if not working by the book! This is a must see movie!!!,1
265,"I only watched “Frozen” a few months ago but I almost cried during the movie. The story was amazing, the performances of it’s voice actors were outstanding and the songs took my breath away.",1
266,"Sure, it was good but also a bit overrated. The best part of the movie was Olaf the snowman who was able to keep me interested. He was just too darn CUTE. But there were some flaws too. ""Let it Go"" was good when it first came out but it's so overplayed now, I'm getting rather annoyed by it now. ""In summer"" is a better song anyway. Still, it has more charms than just a funny snowman- the characters are mostly likeable and the music is quite good. If you like Disney Musicals, you'll probably enjoy this.",1
270,"When their kingdom becomes trapped in perpetual winter, fearless Anna (Kristen Bell) joins forces with mountaineer Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer sidekick to find Anna's sister, Snow Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), and break her icy spell. Although their epic journey leads them to encounters with mystical trolls, a comedic snowman (Josh Gad), harsh conditions, and magic at every turn, Anna and Kristoff bravely push onward in a race to save their kingdom from winter's cold grip. Beautifully animated, smartly written, and stocked with singalong songs, Frozen adds another worthy entry to the Disney canon. Even though there are a few issues, some of the songs aren't very good, it's filled with corny and cheesy moments and has a very pointless villain. I'll give Frozen a B-. (7.1/10)",1
271,This movie is perfect. Period. End of story. Watch it. Now. Seriously. It's awesome.,1
273,Frozen was definitely a cute and well made movie. The voice animations were fantastic and Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel did an incredible job as Anna and Elsa. I thought some of the spontaneous outbursts of song were a bit forced and took away from the moments a bit and I thought they could've made some of the emotional elements a bit deeper. That last part is what tends to separate Pixar from the rest of the bunch but Frozen still mostly delivered. I thought it was a bit overhyped because I don't think it's the greatest animated film ever but it's still a great film and definitely the best of the past year or two.,1
274,"Started off really rocky. I didn't really like the songs, and I kept thinking that it might have been better as live action instead of CGI. Later on as the plot thickens they stop doing so many songs and I took a better liking to it. Despite being a Disney film, they didn't go to heavily on the humor, which made it work really well when they landed a joke.",1
275,Frozen has already become a winter classic--this Disney tale is much more than a children's story. To know that Frozen may never have been completed is devastating to think about.,1
276,"By now, if you aren’t a three-year-old – in which case I would be puzzled to see you reading this –, you know what to bargain for when watching a Disney production: ravishing animations, a feel good story teaching morals, more or less fun for the whole family, but also a rather unoriginal script abounding with clichés. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee’s Frozen preserves the modus operandi, but is one of the most exciting and entertaining features the film studio has forged in recent years nevertheless.",1
279,"This is probably the best Disney animated film for the last 20 years, since ""The Lion King""! I must say that I'm very impressed. The songs are lovely and memorable, the music is great, the plot is interesting and quite unusual for Disney, the characters are very nice. I'm really looking forward for a sequel.",1
280,"Look, ""Frozen"" doesn't really need an introduction. The 53rd Walt Disney Animation Studios film became a massive worldwide phenomenon that doesn't seem to want to stop. And because it became so widely hyped up and made a crapton of money and had its songs replayed a lot on YouTube, you kind of get what's gonna happen: a ton of people will love the film, a ton of people will hate the film. Me personally? I love it. I love the characters, I love the themes and the way the story is told, the animation is brilliant, the voice acting is great, the film is funny and heartwarming, and the music is extremely memorable. There's bound to be a few people that will disagree, but all in all, I definitely loved ""Frozen"" and I think it's absolutely worth watching.",1
281,"A good but SUPER-OVERRATED movie! The story is the same as other Disney movies. Something tragic happens to their family and then they grow up to be princesses. But, the animation is top Notch and the characters, especially Olaf, are heartwarming.",1
283,+Great Animation+Excellent voice cast+Memorable musical score-Formulaic Disney Overall very entertaining if predictable disney animated musical. The quality though is very impressive!,1
284,"Prior to watching this: Disney animations from the past 10 years have been poor but they have been improving. Of the much more recent ones, I have seen Meet the Robinsons, Bolt and Wreck-it-Ralph. Had a terrible experience with Enchanted. Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey...urrgh! in any film. Premise: A princess struggles to control her freezing powers and decides to leave her kingdom and sister so as not to hurt them but that turned out to be the wrong way out. Pros: I liked the change from the polygonal characters we often get with Pixar's films. This has a great X-Men mutant type story with great songs and comedy bits and a very good twist at the end. Cons: Slightly let down by lack of realism in how the two princesses go around with so little clothing in the cold and with some of the ice structures. 5/5 (No half scores) - Good enough to pay to watch it in the cinema and buy the DVD.",1
285,"Good points about this title is the indepth character design paired with a massive 64 multiplayer experience.However there are weak points such as the stale singleplayer and a badly optimised graphics engine that requires the best hardware to run.Overall 9/10 great multiplayer experience.",1
286,"I do admit that Idina Menzel's ""Let It Go"" was powerful and amazing, but maybe it was too powerful and amazing, because after that sequence, everything seemed a little less exiting. Nevertheless, ""Frozen"" as a whole is still fun and entertaining, so I don't see why You shouldn't give it a try.",1
287,"Frozen is the biggest-earning animated film of all time. It is full of excellent songs, great animation, and a plot more mature than the usual family flick. Put simply, it is honest, enjoyable, and beautiful to watch. But it falls short of its highly regarded reputation in quite a few areas.You can really sense the effort that the filmmakers at Disney have put into this movie, however it doesn't always seem like they've focused it in the right areas. Frozen is frankly better at starting plot and character arcs than it is at tying up all the loose ends left over. The characters seem more distant and less involving than those of past Disney hits. And for a movie called ""the most feminist and progressive"", the more major of the two heroines (Anna) spends a lot of time relying on the men to help her.But Frozen is by no means a bad movie. Olaf and Sven are hilarious to watch. The songs are superb, especially Let It Go. And the movie successfully challenges the old Disney formula of true love at first sight. Frozen is not the biggest or the best animated movie, but it is certainly good quality family entertainment for all.",1
288,"Frozen é um filme bom, criativo, chamativo e sucesso de bilheteria, mas eu pensei que seria melhor. Tem algumas coisas interessantes, como Olaf, mas o tempo de duração de Frozen é longuíssimo, fato ruim. E a Elsa não é o protagonista? Como assim?",1
290,"We all love Disney, that means that we all love Frozen! Frozen is the perfect animated movie for everyone, just like many other Disney movies. Although Frozen feels very unique, and it's one of my favorites.",1
291,"I simply cannot understand why there has been such an incredible backlash for this film since the time of its release. I believe the psychological aspect of a movie being perceived as ""overrated"" can result in people believing the movie to then be worse than it actually is. Also, I think many people have the desire to be countercultural for the sake of being independent and unique. Regardless, I believe this movie to be very strong, one of the best to come out of Disney for a long time. Frozen does an excellent job of using the musical format to advance its character development. The songs are not there simply to add some music and draw the attention of children. They are there to develop the characters and drive the plot. I thought Elsa was one of Disney's more complex characters. There has never been a Disney princess with quite the amount of psychological struggle that Elsa goes through. Plus, the King and Queen who (unsurprisingly) perish actually play a big role, by creating the fear in Elsa at a young age. Kristen Bell does an exceptional job as Anna, who takes a different path from other Disney princesses in that she actually has to explore the concept of love and reevaluate her perspective. The twist with Hans was phenomenal in that I would never expect Disney to pull a move like that. I truly believe Hans to be on a similar level to Scar in his strategic planning and sociopathic manipulation of others. Contrary to what others may believe, I thought Hans was a great Disney villain. In general, the movie does a wonderful job of taking cliches and using them to its advantage to create new paths for its story and characters. Excellent film, and even as a lifelong Disney fan, I consider this to be one of my favorites.",1
292,"This is one of Disney's best films thus far. The songs are mostly really good, the characters and acting are strong, the soundtrack is solid, and the story is great. The main problems with this film are that the villain has kinda nonsensical motivations, and the romance is very under baked, but aside from those things, this is still a great film that's good for kids and adults.",1
293,"""Frozen"" was a very good movie , the story , the characters and the song ""Let It Go"" , charming , and know that everyone liked him and has taken away the uncertainty , very good .",1
294,"Okay let me say this. This movie is a guilty pleasure to me but I will explain why. I did enjoy the movie and BUT still, there are a couple of things that bothered me while watching. I think the visuals are really stunning. It feels like they put a lot of effort, time and even magic into the graphic designs of this movie. Kristen Bell is awesome as Anna and has a wonderful singing voice. I think the problem I have with this movie is on the story level.It feels like the writers didn't quite know where to go with this movie. It has no clear direction and purpose from the start. Of course, it is difficult to have a story with two main characters so it does not really 'work' that way. Although I really LOVE Anna as a character, maybe focusing on Elsa controlling her powers would have been better. Most of the characters are well done but it takes more than good characters to make a good story and I thought this animation was an example of that.I'm somewhat disappointed in the way they handle (or don't handle) pay-offs in this movie. Like Kristoff's obsession with ice should wind him up with Elsa, you would think... And there's the cool love song between Anna and Hans before... all of a sudden he turns out to be evil. I love a good twist in a movie but a twist should be traceable if you watch the movie again. There's absolutely no reason why Hans should have been a bad guy since Anna met him completely by accident. And she's not even the crown princess. So how do you motivate it to be premeditated foul play then? This felt a bit like lazy writing to me. ""Let's make him evil all of a sudden so she can date the other guy without remorse."" And why would Hans lock Elsa up if he could have killed her. He must have been planning to anyway as he always intended to become king and had no knowledge of Elsa's powers or what would happen. Why lock her up and let her escape? Why lock Anna up and tell everyone she's dead too soon. Everybody knows that's bound to lead to troubles. If one of the themes of the movie is True Love, then true love should be celebrated by cool songs, not false love. Also, there is little romantic tension between Anna and Kristoff, other than her rational consideration that he might love her because the frozen puppet tells her so (based on what actually? And what's the function of the puppet other than obvious 'comic' relief and potential for expensive children's toys?).They want to put so many perspectives in this movie, so many stories, that they lose track of the main story. And what is the main story anyway? Is it a classic love story? Is it the story of two sisters who care about each other? Or is it about Elsa trying to manage her powers and a kingdom? I would say it's mainly about those last two and in that case, focusing on Elsa would probably have made more sense. What if she had run away and had ended up traveling with Kristoff? What if in the meanwhile, Anna, who was never meant to become queen was having trouble handling an entire kingdom with the product of a day-long relationship? That would have made an interesting story. Having some match-making trolls sing a forced relationship into being doesn't quite do the trick for me.But hey, maybe I'm too critical. I notice a lot of people simply loved this story and that's a good thing! For me, though, there were a lot of loose ends in this story that made it difficult to really feel for the characters. If I compare this movie to Tangled, I think it doesn't match that level of storytelling by far. The story of Rapunzel was strikingly better written (even improved the original a lot), the lyrics were awesome while the songs in Frozen were rather forgettable. I noticed Alan Menken did not compose the music for Frozen only after I watched it and I thought: ""Yeah, that makes sense"". You have this fairy tale frozen wasteland that could have had a soundtrack like Edward Scissorhands or Narnia and yet you don't quite feel the magic. I watched Enchanted the day before, another one that remains great after many times. The music of Enchanted is witty and wonderful and the story is full of great humor and has a perfect pacing and structure. Frozen made me discover once again that great narrative build-up and Alan Menken make an unforgettable Disney movie. Without those ingredients, you get a fun Disney movie that does not even closely compare to the others when it comes to emotional impact and music. Also, I think the message this movie sends (if that is important at all) is a rather cynical one. Sure, it's great that true love is that between sisters for once (no big original surprise for me while watching). But basically it votes for love forced by shared experience and silly troll songs and states that love on first sight doesn't exist.Still, Frozen is definitely a 'to watch' because it looks gorgeous! Although I wonder if the makers used subliminal messages or hypnosis to cause this fan hysteria. Best Disney ever? Definitely NOT for me.",1
297,"One of the best Disney animations of the 21st century. An easy, enjoyable watch especially if you have girls in the family. Songs, story and animation out of the top drawer.",1

300,"Frozen is an appropriately measured modern classic; it is the type of movie which takes on a fairy tale induced historic setting, but adds modern mannerisms, dialogue, and inside jokes to connect you with the characters and their journey. There is a lot of originality with the story arch, but at the same time the conflict does not dip down as low into fathomless peril as some of the prior Disney classics have led you on. All in all, however, Frozen makes for an enjoyable movie full of laughs, heart aches, and maybe something that just might warm you up inside.",1

I love watching this film and there are good songs with it and I also never get bored of watching it.",1
314,"Frozen is one of my top 10 favorite Disney movies, one of my top 10 favorite musical movies, one of my favorite animated movies, and one of my favorite movies of all time. Very likable and well developed characters. The animation was gorgeously done. The writing was very fun and original. The voice acting was stupendous especially Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, Alan Tudyk, and Santino Fontana. The musical score and soundtrack were spectacular, I loved every song especially Let It Go, Do You Want to Build A Snowman?, In Summer, For The First Time In Forever, and Frozen Heart. The soundtrack is one of my top 5 favorite Disney movie soundtracks, one of my top 5 favorite animated movie soundtracks, one of my top 10 favorite soundtracks of all time, and one of my favorite albums of all time. A+.",1
315,"Its OK however it is pretty forgettable for me since like 3 things are happening at the same time, Example:Anna freezing, Elsa fighting the soldiers and the reindeer rushing to help Anna. I also dislike the fact that some of the battles are with musicals. Not hating on musicals, but they are not for me. Like the first battle with Anna and Elsa, when she accidentally hit Anna with ice, I would have wanted to see some sort of action or something interesting other than Elsa having a panic attack and Kristoff helping Anna. At the very least, I would want to see some verbal action. Also, who is the bad guy/girl in the movie, is it Elsa or the prince?",1
316,"Seriously, NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE GOOD !!! I just do not understand why Frozen is so much praised by the critics and by the public, when not only is it a thing that is overexploited so much, but because the plot of the film, as the musical and characters, has many flaws. As in the worst argument to make Hans bad only because, yes, Anna has so much love for her sister Elsa with rescuing her, being that they do not speak for almost 30 years because Elsa was locked up by the danger of her powers, What a trip Anna's and Elsa's parents made, the bad planting of Anna and Elsa's relationship as a sister, that the trolls would help control the powers instead of doing silly things and putting Olaf in the story just as stuffing.Also the songs are forgettable and not memorable, because the only rescatable thing is that they go with the plot, but their lyrics are not endearing or memorable and stupid.The script is loose, cliche, not memorable and it shows that Disney did not take pains to create a good movie, but he did with the intention of selling goods like crazy. And that is the current problem of Disney, which now only knows how to overexploit its products so many times, even if that product is good or bad. And most are bad and mediocre. Few are salvables. Obviously the animation, the character design, the special effects and the music composed by Christophe Beck are very good. And that is undeniable. But what respects the script, the songs, the development of characters and the argument leaves a lot to be desired. We hope that Disney returns to do what was good before :(",0
317,"If the story didn't cheat at a few moments, this would be a 9. An excellent and surprising reinterpretation of a familiar story that not only puts it upside down - it puts a lot of what Disney made us believe upside down. Beautiful animation, incredible relationships between the sisters, a pretty decent plot twist and of course - Olaf and ""Let It Go"". It's smart, it's funny, it's incredibly engaging.",1
318,"This film was slightly inspired in the children's tale ""The Snow Queen"" by Han Christian Andersen. Obviously, anyone who knows the original story quickly realizes that there is a totally new story, set in a fictional realm, geographically located in Scandinavia. The kingdom is ruled by a king who dies and leaves the throne for a daughter, Elsa. But she lives isolated by the fact that she was born with a gift that she is not able to control: she freezes everything in which she touches, including people. The one who suffers most is her sister, Anna, unable to understand her isolation because she is unaware of that power. The film revolves around these facts, and the relationship between the two sisters.The story is beautiful and really able to move the audience and make him identify with the princesses. Elsa is a strong woman, able to make decisions alone, in the style of the modern Disney princesses, whereas Anna is more affectionate, dependent and romantic, mainly thinking in her need to marry a prince. So we can see here the meeting between a modern Disney princess and an old-fashioned Disney princess. It's very interesting to look at these differences and see how the two sisters relate, as well as how they change and transform one another. And while there is an obvious male hero (Kristoff, a merchant), the film shows that he is the antithesis of a prince and princes may be the worst option.There are some script options that don't make sense and some of the characters' actions have no logic. Despite that, the movie works. One of the nicer characters is a talking snowman, magically created. This movie is full of magic, especially that which is provided by a good, dedicated and professional CGI team. The film has good visual and special effects, excellent animations and magnificent colors. The snow is bright, it looks fluffy and the ice is more elegant than a lot of expensive crystal I see around. Finally, we must talk about the awesome song ""Let It Go"", carried out by Elsa. Its very easily in the ear, joining to the extensive roll of iconic songs that Disney immortalized.In short, its an excellent animated film, designed for the whole family and not just for children. Carefully well done, especially in the more technical aspects, it has a rather functional history, despite some glaring flaws and illogical situations.",1
319,"One of the most overrated movies in history. This is by far my 2nd least favorite movie made by Disney, because my #1 least favorite movie by Disney is The Wild. I JUST HATE FROZEN.

It does not deserve to be popular.Let's see how the movie did.Songs: THEY ARE SO ANNOYING, STUPID, AND DUMB!!Characters: MOST OF THE CHARACTERS ARE UNLIKABLE EXCEPT FOR HANS AND PRINCESS ANNA, at least I like Anna, AND OLAF IS NOTHING BUT A DUMB SNOWMAN, AND ELSA IS A RETARD!!Animation: THIS HAS SOME OF THE WORST ANIMATION, THIS IS A HUGE LION KING RIPOFF!

323,"I don't get what people see in this movie. Until I saw the wretched pile of filth that was The Emoji Movie, this was the worst movie I had ever seen. The story was pretty bad as well as somewhat confusing. This movie is a musical, so it's gonna have a lot of singing. But are the songs good? No. Not at all. I thought they were pretty bad to begin with, but hearing every single human being on this planet singing them all the time non-stop (especially the highest form of torture in the land, Let it Go) progressively made them worse. The only character I liked in this movie was Olaf the snowman, but even then I didn't like him very much. Now, there are two reasons this review is a 1/10 and not a 0/10. As Disney movies typically do, it had wonderful animation. And there was one scene I liked in this movie, that being the one at the trading post. Overall, this movie is absolutely terrible, but at least it has some good points unlike The Emoji Movie.",0
324,"Sinceramente me he acercado a Frozen con mucho cuidado debido a toda la asquerosa mala fama que cogió cuando se estrenó, que era hasta repugnante ver a Olaf y compañía hasta en la sopa.Me he encontrado con una película buena, decente, sin más, con una animación sobresaliente como ya nos tiene acostumbrados Disney pero con una trama simplona (sinceramente no se de dónde viene la incoherente fama de Elsa, que de lejos es el peor personaje de la cinta tras el príncipe y su hermana se la devora en cada escena).Recordemos que esta película ha sido la segunda en cuanto a personajes que más dinero ha generado en merchandising después del famoso ratón Mickey Mouse, que ya es decir. Las canciones, pues pasables, si no fuera por el bombo que cogio la mundialmente famosa ""Let It Go"" hoy en día tampoco me parecería nada del otro mundo. Sinceramente, no es una mala película, pero siento que es un paso atrás después de Enredados (Tangled, 2010), que me parecía mucho más fresca aún siendo del ""género princesas"" con personajes mucho más carismáticos y menos empalagosa.A los niños (por lo que ya se ha visto) les encantará y los adultos podrán disfrutarla igualmente.Recomendada.",1
325,"Last Disney animated movie I have watched was already a long time ago. But always had good memories of Disney magical and musical worlds that they created.There was so much hype around Frozen and with the fact that they won 2 oscars with this, I finally put myself to watch it.Oh how I regretted my decision. The precious memory I had of Disney's magic was totally gone in an instant. Has Disney quality story telling really come down to this? Disappointed. Really don't know what the hype was about. It was a mess of a story with too many potholes. The Kingdom is portrayed as static as your typical Disney theme park. It had no soul, no atmosphere.The narrative of the story was rushed, you don't get any background explanation why Elsa was born with her powers and why others did not. The trolls saved Ana once, why couldn't they do it again, yes they said it was her heart this time not her head, which is a lame excuse, but okay. Besides, they misled her that she needed a true love kiss, which spun the story into confusion. If an adult finds it confusing, imagine how kids feel watching this?Talking about kids, the message of the story is not a good one for the kids. Ana was getting head over heels with the first man she meets (Hans), and then loving another man she meets even shorter of a time span than the first one. Crazy thing is she didn't knew she loved Christoph until her life needed to be saved. But turn out she doesn't need a mans true love to save her life in the first place. That was some crazy stuff happening right there, and it will send a wrong message to kids that fooling around with love is apparently okay according in this Disney movie....as if Disney says doesnt matter who you fool around with, as long as you find true love...Apart from the catchy song ""Let it go"" the queen Elsa really was not a memorable character. She was not coherent in her ways, indecisive and at times borderline evil and mental. Not a likable character. She was able to control her powers for all these years, and suddenly losing control over it doesn't make sense. Why doesn't Elsa push forward Ana to be queen, if Elsa was so afraid of letting people know her secret powers?And then the not so convincing silly plot twist where Prince Hans turn out to be this scheming evil person. Where it yet again send kids into confusing why this Prince charming seemingly turn into a bad person overnight. That is some lazy screenplay writing right there. Mess of a story, enough said. I would have given it a 0, but 1 score for the effort, that's about it.",0
327,"Almost everyone I know hates this movie and I can understand why, but I don't. Regardless, I consider this an okay movie, it's not Disney's best work, but it's not a bad movie by any means.The songs are great and serve a purpose to the plot (except for the Olaf song), so as a musical this is really good but what about the rest of the aspects like the animation, the characters, the writing, etc.?To begin with, the animation isn't that great. Sure the snow effects are nice but the lighting, textures and overall character animation are just okay and nothing better than what a Disney movie has done in the past, even when it was released in 2013 and I saw it for the first time I wasn't mind-blown by the animation or anythig. The plot is whatever, there are so many dumb things and plot conveniences that make the writing look lazy. Don't tell me that it's okay because it's a kids movie but let me tell you that there are tons of kids movies (and even Disney movies) with a lot of creativity in their stories and writing. The story is incredibly predictable (even the big twist that happens at the end of the second act is predictable and explaining why, will take too long to write) and it feels like there wasn't too much creativity or effort put in the script and the ""message"" behind this movie is corny and generic...Ohh, it's a story about loooove. The characters aren't that well developed, the villain is incredibly weak with no motivation, the only thing I'm grateful with the character stuff is that Olaf didn't turn out to be too annoying as I expected and while he was annoying, it never made the movie ""unwatchable"", like Gurgi from The Black Cauldron.The only thing I liked from the writing is that, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but there were lines that feel that they were written for a Disney parody or something, some lines that are aware of the tired Disney formula (like when Kristoff said to Anna ""Who marries a man in the same day they met?"") that was one of my only big criticisms in previous Disney movies.Overall this is a decent movie, it's not Illumination levels of bad and annoying but it's far from being something to be named great or a masterpiece. Almost every aspect of this movie is pretty bland, except the music and songs, which are really good.Oh, this won an Oscar!? WHAT!? I know an Oscar isn't a way to determine the quality of a movie anymore but my god, in a year where Monsters University (that didn't even get nominated btw) and Ernest & Célestine were far superior movies, this was deemed the best!?

332,"Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses magical powers that allow her to control and create ice and snow, often using them to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories so that she forgets about Elsa's magic. Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers, and that fear will be her greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle, closing the castle gates to their subjects. In an effort to protect her sister from her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, creating a rift between them. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents are lost at sea during a storm.Following her 21st birthday, Elsa is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is afraid that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them are the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls in love at first sight. Elsa's coronation takes place without incident, but she still remains distant from Anna. Anna and Hans develop a romantic connection during the coronation festivities, and he impulsively proposes to her, but Elsa objects when they seek her blessing. Hurt and confused, Anna protests, begging Elsa to explain her fear and isolation. The emotional strain causes Elsa to accidentally unleash her powers before the court. Branded a monster by the Duke, Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she finally acknowledges her powers, building an ice palace in which to live a hermit life. In the process, her magic unintentionally engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.Anna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an iceman named Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven, convincing them to take her to the mountains. An attack by wolves leads to Kristoff's sleigh being destroyed. On foot, they meet Olaf, a cheerful snowman brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle without her, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa. When Anna reveals what has become of Arendelle, a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. Elsa then creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless ""an act of true love"" reverses the spell.Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her, but not before they were married. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff, who Olaf has revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting ""an act of true love"".Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Hans is arrested and exiled from the kingdom for his attempted assassination, while the Duke's trade links with Arendelle are cut off. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss. The sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.",1
333,"In a rather weak year for cinema, regardless of genre, this is easily a bright spot. Those haters can screw themselves, I love this movie and nothing will change that!",1
334,"I love this movie. I know that alot of people talked about it too much and Let It Go was played way more than it should have been, but that honestly doesn't affect me. At the end of the day, Frozen is still a super fun winter adventure with good songs, memorable characters, and funny quotable meme-worthy lines. For me, it's a classic!",1
335,"Disney certainly made up for ""The Princess and the Frog"" with their movie Frozen, which has unforgettable songs that you can't help but sing along with, dynamic characters (especially Elsa), and a wicked plot twist in the end. ""Frozen"" strays off the usual ""Boy Saves Girl"" path and instead strolls down the ""Girl Saves Girl"" path. We're talking two sisters who have been isolated from each other almost their entire life. Drama galore, Right? Anyways, the songs are just magical. ""Let it Go"" is just over the top, and obviously deserved it's well-earned Oscar. Don't even get me started on ""For the First Time in Forever: Reprise"", which really shows the changing mood in the movie, and shows us basically what happens when somebody shuts another person out. Olaf the snowman is really annoying, however, which is why I gave this movie an eight out of ten, and I rather disliked ""In Summer"". Kristoff and Sven are cute. Oh man, I almost forgot Hans. He is a suckish piece of smelly poop! Overall, I love the movie, especially the plot twist at the end",1
336,"It does not matter who you are, you have to admit this movie is really good. When I first saw this, 9/10 movie. Phenomenal singing, great animation, good story. But this movie has blown up so much in recent years and that really ruins it for me. My sister sings songs from the new frozen movie ad the ld one so much it isn't even funny. That is why my score is a bit lower than it should be.",1
337,"good movie, very good, not ass movie i watch every year in decade. recomend to everi pepel.weak 7",1
338,"Frozen is a very solid Disney that I would gladly rematch even seven years later. Although the movie isn't something incredible, it is still entertaining as the characters and plot are well thought out. Some of the jokes fall flat, but for the most part, I enjoyed it.",1
339,"Frozen is more than well deserved of its praise and popularity not only through its catchy, fun, and energetic songs, but most importantly by the sweet, smart, and adventurous story that contains the most marvelous message for one of Disney's most relatable characters.",1
