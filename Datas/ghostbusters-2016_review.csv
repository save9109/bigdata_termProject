0,"Against my better judgement i did actually watch this cash grab... all i can say is shame on everone involved, and shame on the politically correct critics who were afraid of a sexism backlash if they reviewed this one honestly... either that or they were paid well!",0
1,"What happens when you take an original, funny, timeless movie like Ghostbusters(1984) and reboot it, smear it with unfunny one liners, thinly veiled misandry, steal its scenes because you're creatively bankrupt and try to profit on its name? You get Ghostbusters 2016: an insultingly bad cash grab  that tries to sell itself as an ""upgrade"" to the first film, while using gender politics to shield itself from any type of criticism. Don't waste your money.",0
2,"I have had more entertaining stomach flus. The entire movie felt so... desperate. They were desperate to seem funny, desperate to appeal to nostalgia, desperate to keep our attention. Their desperation become so obvious you begin to pity those involved in its creation.",0
3,"I loved the original when I was a kid, and was pretty hyped for this one despite the haters.While the actresses are ok and the CGI, while plenty, are not too bad, there is a huge problem : it's absolutely not funny. The writing is completely flat, delivery feels forced; it looked very amateurish; and after the first 10 minutes you realize you will be bored for the next hour and a half. Sorely disappointed...",0
4,"I hated to say it, but the haters got this one right.  Let me be clear, ripping on a film you haven't even seen is still a bit childish, but the movie is just awful.  I took my family to see it last night, and never in my life have I ever seen an audience more stone-faced during a comedy.  It was a weird almost uncomfortable atmosphere. It doesn't work as a comedy targeted at adults; many of the jokes are beyond worn out and predictable.  The effects are cartoonish.  The film doesn't work as a family picture either.  Some of the humor actually pretty crude.  I can not recommend this for those with younger kids.  Throughout the entire film, i sat there wondering:  ""Who exactly was the target audience for this?"" My girls did not enjoy it, and I was bored out of my skull after about the first half.  The only redeeming thing for me was Wiig.  She was her usal offbeat, but charming self.  McCarthy was just awful.  Literally nothing redeeming about her performance.  Jones who is usually hilarious, was saddled with a bad script and some truly horrible lines.  McKinnon is just kind of there.  She was utterly forgettable.  The males in the movie don't fair much better.  Hemsworth hammed it up, but it was way over the top.  Even the usually solid Andy Garcia looked like he was phoning it in.   Cameos from some of the original cast members felt shoehorned in as well. All in all, I wanted to like this, hell I defended this, but it falls well short of the mark.  Save your money, and wait for it to hit the bargain bin.",0
5,"A giant disappointment from many extremely talented people.  From the moment that this new cast was announced and Director Paul Feig was brought on board I was excited about this film.  I like all the female leads in this film and I especially love them working with Feig.  From Bridesmaids to The Heat to Spy, Paul Feig really knows how to direct all female casts.  Unfortunately he fails to deliver with Ghostbusters, a horribly unfunny waste of time.  I've seen worse in 2016 but I haven't seen anything as disappointing.  D",0
6,"What a huge disappointment. I went into this with an open mind and left frustrated and annoyed. There were a few moments that made me chuckle, and I absolutely loved the intro scene, to the point that I turned to my gf and said ""if the rest is like that I will be soooo happy, that was awesome!"". Unfortunately it was not. The plot was absolutely terrible, the forced cameos were completely unnecessary and the ending was horrendous. The actresses were a bit of a split bag, Melissa Mcarthy and Leslie Jones were actually the funniest out of the bunch, which I was not expecting. The trailers showed Leslie Jones character to be a stereotypical sassy black woman, when instead she played very similar to the originals Winston Zeddemore. Kristen Wigg was ok, however Kate McKinnon's ""wacky"" character grated from the very start, feeling very forced and irritating. I really am still scratching my head over a lot of the plot trying to understand it. Overall this was a below average, poorly written movie that actually showed some potential but couldn't get past the awful plot.",0
7,"Cheesy acting, dumb jokes, cliche and horrible written characters. The GhostBusters Reboot will pass like another failed intent to gained fame at expenses of a classic franchise",0
8,"This turns out to be just a really bad movie and an insult to the Ghostbusters franchise. After all the years of Sony saying no to making a new Ghostbusters movie and when they finally decide to this is the result. The actors in this movie just don't create the sort of chemistry and flow that made the original great. That being said it is also not their fault as they are not bad themselves. Kate McKinnon does a good job with what she has to work with as does Leslie Jones even though she is put into such a stereotypical character. I look forward to seeing these two in much better films. The writing in this film is just awful and in large the most atrocious part of this movie.  The male characters are horrible and other than Chris Hemsworth are completely forgettable. The cameos by the original cast are absolutely terrible and insulting. I did still enjoy Annie Potts but her cameo could have been much better to. There is just so much in this movie that makes no sense. In the first film since the Ghostbusters were new to this they basically destroyed the hotel with their proton packs just trying to catch Slimer but in this film they are all great shots somehow. The CGI overall was not very good and this movie seemed like it would have been better as a cartoon or a movie for kids. In the end Ghostbusters 2016 is just a bad movie and a cash grab that should have never happened like this. The blame falls on Sony, Amy Pascal, and Paul Feig for how this whole thing turned out. They should be ashamed of themselves and never allowed to touch something like this again. The worst part to me is that I think we could have gotten a good new Ghostbusters film but that would have required getting the right director and choosing the cast because they are right for these parts. Having women Ghostbusters is great but when you start out by making the qualifications for the part to simply be female and that's all that matters then you will never find a great cast capable of giving you that Ghostbusters magic. I wish Sony would have taken the time to do this right and make a great movie instead of worrying about politics and catering to the vocal minority. One last thing that needs to be mentioned is that Sony deleted the comments of a large number of women that were critical of this film to frame it as just men being sexist. Sorry Sony but if you respect women then you don't erase and silence the voices of those that don't agree with you.",0
9,"Sat through it last night because wife wanted to. Words fail me at just how awful this is. It is literally Pixels with Women. People keep praising Hemsworth and McKinnon. I have no idea why. Thor boy plays a moron. A complete and utter moron. It that's your thing go watch some old Mel Brooks movies and look for Teri Garr. That's Hemsworth in this. Shallow and stupid. And McKinnon? She's like a random clown thrown in to distract you from realizing just how awful and souless this mess is. Look! Jangly Keys!!! she is comepletely insanely random. She would work better in a Monty Python sketch. It's like she is channeling all Three Stooges in one body, at their most annoying. I suspect they accidentally gave her an old script for ""Tank Girl"" and nobody bothered to correct it. But at least she has and is a character. Which cannot be said of the rest of the cast. I can't believe any critic with ethics or a soul is giving this dumpster fire of a movie a mid to high grade. Just save your money. Take your family to see the Pets movie. Again if needed. Don't subject your poor daughters to this mess in order to empower them. They deserve better.",0
10,"A Terrible, Unfunny, Man-Hating Mess Heralded by the most disliked trailer in YouTube history, and an embargo on reviews until pretty much the day of release by a panicked Sony Studios, the ""Heaven's Gate"" of supernatural horror comedies is finally here, and what a terrible, unfunny, man-hating mess it is.",0
11,"This is the kind of garbage spineless critics try to make happen .. srsly get your **** togehter. Ghostbusters 2016 is horrible and would be horrible even with male lead actors.",0
12,"Ghostbusters 2016 doesn't understand what made the original special, and even fails to be entertaining on its own merits by constantly trying to emulate the original while failing. Wiig's and McCarthy's characters come across as bland compared to their usual roles. McKinnon's is annoyingly weird. Jones' character is a straight up loud racial stereotype. The only character that works most of the time is Hemsworth's, but it's not enough to save this movie. The plot weak and uninteresting, something that seemed to have been haphazardly thrown together for the movie rather than something crafted with care, so much so in fact that the movie's own self contained logic gets thrown to the wind at points. The original Ghostbusters made the implausible seem plausible, and took an absurd premise while playing it straight. Ghostbusters 2016 takes cartoonish characters and inserts them into a poorly written plot with lowest common denominator penis-vagina-fart-piss joke humor I'd be ashamed to show to my kid. Verdict: This movie is neither worth a watch at the theaters or even an eventual rent. If you need Ghostbusters, stick to the original.",0
13,"An awful mess. Don't see it, don't give them your money. Should've just been a SNL Skit. Talented actresses, but everything falls flat. Everything is wiped clean from the real Ghostbusters. Replaced good writing & comedy with mile-a-minute jokes that don't land. Constantly hating on men and shows men in a negative light. Men characters act absolutely dumb. Absolute garbage. The original worked because of the great writing. The writing is just not present here. Only memorable moment is the ""from the front"" fart joke. And that's because it's so bad.",0
14,"I can't blame the four stars, they just wanted paychecks.  Sometimes you can tell, but for the most part they try and you can tell they at least get along and have fun together.  No one else does.  They repeat the same beats as the original film to distraction, even bringing in embarrassing cameos.  I feel terrible for Bill Murray even though I'm sure he requested what happens in his scene after they contractually forced him to appear.  Aykroyd's cameo also jarred me and made me wish his character was in the film properly to send the new team off.  The movie shoves the producers agenda down your throat at all times right up until the finale which is a giant ""kicked in the nuts"" joke.  I left the theater feeling depressed and tired.  No one was laughing.  My friend insisted I had to go to the midnight showing because ""no one else was.""  The theater was empty and silent most of the film.  not a spoiler, but a joke about an ""anti-Irish fence"" is the only big laugh I remember and it was in the first five minutes.  The problem is no other jokes feel written.  All the other dialog was that meta, sarcastic sounding ad-libbing.  Where someone says a baby word or something and everyone else blinks like ""wut?""  There's 2 HOURS OF THAT dressed up in shiny, cartoony effects that are flitting in and out in maximum irritating fashion.  It was an endurance trial when all I wanted was to laugh.  Now I'm just tired and annoyed.",0
15,"As much as I hate to say it - Ghostbusters was a disappointment. Apart from the absolutely incredible visual effects, which were stunning, it lacked all the wit, character, comedy, emotion and sharply written dialogue that make, not only the original movies, but also the IDW comics, TV series (both Extreme and The Real) and the 2009 video game such a joy to consume. As is the hipster thing to do at the moment -to paint anyone who doesn't like this film as a sexist- I can tell you I have no problem with a female cast, in fact it may interest you to know that my favourite Ghostbuster of all time is Kylie Griffin, a (shock) girl!! For those of you that don't know her or Eduardo, Roland or Garrett I suggest you save yourself a tenner and watch some Extreme Ghostbusters, a series that does what a multimillion dollar film couldn't - simultaneously pay homage and respect to the original iterations whilst further steering the franchise in new and interesting directions. It's easy to say 'don't judge it based on what has come before', but if you didn't want it compared to things in the very same franchise simply don't call your movie Ghostbusters. At the end of the day Ghostbusters 2016 is a hollow cash grab designed to prey on nostalgia just to make a quick buck. This is more Transformers than Mad Max.There are far better ways to bust ghosts",0
16,"Even without comparing to the original 'Ghostbusters' this movie is absolutely bad, every part of it is painful. Constant jokes (that are not funny), awful script, flat characters and lazy acting. Giant disappointment.",0
17,"This movie is just straight desperate and pathetic. The humor is beyond dumb and forced. Honestly, I was encouraged to see Hollywood put some serious money behind a female-driven comedy. But....wow....it just constantly hits you with ""jokes"" that makes Adam Sandler humor look genius. Beyond the fact that the film completely failed as a comedy, it is just horribly written and mindbogglingly boring.",0
18,This movie is just pandering. It was painful to even watch. The jokes are not funny. The ghosts look awful. Don't waste your time or your money. Just watch the original again.,0
19,"Did anyone see one bit of actual comedy not lifted from the original movie / a nod to it? Effects, props, even car, worse than the 80s original. Awful",0
20,"This Ghostbusters is an insult to the hit original that inspired a sequel and a reboot. What you should do is don't answer the call, find whoever started the idea of this reboot, and bring it down to the ocean. These women are already fine in their own major-leading movies, but bringing them together to star in this Ghostbusters movie insults the original's main stars (At least some of them made a cameo in this film). For once this movie didn't even try to surprise me and it didn't even made me feel like I'm in the fun compared to the original. At least the original movie is filled of fun, unlike this wannabe-jolly reboot. Don't even bother watching it. Now I know what you might be thinking, ""Why didn't you give this a 6?"" Why, that's a very good question. Everything lovable about the original Ghostbusters are either cameos or got taken away from this movie like ""Paper Mario: Sticker Star"" except it's worse than that game. (The game scored a 5 by me.) Everyone is not as lovable as they seem to be in the original movie. At least just give men some respect, jeez, it's not like they must be dumb and uncomfortable throughout most of the movie. Having the most disliked trailer on YouTube, it's only a matter of time before this film gets flamed by a lot of users. Sorry, critics, you can't stop me from hating on it. Saving the world takes Melissa McCarthy, corny jokes, no respect, and a lot of fire. Come on, Paul Feig, you produced ""The Peanuts Movie"" and you gave us this? That's a big shame of you. Have at it, Paul Feig, and give us a new movie to watch that's great and watchable.",0
21,"First things first, I've watched it and its mediocre at best, but knowing that they didn't even attempt to respect fans of the originals is what makes me dislike it more. They have basically taken the Paul Feig formula that he has established with the heat/spy and copy pasted Ghostbusters on top.So instead of making a ghostbusters for fans, they made a ghostbusters for fans of  Feig movies.Imagine if they made a Spy sequel and instead of using PF/MM they got new actors/director and made it with a totally different tone and humor? tell me then if you would be upset as a fan wanting more of the same.I have no problem with him making his films (i will never watch them) but ppl are entitled to enjoy what they like.I wished they would have thought about what GB is first, then tried to make a good movie that fans would enjoy.If it was good enough it would have found an audience, as well as pleasing existing fans. The whole racial/misogynist angle Feig and co have been using as a deflection is a joke. maybe 1% are real trolls and misogynist, but they cant honestly believe the other 99% are all **** with no real concerns.It annoys me the amount of disdain they had for real fans, why they felt they needed to stomp all over its legacy.Look at SWFA, while it had some problems Abrams really had respect for the fans. They looked closely at the originals and cast the original actors while writing 'NEW' characters. The lead being a women was great and she fit the part, was no misogyny fan blow back.  Its was a SW movie first and foremost.Fans could see a genuine effort was made, and while there was gripes, it was nothing to do with Daisy Ridley being cast. Bottom line, there is a PC SJW agenda in the media/hollywood at the moment (and gaming too)And they will claim its because they're progressive, but being this heavy handed, smacks of twisting the knife and **** stirring.If they genuinely had the best interests of female actors (all women in general) they would look to find the right people for each job, instead of shoehorning copy pasting. Overall, they only have themselves to blame for the way the Internet has hit out at the clumsy way they handled everything.Misogyny didn't make the GB trailer the most DV ever..........Colombia/Feig did.",0
22,Have you ever had a favorite book that was completely ruined by a movie? Well now Hollywood is openly ruining other older movies with a movie. This movie is a disgrace go watch the original Ghost-busters for a cheaper and overall better experience.,0
23,"I reviewed this on IMDB too: Don't listen to a lot of the professional critics on this one, I suspect some are happier as their wallets are a little heavier after giving this a 'good' review, while playing it safe to appease the crowds. But their lack of honesty then requires real viewers to be honest in their observations and write about it. Some of the issues with this film: - The Characters - They are often too over the top, especially Kate Mckinnon, she becomes very annoying very fast, like a 13 year old trying to be funny. Kristen Wiig plays it less goofy but her issue is she looks like she doesn't want to be here at all. Chris Hemsworth provided a few 'bright' spots but certainly not enough. Leslie Jones was OK when she was not yelling, but she does this too frequently, it feels like a stereotype. - The Script/Jokes - Far too many rapid 'jokes', many miss and the standard is low throughout. Too many gross out, immature gags that often are just a cover for a lack of good writing. - Excessive Noise, Color - This whole movie is very noisy, ugly and in your face, they didn't say you can get a free headache with the price of your ticket too. - Reeks of a Feminazi Message - I love women, but I hate feminazis and the often hateful message they spread. Certain scenes are for sure geared towards this malicious group - such as the shooting the villain in the crotch, castration, to 'save the day', good message for kids there... - Runtime - I was checking the time throughout, it is overlong and the pacing is off, too many needlessly long scenes. Overall: The original Ghostbusters (and to an extent the OK Ghostbusters 2) had a subtle humour, this film is the opposite of that. Even if it wasn't a Ghostbusters film it still would be very bad, but to hijack the name of a great franchise to get your movie more popularity, that makes it worse. I was almost tempted to ask for my money back at the cinema afterwards, but then I knew what I was getting into as the trailers were everywhere, so I didn't, I did this to myself. --- So unless you too want to have the same feeling of being robbed after walking out of the cinema, I would highly recommend spending your hard earned money on another movie.",0
24,"Horrible movie. Washed out humor, predictable jokes and boring overall. Didn't have high hopes for this, but was disappointed still...like Fantastic Four Reboot disappointed...shame.",0
25,"In the Immortal words of Kevin Sorbo, I was ""DISAPPOINTED!"". What a flop, Feig owes me my money back, especially for insulting all those people smart enough not to be duped by this hack.",0
26,Lazy and unfunny remake that doesn't bring anything new to the table and is short on laughs throughout. The banter and chemistry between the main cast found in the original is long gone. The cast is amazing though!,0
27,"I enjoyed the new independence day more.... yeah this movie is that bad. Imagine if you tried kids humour.... but the humour that kids would not find funny because they dont understand it (lol queef jokes and shooting people in the dick) but adults wont find it funny because there not children. Honestly take your kids to see the secret life of pets instead.... god I wish I did.",0
28,"This is a criminal waste of potential on so many levels. The actors are given a script that makes everyone involved one dimensional stereotypes with minimal depth or development in any sense. The Movie comes across more of an long bad SNL skit than a proper film. The nonstop gags and jokes are for the most part are boring, crass, and feel like the writing team believed the audience was going to be entirely 12 year old children. There are countless pointless scenes and important plot points are rarely explained, if at all. The actors have no chemistry together and the screenplay has them be complete idiots most of the time. The only reason that they would be considered the protagonists in any sense of the word, is that the movie differentiates them from the other idiots in the film by having lead quartet actually be right from time to time. The trailers to this film already give all the big plot points away as well as the only funny jokes.  For all the complaints that negative criticism the trailer got are mysoginistic, this film's portrayal of the cast is far more guilty of mysoginism than any criticism of the trailers got. The lead four are so stereotyped that your hopes for characters that are complex and believable are sunk to rock bottom at the start of the film and never recover. There is also a persistant, anti male message through out the whole film as well, in terms of jokes, characters and even how they beat the antagonist. All in all, A horrible waste of time, money and more damaging to Womens' equality in film making than any other film in the last 20 years.",0
29,"a remake/reboot no one asked for, this movie is utter garbage and suffers from bad acting,directing and writing. However it would make a good torture device just make someone watch it on a loop and youll get any info you need out of them unless of course they kill them selves rather the suffer the garbage that is ghostbusters 2016",0
30,"I was insulted by this movie as a women. Is this how Hollywood views us? Not to mention I had to explain the queef joke to my child as being something else. This movie clearly had an agenda other than entertainment, and in one word was HORRIFIC!",0
31,"It's beginning to look like Christmas, at least for all the ""professional"" critics who may be getting a nice bonus in order to give this ""movie"" a good review. The quick review: This is not ""The Heat"", this is ""Scooby-Doo the Movie""(live action) with the worst jokes from ""Spy"". Unfortunately for the cast there's no Sandra Bullock this time to keep the movie afloat. The sad part:  It's unbelievable how Magazines and TV channels can publish/broadcast such blatant attempts to please their Hollywood overlords. I understand that some people may like the kind of ""humour"" portrayed in the movie, I personally find it repugnant, but to give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10 or an A/A- is just a disgrace for the reviewers and their employers. Some of the worst like Mark Kermode from the BBC who in his review you can see struggles to find something positive to say about the movie even implies that people who don't like the movie are ""misogynists"" right off the bat . How can someone like that clown be allowed to work on TV?",0
32,"this movie was abhorrent, sexist, racist, and stereotypical. All whilst claiming to be progressive. I went in with my wifes kids and we all hated it. 1/10",0
33,"One of the worst movies I've seen in my life, I didn't think I would ever say something like that about a film with Melissa McCarthy. Horrible. The plot is pathetic, the characters are shallow and exaggerated, the dialogue and jokes are incredibly bad. The only thing not bad about this movie are the actors, which doesn't matter very much since the characters they portray are horrible. Disgusting excuse of a movie.",0
34,"Not sure how this is getting positive reviews, other than paid people by Sony to do it. This movie was garbage. It is ironic because Sony was accusing all of the people criticizing the movie to be just misogynists. This was one of the most misandrist movies I've ever seen. Every male in the movie was an idiot, a bad guy or a complete jerk. The final boss was even killed by being shot in the ""privates"" which are assumed that he is a male. The cameos were disrespectful to the old cast and I would more compare it to the cartoon version, rather than the original 1984 film. There were a few funny moments, but that was lost due to overdone stereotypes, such as the ""angry black woman with attitude""....very overdone effects and the film doesn't even follow its own rules in regards to how the ghosts are dealt with. Trust me on this...don't see it, wait for redbox or netflix.",0
35,"I nearly walked out of the theatre. This movie has some of the worst writing in the history of cinema. Maybe in 30 years we can get a decent reboot of this reboot, one can only hope.",0
36,"Even ignoring the fact that the original is a cinematic masterpiece, and the reboot is female comedy cash grab akin to Bridesmaids, Heat and Spy, a tonal shift that just does not belong in a grand remaking of a beloved iconic series, Ghostbusters deserves to bomb for being sexist towards males (i kid you not. Apparently that's a thing now. Just look at how the people involved label any and all haters who lob warranted criticism at their film ""misogynists."" The film itself carries the exact same attitude in plot, characters and theme. You know it's bad when Sony debut's the second trailer on facebook instead of youtube to avoid due criticism (which didn't work), then wine's and dine's most of the critics to make it look like the film's actually great when they know it's not, THEN start to hire these random youtubers and other media personnel to fake positive experiences with the movie and again shovel their ""anyone who doesn't like the movie is sexist"" response. No fans or potential fans deserve this treatment. We deserve better. Don't see Ghostbusters. Just wait till it comes to redbox.",0
37,"Ugh. Ghostbusters (1984) was a light-hearted sci-fi picture featuring the right balance of comedy, action, creep and drama. The iteraction between the original cast and the ambiance of the film set by the music and pacing was masterful.Sadly, Ghostbusters (2016) has none of these things.  The cast has no cohesion, the special effects are out of control, and the film feels souless and ill conceived.  Most of the performances (from actors who have proved their worth in other films) are hollow and without connection. Save your friday night for another film.  This one is a rent or wait-for-HBO.",0
38,"I can't blame the four stars, This is what happens when you disregard a wonderful heritage and fill it full of brown notes. It's not a bad movie, but is about the worst thing you could imagine as a Ghostbusters reboot.",0
39,"I saw an early screening, ice age is a better movie than this (not a compliment)Awful acting , not chemistry between the cast (ironically hemsworth is the funniest one and steals the show).I have seen ps4 games with better fx than this tripe. (think scooby doo movies green screen mess fx)Editing seems rushed and not organic at all.The cameos are cringe-worthy, I really fell sorry for the old cast that was forced to participate on this.Don't waste your money to ""give it a try"", wait for it on netflix.",0
40,This was pretty bad.  I was really bored overall and really had nothing of the magic of the original.  Cameo appearances were nice but would have been better if they were the original characters.  My wife and daughter enjoyed it a lot.  It seems to be favorable among some women so I recommend it for a date night.  The writing is really really weak.,0
41,"They did not understand what made the original two movies good.Bad characters, braindead humor, silly effects, and a very badly written story.Instead of paying for this movie, rather play the video game from 2009, because unlike this movie, the game actually respected Ghostbusters and it's fans.",0
42,"This movie is just terrible, how anyone can say it's good. The acting is just bad, few jokes are not bad, but cgi just terrible, directing is terrible, this insults original cast. Ghostbusters should of been left alone. Should not of been rebooted.",0
43,"Simply horrible. I decided to to see it before reading an reviews so I wouldn't go in biased and I'm floored that this tripe is currently at 60. Then again...no I'm not. It's depressingly obvious that the ""top"" reviews are horribly biased, desperately trying to prop up the militant feminist propaganda, which is the sole reason this movie was created. The entire movie suffered from the same drawback every political agenda driven movie does. So bent on simply pounding a cynical and divisive message into the audience, the movie's characters, plot, setting, scenery, script, and everything else is all secondary. It's all just support for the ""message."" And it all falls apart. The plot is boring, the characters are forgettable, the script is laughable, and it all just comes across as amateur fanfiction written by hateful feminist with an axe to grind.",0
44,"Take a female producer that replaced the original director out of spite, a new director that was bullied into making the film and who demanded full control without the producers interfering, man hating writers that don't understand the source material and are genuinely bad at their jobs and a cast that's ad lib-ing through the whole movie while trying to do a decent job.Add completely overdone special effects and bad timing to the mix and you get mediocre movie that isn't even bad enough to be funny.Save your money for a movie that won't bore you to tears while preaching ""girl power!"" and ""men are all stupid and/or complete a*holes!"" to you.",0
45,"Absolute trash. Disgrace to the original movie. There was even a queef joke in this movie. I never knew Sony could **** up this badly. I never wanted to hate this movie, but the trailers made so disgusted, and now having seen the film, I wish it was never created in the first place.",0
46,"The movie is plain bad. A person would wonder why they even tried. The Ghostbusters were fine as they were, we did not need a new movie. The people who invested in this movie probably didn't understand the reason the first movies were good, it was the actors, you can't put some random three nobodies and expect it to work. The jokes were awful and stupid, even worse than something from Adam Sandler. The CGI, weirdly, was beyond awful, just disgusting. This is offensive to the fans and to moviegoers, it feels like they made the Godfather 4 2016.",0
47,"This is the most disgusting cash grab I've ever seen. It does nothing right, and ruins every thing that the original movie had. This is absolutely terrible, and you should save your money for something else.",0
48,"Even if there were no original Ghostbusters, this film would be a 3 on its own.  As it tries to be a remake, reboot and/or ties into the '84 version, its a 0.  This film is terrible.",0
49,"People giving it 0 is a little too harsh imo. But the movie was legit bad. The joke was bad, 3 of the 4 leads were bad. The CGI was pure cringe at the end. And the the theater I went in was kinda empty.",0
50,This is easily in my top 5 worst movies. Not funny. Not entertaining. With the budget given for this I expected a watchable movie. I really can't believe I wasted my money on this. If you have yet to see this movie don't. Go rent or buy the original.,0
51,"This is sooooo bad. None of the jokes are funny, the characters aren't interesting or memorable (I can only remember Patty's name because she wore a giant gold necklace through the whole movie). AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL",0
52,"If you love fat jokes and crappy special effects, then this movie is for you. For those that loved the original Ghostbuster movie, you guys should stick with the original and not with this one.",0
53,"Whereas the original's first 45 minutes are some of the funniest moments ever in cinema, the first hour of this slog was entirely NOT funny at all, unless you're a teenie bopper girl who actually believes Kristen Wiig is a decent actress and that Melissa McCarthy is funny. McKinnon and Jones are the best of the bunch, and they're typically in the background.  This film used the cameos and the homages to the original to make it watchable, but it cannot stand on its own. Hemsworth was downright annoying! Thank goodness I was taken to this film as a treat, and I didn't have to spend a single penny on it.  It's best to grab it as a rental, or skip it altogether.",0
54,"Serious contender for worst movie of the year. The comedy was cringeworthy at best. The story was forgettable, absolutely no memorable moments like the Original and it's sequel had.No quoteworthy lines. I've seen straight-to-DVD movies make a better effort at producing quality entertainment. This is exactly as I thought it would be: a cheap cash-in on a cult classic aimed solely at making a quick buck off of it and nothing else.",0
55,"I think that if you were never that much into the ghostbusters concept in the first place (i.e., you don't care for the original movies and the animated series - which I think are really cool too), then you might have some fun with this 2016 version in the movie theater and will forget that you ever saw the movie when you wake up the next morning. To give this movie some credit, there are some funny moments that make you laugh, but the jokes here are more like bullets coming out of a machine gun and something like 15% hit the target while the others make you think ""Why such a crappy line? Who forgot this one in the script?""The characters are bad ideas that became even worse realizations with the lame acts - they are pure cartoonish satires (whereas the original ones were quite sensible funny representation of real life archetypes.The special effects are terrible (looks like we are back to early 2000). Ghosts look like circus characters. And the story-line is just a lazy job.If I knew better, I would avoid watching it.",0
57,"I have been skeptical of this film pretty much from the moment it was announced.  And that the trailers/marketing, that god-awful cover of the theme song, and especially the way the cast and crew painted everybody who dared  to say they were skeptical as sexist trolls, didnt do much to dissuade that.  So needless to say, going in my expectations were about as low as as possible for a film. The good news is, its not AS terrible as I feared.  The bad news is, its still pretty terrible. The biggest problem with Ghostbusters, is that pretty much everything about the movie feels forced.  The jokes, the relationships between the four Ghostbusters, the winks and nods to the original, the characterization of the bad guy, the technobabble the big battle sequence at the end.  None of it felt genuine.  Pretty much everything in the film felt like ‘this is a movie, and this is whats supposed to happen in this movie.’ There’s far too much reliance on zany/wacky humor.  Theres very few quotable lines.  Certainly none that are as memorable as ‘tell him about the Twinkie.’  Or ‘Dogs and cats living together.’  I guess if like that style of humor(think Bridesmaids, but less crude), you might like the jokes in this film.  But its not my thing. The winks and nods to the original just dont work.  They’re not subtle enough to be overlooked(like in say, Total Recall), and pull you out from the movie, forcing you to think about the far superior original.  I’m not just talking about the cameos(which this film would be much better without), but also the way that certain scenes are almost shot-for-shot identical to scenes in the original. Its a bit of departure from a strict review, but I want to talk about the technobabble in this film.  Part of what made the original film so great was that Dan Aykroyd is a true-blue believer in the paranormal, and based the story and script on actual pseudo-scientific theories.  The result being that for a film about ghosts, it has a real feel of authenticity.  When terms that have their origin in pseudo-scientific circles are used in the film, feel like they are legitimate and being used in the proper way. In the remake though, it feels more like Paul Feig put a bunch of ‘science-y’ sounding words in a hat and drew them out randomly.  You know how in Star Trek, the plots are always solved by a series of giberish that sounds almost, though not quite like actual science?  Yea thats pretty much what Ghostbusters sounds like too.  It was annoying in Star Trek, but we put up with it for the otherwise interesting plots and characters, and this film is lacking in those departments. So there were good things about this film right?  Well yes.  Chris Hemsworth was pretty funny as the dopey secretary.  Pretty much all of the laughs of the film came from him, and he clearly had a LOT of fun playing the bad guy when his character got possessed.  In fact pretty much the entire cast really did seem to be enjoying shooting this film, although in  Kate McKinnon ’s her hi-jinks came across more annoying than endearing.  But still its just a shame  that this film wasnt better so you could enjoy it with them. TLDR:  Dont see this film.  I tried to warn you.",0
58,I really wanted to like this movie...but it is impossible. Poor story and TERRIBLE acting. We had some awful reboots in the past few year but this is by far the worst. Don't waste your money on this.,0
59,"Is the Ghostbusters movie as bad as everyone says it is? Unfortunately yes. Even on its own, this film is still not too good. The writing is lackluster, I did not like Melissa McCarthy's performance whatsoever (despite actually liking the other ones, specifically Kate McKinnon as Holtzman), Paul Feig's direction is confusing (as if he wanted to rush this film out), the CG looked pretty terrible, the ghost designs were pretty bad, and generic as well, and, worst of all, the humor really wasn't good. Oh and in typical Sony fashion, toss in a crapton of blatantproduct placement too. Overall, this movie was a major disappointment in an already major letdown of a summer movie lineup.",0
60,"This movie is absolutely atrocious. Outside of the soulless ""fancy"" CGI - the comedic crew is pathetic this time around. I never thought I'd see a worse installment to this franchise after watching #2. Boy, was I wrong.",0
61,"This is an awful movie. Trashy cash grab. Whatever happened in 1980s Ghostbusters, is wiped clean here. There are no interesting male characters, and the female cast falls flat. The jokes simply aren't funny.  This movie is an insult to the Ghostbusters license.  Take ScoobyDoo and add some ghosts with bad jokes and writing.  Now, don't get me wrong here the female cast have talent.  It's not about that if SJW's want to hate on me for my review - the writing, direction, plot, the jokes, continuity its just awful.  Personally I didn't find much funny here and the longer the movie went on the worse it got.  Act 3 is a complete trainwreck.  Only people that would like this movie, are idiots.  DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, WASTE OF MONEY.  It got 2/10 for me for being Ghostbusters and some interesting visual elements.  The rest of the movie, is just awful.",0
63,"This movie sucks. It is awful. The plot is awful, the jokes are stupid, the characters are cliches, the dialogue is just horrible. Every single aspect of this movie sucks. Except the CGI effects, those were pretty good.",0
64,"Ghostbusters was a disaster.  We're talkin' MiB II and Indiana Jones IV level quality.  An hour and a half of weak gimmicks and rehashed jokes and embarrassing cameos.  Standard firehose of sound effects and soundtrack.  Jokes are over explained then quickly cut for punch, while feeling gleaned from Reddit's front page.  Cartoonish texturing and color balancing.  Most cringe worthy thing I've seen all year, and that's coming off Warcraft and BvS.  Critics must be terrified of being black listed.",0
65,"As a huge fan of the original, I'm going to judge this as a Ghostbusters film (which is only fair as the studio is trading off the franchise), rather than a generic Hollywood Summer Blockbuster and well... I'm afraid that as a Ghostbusters movie, it stinks. It really stinks. I've read quite a lot of official reviews that say it's better than GB2, in what universe I ask you? GB2 had serious structural flaws compared to the first, there's no doubt, but its jokes and set pieces are still some of the most iconic of the franchise. Seeing as how no one who has made this claim has in any way tried to back it up, let me compare the two right here and now. First the baddies. Vigo vs Rowan. No contest, Vigo. Rowan is a terrible baddie, he'll be forgotten a few months after the Blu-Ray release, whereas Vigo is iconic and terrifying. So let's compare the good guys. GB2 relies on the magnificent chemistry between Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson to drive it along and whatever the structural flaws, the chemistry is as strong as ever. Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon and Jones do not share any chemistry, it's actually painful to see them on screen together. Even as individuals they fall far short of the original cast. If we take Wiig as an analogue to Murray, there's no contest; Murray gains a flawless victory. People are still quoting Venkman lines from GB2, ""bummer"", no one will be quoting Erin Gilbert in (nearly) 30 years time. The same is true for the rest of the cast head- to-head. To save time I'll just highlight the example of McKinnon, who I love on SNL, but couldn't bear in this movie. She's clearly the Egon character, but she phones it in, playing a generic 'kook' and going so over the top that it basically ruins half of the scenes that she's in. Again, McKinnon, like Wiig, has no funny or memorable lines such as 'lets see what happens when we take away the puppy' and her humour is weird for the sake of it, rather than the deadpan brilliance of the late Harold Ramis. The supporting characters are just regurgitated, worse versions of people from the originals, there isn't anyone who comes close to the creepy-comedy brilliance of Peter MacNichol's Janosz, one of the greatest, most iconic supporting characters in any comedy! So let's look at the structure and set pieces. If GB2 was structurally flawed, GB2016 ""should be condemned"", (see what I did there?) I don't want to spoiler the movie, so I'll keep to scenes and plot devices already revealed by the trailers. Firstly, the rock concert scene falls completely flat compared to the courthouse scene in GB2. The ghosts released by Rowan serve little purpose, look cheap and lack the comedy mischief of the ghosts in the original. Rowan's machine is a lazy cop-out and is in no way comparable to the absolutely terrifying and completely awesome river of slime flowing through the spooky abandoned subway. GB2 was all about creating some legitimate scares (Titanic docking!) and a feelgood factor which it did through some iconic set pieces. There is no feelgood factor to this new movie. It feels cheap in a nasty way and is surprisingly cynical for something that I've read is supposed to be aspirational in some way. I could go all day comparing the two but let's just say that GB2016 in no way measures up side by side to GB2. I suspect that the reason some reviewers are making that claim is to try and salvage something from this God-awful mess, so people will say 'hey, at least it's not the worst Ghostbusters movie.' It must be shilling because when you put all the elements of the two movies side-by-side, it's clear that despite its flaws, GB2 is simply better in every way than this lazy reboot. But here's the thing, my kid enjoyed it. He didn't like it as much as Ghostbusters, or even Ghostbusters 2, but he thought it was neat regardless. I think kids will like this film because it's flashy and the jokes are crude and obvious; adults who loved the subtle, dry wit of the original will probably be turned off by the listless, rehashed, gross-out humour and half-hearted performances. I have one more story to share that I think any parent might want to know before taking their child to see this film. When we came out of the cinema, my kid was in a funny mood that I've never seen him in before, half-hyped and half-pensive. I asked him if he was feeling alright and he said 'yeah', then there was this long pause and I could see him struggling with something. Eventually he turned to me and said, 'dad, when I grow up I want to be a lady'. I was pretty taken aback but I tried not to show it, instead I just said to him 'well you know you can be whatever you want to be sport; why do you want to be a lady, is it to be like the new Ghostbusters?'. And he just looked at me with eyes that seemed older than his years and said, 'no dad, it's because this film made me realise all guys are either stupid or evil, so it's better just to be a lady I guess...'",0
66,"I'm glad my overly eager friend paid for tickets to see this, because I would have walked out half an hour in and politely requested a refund otherwise. This just wasn't a good movie. I'm giving it a 1 versus a 0 only because it delivered exactly on what the trailer promised - heavy mediocrity.",0
67,"Absolute tripe. If you thought Pixels was bad, this is even worse. The CGI effects are terrible and the comedy falls flat. Having Paul Feig as the director has ruined what could have been an entertaining film, instead this is just not worth watching, even on DVD or freeview TV.",0
68,"The chemistry isn't there. The jokes aren't funny. The editing and pacing takes you out of the movie and makes everything feel rushed. You never feel settled in to the movie too well. I thought it was unfortunate that a comedy film starring 4 comedic talents needed a comic relief. Aren't they all the comic relief? It's a comedy! Getting a non-comedic actor to be the comic relief is a little telling. He was probably the funniest one, though. This is worse than the Pink Panther remake. Comedies should NOT be remade.",0
69,"Do you like movies that are sexist and racist? If so this movie is for you. Clearly everything about it is some individuals like Paul Feig (the director) pushing their agenda. Why didn't they have a cast of 2 men and 2 women instead? I went to the movie with my daughter, luckily I didn't have to pay as I had a promotional tickets. My 12 year old daughter didn't enjoy it, she said the vulgar unfunny jokes were too much. There is a queef joke in this movie.Every single male character in this movie is a dummy or and idiot, the black characters is the stereotypical obnoxious and loud black women. The cgi is worse than the 1984 ghostbusters movie, not sure how but it is. Don't waste your money on this, because it is one of the worst movies ever made. I'd say it's up there with united passions.",0
70,"Putting all of the Ghostbusters purist and nostalgic thoughts aside, from watching the trailer, this new movie looked like a **** new comedy that wouldn't get one laugh out of me. If there were never an original Ghostbusters 1 and 2, and this was a brand new idea that we were seeing for the first time, I would still hate the trailer because it didn't seem funny (even in a bad way) to me at all. So I saw the movie... peer-pressure can do things like that sometimes. I went to the theater with five friends eager to prove my opinion wrong, and by the 53rd minute mark after Melissa McCarthy made another atrocious joke, the camel's back broke. All of my friends looked at each other and myself, and we walked out. This was easily the worst movie that I have ever seen in a theater in my nearly thirty years on this planet, and I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 when I was a kid. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE - Like I suspected from the trailer, you can't even laugh AT it because it's so bad. Long time Ghostbusters fans will absolutely hate this movie. Another sad note, I believe a second one will be made. Yea, that's how Hollywood works... If one ****-ass movie can make enough money, you can sure-as-hell bet a sequel is coming. 0/10 - absolute filth.",0

72,"Sooooo I'm not really that big of a Ghostbusters fan. I really like the first one, but meh, not the biggest fan. I didn't really expect anything from the film. Didn't really take notice or really watch any trailers or read anything about the film. I just kinda saw that it was in theaters and decided to check it out. Nothing in this film made me laugh I wasn't expecting much, but damn the film was boring. Its not like godawful or anything, but holy heck I just wanted to leave the theater because I was so bored and frustrated at how damn annoyingly irritatingly bland the humor was, and I love dry humor. The characters are kind fun, I guess. Good chemistry. Also the cameos where kinda cool. But besides all that it wasn't anything special or really entertaining. Action scenes where also pretty awesome. But yeah. The film has no substance and just feels bland.",0
73,"Long time Ghostbusters fan. Haven't been into it that much since I was kid when I was bonkers for it. Even missed the 2009 video game.I went in to this movie with high hopes and it was...fine? As a disposable summer comedy it was...adequate? As the long awaited follow up to Ghostbusters 2 it was...a total let down.These very talented actresses did their best but they had no help from an awful script that was razor thin with a weak tea villain and a plot that held no surprises. Everything felt totally under cooked. And ultimately, it just wasn't that funny. I was willing to accept a totally different tone from the original movies if this was going to be side splitting funny but...I chuckled a few times?If you want a mindless comedy you'll forget about as soon as the drive home then by all means pay to see this movie. If you love the originals then save your money and wait for it to drop on Netflix.",0
74,Just so bad. Watching paint dry or organising your books according to the Dewey Decimal System would be considerably more entertaining than watching this travesty.,0
75,"I was wondering what all the hype was about, with feminists calling this movie an ode to feminism and saying that anyone who hated it are misogynists. I now understand why so few people identify as feminist and why so many are against the movement. This movie was an ode to hatred of men and it is obvious that it's supporters were projecting their own sexism and chauvinism onto those who were speaking against this movie. The man-hating would have been bad enough, but add to that the fact that it just wasn't funny. At all. Ok, there were a few chuckles early on, but for the most part the theater was silent. Every man in the movie was either evil or idiotic, and their motivations were not really explained at all. It was very poor, lazy writing that made it clear that the writers weren't aiming to make a good movie, they were just aiming to cash in on apparent feminist vitriol against men and boys. Speaking of, the writing was just horrible. There was none of the wit that we saw with the original, and many parts of the movie didn't even make any sense. Especially when it came to the special effects - it's like the actors and writers never communicated with the CGI team and didn't know what was going to be on the screen. For example after the possessing ghost  visibly leaves the Ghostbuster right in front of your face, why continue to hit her? For the slap-stick comedic effect? It might have been funny if it made sense to do that, but it came off as just stupid. And speaking of the CGI... there were parts that weren't too bad, mediocre even, but the end when the antagonist turns onto the ""Ghostbuster's"" logo, it looks like something out of a Disney cartoon, which looked really out of place and, well, lazy. And of course they have to put the icing on the misandry cake by shooting the antagonist in the crotch with their proton beams. The worst part was what hey did to Bill Murray. You can tell he didn't want to be there, and they treated his character horribly. It makes me wonder how they forced the actor to participate, which leads me to wonder if the other actors from the original were there under duress as well. This movie was so horribly disrespectful to the original movie as well as all of the fans of the original, and to the audience as a whole, I have a hard time believing that the actors of the original were happy with what was being done to the franchise. It's as infuriating as it is sad. As we were leaving the theater, the looks on the faces of those around me were looks of bewilderment. Why would Sony sign off on what amounted to a kick in the collective crotch of the audience? Do man-hating feminists really have so much power in our society that they can now browbeat movie executives into cow-towing to their political agenda? Now I understand why there is a growing number of people who identify as anti-feminist. This movie, and the way that Sony and feminists have bullied anyone who spoke out against the movie and its trailers, convinces me that ""anti-feminist"" is not only a preferable label, but one that is becoming increasingly necessary.",0

The special effects were horrendous and like a cartoon.  This has zero relation to the original Ghostbusters, and pretty much gave a giant middle finger to all the fans of the old franchise with missed opportunities to properly pass the touch off to a new generation.

87,"To get this out of the way at the beginning, yes this movie is bad. Real bad. However I then I have to ask the question: Does this movie deserve a 0. The answer to that, in my opinion, is no. The movie itself, while not a 100% complete beat for beat retread of the original movie story wise, still manages to offer no new story bits while managing to not even prevent obvious plot holes in its own retreaded narrative. While there are a few comedy bits that do land, most do not, and leave the audience just groaning at how bad they are. The CGI effects have been compared very unfavorably to the Eddie Murphy movie The Haunted Mansion, and I have to agree. The effects are not good and took me out of the movie. There was no suspension of disbelief, no feeling that what was appearing on the screen was anything other than fake. The question then becomes, if the movie is this bad, how do I score it? The only real positive I can give this movie is that I did not have to resort to alcohol to finish watching the movie. Because of that, and the problems I noted, the only possible score I can give this movie is a 2, which is the lowest possible score I can give to an alcohol free movie. This is no Dragonball Evolution or Double Dragon, but its dang close.It's a shame really. This movie could have been good. The terrible storyboarding and epically awful directing made sure it wasn't.",0

You'll laugh just as much as the Ostrich laugh from family guy but never anything worthy more than a chuckle. The overall high points are mediocre too with very little to keep me interested. The visual effects were really nice to see in some areas but even those got annoying at times. The cameos were nice at first glance but to find out they have no relation to being prior Ghostbusters is just another low point in the film. It's really something I'd rather watch being home than in the movie theater as if never really took off as a reboot. To be honest I'd rather watch Independence Day: Resurgence again as bad as that movie was. If you do watch this film be prepared for average movie experience with some titter and more neon ghosts than a rave party but a film that just feels empty and without anything genuine to the Ghostbuster franchise.",0
96,"Not trying to jump onto the hate bandwagon here, but this is seriously one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Cringe worthy and nearly unwatchable. A barbaric mishandling of a franchise. And it has nothing to do with the gender of the cast, but everything to do with the director/producer/screenwriters. The reviews that say 'Oh its not the bad' or 'Give it a chance, its pretty good' are completely out of touch. It's sad really. Hopefully the reboot the franchise again, go back to doing a sequel/canon continuation and GIVE IT TO A DIFFERENT FILMMAKER!!! The only other option is to just let it die. This film is soooooo bad, I'm kinda leaning towards the ladder. PROS:-the 3D is pretty good-the music score is okay.-Chris Hemsworth is hilarious, albeit completely inappropriate and out of context for this kind of film CONS:-literally everything else!! In closing...this film is horrid and quite possibly the worst film of 2016.

Irritated I was forced to sit through it with my girlfriend.  Don't waste your money.  Don't go to this movie.  Period.",0
99,"I feel dirty for several reasons after watching this. First, because by paying to watch it, I've contributed to this becoming a ""thing"" which will see sequel after sequel. Second, because I felt my intelligence insulted by the sheer stupidity of the story and 'jokes', for want of a better word. And third - and most importantly - I now feel like I'll be made out to be a sexist for hating it, which is ridiculous. Ghostbusters 2016 is an awful movie. It makes no attempt whatsoever to be coherent in its narrative, the jokes all misfire - I mean every single one of them, queef jokes included. The effects are straight out of Eddie Murphy's Haunted Mansion (for the uninitiated to that trainwreck of a movie, that means the effects are bad!) and it is a money-grubbing pander-fest from start to finish. Most galling of all, the movie is out and out offensive. It's amazing to me that a movie that stood it's ground and called itself progressive, wanting to put women forward as strong role models in leading roles in movies... ends up giving the women here cookie cutter, dumb as a post characters that don't evolve or do anything meaningful throughout the entire thing. This is meant to be 'empowering' for women? Really? Is this what you girls want to hang up and go, ""yeah, this is girl power!"" Really?!?! The men in the movie are portrayed as blithering idiots, and just exist to make sexist jokes out of. Not one character has any semblance of realism about them - not once did I think, ""this is what a character would believably do in this situation."" Not once. It has none of the horror aspects of the originals in this movie series - in fact, apart from calling itself Ghostbusters, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the licence. This is a sketch show, dragged over an hour and a half, with amateur writing, direction and effects, which just completely misses the mark. It's just bad joke after bad joke - not once did it even raise a smirk; all it got out of me was a constant look of pure astonishment that a team largely made up of the one that brought us the excellent Bridesmaids can come up with pure diarrhea such as this. Too many people pitched themselves to a political post with this one - too many people lambasted the bastardisation of a beloved franchise simply to make a feminist point, and conversely too many people lambasted men for being sexist pigs. The truth is both sides were wrong to do so; as this movie isn't worth the effort either way. This was a cynical cash grab, aiming to milk money out of feminists, who deserve much more effort and thought going into projects like this, so we can truly see progressive, strong movies and other media with well thought out and admirable female characters. But I'm a sexist for thinking this, right? Give me a break... The short story on this - if you want to see a good movie, avoid this one like the plague.",0
100,"I've been waiting for this for so long.. The Metacritic user reviews, of course (which have ironically become more objective and principled than the reviews of mainstream critics), the movie itself I could not have less of an interest in. I could go on a 10000 word essay about why this film is, in a word, an abomination, but I won't (partially because there is a 5000 character limit, partially because I am very lethargic and partially because I'm not a pretentious, preening, poseur liberal arts/gender studies graduate pretending to identify with and enjoy cult movies/nerd stuff just so I can then **** all over everything and ram my toxic, inane, nihilistic agenda down everyone's throat to feel superior, because mommy gave me just a little too much attention and praise for my own good growing up). What is this movie? It's Bridesmaids with a Ghostbusters veneer. It's the same, tired, generic ""female comedy"" that is churned out every time women are given a damn chance to try and make a funny, which is far, far too often. Don't give them your money, don't give them your time, this is an inferior charity product that participants will try to guilt trip and shame you into watching and pretending to enjoy in the name of social ""justice"". Women's comedy is effectively the WNBA, let's be **** honest, shall we?!",0
101,"Let me preface my comment by stating that I'm not precious about the original Ghostbusters. While I really enjoyed the original, I've probably only seen it twice in my nearly forty years on this planet. I'm not sure that I'd particularly care for a new Ghostbusters under any circumstances, because . . . it's just not a thing I'm that passionate about. I'd also like to mention that before the new Ghostbusters, I've never heard of the directory ""Paul Feig"" nor (as per IMDB lookup) have I ever seen one of his movies. I've also never heard of any of the main characters in the cast. I've obviously heard of Andy Garcia and the cameos, but I've never heard of the four Ghostbusters or the dude that plays their secretary. Anyway, I didn't expect much going in. After all, it's a remake/reboot/sequel/whatever of a franchise from thirty years ago. It's blatant money-grab banking on ""hurr durr, that was a thing when I was a kid"". Aaaand.... it met all those expectations. The special effects looked like they were from an earlier season of the ""new"" Doctor Who. The comedy was . . . flat. The characters were all obnoxious stereotypes. The outfits looked like they took them out of a clown  school. The ghosts they fought were . . . uninspired. Honestly, I just regretted everything about attending the film. I desperately longed for something else to do or the ability to run the film at 1.5x speed so I could get through it faster. Please... don't give this film your money. We need to stop encouraging this kind of crap as the ""go-to"" over something creative and original.",0
103,"It's not misogynistic to dislike a movie on its merits, or in this case, lack thereof. This film misses the mark on so many levels. The jokes were bad, which is a huge disappointment considering the strength of the cast and a director whose previous work I've enjoyed pretty thoroughly. I can count the number of exceptions to this statement on one hand. The effects would have been better placed in a direct to disc Scooby Doo movie. It has none of the charm of the original, and doesn't even play by the rules that the franchise set, and were reiterated in the beginning of the film. It feels as if this is just yet another attempt at a cash grab by Sony. Shame on Paul Feig for his whole ""If you don't like it you're a woman hater"" rants he went on when the trailers were released. No Paul, I didn't like it because you made a garbage film.",0
104,"Its like a bad snl parody of the ghostbusters, this should have been nothing more than a snl sketch. Its sexist and racist and has jokes that only 5 year olds can enjoy. It **** on the original movie and on its fans. The female cast was a good idea, but it was very poorly executed and the actors had nothing to work with. No reason for it to exist except to cash in on the name. This side of hollywood should never be funded!",0
105,"Fu*c*ng awful. There is a place in hell where this film is shown over and over again for sinners. Nearly every joke falls flat. Fart humor throughout, CGI overload and a complete rape of the original concept. I'd Rather rip out my own eyes whilst performing heart removal surgery on myself without anesthetic than sit through watching this pile of dung again.",0
106,So we find ourselves with yet another utterly bland and 'by the numbers' re-boot which completely wastes a talented cast and bored me almost to death. There were a few chuckles but not enough for the price of a ticket. People who enjoy good movies should avoid this.,0
107,"Forget the toxic political undetones sorrounding this movie and its critics, Ghostbuster commits the worst of movie crimes: it is monumentally boring. Flat jokes, predictable scenarios and terrible effects. Waste of time",0
108,"The Good: the effects are pretty cool - the CG is layered, cloth, translucent skin, bones, particle effects and little glowy bits. There's a couple of kinda funny jokes, particularly in the intro. The Bad: Most jokes, dialogue, locations, gear, outfits, weapons, traps, ghosts and well... the plot is 80% recycled from the first movie. There's an awful lot of stereotyping going on, from a cookie-cutter villain to a dumb-as-rocks secretary doing his best Zoolander impression, to feel-good 'girl bonding' moments that feel straight out of Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. The entire concert and several other shots are clearly pieced together from green screen takes. The cameos with Ackroyd, Weaver and Murray, are... well unnecessary. You just sort of go 'holy **** I had no idea they were *that* old!' The Ugly: I consider the original Ghostbusters to be one of the funniest movies made. It's painful watching highly skilled actresses with years of SNL, stand up and improv experience try desperately to do something, anything, with what is *really* bad writing. Bad writing means no foreshadowing, no figuring out the plot or backstory, no interesting, warm human connection moments, you stop caring about the characters, then the plot, then things really just start falling apart as you realize with no small amount of horror that you're watching Ghostbusters shake their butts to DMX's Up in Here. I'm giving this movie a three. And that's being generous.",0
109,That whole movie is just a guide to how convert 144 million $ into the pile of sh*t. And a queef joke of course. Call me misogynistic but i found this kind of jokes is disgusting. If you laugh at this you have a serious mental problems.,0
110,"Horrible movie. Shallow jokes and story line. Save your money and go see something else. This movie shouldn't have been made, but since it was, I'd have to say the execution was horrible.",0
111,Some things are better left untouched and this is one of them. Aside from the special effects which by modern day standards is nothing super spectacular it has neither the soul nor the charisma of it's predecessor. Even the younger generation found it so so. So sorry but it's a no for me.,0
112,"Stereotypes, Fart Jokes, Terrible Comedy plus for a film that aims to promote equality all the men in the film where shown to be stupid or cowardly. Much of the comedy will make you cringe throughout.",0
113,"I cannot ever recall a movie with more product placements... not ever.  Even some of the dialogue is essentially advertising.  But the real problem is the script is uneven, the directing is artless, the pacing is poor, the special effects are underwhelming, and the acting is by-the-numbers and stereotypical.  This movie is not utterly horrible, but for the life of me I cannot think of anything *good* to say about it.",0
114,"I went into this movie being very hopeful.  I was wrong to do that.  It was bad.  I honestly think I chuckled twice, total.  No solid laughs at all.  I would normally say wait for video, but honestly, wait till it's free on network television.  So bad...",0
116,"Waste of a very talented cast with awful writing and directing. Don't fall for the virtue signaling politically correct critics, avoid this one. This should have been an awesome movie.",0
117,The plot of this movie is that women kick ass and men are stupid..  Just pure crap. Stop with the reboots Hollywood and come up with some original concepts.,0
118,"Well then, I don't know why I believe any of the hype when I should have known better....... This movie had perhaps the worst comedic chemistry I have ever seen. Bad jokes, bad CGI, and an incoherent nonsensical plot. Don't even get me started on the estrogen based man-hating which seethed from this movie like the ever present CGI fog in the ghost scenes. 0/10",0
119,"This is a terrible excuse for a Ghostbusters movie. The writing is awful, the acting is awful and it attacks men at every chance it gets. Ghostbusters 2016 is set in a difference universe than the first two Ghostbusters movies, it has nothing to do with those two movies. So there's no reason to reboot the francise (Other than money, of course). They only make a slight reference to Ghostbusters in the very end of the movie. Seriously the last line of dialogue spoken. I'm not kidding you. The acting in this movie was so bad! In the orginal two movies I alwes felt like they were real people. Not just actors in cheap suits. In this movie, I just felt like they were (bad) actors in cheap suits. This movie doesn't deserve to be called Ghostbusters. Because they never catch any ghosts in the movie! And the one they actually catch they let out later in the movie to prove a point to Bill Murray (Who doesn't want to be in this awful movie). I'm not even gonna explain how it attacks men at every chance it gets. And no, I don't hate this movie just because it stars a female cast. I've seen plenty of movies with a female lead that I liked. The only connection this movie has to the original is Bill Murray, but he doesn't even want to be there. But he has to since Sony planned to sue him if he wasn't in the movie. This movie is nothing but a money grab. Don't pay movie to see it. Don't even see it for free!",0
120,"Having not seen the trailers that got massively downvoted, I went into the movie with a (mostly) open mind... Sadly, I walked out shaking my head. You'll undoubtedly read a lot of reviews about gender or other assorted things but here's the reality of why this movie stinks: Instead of tying it to the continuity of the original movies, Feig opted to create a reboot and, in doing so, spends TOO MUCH TIME giving the audience the nostalgic ""See, this really IS ghostbusters!"" winks and nods. As a result, there's too much time spent trying to convince the audience that it's Ghostbusters rather than trying to craft a cohesive movie. There are four quality comedians here (five if you include Hemsworth, who plays a comedic role really well) and yet there's practically zero chemistry between them. McCarthy is actually subdued from her normal boisterous self and is often left reciting little more than stereotypical dude-bro lines (or doing other stereotypical dude-bro things, like crotch thrusts). There is little to no character development, the characters themselves are extremely unbelieveable, Jones' character panders to racial stereotypes far more than Ernie Hudson EVER did in the originals. The plot is paper thin, the CGI is some of the most overused, easily identifiable nonsense since The Phantom Menace. So much of this could have been avoided if, instead of a reboot, the story was told around the former crew (with or without Murray, who cares if his ego bothers anymore) finding successors to take over for them. Imagine a movie where Ray and Winston find Gilbert and Yates, and hire them to take over the business. Then those two would find the others and the movie could progress from there. That would have given the requisite character building AND eliminated the need for constant winks and nods to the audience about the old movies. Imagine McCarthy picking up an old 1984 proton pack and saying something like: ""How did you not blow yourselves up?"" Instead, we got a crappy, play-it-safe, reboot that is lackluster in every respect of the word. Less than 24 hours since I saw it and I've already forgotten most of it. Save your money, wait for it to come out on TV. Not even on Blu-ray.",0
121,"This movie is a failure, a shameless cashgrab, riding on the fame of a beloved franchise. Unfunny, clichè, over the top, filled with juvenile and lazy jokes, stereotypes... the amount of effort put into this is minimal. I dont even feel like to sumarize all of the problems this thing has, for it has taken enough of my time already. Let it be know its totally OK to dislike this movie, for it is bad, and you shouldn't feel guiilty about it. The whole ""you dont like it becaouse you're sexist"" is the perfect alibi.",0
122,"The quality of the acting made it seem like few of them wanted to be involved in the movie.  The attempted humor was tired at best, and nobody else seemed to find it amusing either.",0
123,"How many SNL cast members does it take to ruin a movie?  Obviously 5.  If you count just current cast members, just 2.  Why does Hollywood continue to try to remake good movies or copy good movies?  Pixels was another Sandler disaster of a Ghostbusters ripoff.  Doesn't anyone on the west coast have an original idea?  I guess not.",0
124,"The film's only saving grace is good visuals. Other than that it fails from horrible acting, unfunny jokes, terrible casting, waste of Chris Hemsworth, crap plot, and boring personas of each ghostbusters members. I honestly think Last Airbender did a better job in following it's source material",0
125,"I promised to give this movie a chance and regret it. It is exactly what it seemed from the trailer. Badly portrayed stereotypes, forced acting, and terrible effects. If you insist on seeing it to give it a chance, do yourself a favor: get drunk first. The worst part is that the actors themselves are generally very funny. I like them. This movie, however, is a train wreck.",0
126,"Bad acting, bad CGI, bad plot, bad jokes, bad soundtrack, bad editing, and bad casting. I watched this film with an open mind, however by the end I was wishing I was a ghost... This is the worst film of 2016 by far and everyone involved should be thoroughly ashamed.",0
127,"A sexist film from a cast and production that called people sexist for disliking their **** cartoony trailer. The  critic reviews are clearly censored and bought by Sony. If you want to see this for free, just watch Saturday Night Live on television.",0
128,"Full disclosure, I'm male. I wanted to see this movie because I really liked Bridesmaids and have enjoyed Kristen Wiig on SNL and in a few other things. I'm not attached to the original Ghostbusters, and I wasn't upset that the franchise was re-booted with female leads. Overall I think I went in with an open mind. It's just not good at all. In fact, it's terrible. The jokes were lame and just weren't funny. The story felt incredibly rushed and poorly thought out. The important moments aren't tied together at all. It was sloppily executed. Save your time and money. There is nothing worth seeing.",0
129,"Ghostbusters was an odd experience to say the least. I was the only one in the theater, didn't laugh once, though did have minor grins or chuckles a few times mostly because of Kate McKinnon's character. To be honest, I feel bad for anyone who is a fan of the director or any of the actresses. Because this movie was an example of how good talent can't save a terrible script, especially not when they force it or at times are abrasive. Strangely, it's not all terrible, yet it's also not good. It really is just a really average movie. A few neat moments here or there that I wish would have accumulated to something awesome! I'd have to say, my best description of the film is, as if you went to a Stand Up routine and the comedian kept telling  jokes without a punchline, turning into one really long awkward set. Then s/he just walked off the stage without reaching any punchlines. But, he did this all while random **** happened around him to try and distract you or get a laugh out of you, in an attempt to distract off the fact that there is no punchlines... One thing I figured out really quickly though, is that it's obviously a communal or event film, best viewed or seen with people who may enjoy it... Laughter is often contagious, I'm sure if I didn't get ""private"" showing, being the only one in the theater, some of the stuff that didn't land at all might have made me at least laugh via the spread of someone else's enjoyment. But, unfortunately for me, the jokes just like in the trailer, didn't work at all, they all fell flat. But this wasn't restricted to the jokes for me, the rest of the movies writing & character portrayals also fell flat for me... The movie did show promise, in that the most genuine of moments were when the Ghostbusters were together doing their thing. But unfortunately, it took the whole movie for that to become charming. As the most engaging part of the movie was the credits. Seriously, the riffs during the credits of them now established as Ghostbusters were amazing. That's the movie I wanted to see... It is a bit more spastic in what's promising and what isn't through out the film, struggling to get it's footing there were a few moments where I almost got up and walked out of the movie actually, because I was that bored with it and the movie takes almost an entire 75 minutes to actually accumulate into something, to set up premises, characters, etc. But, as it does so it sometimes has some charming moments, which kept me at least engaged waiting for the other shoe to drop be it a positive or negative drop... Even though, it was a rough movie to watch and I didn't always enjoy my time watching it, it showed promise. I actually, crazy as it may sound, want a sequel. Now that the kinks are out. I feel like, if the movie was more competently written (including some valid satire as the director already was involved in an amazing satire film via Spy), the characters were given real character arc's, and they designed a story where the characters feel more invested in what's happening and get more genuine moments together. It could be the most amazing thing... But it's because of that lack of real satire and sincere feeling characters, that really creates most of the flaws the movie has. Spinning it's wheels most the movie. IF it weren't for those flaws, the movie would feel like much more than a Merchandise selling vessel. Because in the end, that's really what it boils down to. Everything can be connected back to that in some way, shape or form. Creating the forced, abrupt, abrasive attempt at comedy that this film actually is. Even though there is some fun to be had, in the smaller moments and the target market for the film is a bit wonky as well as the tone, feeling like it's target is families, even though the dialogue is not at all that family friendly... Ultimately, the problems with the film are things that could have been easily prevented, fixed, or that would have benefited from a clearer focus rather than forcing it and I feel as though a sequel would do great; if they capture what worked and are aware of those mistakes.",0
130,"This movie is a disappointment for what it stands for. The artistic qualities are mediocre at best and the jokes are second hand. I don't blame the actresses for their performance, I blame the director for going ahead with a trainwreck of a movie with an unoriginal script. And yes, the movie is racist and sexist despite having a full women cast. Who could've imagined that?!",0
131,"Um, where is the line for refunds? Personally i think that people should be paid a salary to watch this and not the other way round. Sony, please get your head out of your ass and stop making movies that are just path. I mean i went in with an open mind, but; none of the jokes were funny, the acting was terrible i mean i have seen better grade 4 productions from school kids. What was the story? was there one? Was there even a script? or was this just an attempt to appease people that say that there aren't enough women in leads?",0
132,"A slap in the face for all, who loved the original movie from 1984. NOTHING, I reapeat...NOTHING of the charme, the suspence and the lovable characters remained. It´s only a goofy, bad acted movie. Too bad, it could have been so good, but they blew it completely...",0
133,"Well, rather than reviewing a movie without seeing it, I saw this production and there is absolutely no way any of the positive professional critics have seen the movie without being incentivised in a way or an other. The good aspects of the movie reside in the sets, the make up, the photography, the costume designer, the props. The bad aspects of the movie are the characters, storytelling, narrative, outcome, character development, editing, music. The music is uninspired, repetitive, and inappropriate in most of the situations, it does not help supporting the story or the action. The characters are stupid: their reactions are unreal, inappropriate (dancing like a 6 year old, making fart jokes like a teenager, putting a wig), the actors cannot even pronounce some of their lines (why trying to impress anyone with words you cannot pronounce correctly ? or throwing a list of keywords without any link between them. Ridiculous and annoying). The motivation of the key characters is stupid, non existent and contra intuitive: a receptionist with such a low IQ would probably be handled by a specialist in a adult centre, requiring pretty much constant supervision. The ghostbusters have no intrinsic motivation, no coherence and are dumb beyond redemption, they don't even catch more than a ghost. Their antagonist is equally stupid, he is the antithesis of any intelligent villain. The cameos make no sense, they add nothing to the story. The characters are not developed throughout the whole story. And probably the worst part of all is the editing, scenes are cut and stitched together in almost a random fashion (as if it is a series of small sketches stitched together as best as possible in the editing room), at some point in an action a shot is made at a completely irrelevant action performed by a secondary character, the cameos of course are present for servicing the producer (the fans? I do not think so) as they add no value to the story. It feels like a stutter, not a naturally flowing narration: this is a big problem created by the director I believe. Also, there is no direction: some parts are clearly poorly improvised, and these actors do not excel at improvisation. Oh, I forgot something: the jokes are lame, pathetic. They fall flat like the jokes told by a teenager who does not remember the punchline, there is no passion, no wit, no energy. This production is a very sad attempt to exploit a 30 year old idea for easy money, this pathetic movie deserves nothing more than a 0 and I hope that sony will stop using any of the people (in the upper management) behind this production.",0
134,"Yeah, I think Sony paid the critics to even get a 60. This movie isn't funny, but tries very hard to be. Ugh... I don't even wanna talk about it. I guess most people hate it anyway and they should.",0
138,"For someone like me, who hasn't watched the first or second movies, I really enjoyed it. I obviously am not comparing this movie versus the original. However, as a comedy I thought it was quite funny. Go in expecting the humor to be kind of childish and strange, and you will love it. The visual effects were nice. I thought the ghosts looked quite nice, and enjoyed the blueish hue that was given to them. The characters for the most part are legit. Holtzmann is easily my favorite. She definitely is the geekiest, strangest one in the movie, and does a good job selling a funny persona. Overall, an 8 out of 10. There isn't anything worthy of a 0. No, I don't think those people are sexist, but I just question what they are watching. There are some horrible movies out there, and this one isn't one of those. I personally enjoyed my time a heck of a lot more than something better reviewed like 10 Cloverfield Lane. But, that is just my personal opinion, and shows that not all people think alike.",1
139,"I don't know why I went to see this movie; I already believed it would suck, yet I rushed out to watch it.  Ghostbusters is a surprisingly solid and high entertaining movie; it's not perfect, but it's well worth watching.Very funny movie, with solid acting , and awesome special effects!  I watched it in Imax 3D; the special effects takes full advantage of Imax 3D format to create a sort of hyper realism.",1
140,FUNNY glad i saw it. No expectations. Ignored all the noise and just said Im gunna go and aee it for myself. Did i say it was FUNNY. I dont care who makes me laugh.,1
141,"It was funny and had great special effects. I mean honestly, what more do you need? The entire cast is pretty great especially Chris Hemsworth as a pretty yet stupid secretary. I can't wait for the inevitable sequel.",1
142,"I had a very good time watching this. I thought it was genuinely funny and would see it again. I was laughing, the rest of the audience was laughing, and it was a pretty packed theater for a 2 o'clock showing on a weekday. It was a good movie.",1
143,"I thought the new Ghostbusters movie was great! I'm not going to give out any spoilers, just a quick review. Overall, it was funny and action packed. There were some amazing special effects! With the exception of a few very minor roles, the acting was great. The characters were well developed and unique, not just a rehash of the original cast. In comparing it to the original movies, the plot was actually a bit different. Sure, there were four characters seeking to ""bust"" ghosts, but the incentive, development, and methods were totally different. There was more emphasis on the development of the tools, more comedy (or maybe just more of my type of humor), and definitely more action. There was less of a focus on book research, and no real romance in the story. It was definitely scarier than the original. For you parents, it is rated PG-13. I will be taking my 7 and 8 year old children to see it, but I will have a talk with them first about how it is just a movie, and the peril is not real. I'm pretty sure the PG-13 rating is due to some smoking seen on screen (which I totally missed), the use of the middle finger as a crude gesture, some mild language, and violence. It was not at all bloody or gory, but there were implied off screen deaths. I laughed out loud several times, jumped a few times in surprise, and was cheering by the end. Those who are fans of the original will likely appreciate that the new movie had several jokes, nods, and references to the originals. I emerged from the theater with my childhood intact, a smile on my face, and a desire to build myself a new proton pack.",1
144,Ghostbusters is definitely one of the better films of the summer.Great performances from the lead actresses with hilarious one-liners and pays homage to the original with its cameos and easter eggs. The 3rd act is highly entertaining with outstanding VFX and brought something new to this reboot franchise. Although the movie suffers from same old plot as the original and some jokes didn't land well.,1
145,"The new Ghostbusters is much better than the trailers make it seem: funnier and with great effects, an amazing cast and director. It stands on its own, and if they'd let it, more people would enjoy it if they left the original out of the discussion. You can be a fan of both. I was looking forward to MVP Kate McKinnon the most, which is saying something given the cast. The ladies have excellent chemistry, and the filmmakers are able to nod to the original in different ways without depending on it. I loved how the women functioned as a band of outsiders. It made me wish there'd been films with more women like this when I was young.",1
146,"A decent, good-not-great sequel to the beloved 80s film, this makes plenty of references to the original (too many, actually). Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon steal the film, while Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy mostly play it straight. I like Chris Hemsworth but feel his character is too cartoonish and doesn't mix well with the rest of the cast. This plays more comedic and light-hearted than the original two did, and the tonal inconsistency will really prevent this from being remembered like the original is today. The visual effects are pretty impressive, especially in 3D, and the neon colors of the ghosts is quite lovely to behold. Hardly the trainwreck everyone was expecting, go see it for Jones and McKinnon, both of whom are hilarious. The ending of the film is the worst part of the film, pulling one of those ""reset"" conclusions that makes the climactic battle seem exceptionally dull and pointless.",1
147,"Best summer big budget film so far this year. And no I dont watch cartoons. I also ignore obvious attempts to slander other users while a string of zero grade reviews to do it. Its childish and reserved for people that should stick to watching cartoons. I thought acting here was good. The story was loose and didnt feel constrained with too much exposition. The graphics - call them scooby doo if you like kids films, but they worked just fine. NICE one liners. And maybe there was some humor directed at men but guess what. Im a guy and I found the jabs funny cauae im not an over sensitive boy on an internet rampage.",1
148,"I would give this an 8 but to many people are under rating this just because they feel entitled to this franchise.The reviews for this are like the river of hate filled slime from ghostbusters 2I personally love the original movies and the cartoon series and this is a fine installment to the franchise.I hope they can find enough encouragement to make a sequel.",1
149,"I'm a die-hard fan of the original 'Ghostbusters'. I've seen it countless times and it remains one of my all-time favourite comedies. Having said that, I find the sequel lifeless and forgettable. Superfluous, even. I am absolutely not indiscriminate. And yet I liked Paul Feig's 'Ghostbusters'. I really liked it. Yes, the trailers were lame. Whoever cut them made me want to not see the movie; they really did not do the movie justice. In fact, most (not all) of the gags that fell flat in the trailer worked in their proper context. Even some of the reheated ones. The cast was pretty good and they had an excellent dynamic. I was most pleasantly surprised by Melissa McCarthy, who isn't all shouty for once (think Ray without the naiveté), and Kate McKinnon, who plays a smart, creative, quirky and bad@$$ chick. Yes, there are plenty of small bits that I could have done without, including the gimmicky arsenal, the product placement, some of the cameos, an over-the-top, action-heavy finale (as well as Hemsworth's part in it), amongst other things. But I had a really good time. And, seriously, I would see more of Feig's 'Ghostbusters' if they made more. I would love to see where they take it from here, how the characters evolve, and how they develop the concept. Yes, I will see this one again. I'd give it a 7.75 out of 10 (not quite an 8, but certainly better than average)",1
150,OK Im a guy giving a movie review about Ghostbuster and I dont care about all the back & forth between the haters that never went to the movie vs women that said its was great no matter what. I HAD FUN. laughed a ton and yeah jokes against men? they were funny. it felt to me like they totally paid respect to the classic version - the sure as heck didnt turn their back on it. also think Kristen Wiig gets no respect. she's funny but can play it straight-up normal. i recommend.,1
151,"I enjoyed it all the way through, more fun than i thought it would be. And I would totally see it again. Thats my review.

152,"It was fun to watch, had interesting characters, and lots of jokes.  It really was funny, and good.  It had impossible expectations to meet from it's predecessor, but came close!  Much better than the 1975 series and Ghostbusters II.",1
153,"Ignore the (largely confected) hate-fest around this movie. It's wonderful, with a great cast, terrific FX, lovely cameos from five of the original cast, some gorgeous little references to the original novie and lots of laugh-out-loud moments. The original movie(s) have been in my top ten movies ever since I saw them as a teenager, and this remake is a worthy addition to the canon. It manages to be very respectful to its much-loved 'parent' as well as a terrific popcorn movie in it's own right. Here's hoping for a sequel!",1
154,"I totally don't get all the hatred!  I'm a long time fan of the originals and I watched all of ""The Real Ghostbusters"" cartoons growing up.  I am probably one of the biggest Ghostbusters geeks born to man.  You have to go in to the movie open minded and be ready for a new story. Obviously having some doubts and skepticism I went in wanting to be entertained and not looking for an exact sequel or reboot and I REALLY enjoyed it!  I saw it in IMAX and the effects were awesome!  The cast was totally loveable and super entertaining!  I am really hoping for a sequel, I had a blast and think the girls knocked it out of the park!",1
155,"5 stars! There is no fan bigger than I regarding the original 2 Ghostbuster movies. That said, the new movie is an absolute compliment to the originals.I had hopes for it to be good but went in skeptical. I was very entertained and fell deep into the movie. I loved the characters and the special effects were great.I will see it again and buy a copy when available.Don't listen to the bad reviews.Go in, enjoy the fact it's a fun movie in the middle of a lot of terror in our present day lives.",1
156,This was okay. Not great and not a patch on 1 but as good if not better than 2. Holtzmann was a good character and Wiig was very likeable. Could have done with a better villain.,1
157,"This is a great movie. Don't believe the haters. Cast is great, writing is great, it's even a little scary. And it's a fun movie for kids, too. I'd see it again.",1
158,"i love ghostbusters 2016, this movie its just so amazing, i knew from the beginnig this movie was going to be awesome, i mean come on you have an incredible cast the queen of comedy MELISSA MCCARTHY the hilarious KRISTEN WIIG the fireball LESLIE JONES and the dynamite KATE MCKINNON and lets not forget the genius director PAUL FEIG and BTW they and the movie have the endorsement of the original cast of 1984 they loved it and a think this movie has a great story, awesome characters, amazing effects, hilarious and non stopping laughs and i really had great time watching it .",1
159,"I LOVE paul feig movies. He did a great job with this remake. Funny as always. I know I might sound biased but hey, he hasnt let me down yet . Thought the CGI was great in 3D. Not a ton of people in my IMAX show but its expensive, so I get it. Anyways, probably the funniest movie of the year for me.",1
160,"The last X Men felt empty. Batman v Superman was WAY too serious and heavy. Warcraft was utter garbage. At least Ghostbusters was fun, which was probably why I enjoyed it more than I should have.  Captain America was strong but I only had fun for about fifteen minutes in the middle. GB was a solid comedy with action. Thats all I got. That, and my grade.",1
161,"I thought the SNL cast members pulled off a very entertaining movie. It was a good and funny film, and I loved seeing these 4 funny SNL women play leading roles in what is usually male dominated casts in action roles movies. I especially liked Kristen and Melissa, but Jones, and McKinnon were great as well. I thought it was a great mix of pulling from the original, as well as adding new material and great special effects and some pretty scary ghosts in the subway. Don't pay attention to many of the negative reviews, they are probably people who think that any action movie must have males as leading roles. The small cameo roles by Murray and Aykroyd and Weaver were a nice touch. Go see this movie if you liked the first two Ghostbusters, you will not be disappointed!",1
162,"i felt a lot of love went into this film. i appreciated the nods to the original (i saw the first one when i was 12) while infusing the story with some fresh ideas. camaraderie between the main four characters was wonderful. i think ghostbusters belong in the 21st century as a remake, and Feig did the film justice.",1
163,This movie is hilarious.  I found the character arch of Slimer to be moving.  All the haters just need to lighten up and enjoy the ride.  And yes it is better than the original.,1
164,"Really enjoyed it, it was a good time at the movies; the main cast do what they do best but was specially entertained by McKinnon and Hemsworth, I can see the former becoming a movie star in her own right.. This film is one of the best 3D movies this year, in this case the 3D is not just a gimmick to get your extra few dollars, also probably the best rolling credits I've seen in a while, it kept the audience 'till they ended.",1
165,"The ghosts were actually scary, the comedy was hilarious, and the busting action was great. Don't listen to the haters. I loved this one WAY more original. A brilliant successor more worthy of the moniker more almost everything else it shares it with.",1
166,"Everyone knew a movie with this creative team was going to be funny. The visual effects (specifically the 3D and what the film does with aspect ratio) was what shocked me. This is clearly in the Scott Pilgrim school of effects, not attempting to create an uncanny valley of hyper realism, but instead making something fun, cartoonish, and that fits story being told. And Kate McKinnon is a comic genius.",1
167,"Paul Fieg & his cast of women, didn't destroy my childhood. Great homage to the classic original. The pacing is perfect, like the original. Building to an fun visual ghostly climax. See it in 3D if you can.For all the ""Ghostbro"" ignorant haters, Ivan Reitman who Directed & Produced the original, is the Producer here too...A new generation of Ghostbusters is here. Bring on the sequel. You know there will be.",1
168,"Haters be damned and those on the fence be assured: the new GHOSTBUSTERS is a worthy remake.    It is 2016 and there is a brand new reboot of the series with new characters, newish plot, new writers and a new director.  And you know what: it works: both as a remake and as its own film.  GHOSTBUSTERS strikes a balance between what worked before and new elements. It neither copies 1984 outright, nor takes the title and runs in a different direction. Like recent (and excellent) sequels STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS and CREED, GHOSTBUSTERS uses the bones of the first installment to make a new body. The core of the originals is not the ghosts, but the characters by way of dynamic personalities, witty banter, and how the react to the actual events that occur. Those actual events are the burned marshmallow on the cake. This we have in droves. GHOSTBUSTERS is a comedy: and it’s damned funny.  It’s continually hilarious both in dialogue in physical comedy – although the dialogue and interaction based humor works better than the physical which sometimes too much slides into over-long slapstick.  The characters are not direct copies of their predecessors, even if one can see the basis of each; some traits slide around or are merged.  Each of the four Ghostbusters: Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon have their times to shine and just about equal play.  McKinnon is a scene stealer, her line readings are wonderful and her reactions are even better.   But she has a challenger in Chris Hemsworth as Kevin, the dimwitted mixture of Janine, Tully and a little Dana.  Hemsworth is worth is muscle weight in comedy gold.  With Taika Waititi (WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS and HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE – two of my favorite comedies of the last two years) holding the hammer for THOR: RAGNAROK, can it just be an outright comedy and allow Hemsworth to keep this up? He’s great at it.Since we’re talking about actors and performances: yes there are cameos from familiar GHOSTBUSTER faces (more than you’d think too), and they all work, fitting into the film, and are very welcome. Here’s the biggest surprise: there are many things that this version does BETTER than the original.  Wow! Yes! It’s true – this man has no dick! Sorry, back to this movie.  This a movie with ghosts, based on horror elements.  And there are times it’s actually a bit scary; sequences designed to be horror. Not too scary – just enough that woman to my right was freaking out a little, but the tone is there – particularly in the incredibly well constructed opening scene.  By the time those familiar tones start to play, the audience is ready to bounce their heads with a smile as the theme starts, and in my audience they did.  The ghosts in this version have bite. They can hurt people, and weirdly enough, able to be affected by physical objects too.  This creates higher stakes in each sequence and allows creative interactions of the living and the dead.  These dangerous dead look great, too.  Physical actors play the majority of the spirits and given CGI enhancements of glowing blue, skeletal features and some rot. They and the non-human ghosts are remincent of the create designs in the REAL GHOSTBUSTERS cartoon (along with McKinnon’s Holtzmann echoing that show’s Egon).  However, there aren’t enough of them.  Missing is a montage of creative spirits – both in catching them in the 2nd act and when they expected activity bump in the finale.  It’s understandable with the way the plot works, though.  The plotting 1984 is reactionary: the Ghostbusters have an event then figure out what’s happening. It’s a rather passive plot.  2016 features a more directed, but wider ranging plot with a human villain behind the mayhem, who is followed so there more of a forward motion to the plot. Sorry guys badmouthing women being Ghostbusters – the villain has MRA qualities. He hates everyone but has many barbs at women. He actor of the villain a little weak and doesn’t command much presence but it’s a welcome alteration. After all the waiting for many and hating for others: GHOSTBUSTERS is a strong new entry into a beloved franchise.  The characters are fantastic. The ghosts are well designed and sometimes scary. There is a well-made plot. The cameos and in jokes are welcome and not awkward. Most importantly, GHOSTBUSTERS is a constantly highly enjoyable and continually hilarious film and I give it a very strong recommendation.",1
169,"I loved this movie. The women in it are great together and all bring their own style of comedy that blends well with their cast members. I laughed throughout this film! Who doesn't love a movie that has amazingly smart women who turn-up as the sheros! Beyond the great comedic acting, the film makers sprinkled a lot from the previous movie in which was fantastic. There are cameos, there is the famed marshmallow man, basically same events happening. In a brilliant way, they still made the movie have it's own story-line while at the same time bringing back all the old stuff we love about the 1984 classic. Very well done. I would pay theater money to see it again! Hopefully this cast continues making films together.",1
173,"Hyper silly punch lines, and hyper silly characters. The movie tries too hard to be funny; it oversells every joke, and delivers as many jokes in a row as possible to get any to land. Like all of Kevin's scenes are a string of ten jokes, and one will be funny, but it is immediately overplayed by nine other groaner jokes. It is so hyper jokey, that nothing is allowed to marinate. I smiled a few times, but every time it turned into a mess of cut up jokes that would make me frown.  Cringe humor and hyper-talking humor works in some movies and much of tv comedy, but it did not work in this movie.  The moment you start to think this movie could get good, with a few cool looking ghosts, or when the intensity picks up, immediately they kill it with silliness; like they thought it would be funny to have Slimer and his girlfriend ghost, but the joke doesn't end and they totally force them into the plot.  The characters of ghostbusters step out of situations just to make ajoke, and make you lose the immersion of the situation. Kate McKinnon's character Holzmann eating pringles part is not just annoying for the forced product placement, but for the complete lack of the character's immersion. She continues eating pringles as a ghost is projectile-attacking Kristen Wiig's character as if she were watching a baseball game. Yeah I know she is aloof, but no reaction to the actual jump scare. This happens the whole movie.  The audience needs to be pulled in by the actors, but the characters would never stop talking for two seconds to allow the situation or their expressions to make us laugh. (Except I like Patti's reaction with the ghost on her back.) The gadgets like pk meters and portal devices all look like plastic Halloween toys, and i actually thought the movie would reveal that they were just toys, but no, they were supposed to be real science. Bill Murry's cameo is even super lame in this. I would have been so disappointed in this movie if I was not already expecting it to be bad. I hope they try again, maybe another reboot.",0
174,"A very bad remake that has an awful script, screenplay and direction. The jokes are not funny and every single actor in the movie seem like they don't care.. and neither should you.",0
175,"Ghostbusters 2016 is an odd movie, it promise a lot of ghost action, but instead of that there is only one ghost caught before go to the last boss. One of the best thing about the original movie is how it worked as a blend of a true horror movie and a comedy, while 2016 feels very awkward and rough. A ghostbuster reboot fails not because the main characters are women, but a weak script and a poor direction",0
176,"this movie was a horror to watch! It was so bad! it was unfunny, unoriginal. avoid at all costs",0
177,Incredibly bad. Completely destroys the soul of the originals. Total mess of a movie.,0
178,"The small things that made the original Ghostbusters so amazing was taken out and turned into nothing but a cash grab. Not only did they change everyone's personality but they also took away from the main plot. They made everything just a joke and yes, Ghostbusters was originall funny but at the same time it had a real plot that scared people. Of course we were younger then but the plot wasn't filled with just lame jokes and people acting stupid. It's annoying to see that their best jokes are people simply just getting hit in the face or stumbling. They don't make the same jokes and it just wasn't the same. I know that it isn't easy to recreate the feeling that people had when watching the first ghostbusters but keeping that in mind, they didn't even get close and they should have left the original movie as it was and just left it alone.",0
179,"Crap all over the place. A poor attemps of making a political? statement, do it, just not in a movie ruining a franchise.",0
180,"The cheesy half-witted feminist humour plagues this poorly written *remake*, although the enthusiasm of the new cast nearly redeems the script. Very disappointing when compared to the original...",0
182,"I just forced myself through this trainwreck just to see Murray and Aykroyd's cameos. What an useless waste of good money, of talent, of hundreds of people's time.It's not racist, it's not sexist, it's not a story you want to have in your memory. It's an insult to a generation.﻿",0
184,'Atrocious' 'apalling' Great example of what what bad remakes movies are made of.I don't know why they wanted to do this it's really an insult to the masterpieces 1 and 2...it's unfunny. uncanny. bad jokes. It's an aobomination,0
185,"an unfunny, stale, lazy movie that attempted to use politics as an excuse for it's many flaws, Hemsworth belongs in a much better film, preferably one that doesn't feature the insufferable and unfunny Melissa McCarthy, who seems to think she is the greatest comedian of all time, similar to the movie, the main female cast, and the mainstream media. A travesty especially compared to the classic original.",0
186,Sony literally gave this movie to me for free when i downloaded the new spiderman on itunes.  It really is as bad as people have said.  It just wasn't funny.,0
187,"One of the worst (big budget) movie I've seen in my entire film. Cringe, unfunny movie, trying to cash on SJW propaganda. Get woke, go broke.",0
188,"I didn't bother to see this film! That's all I have to say about the film. I love the original film from 1984 and the sequel from 1989, which is to me very underrated. I got laughs from those two and I will never see this hunk of garbage! I didn't see it not because it has women. I didn't see it, because the trailer looked awful and I didn't like what was in the trailer.",0
189,"The 2016 movie feels like a parody of the original, a two hour Saturday Night Live sketch. Back in 2007 there was a ninety minute fan film called Return of the Ghostbusters which also followed a band of new recruits. If my memory is correct it was set in Denver and had similar directing and story beats to Paul Feig’s movie. But that was a fan film and could be considered great to a point. I shouldn’t have to compare a multi-million dollar movie to something fans did for a quarter of a million almost ten years ago. This is a movie without logic. It does want it wants just because, without any thought as to what really worked in the original. This is a movie where members of an audience seem happier to use a selfie stick to snap ghosts than run away from them. This a movie where the villain uses the time travel of a portal to alter New York so it looks older. Why? I have no idea. The idea to disconnect from fans may of seemed like the obvious choice in that it brings in new fans however when you have a property that’s almost adored as much as Star Wars it may not be wise to go after just that other audience. What fans wanted and what would have made sense was a third movie that passed the baton onto a new set of recruits. This isn’t the GB movie we got and to misquote a certain Batman it’s not the movie the fans deserved either. What you’re left with is a movie that offends fans and is only likely to appeal to either Paul Feig fans or small children who never grew up with the originals. Before this film was released like many I wanted this movie to fail for the reasons mentioned in this review. However, having seen the new movie the anger I felt has turned to pity for everyone involved as well as the kids who grow up with this movie. Clearly everyone was trying, too hard it must be said but like the 90s animated series by design it was destined to fail and that’s worse than hating a film outright because it’s bad. I can’t totally hate the finished product because it desperately wants to be liked. The film would have been ok if it had been a spin-off movie but to bring back a semi-dormant franchise with this movie is a massive waste of time and money for self-indulgent political views that have nothing to do with the film’s story. Good intentions without suitable reasoning because at the end of the day why did it have to be Ghostbusters?! At least I can wrap up by saying the 90s animated series is no longer the worst thing to come out of the franchise. Faint praise I know. I never got to see an actual Ghostbusters movie in the cinema and it seems my childhood dream of doing so will have to wait. A stumble but hopefully one day the franchise will walk again, that’s what being a Ghostbusters fan is all about.",0
190,Why?This kind of hot mess is the reason Bill Murray refused to do another sequel.For the love of god just go watch a decent comedy like Kung Fu Hustle,0
191,"Why they made this movie is beyond me. It was bad, worse than just bad, it was really bad. It was ok like for the first 5 to 10 minutes, after that it's just all downhill if there ever was a hill to begin with. There is just nothing there, no chemistry between the actors, it's not even funny like ever, it's just a whole lot of fail and some special effects. Not a good thing for a comedy.",0
192,"This had a huge potential to be a canon sequel and restart an awesome franchise. Having four women follow the path of the original ghostbusters was a great idea, Bill and Dan could have passed the torch on, but this movie like many recent others hides behind a so called empowering of female characters to get sales, and then it sets them up to fail. Sadly the director turned the movie into a bland senseless thing that goes nowhere for two hours. Kate McKinnon does a great job, and so does everyone else in the cast, with the exception of Melissa McCarthy who I find poor at acting and comedy. But the plot and its execution ruin everything for everyone. Paul Feig managed to get a commercial success out of some cheap movies in the past, and that's why he got to do this project, not because he's good at directing, or because he cares about female characters, or the ghostbusters fanchise. This whole thing has been depressing, I hope a new reboot can be created in the future that isn't as poor as this.",0
193,"Yet another hollywood money grabbing reboot. If this was somehow unconnected to the ghostbusters brand I could mark this up as a 5/10 effects movie, with a couple of popcorn munching chuckle-worthy moments to be had for sure. But Ghostbusters 2016 aint that. Unfortunately this film lacks the will to commit to the scientific and paranormal sensibilities that made the original films. Paul Feig sacrifices all the limited screenplays dramatic opportunities to instead produce what is ultimately a shamelessly simple comedy effects movie for a quick cash grab.",0
194,Jaw-droppingly bad performances litter this awful film. Melissa McCarthy in particular seemed to feel that comedy means yelling every line. I urge you to avoid watching this garbage.,0
195,"What have they done to my favorite classic childhood film? They could've called this trash (I'm really sorry, I have to) Ghostbuster: Ladies in Action or something other than just Ghostbuster. Calling this Ghostbuster is totally disrespectful towards so many fans and definitely to the original. The writings, the casting, and the direction are junk. This movie was made purely to spit on men and to deny their roles. Women are beautiful creatures, they're smart, and unique. They definitely don't deserve to be put in this terrible propaganda film. I'd rather they cast some monkeys and cats.",0
196,"Even if we wipe out the original version from our minds, and review the film from its very own, it never feels like a film and more like an extended SNL sketch with paranormal themes. The meta-references within the film and the cameos of the original cast give the sensation that the director is parodying its own intent of making this film.",0
197,Dumb movie...so dumb... It's pathetic and dull...hell I can't even write a good review about it because it's soo dumb,0
198,"Wow, is this crappy or what? Downright the worst movie I have seen in a while. To add insult to the injury, managed to stumble upon an extended Blu-ray version which is 18 minutes longer than theatrical – whopping 134 minutes in all!Yes, this is the all-girls-remake of the 1980's darling ""horror comedy"" franchise, this time starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and, er, the other ones. Most of the original cast return with ""surprise"" cameos too, excluding, of course, the late Harold Ramis.This is just a sad **** of a movie where everybody tries and tries for two hours and more, but nothing worthwhile emerges.The only good thing I can think about the movie is that at least they have tried. For a long time, they try to make us laugh with their witty bantering dialogue and good chemistry but none of it materialises and the result is dead on arrival.Alongside ""Anchorman 2"" and ""Zoolander 2"", this must be one of the biggest failures of recent times, where they tried to bring back some cult classic and just fell on their asses.""Ghostbusters"" is so bereft of laughs or joy that it feels **** even by movies starring Melissa McCarthy's standards, who's still desperately trying to define and recreate this little magic she managed to create in her breakthrough role in 2011's ""Bridesmaids"".The same goes to Paul Feig, of course, who has mostly directed McCarthy's movies, the first and only creatively successful one being ""Bridesmaids"", of course. He should go back to TV world or something.Rotten Tomatoes' and Metacritic's reviews are far too kind this time, the most telling would be the latter's user score of 2.9 out of 10.The only bits I at least semi-enjoyed in the movie were original ghostbusters' surprise cameo appearances, and maybe Chris Hemworth as the good-looking but stupid assistant to the girls. He's the closest thing this ""entertainment"" had to offer to make me smile.The visual effects look cheap too, although this may be some kind of homage to original movies.",0
199,"It is terrible! I hated it and constantly wanted to turn it off, well done to Chris hemsworth for making the film bearable but overall it was a trainwreck. I give it a two... 1 for Hemsworth and 1 for the original nods",0
200,"While watching I wrote the following...UnnecessaryLazy PointlessDesperateTired Cheap PoorCharmlessPainful LabouredBoringpDisappointing TurdThe studio don't care about the original or the kids that grew up watching it and loved it. They see this as a moneymaker. A cash cow and they are milking at full speed. And it's not ok. It's not. When they come for your childhood in the night, when they remake Back To The Future, Goonies or Dirty Dancing, it will be YOUR fault because by going to the cinema, by buying the DVD, by buying into the whole 'support it because it's women' rubbish, you have shown them they'll always make money with a remake. Awful",0
201,"I never loved the original, but always respected it because lots of people loved it. This remake is like an offense to those movies, and trying to use the ""female lead"" as a way to update it to our times failed so hard. It could have worked with a female lead, but Sony just didn't really cared about fans, and the movie itself.",0
202,"I give it a 6.5/10. Some jokes fell flat, and some scenes don’t add anything important. But tbh, I enjoyed watching female Ghostbusters. Why is that a bad thing? The action was fun and the new stuff was pretty good. Some performances were great.It’s not perfect and it’s not as good as the original. But I respect having this film here. Don’t dislike my review because I have something called an opinion",1
203,"Not good. Ghostbusters 2 wasn't the best, but at least it had the original cast, somewhat taking it seriously. (Ahem Bill Murray, I know people love you and I do to, as well as all of your movies, but this was abysmal)",0
204,"This movie is unbelievably sexist....to men! The constant ball kicking jokes is beyond unfunny. Not to mention that every male in the movie is a retard, one not even able to use a phone correctly. Unlike the original movies, these 4 girls are amateurs and yet can accurately hit a pinpoint on a moving target whilst arcing the streams. In the originals, the ghostbusters would be shooting them everywhere and struggle to control their weapons. It was more believable that these were amateurs than this movie.The special effects are good which is why is gets a 2, it's just the characters, story and world that is completely screwed up.",0
205,"First of all, I want to clear that I'm in favour of intelligent strong female lead characters, I love Alien and Aliens (Sigourney Weaver), the new Tomb Raider (Alicia Vikander), MCU and Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), Edge of Tomorrow (Emily Blunt), Thor: Ragnarok (Cate Blanchett), just to name the firsts movies that comes to my mind, but this stupid SJW's new trend of trying to remake old classics, cult movies or just old movies with an all-female cast is unbearable, but the main point is not even about the all-female cast, the point is that they're traying to do it making real awful stupid movies, It's just that simple, if they do it with excellent stories and performances I support it, but this it's not the case at all (The same as Ocean's 8 and the new Star Wars movies, except Rogue One which I loved and validates my point), please, enough is enough.",0
206,"A contender for the worst film I've ever seen.To be clear, I couldn't give two **** about the original and I'm anti-misogynistic. That is actually one of the reasons I hated it so much, the waste of talent on offer.  The funniest women, nay, people on the planet in one of the most aggressively unfunny disasters.  It truly feels like the writers room went out of their way to make it tiring and bland.  I'm glad it empowered young women otherwise this turd had no business existing",0
207,"Overall, the movie is relentously bad. I am a fan of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 because of the quirky comedies and real skits that we know and loved today, but the new 2019 one is literally dying out of all the known characters you known and love, whoever came up with this idea, is an a-hole.",0

If I don't live a good life I expect my personal hell to be strapped to a chair, eyes wired open and forced to watch this dumpster-fire for all eternity.With such an amazing premise and talented cast, this should have been a dead cert success. What the writers and directors were thinking is beyond me. High-school drama students would have churned out a better, funnier script that this cr*p.Redeeming characteristics: It ends (eventually)This is not a movie for watching, it's a movie that could be used as a cautionary tale for would be screen-writers and directors.",0
210,This is how you ruin an already completed franchise after its closing movie. A clear example is this film.,0
211,"Painful to watch. There was so many high hopes mustered from me when they were talking about making the film. I felt like it was loaded with political agenda, bad writing and bad humour. Not worth the time, money and effort. My other half, who is one of the biggest fans of Melissa McCarthy came to watch the film with me. Half way through the film she turned to me and said can we get our money back. After all the hype the film fell flat on its posterior.",0
212,"This film is absolute trash. I liked the idea of an all female ghostbusters crew and the cast had great potential. But to make a reboot is just plain stupid. It could have been some kind of sequel that acknowledged and followed the original films. But instead we got this pathetic joke of a film. What a waste of a great opportunity. Aside from the reboot nonsense, the plot is boring, special effects feel like its a childish made-for-tv-movie, the character's lines and development are contrived, flat, and foolish, the ghost busting equipment looks like stuff built out of garbage, and the HQ is a cheep filthy garage. This is not a ghostbusters film in any way other than by name.",0
213,"Im a fan of the ghostbusters series (well the 2 first movies at any rate) but this movie just made me sad, if I had been beaten up and told by half the population that I simply aint good enough I would probably be in a state fit to write a story such as this. You simply cant take the worst misonygist traits of old movies and turn it around, it lacks class and it makes for a horrible movie. It also lacks in writing, the first two movies basically had the same script and for the third they went and did the same - it does not work.

217,"Horrible movie. Makes the main character seem perfect and everyone else are bumbling idiots. The jokes are lame and the plot makes the ghosts the bad guys, unlike the original. Another pathetic money grab from Hollywood.",0
218,Ghostbusters 2016 has to be the worst remake to date.  There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is not possible to list them all in this review.  I believe the director had little understanding of what made the original movie great this movie feels like a parody or SNL skit I don't think much effort into the visuals or props the car looks horrible the proton packs look like plastic toys and there outfits terrible not sure why they chose to make the ghost neon people have complained about movies such as scooby doo and the haunted mansion this movie had no horror to it at all.  The charecter seem so fake and stereotypical.  The new audio tracks created for the movie are horrible as well this movie is terrible eveyone involved in the creation should feel ashamed at what they have done.,0
220,"Oh my... what did I watch! I somewhat felt bad while watching this movie. It was unoriginal, not funny, forced, and made no sense. The CGI was also bad at most parts.The movie was cringy at many times. The actresses and actors are clearly talented and having a women only Ghostbusters movie could have worked! But no. The story was stupid, the characters were stereotypes, male characters were unbelievably dumb. It had jokes all the time and they didn't really work! Some CGI work was pretty good, but mostly they're neon ghosts and the green screen was so obvious at some parts.Most cameos were totally unnecessary. The villain wasn't menacing at all and his motivations were just lame. And how he got that power? Well... no explanations. The movie has lots of logical flaws.There were good parts of it but not enough. In overall it's a bad movie. It's not one of those bad movies that are so bad it's good an it makes you laugh on how horrible it is. It's just an insult to the beloved franchise! Sadly it failed to deliver. It clearly had potential but it didn't live up to it.",0
221,"This is a pretty bad movie folks. I'm one of those people that will watch and find something in most movies that I watch that I like. But this is worse than the Fantastic Four reboot. I understand what they were trying to accomplish with the movie but it was forced and that takes away so much from the quality of the film. The best jokes( not very many) came from the supporting cast. It pushes a racist agenda. It's OK to call a bad movie a bad movie. If you keep up-voting bad movies to push an agenda you will keep getting bad movies. Save your cash and don't buy in to the critics who are paid off by the studios anyways. I don't know how they have a job.",0
222,"This movie was really bad.  I mean, I wasn't expecting it to be good or anything, but this film pretty much poops all over the Ghostbusters name.  Really, really sad to see the state Hollywood is in right now.  Quit with the reboots, quit with the ""progressive"" ideas like replacing the original all male team with women, just quit.  Wasn't funny apart from a few small moments.  Only a real few good action sequences.  Not worth the cost of admission.  You'd have to pay me to see another movie like this.",0
223,"As ghostbuster fan this is a really hard slap in the face.The all woman cast isn't funny at all i don't know what they where thinking but it fail'd! I didn't even finish watching it, i walked away.",0
224,"Why just why. The original is a comedy classic with great practical effects, great performances and most of all it's funny. This ""reboot"" is a disrespect to the original and film making itself. No, it's not because they're women (to the idiots calling people that dislike the film sexist), it's because it's very unfunny, not well written, very clique, annoying and unlikable characters with an overload of cgi. The film was rushed into production after Harold Ramis died, and ignores the events original films, which is so disrespectful. Why the f**k did critics give this piece of **** good review, but intelligent, well made films like Neon Demon and BvS receive bad reviews. Do critics only like generic, dumb cr*p??  I happy the film didn't do well at the box office. These remakes (the film is basically a remake) need to stop. Total Recall, Robo-Cop, Poltergeist, Point Break, and now unfunny SNL Ghostbusters....It's a disrespect to film making. What are they going to remake next? Citizen Kane? The Godfather? Back to the Future? IT NEEDS TO STOP",0
226,"This movie got ever chance in the world from me.  Even though I didn't like the casting or directorial choice, I was adamant that it'd be good.  What I got was a horribly written, unfunny, poorly-acted piece of pisogynistic garbage that depended on manufactured hate to build it up.  Just bad from start to finish.  Paul Feig's career should be over.  Sony Pictures should be in much of the same boat.",0
228,"Terrible movie, if was actually far far worse than the trailer from early this year, all the ghost encounters were badly done. It wasn't funny at all except the dumb ass secretary played by helmsworth, just a chuckle that was it. Wasn't scary, cgi was bad, retarded ending, definitely ranks has one of the worst reboots in movie history, if you've seen the original this will make you cringe, i nearly threw up a few times, holy crap i couldn't wait till the movie ended it was so bad,",0
229,"I didn't enjoy the film. I watched it yesterday and felt ripped off. The movie seems to be more about proving a point rather than entertaining the audience. I was bored at 45 minutes into the film. This movie goes for 1hr 50min!!!! Chris Hemsworth seems to have taken the spotlight. I'm not sure whether this was intended but it happened nevertheless. The movie kept on pointing out how mindless and stupid Hemsworth was to the point that he became a central theme of the entire movie. This came over as bitter. The movie should have focused on the ghostbusters but instead became preoccupied in proving that men can be stupid secretaries. The sad thing about the failure of this movie is that a serious production now can't be made. They've tanked a great brand name and have ruined the concept for all of us. On a different note, I believe this movie may be the death of Melissa Mcartney's career. I have a theory -- called the Sander's Syndrome -- that an actor's comedic value dies as soon as the actor becomes ideological. I name the Sander's Syndrome after the 'comedian' Adam Sandler. He just isn't funny anymore. I believe he started to become unfunny when he started to become political. I think this killed his comedy. Unfortunately, I think Melissa Mcartney will just become another Adam Sandler. :(",0
230,"Ghostbusters 2016 is not ruining my childhood, it just ruined two hours of my adult life. It's a bad movie. Who is the movie targeting? The ghost scenes are too scary for 7-year olds. But then there are fart-jokes. And shortly after that the fart was apperently coming from the vagina, which in a later scene was filled with goo from a ghost. Ehh... what!? The acting? Hemsworth is supposed to be a handsome, intelligence-impared man. But he's so unnaturally stupid that his character should be diagnosed with something. And with that in mind, it's really insulting to people with handicaps. I don't understand why organizations are not crying out loud! And when he's possessed by another character, his acting doesn't change a bit. The same goes for one of the female leads, no change in acting when possessed... such a B-movie! More about the acting... The female cast were so great in other movies they made, Bridesmaids is one of my favorite movies, but in this movie they were just bad. All the techno-babble came so unnaturally from them. It's not a gender issue. It's great that there are real-life female technology specialists, but all of them are likely ashamed to be represented in a movie like this. Story? Kinda OK. Except for the fact that there was no chemistry between the main four characters. They were all the same! It's like the writers really loved Dan Aykroyd's character in the original and made four copies. Where's the sceptical character so wonderfully portrayed by Bill Murray in the original? As for the orignal cast, it felt like they were forcibly inserted in the script. Ending? What ending? The writers must have felt like the ending was so bad, they attempted to amend that during the credits. And finally an attempt at a Marvel cliffhanger/hint of a sequel. NO WAY should you make a sequel!",0
231,"This movie is a succession of flat jokes sprinkled with bad CGIs that no ""plot"" or acting cliché could make interesting. If there had not been so much jokes and useless explainations on things that don't matter maybe the story would have been better. They tried to remake 2 GB in one, but without the substance. I don't see any reason why any person older than 12 would enjoy that crap.This movies suffers from too much quantumic-mumbo-jumbo-unnecessary explanations that don't serve any purpose in the story. Probably for selling toys on Christmas.Very very bad characters. Not one of them seems ""real"" enough to dive into the movie. Too much dull jokes. I mean, really, too much. More than 1 joke a minute.",0

236,"Truly one of the worst films ever made. This utter insult of a soft reboot to a beloved franchise can't even be considered a cash grab. Ignoring the weird sexist tones where every man is either incompetent, evil or often times both, this film is rarely funny and fails to pace itself properly. Compare it to the original Ghostbusters, where the climax battle is followed by a short shot of everyone celebrating before the credit rolls. This movie does the same thing... except after it just goes on for several more minutes with two more pointless scenes.",0

239,How could you take a great classic and turn it into the Misandrogynistic mess.  WHHHYYYY?,0
240,"Ghostbusters 2016 is a reboot of the classic franchise from the 80's. It re-imagines the Ghostbusters team as a  all female cast. For this review, I will be discussing the film itself and not the drama and controversy surround it. The movie opens up with hard hitting jokes such as anti-Irish fences, enslaving elephants and a fart joke about a EVP involving a female ""queef"". You can expect other such quality jokes about a man pooping his pants, a **** joke in the disguise of one of the main characters being slimed, a coward of a man screaming like a eight year old girl and much more. There is a moment of blatant advertising for Pringles potato chips. They don't even attempt to hide it and are unapologetic about it. It's bad enough they expect people to pay money to see this film, but then they cram advertising down their throat. The complaint that the film portrays all men as jerks, creeps or idiots is doesn't appear to be a valid complaint. If anyone can recall the older movies in the franchise, the Ghostbusters have always had problems with authority and in almost all cases, it has always been men. With that being said, the male secretary for the reboot is beyond stupid, this character is so dumb they should be considered mentally retarded, it's to the point that it is literally offensive that anyone would consider this character funny. I assume the animated behavior and antics of the characters are intended to be funny, but failed on almost every level to as so much illicit a smirk from me. The funniest moment is when a person literally flips them off and tells them to ""suck it"" for a extend period. The character Patty just seems to be like a hodgepodge of black stereotypes in her mannerism and the way she speaks. The remade theme son of the Ghostbusters is absolutely terrible, they took a classic theme and turned it into a hip-hop, rap stylized song and it fails on several levels. The movie blatantly ignores source material, steaming ahead and forging it's own path. Perhaps if this movie was intended to be more of a spiritual successor instead of a direct reboot, it wouldn't be so heavily criticized, but the fact is, this movie was never intended for the fans of the classic franchise. None of the jokes or dialog match the thoughts and feelings of the original movie. This is a great example of meritocracy at it's best, dragging the since long dead corpse of the Ghostbuster's name through the mud and making a complete mockery of something many people have held near and dear. People who have never watched the originals may enjoy the film, but the reality is, Ghostbusters 2016 will in no way please the actual fans who have supported the Ghostbusters franchise for nearly three decades.",0
241,I did not enjoy the movie and to me it can be summed up by its first joke ... A fart joke ! The effects were nice and the cameos were ok but the humour did not click with me at all and the story did not draw me in either.,0
242,"So much unused material and so much wasted talent. That's probably the best one-line summary of GB2016 I could provide. Feig had cast a lot of talented people and gave them a script that wouldn't even do justice to a shallow B-Movie. You can pretty much see (especially with McCarthy) that the actors really, really wish they were somewhere else, probably unemployed, just not in this potentially career-ending train wreck. Despite all this, they really try to make the best out of the junk they were handed. I can't even pretend that it's done for political correctness, because Leslie Jones' character is a brutally blatant racist stereotype, the proverbial black ghetto **** mama from da hood. Sadly, she and the bumbling fool that Chris Hemsworth is portraying as the secretary are the only fun parts of the movie. Unfortunately for all the wrong reasons. She's funny if you like racist jokes, he is funny if you like klutz jokes. The rest of the zany acts is mostly funny if you're 5 years old and didn't watch a lot of TV yet, so you don't know all the jokes yet. And that's only part of the problem. The CGI is hardly newsworthy and I can't help but think that I've seen some of this before on a Doctor Who episode. The product placement is WAY out of hand, don't get me wrong, putting some real-life items into a movie can spice it up and give it a feel of real, but they just went overboard with it to the point where it gets ridiculous. You even see a lot of it in the trailers when McKinnon is stuffing her face with Pringles right at the sliming scene. Really? Your first contact with a ghost and you munch chips? Very professional, indeed. I mean, ok, in the old movies, the Ghostbusters were constantly seen smoking (with the notable exception of Winston, by the way!), but seriously... The characters don't ""work"" together. Holtzman has no reason whatsoever to join the other two, and even they don't really have a reason to work together. Gilbert just lost her university job because of Yates but of course the one thing on her mind is to join her in the hunt for ghosts, something that Gilbert tried to shed for the past years? Hello? Logic? Seriously, a lot of movies have plot holes, but the holes in this movie are large enough to move whole planetary systems through without even touching the movie. And that leaves me wondering who would be the target audience for this movie. Old fans of the franchise who are old enough to have watched the originals in the movies? Nope. That would be me and, no, this movie doesn't hold up against the old ones. Politically correct hipsters of today? Probably not really either, despite the all-female cast and the flawless portrayal of all male characters as either evil, inapt, insane or forgettable, but that racist stereotype will not sit well with them. Families? Nope. Not with queefing jokes right at the front gate and some other not really G-Rated jokes sprinkled through the movie. Who is supposed to watch this movie? I couldn't really figure it out. If you want to find out yourself, go watch it, but don't come back to me complaining for all I have for you is ""I told you so"".",0
243,"well, I mean I was expecting this to be bad, but not this bad. the cgi was horrible, the story itself was horrible,  it was sexist against men, and worst of all, it had none of the charm, wit, or jokes of the original movies in fact it had NOTHING that was really funny or scary in the movie. maybe a chuckle here or there but it was so forgetful I don't think ill remember what ghostbusters 2016 was about. if you want a good ghostbusters movie see the original two but steer clear of this one.",0

Starting by the bad casting ( remaking a cult movie from 3 funny guys hunting ghosts and changing it to 3 girls that hadn´t any idea what they were doing and cashing on the ""name"" of the franchise is LAME) The comedy was cheap, the effects were cartooned and the plot was total nonsensical.

The story line if you can call it that was seriously lacking and made no sense. I feel bad for the actress that had to put up with this piss poor writing. Also Paul Feig should never be allow to make another movie because clearly he doesn't know what the general public wants and is seriously out of touch with the real world.,0

265,"Okay, lets get to it. Is this the worst movie ever made and does it deserve a big stinking zero?Not really if we're being fair.The thing about Paul Feigs Ghostbusters is that it's lazy, the whole move plays and feels like a soulless cash grab.Im not the biggest fan of the original franchise but at the very least i can appreciate the amount of heart and attention to detail that went in to making the 1984 version.These things are not present in the 2016 version and i'd go so far as to say that one of the biggest problems with this movie is how unbelievably shallow the characters and even the plot comes off.The characters are i'd say the biggest flaw as they are all extremely one-dimensional and i can honestly say that after watching the first thirty minutes of this movie i no longer cared what happened to any of them.Now i get that this is supposed to be a comedy and so maybe the director and writer feels that character growth isn't as big a deal as it would have been in a more serious genre but that's still not an excuse for the lazy writing we're being offered in this supposed ""summer blockbuster"".Apart from that not all things are bad, this movie is not horrible.It's not filled to the brim with evil feminist propaganda nor is it the shining light in the darkness that will lead to Hollywood producing more movies with all female leads.Its just painfully mediocre, in almost every single meaning of the word.For what it's worth i thought Leslie Jones did what she could with her role and for me she came out on top because of it, judging from the trailer i was expecting the usual loudmouthed stereotypical sassy black woman but she actually managed to give her character a little life and the laughs i got from this movie was mostly due to her delivery.",0

(Like a queef joke.) The movie has a terrible plot. Basically, it is this mad bullied guy, who wants to summon all the ghosts in the 'ghost world"" (which is not explained at all), because all his life he has been bullied by people. He just wants them all to die from hundreds of ghosts. I found this as a very common thing to do in movies, and it didn't have a scent of originality. The characters, OH MY GOD THE CHARACTERS. Almost every joke they said didn't even make me smile, it was just a bunch of stupid ""wacky"" **** There are four female characters, and they all are basically the same. (Besides the blonde lesbian chick.) She is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. Her character is just so stereotyped as the ""I don't need help"" character. She (I think) is meant to be the funny one, but some of her jokes left me questioning myself if the joke itself was even a joke. And they portray all of the male characters as Idiots, and **** Chris Hemsworth did a good job, but they tried to make his character funny in a ""I'm retarded look at me kids"" kind-of way. This movie has many flaws, and is not worth watching in cinemas.

Acting..SUCKS.   Story....SUCKS.  Visuals...SUCK.  I don't mind that it is an all female crew but why not do something completely different to set it apart from the original.  Do not buy this movie.. better yet.... DO NOT EVEN RENT IT!  GIVE YOUR MONEY TO ASPCA INSTEAD!,0
287,"My fiancee and I got this movie from the library. We were watching it leading up to Halloween. We thought it would be kind of a fun way to be in the spirit. I knew there were very mixed reviews of the film so I went in with mixed expectations but an open mind. An hour into the film my fiancee suggested we turn the movie off and go get a drink instead. We finished the film two days later. She lamented that she would never get those two hours of her life back (the movie is much too long), and that the film was terrible. I completely agree with her. There is talent in the film. I won't say there is a LOT of talent, but more than what this terrible script provided. The plot makes no sense even for a movie about ghosts. The antagonist has no actual motivation that makes any sense. The four leads seem incompetent in every way. Worst of all the film isn't funny. I meant at all. It was a slot to get through. On top of it they straight up troll the audience by having bits on anti-female themes (youtube comments and the main antagonist). The cameos by the original crew were forced and added nothing to the plot. Kate McKinnon as Holtzmann is just terrible. There group will just be walking, and there she is bopping around in the background, looking straight into the camera. She isn't funny, she is annoying. Reviews and articles praising Ghostbusters (and McKinnon in particular) must not have seen the film I (and most users) saw. Instead they are seeing a film filtered through social justice warrior lenses where the fact that the main characters are all women (and Holtzmann is gay according to the director) means more than the quality of the film. If the film spent more time, you know, working on a script and directing than fighting social media fires perhaps this wouldn't be the dumpster fire that it is. Lets throw out a couple other tidbits. Leslie Jones's character seems like a racist stereotype. The only joke about Hemsworth (who is hilarious) is that he is hot but dumb. Would reviewers be ok if it was a super hot female who was a ditz? The double standards are astounding.",0
288,Painful. Guess this is why they had to abuse fans of the old ones/make it a sexist issue instead of trying to run on it's own merits! Think I'll go watch the old one again now.,0
289,"A horrible remake with focus on all the wrong things. It thought it was cute.. it wasn't. If they had focused more on fleshing out a solid storyline instead of they themselves constantly pointing out that the genders are reversed(something most people knew before going in) they might've had a chance. Only a deluded feminazi or a person who genuinely don't care what they're watching could enjoy this movie.",0
290,"Bad acting, bad jokes, bad special effects .. .you name it this movie has it including one of the worst cases of deus ex machina cinema has ever seen because writers don't know how to finish this movie.If they haven't relied on slapstick comedy and eddie murphy haunted house stile special effects and actual ghost that make sense to have that much power it might have worked but instead they were lazy and marketed feminism and misogeny on this movie to save it from being a total failure. Thank god for humanity that it didn't work because it's not the all female cast that ruins it but the awful directing and movie script.",0

It's not atrocious but it's bad and forgettable. But now because this garbage you have to refer to the original as the -84 version which sucks. Surprisingly the black woman's (Patty) most obnoxious scenes where in the trailer and she came across more tolerable than naggy voiced McCarthy (Abby). Only likable lead is Kristen Wiig's Erin though. Ironically the only chuckles came from the antics of male character Kevin, largely because of Chris Hemsworth's delivery. So the forced female angle didn't quite have the effect that they were shooting for. Watch the original instead for a lesson how witty, subtle and brilliant comedy is done. It holds up!",0

I was expecting a really awesome movie because noone would be as stupid to make a so controversial movie and then make it a bad movie so you make it easy for everyone to bash you so hard, but yes it is, really amateur. It looks like made but a bunch of unprofessional people with not a hint of talent. Script, camarography, lighting, Special Effects, Direction, are all subpar to the point that the movie looks like those direct to tv movies.3. The movie is highly insulting to men. The first one secondary character is depicted as a coward, the secod as effeminate ( that apparently the people behind this movie is a trait they consider shamefull i see), the third is depicted as a mentally retarded.They even go as far as insulting the real ghostbusters through a sentence said after an appearance of bill murray.I am not surprised this movie made millions of people extreme anti feminists.",0
301,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while and I'm a fan of B-Movies (Bad movies), to clarify, a ""good"" B-movie is one that is so bad it's entertaining, this movie is just bad. 99% of the ""jokes"" are on the level where only a 3 year old or someone with a similar sense of humour will enjoy, gone is the wit and clever delivery from the original movies. In fact the maturity of the movie overall is drastically lower than the original movies. The movie is also very sexist towards men and is very obviously in treating them as sex objects, this is the worst sexism I've seen in a modern movie. I don't usually care either way about these kinds of things but when it keeps being rammed down your throat throughout the movie I get annoyed. The acting isn't bad, the special effects are a little budget but not to the point of making it unwatchable. Overall, your time would be better spent doing anything else then watching this utter garbage.",0
302,"Thank you Metacritic for the user reviews and I promise, I'll take them into account next time I'll watch a movie. About Ghostbusters 2016, all I can say is they really took a big p00p on the earlier films. My main problem was I couldn't find what was wrong with the film : writing, acting, directing ? Why wasn't I smiling at all ? Final verdict : if it worked in the past, don't mess with it and leave it buried (it's the same with the SW saga,really...)",0

The rest of the cast just looked lost much of the time. The writing was insulting to fans of the original. Could they have written more lifeless stereotypes while still trying too hard to recreate the old Ghostbusters shtick? I dont think so. If you are 8 years old and like Nickelodeon cartoons....you may like this movie. It isnt the worst film ive ever seen, but it is one of the most disappointing. Cringe worthy on screen and on the pocketbook. Save your money. If you are curious....wait for Netflix. Sony better be firing someone after this project. Its was an incompetent handling of an iconic franchise.",0
315,Poor is all i can say about this film from the stale and well used jokes that lost there humour in the early 90s to the director who appears to have no idea what he is doing and visuals that look dated even in comparison to the original two films this is yet another quick cash in and an insult to fans of the original two films,0
316,"There's only a certain amount of cringe that a body can handle, so I stopped watching around 20% in. The movie has one thing going for it however: I doesn't inflict any physical harm, only mental. As such it might be a suitable replacement for waterboarding.",0
317,Steaming pile of turd. Utterly no effort shown by the cast in trying to make this a success. Everyone involved should be ashamed. The script must be a one pager. Even Melissa McCarthy was not her usual self. The lamest of lame jokes accompanied by a continual vomit of CGI special effects. This is not why I go to the movies. And what's with the BS reviews on RT?,0

I think I chuckled exactly twice (in a 2-hour movie)!  The characters are ridiculously unbelievable, there are logic fails out the ying-yang, and the villain....  Sigh. Don't spend money on this movie.  If you're a fan of SNL-type humour and want to sit through two hours worth of it, watch it when it's on tv sometime.",0
320,"'Ghostbusters' or 'Ghostbusters: Answer The Call', directed by Paul Feig, is the absolute best example on how not to revive a dormant franchise. Out of all the recent franchise reboots from last summer's 'Mad Max: Fury Road' (a much better made ""feminist"" movie) to the belated sequel 'Independence Day: Resurgence', Sony's latest cinematic failure is not only the worst in the current trend of big budget reboots, it's also one of the most unfunny comedies I've ever seen. If you want to kill a franchise, have it be made by Sony.",0
321,"Throughout my hole life, I honestly think this is the absolute WORST film I have ever seen in a theater. The actresses: Some were OK, delivering a mediocre performance trying to make people laugh and, while something achieving that goal, they failed the vast majority of the time. The visual effects: I belive that the CGI were the best aspect of the entire movie. Overindulgence of this asset, but good overall. Finally, the script: I really hate that they took a classic from the 80's and turned into this piece of junk. I'm so sorry if someone who's reading this actually disagreed with my opinion overall, but is safe to say that they had the obligation of NOT FUC**** THINGS UP! I felt like part of my parents childhood was taken away when I saw the actual actors from the original movie taking part of this so called ""movie"". Now I know that I'm been a little too emphatic on how bad the movie was, but it breaks my heart, and I soon as I got home I needed to write a review. I'm sorry Paul Feig (the Ghostbusters 2016 director) and Columbia Pictures, your movie sucks big time.",0
322,"Maybe if you're a young girl and you don't even know about 1984's ""Ghostbusters"", maybe, maybe, then it's a watchable film and it gets a decent rating; otherwise, it's a throwaway - at least, the first half; the second half was decent action-wise despite the girls' feeble-ility. Look, I like the Girls of SNL + Melissa, but their offering is barely better than the pitiful SNL skits they're in each week. And it's just so girl-power messaged that it would make any guy watching puke, especially with how they utilized ""Thor""'s Chris Hemsworth. And what kind of awkward irony was it to have Bill Murray as a debunker of ghostbusting? The big budget sfx are decent enough - in fact it could be argued they saved the film, but the actors' reactions aren't appropriate much of the time, there's a disconnect. Talking about disconnects, there was a HUGE editing whiff during the concert scene! Pahtiful. Also, in this day and age, wouldn't they use Go-Pro headsets to document their encounters, but headsets wouldn't make the girls look their ""cutest"" would it? The act of sliming had a ""fun"" dbl-meaning to it in the original, but here it's just used like a Nickelodeon awards show. Finally, it was some fun to see the other originals - Dan, Ernie, Sigourney, and ""Slimer"" - as cameos. But seriously, one and done, alright?",0
323,Missed opportunity to make a good movie. It is a sexist movie and they just hate on men threw out and tryed to push a political agender. BAD IDEA. I cant watch ghostbusters in the same way again,0
324,"Wow, I knew this would be bad but I wasn't quite prepared for this train-wreck of a movie. What a kick in the teeth to all the fans, let alone good taste. The original was a comedy at heart but there was still a sense of seriousness that made you sit on the edge of your seat and feel a true sense of fear and anticipation. This is just one big joke with all the characters dancing around in the credits like a bunch of morons. And man are there some seriously offensive character archetypes being peddled under the name of 'political correctness.' The black woman who has to say either the word 'yo' or 'homeboy' in every sentence? C'mon...Not even so bad it's good, just SO bad it makes you want to cry and slap the Director's face for having the audacity to create this miserable pile of donkey turd",0

330,"What a mess. I've given up on ""professional"" reviewers. We have 8/10 media outlets shilling harder than a fake cripple at a tent revival. That's the only explanation I can come up with to explain how this film doesn't have an aggregate five, or- how low does this thing go?- negative ten? I don't know. This rolling crapsack is an affront to filmmaking. I've seen funnier school bus accidents. It's seriously the cinematic equivalent of having the o-ring forcefully removed from your **** with no anesthetic.I saw it in a pretty packed theater, which probably would have accounted for 84% of the films total US revenue, and the crowd laughed exactly twice. Neither time at the movie. Except for me. When the protagonists were dancing for absolutely no reason after the garbage, inorganic, forced library scene, I started cackling like a madman. Everyone stared at me like I had checked the **** out, and I finished with ""Aaaahhh.... This is **** I happened to deliver that end line right when the sound cut out, and the theater erupted into laughter. That's right, folks. I garnered more aggregate laughs in three words than this entire film. Comedic timing. The other laugh came as Chris Hemsworth busted his dance move and someone in the back row ripped a particularly deep and voluminous fart.I mean, look at it. The characters are barely cardboard cutouts. We might as well have called them ""the fat one"", ""the black one""... ""pants""? The only actress who seems to have any actual talent is Leslie Jones, who unfortunately gets completely swept under by the garbage script. Paul Feig is a hack and whoever wrote this should feel a deep and eternal shame. The cameos were forced and awkward. A bunch of stupid, one-off devices were introduced for the sole reason of setting up an action scene that was the antithesis of everything charming about the original. Oh, and the end villain is defeated by a kick in the nuts. Seriously.Sadly, the whole affair is vastly less entertaining than reading the unwarranted positive reviews of obvious corporate shills.Don't see it. Don't rent it. Don't get it from Red Box. Put that money in an IRA or something. Hell, light those two dollars on fire and shove them down your pants. You'll have a better time than you will seeing this movie. Oh.

332,"It's really sad that after 25 years since the second GBs, we see a reboot/remake movie like this one, that completely misses the spirit of the series, and negates everything that GB stood for. None of the ingredients that made GB (1984) special were present here. This is specially sad because we know there were a lot of drafts for the script during the last few decades for the expected GB 3, so you expect a smart, clever, strong script, but it is the contrary, seems hurried at best.I'm really not sure how Feig was given the reins to direct a movie from the Ghostbusters franchise, both first movies specially the first one were really something else because they were a horror film wrapping a comedy. The were classics both of them, even if the 2nd is a lot worse than the first one, both stand the test of time. This 2016 version pretends to erase those two first films because it can, no reason behind it, just because they don't want capable males to be linked with this new film, or because Feig and his writing partner didn't want to hear ideas from the guys who created the franchise, I don't know why, but is one the films big mistakes.This atrocity called GB 2016 is genre-less, is not a horror film by any means and it is a terrible comedy, horrible comedy,it is just a bland movie with bad effects, it is the worst movie Feig has ever done by a lot for sure; add the fact that it has a weird agenda that tries to portray men as idiots or **** and you have a recipe for a toxic film that achieves nothing, or if it achieves something is destructive, not only undermines the franchise and the 1984 original, but also is a regressive film in terms of gender equality. Only a guy like Feig (apparently he had issues with male figures during his childhood), could think that objectifying and insulting males on the movie could gain some ground on the Hollywood gender inequality issue he is allegedly trying to fight.My recommendation is not to see this movie, not even renting it. Let's hope it disappears with the years and a new sequel gets done where the old team introduces a new team, and the canon set by the first movie gets the respect it deserves. I apologise for the mistakes, english is not my first language.",0

So off the bad I had this down to be one of the worst decisions in movie making history and had already expected it to be under a 5/10 regardless. However I kind of enjoyed Bridesmaids and Spy oddly enough!I was wrong however about Ghostbuisters. It was worse. Much worse.I think I chuckled twice the entire movie and I think I looked away in embarrassment for the other 90 minutes (I watched it alone too). Felt like a Scooby-Doo mash up with the same humour you would expect from a kids cartoon from the 80s including all the stereotypes from a bygone era. Awful.",0

Its a shame they didnt make one with the original cast (Akroyd and Murray at least) as Ghostbusters but this new take on it is fine and a fun family movie all the same. It certainly deserves a better score than 2.7!! Loads of references to the previous movies and great cameo roles from the old actors. I'm actually hoping they do a sequel :),1
341,"i skipped watching this at the theater because of all the bad hype about it, which i regretted after watching online later. found the humor, though not as clever/subtle as the old movies, was more of a laugh-out-loud experience. alot of people criticized the men as being ""dumbed down"" or purposefully rude/ignorant, but other than Chris' part as the receptionist, they seemed about on par with most of the bit characters in the old movies. and since the receptionist in the old movies was exactly the brightest bulb either, the dumb receptionist theme was okay with me. also like the new ghost catching tools/weapons they made for the movie. all in all, worth adding to the end of my yearly ghostbusters marathons :)",1

Unfortunately it was not. The plot was absolutely terrible, the forced cameos were completely unnecessary and the ending was horrendous.

350,"The original Ghostbusters movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie pales in comparison. I did not go into the theater with high expectations. The beginning of the movie is kind of boring due to the slow pace. I have nothing against a nearly full women cast, but it did have a really feminine kind of feel to it which it every much different to the first movie, it felt more like a ""chick-flick"" than an action movie to some degree. I wish they made the characters a little more gender neutral or less ""stereotypical girly"". I did enjoy the African American Women's character a bit more however. The female version of ""Egon"" kind of lacked in character, the original Egon was a believable nerd, this one was just a bit of an oddball that didn't have much to say but in a way that was not believable. She wasthe subject of a humourous jokes, mostly prop comedy which did make me laugh sometimes. The jokes were hit and miss. I did find some of the joke funny and burst into laughter, other ones, particularly the potty jokes involving speech about a women's genitals, feel flat, they were not funny to me and no one in the theatre around me appeared to laugh at those either. This is to the original Ghostbusters movie kind of what MacGruber is to MacGyverr. Really this should have been marketed as a parody of the original Ghostbusters movie than a reboot since that is what it really is. I did enjoy the movie enough that I didn't hate it so I've given it a 7, slightly above average rating. I did like it better than Ghostbusters II but that one was a flop too so that is not saying much.",1

352,"The new Ghostbusters, while not an Oscar-worthy movie, is actually a pretty average, funny comedy and doesn't deserve all the harsh criticism (there are way worse productions that receive higher score, god knows why). Unfortunately, many people hated the idea of a remake from the beginning and the movie was further sabotaged by the awful trailer. I grew up watching the original movies and when it comes to plot and humor the remake is more or less on the same level as the originals. The characters are not flat, the cast did great job, the plot (although predictable) isn't overly boring, despite the fact I was preparing for the worst. Unfortunately, the low score is mostly caused by the viewers' negativity. If this movie wasn't a remake but an original made in the 90s, people would've loved it. It's a solid 7 from me and I'd gladly watch it again.",1
353,"Ghostbusters is a very good reboot of the long dormant franchise. It was funny and had some cool visuals and action sequences. What's not to like? I have no idea why this film met with such vitriolic hatred upon release. It's a good, fun film! Oh well... Here's to the internet crazies once again.",1
354,"Okay, it's a remake of a classic so it's going uphill from the start, but taken by itself, it was pretty good.  Plus we had Bill and Sigorney do cameos, there were ties to the old film with the fire station.  For the 4 women to hire a hunky blond as the receptionist was reverse sexism at it's best.",1
355,"So far, 2016 seems to be a very bad year for movies, but Ghostbuster, despite its deplorable marketing, is a good surprise. The movie is not perfect, but I had a good moment watching it. So why ask for more ?  I still love the original movies, and I like this one too. Nice and funny movie.",1
356,"Really funny movie with great performances from MacKinnon and Jones, although the others are a bit muted. Solid special effects, decent story. Overall I recall enjoying this as much as I enjoyed the original when I watched it a quarter of a century ago. It's a shame a trolling internet campaign ruined its user ratings and killed the chance of a sequel.",1
357,"I loved this movie!! It was funny and has awesome effects. The cast was perfectly picked and it was worth buying. I hope they make another one! The only down side was I know that women get shown as dumb and only wanting to look good in movies, but i felt like the guy was a little too dumb. It was funny though and he had a good time playing the role. It would have been fun to play coming from a stage actress opinion. in all i couldn't be happier with the results.",1
358,"I've given myself a month to think about how I really and truly feel about this reboot. Firstly, I should clarify that the original Ghost Busters is one of my all time favorite movies but because I truly love the film, I can also acknowledge it's own faults. Exactly like with this new Ghostbusters. It is not good movie. It definitely could've been yet not as iconic nor groundbreaking like the original. That problem is due to the fact that Sony wanted it to make so many callbacks so that the movie could appease the fans. It is a shame that Paul Feig did not have complete creative control over this reboot because this movie could've been really good plus some possibly interesting future films in the franchise. So the nonetheless I loved it and I liked a tad more than Ghostbusters 2. It is disappointing to know that this is the only Holtzman we get in movie form.",1
359,While the story and characters are kinda bland. The movie makes up for it with funny jokes and good action scenes. I would suggest you go see this movie.,1
360,GHOSTDUMPERS takes a well loved franchise and craps all over it. If the originals didn't exist then this would be an ok kids movie Disney would be proud of. I think Bill Murray insisted his character be killed so he wouldn't have to soil himself again by getting involved in any future GHOSTURINATOR movies. If you wanted GHOSTBUSTERS 3 go play or youtube the Ghostbusters 2009 game. It's got the original cast including Harold Ramis. RIP Ghostbusters.,1
362,This movie had a lot to live up to with the first Ghostbusters. I genuinely like Paul Fieg's films so this definitely was on my radar. The cast all have worked together in some form so they all gel together nicely but no one overshadows anyone. The CGI was a lot better than I expected and the movie was funny. There were a lot of jokes when it hit it hit hard when it didn't hit it was super unfunny. The villain on the other hand does not fit in and isn't remotely funny. They are really pushing feminism with this movie with every male an idiot or a ass and the woman superior in everything. I'm fine with feminism and all but don't constantly throw it in our face. The action scenes where pretty cool and overall I was satisfied.,1
363,"I actually liked it. I thought it had good effects and funny moments. I didn't enjoy the cast as much, I think they pushed the all girl cast to much and just picked these people because they are popular. It should have been different people. These actors aren't actually very funny at points, sadly. I enjoyed it a lot though, if they fixed the acting a little it would be great.",1
364,"Can't see its as bad as some would have you believe, the story was some what original in that it was the ghosts doing all the bad things. The new ghostbusters worked well together, most people seem to have issue with the fact it wasn't a continuation of the original and getting mad over how they would have done it. Well its new universe for and its like the first trailer 30 years have past since that came out things have indeed changed. It was nice to see the camos from other actors. The ending for me was the weakest part and very rushed with the final scenes being all too much CGI . I will be getting this on blueray",1
365,"Saw it opening night! I know I'm in the minority here, but I liked it better than the old one! It was entertaining to watch and I loved all the actresses! I was already a fan of Melissa McCarthy, but I really liked Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones performances too. OMG, McKinnon's smiles and winks! (female reviewer here, but my husband who's a huge fan of the old ghostbusters really enjoyed the new one too!)Ignore the troll hordes, they are just angry (and often sexist)!",1
366,"Que os den Haters y **** En general, me ha gustado bastante. Suscribo la critica de Gonzalo muy respetuoso con el original, muchos guiños, es un humor muy de Cazafantasmas. El tercer acto muy bueno, raro de estos films que siempre se me atraganta pero aquí no me ha pasado. La pega que le pongo es que la mitad de la peli se estanca y se hace pesado, pero luego arranca y cierra bien. Muy recomendable.",1
367,"I would rate this an 8/10....but I will give it a 10 to balance the zeros. Is it funny yes!Is it good yes!Is it entertaining! Wiig, McCarthy(?), and Thor are hilarious. And just a side note....I went back and watched the 1984 Ghostbusters....nostalgia....I think in general we should erase the 1980s from human history. Forget it ever happened....it was an awful time full of bad movies and embarrassing photos....... Except for Guns N Roses......let's just pretend they started in the 90s.",1
368,"I love this movie. The women in it are great together and all bring their own style of comedy that blends well with their cast members. I laughed throughout this film! Who doesn't love a movie that has amazingly smart women who turn-up as the heroines! Beyond the great comedic acting, the film makers sprinkled a lot from the previous movie in which was fantastic. There are cameos, there is the famed marshmallow man, basically same events happening. In a brilliant way, they still made the movie have it's own story-line while at the same time bringing back all the old stuff we love about the 1984 classic. Very well done. I would pay theater money to see it again! Hopefully this cast continues making films together.",1
369,"so goodThe USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.",1
370,"This movie was absolutely amazing. Special effects, acting, characters, you name it. Judging by the director's statements, it entirely accomplished its goal of being a movie where the audience can have fun and see themselves represented on screen, and then went far further as a very enjoyable, hilarious movie. Everyone I've spoken to shares a similar opinion - that this movie won't be easily forgotten.",1
371,"Less a reboot than a re-imagining, Ghostbusters works primarily because of the amazing chemistry of the four leads, who keep us invested (and laughing) from start to finish. While McKinnon does steal a couple scenes (and is on fire all over the internet because of it), all four of these new characters are given plenty of time to shine and endear themselves to us, and by the end I found myself eager to see them regrouped for a sequel. Admittedly, the film has a bit of a weak antagonist character, and the challenge our heroes face feels less weighty than ol' Gozer did back in 1984, even if its talked of in terms of cataclysmic importance. But the film makes no illusions: it happily leans far heavier on the jokes than the scares, and works beautifully as an establishing origin story.",1
372,"This is a fun movie, with many funny performances. Chris Hemsworth is great as a dumb blonde secretary, and the all-women ghostbuster crew turn in a solid ensemble performance.  Don't let the trolls muddy the water.  If you like Paul Feig movies, you'll like this one.",1
373,"What an enjoyable, smart, funny summer action movie. I am sad and surprised by the very harsh negative posts and reviews. I know there is a lot of nostalgia for the original-it had it's moments- I watched it just a couple weeks ago but  there were numerous cringe worthy moments many by my favorite Bill Murray, odd ""plot"" twists and special effects that by today's standards are done better on most cellphones.   The original GB was a product of it's time which I enjoyed in the 80's , but it was ready to be remade and this was the team to do it! Women working together saving the world and trying to get a decent soup to wanton take out...is that asking to much?",1
374,"I was reluctant to go see it, not due to the female leads, but because (confession time) I hated the first film and found it unfunny and unlikable. So maybe I had less to lose than others watching but from the first few seconds I was IN. I loved every minute of it, the characters were so great, the comedy so very well done - I laughed my ass off. There was a bit of feminism in there (yay) and I was impressed by how it was worn ever so lightly and completely about moving along the story/character arcs. We also loved there were some clear John Finnemore and also Airplane riffs in the comedy that are very, very hard to pull off but were achieved with great aplomb.",1
376,"I think it's a good sign that I started laughing pretty much immediately, and I basically didn't stop until the first act of the movie ended. The scriptwriting and casting were both fantastic, and all four leading ladies did an excellent job. The movie separates itself from the original with strong, unique characters and a new plot but stays recognizable. My only complaint is that the second act of the movie, setting up the villain for the final conflict, seemed to drag on for a bit, but it was short enough before the action got started and everything was back to being a joy to watch.",1
377,"I have rarely been so surprised by reviews of a movie from which I have gotten so much enjoyment. I hadn't been sure what to expect, but I and most everyone in the (packed) theater where I saw this was laughing through the whole movie. The acting was as great as you'd expect with a cast like this, and the jokes were genuinely hilarious. We are fans of the original Ghostbusters and loved this ""update,"" which felt respectful of the original movie while putting a new spin on the premise.",1
381,Dude after i watched this i want to see some movie named Feminismbuster ffs i hate this movie what is this feminism theater? i hate you,0
382,"Funnier than I thought it would be. It's so silly that some folks are bashing this movie. There's no reason for the vitriol.  It's your basic summer comedy. It's good for a few laughs, and the stars Kirsten Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones all do a good job. I haven't been a big fan of Leslie Jones (or anyone else, for that matter) so far on this season's Saturday Night Live, but I did like her in this movie, so it's probably just a matter of her needing better scripts than SNL provides. Most of the original stars of ""Ghostbusters"" make cameos in this movie, and that adds to the fun. Bill Murray appeared on a talk show and said all good things about how funny and talented the women are. Ignore the nasty commenters, and check out this movie. Is it the best comedy you will ever see? Probably not, but it's not bad. In fact, it's better than a lot of comedies I've seen in recent years.",1
383,"Very funny and entertaining. I loved watching these smart, strong, funny women kick ass- and it was such a nice change that they managed to do so fully clothed.",1
384,Certainly with its flaws it still entertains with its rapid fire cast. It sure does have a lot of misses but the jokes come out so fast you really do not mind quite so much when some fall flat. It seems to be edited way to sharp and the girls seem to be trying too hard to make this movie entertaining. It is almost like someone was threatening them saying be funny or else. The result is a McCarthy that never seems to break out of her shell. The cameos could of been better. The special effects though are top notch and really bring out the third act with a bang.,1
385,"Here's what I don't get about all the negativity being heaped on Ghostbusters (which was a perfectly enjoyable popcorn flick, by the way). The Force Awakens was a near scene-for-scene remake of the original Star Wars with little more than a gender-swapped main character and flashier special effects to update it for modern audiences. It was ultimately a lesser film than the original and yet it's been met with near universal acclaim and abundant goodwill from the movie going public. Ghostbusters is a near scene-for-scene remake of the original with little more than gender-swapped main characters and flashier special effects to update it for modern audiences. In this case, though, the remake improves on the original in almost every way, and yet it is met with the kind of vitriolic negativity usually reserved for war criminals and politicians. I really want to believe that this negativity is not simply a reaction to the idea of a movie that features four female leads, but sadly I fear that is exactly the case. Either way, if you want to see fun, lighthearted, entirely enjoyable movie at the cinema, you won't go wrong in seeing Ghostbusters.",1
386,"If I remove my emotions around the original movie, this reboot is a strong 7.  I was against the idea of a reboot and went to see it, because I loved the original and Dan Aykroyd had good things to say about it.  We saw it in a packed theatre on Union Square in NYC.  There were tons of people laughing at the appropriate times.  I didn't find it laugh out loud funny, but it was amusing, like a comic strip.  Typical that all the 'good' scenes are from the trailer.  Plot was decent, but moved too slowly.  Nothing subtle about the switch of female leads with a hot, dumb male which was obvious and in your face. Kate McKinnon is the best part and sadly, her gun licking is her best scene.  All the original cast's cameos are brief and shoe-horned in and added nothing special.  Based on the audience's reaction, I must say that it felt like a solid 70-75, but my emotions got in the way and I just felt sad and a little foolish that a silly movie from my childhood could evoke such a strong reaction.  They chose to do a reboot and not the passing of the torch.  I think teens who don't know or care about the original will love this movie and all us 'old people' just have to accept that our pop culture is gone.  I've become that old guy who said, ""Who's this Indiana Jones?  Back in my day, Errol Flynn, now there's a hero!"".  Go see it, but do yourself a favor and don't compare it to the original.  You might like it.  If I rate this movie through the lens of the original, it's more like a 3, but I'm just some middle-aged guy who still loves the movies he grew up with...",1
387,"Super funny. Just the right length. True enough to the original but stands on its own. Outstanding comedic acting and great chemistry among costars. That being said..... The plot is paper thin. I give the film a pass b/c you don't expect or require a super compelling story in order for the film to work. In the end, its still my 3rd favorite Ghostbusters film (that could change over time with more views) but I am super happy with the way it turned out.The ladies (plus Kevin) are great!",1
388,"The movie is so much better than the trailer. The one-liners are great and there are so many quotable scenes. It has the same sense of absurdity, fast pacing and amusing supporting characters as the original. Also, this is Feig's best movie (its way better than Bridesmaids). The new proton packs are quite cool too and they improve throughout the movie, which is a nice touch. I'm a child of the 80s and 90s and this actually exceeded my high expectations. One minor issue was that I thought Sigourney and Murray's cameos felt a bit forced...",1
389,This is a very funny film and then scary in parts.  I took my 12 year old daughter and her friends and they loved it.  Most didn't know the original (mine did!) so comparisons just don't matter. We all loved it.,1
390,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's a lighthearted action comedy, with enough nods to the original while also striking out on its own. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are particularly hilarious in their roles. Leslie Jones's character was pretty stereotyped, and it was at leaste partly tongue-in-cheek, but perhaps not enough to justify itself. Hopefully the sequels will do a better job of showing off her expertise as a history buff and NYC local. I loved Ghostbusters as a kid, but I only wish I'd had this version too. It means a lot that the women are on screen to be funny and goofy and not be anyone's plaything, and the reaction to the film just shows how important movies like this can be. Beyond that, this satire of Ghostbusters reviews by Samuel Priest captures everything I wanted to say and more: ""I don’t dislike this new Ghostbusters movie because they’re all women, that’s silly and ridiculous. I can’t believe that’s even a question, with my history. I mean, my mom and sisters are all women and I know them, so how could I dislike other women that are not them? It doesn’t make any sense and, frankly, it’s below the belt. I mean, how dare you?"" https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/no-i-dont-dislike-the-new-ghostbusters-movie-because-i-hate-women-its-because-i-strongly-believe-in-hollywood-finance-reform",1
391,"Wonderful from beginning to end! Of course, it wouldn't be this good without the original, but in 20 years this will be the Ghostbusters movie people are still watching.",1
392,"This movie is fantastic! First off, the cast did a great job with their roles.  I can't say that one person stood out. Next I want to give props to the director. The movie looks great including the effects. The colors are really vibrant! The movie isn't full of funny jokes, but it is wildly entertaining, and I really enjoyed it. Totally recommended for the whole family!",1
393,"Not sure I understand all the negative User Reviews. I feel people just hate the idea and are not giving the movie any shot.  If you are on the fence, I would go to this movie. I thought it was a fun movie and light hearted. Way more like Ghostbusters 2 than the original, but I personally liked Ghostbusters 2. Third act is clearly rushed. Everyone in the theater seemed to like it and laughed a good amount. Definitely a movie I want to see again (but probably not in theaters).",1
395,"People, this movie just parody!!! This is not next part , its not somthing like old movie, this absolutle new movie!!! .This film make you laugh and little bitremember the old movie.  STOP HATE THAT MOVIE!!!!! This is my first review.",1
397,"Here is my real deal review. Its going to have a lot of info so bear with me. Im a huge fan of the first two Ghosbusters, that being said lets get on with the review.  First let me get this out there. Whoever is in charge of or put together the trailer for this movie needs to be fired. The movie is not as bad as some people made it out to be and no, it will not ruin your childhood.  The beginning started out strong, then the pacing feels kind of off. The two best things about the movie is Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth.  Hands down.  Kates chararcter, Jillian Holtzmann, is a character. Chris's character Kevin is very funny. You can tell he had fun playing that part. Here is where I am baffled.  Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are kind of just there. They have no real personality. Patty Tolan played by Leslie Jones, is a very stereotypical African american role.  The same role she basically plays on SNL. I admit she did deliver some funny moments but for the ""funny"" part it really wasn't all that ""funny"" for a movie that is trying really hard to be funny.  I would have rather the funny moments just came naturally.  (Like Ghostbusters 1 and 2) I hate to keep comparing it to the originals but we are all human and the originals are cult classics.  Of course we are going to compare them. Overall the movie is watchable.  Pacing is at times a bit awkward.  It's geared towards a different audience.  Kids up to age 12 or even teenagers will love the movie. Fans who grew up with Ghostbusters 1 and 2 will probably enjoy the many cameos of the original cast members but here is my gripe.  I feel like this movie could have and would have been better and much better received if they had a ""passing of the torch"" movie with the original cast. Even with the passing of Harold Ramis they would have still pulled it off tastefully all while keeping the same plot and story line. Overall:  The originals still stand strong and are better movies. Ghostbusters 2016 is watchable and not ""Fant4stic"" or ""Superman IV"" levels of bad. It's not a bad movie, it's not a great movie, it just is. It's watchable, has it's moments and it is definitely not as bad as some ""fans"" are making it out to be.",1
398,"Okay. A serious review. The Ghostbusters reboot is a good movie. it`s not going to ruin your childhood memories, it can`t, it`s just a movie. That being said it is a good movie. Could it have been better, possibly. A lot of time was spent setting up the creating of the toys. The villain was not bad but could have been better and the climax of the movie could have been better, however these problems could be said about all the ghostbuster movies. Some movies say that it hates on men. No it does not. It does not portray men in a positive light, but with the exception of the Ghostbusters, it doesn`t paint women in a positive light either.The problem is that there isn`t a Dana or Rick Moranis in the movie. So everyone not a ghostbuster is initial a sceptic or out to get them, thus people believe it is painting a negative image. Hey its a comedy, nuff said.Don`t listen to those losers who have rated the movie a Zero without ever having seen it. Go judge for yourself. I did and I liked it!Go see you won`t be sorry.",1
401,"The comedy is great, with many laugh-out-loud moments. Funnier than the original in a lot of ways. The plot isn't quite as good as the original, but way better than Ghostbusters 2. The original cast cameos are delightful. Overall, highly recommended!",1
403,"Love the chemistry between the cast. These gals are in for a good time and it's great to go along. It will not win over the pre-haters, but it's a nice film nonetheless.",1
404,"So a friend and I went to see Ghostbusters last night. TL;DR version, it was fine and not a waste of money (that popcorn though... such a delicious salty ripoff). There was the standard geeky technobabble explanations of things, a lot of action, very good CGI, and while I felt the villain was a little weak the overall plot seemed solid enough. I will preface the rest of this by saying... comedies aren't really my thing. I'm weird that way. Also, I will try to not spoil anything really, but there is probably some thematic spoiling going on in this. I'm bad with spoilers because I totally don't care about them, so I can miss them in my own comments... be warned. As anyone who is on the internet and as seen anything about this movie knows there has been a lot of bad press. I'm willing to bet that a large majority of that bad press comes from people who haven't seen the movie, and are just going on their gut reaction to the fact that women are being cast in a reboot of the franchise. The humor seemed solid to me. There was some physical stuff, which is totally in line for the original, and I can only think of a single fart joke as far as ""gross out"" type humor is concerned.  I suppose the sliming that happens could fall in that category, but I put it more into the physical side... your millage may vary. There were numerous little call backs to the previous movies which were all subtle enough that if you hadn't seen the old movies they just seemed like regular dialog, as opposed to weird inside jokes you won't get. Most of the old cast had cameos in the movie, Bill Murray as a debunker, Dan Aykroyd as a cab driver, Annie Potts as a hotel desk employee, Ernie Hudson as the uncle of Patty, Sigourny Weaver as Holtzmann's mentor, and the late Harold Ramis even makes an appearance as a bust that is outside Erin's office when the dean comes to talk to her about her tenure. Rick Moranis does not appear, but he's pretty much kept out of Hollywood since his wife died so that's no surprise. Character wise Holtzman totally steals the show. To me it felt like the ""main"" characters were intended to be Kristen Wiig's Erin Gilbert and Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates but Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann gets a ton of great lines, gets to be the total tech geek spilling out technobabble like a startrek engineer, and her big action scene in the later third of the movie was extremely well done and fun to watch. Also I'd like to not that while Patty isn't a scientist she is shown as smart and is the group's history geek, so she's not a one dimensional character. Oh and Thor's, I mean Chris Hemsworth's, Kevin is a total send up of the ""pretty but dumb secretary"" trope. And that is fine. The villain, to me, was just.... I don't know how to describe it.  He reminded me of the 3 geniuses from Buffy. He was creepy, and surely up to no good, but he didn't seem... scary, really. It wasn't a bad villain, exactly, but he felt a bit weak as an antagonist. Like, he would have been fine as an underling to a big bad, but as the main guy... shrug So all in all, I thought it was a decent film. It entertained me, and that's all I ask of a movie.﻿",1
406,"I know the haters of this film will hate me after this, but this movie is very funny and creative. We can't boycott only one movie if we are angry by the insistence of Hollywood to do remakes and sequels of classic movies. Remember Mad Max, Star Wars, Jurassic World, King Kong,  and the thousand reboots of Spider-Man. If you want to deslike Ghostbusters just because it's a remake, do it with the remakes that you like too... This film is rather a great choice of entertainment and fun. It is well done, it does justice to the original and captivates not be even a little cliché. Ignore attempts of unfounded boycotts and have fun.",1
407,"I have no clue why this movie got such negative reviews! It was cute and funny; stop comparing it to the past versions. But yes, there were a lot of ""one liners"" and they made Chris Hemsworth too stupid in this film. It was more towards the younger demographic versus the original's darker sense which would have been amazing. But all in all, I went in with an open mind and actually enjoyed it. I wasn't there comparing the two films or anything, I based this review off of video work / CG, as well as, acting and it was better than expected. Definitely a movie to watch, but not one to buy.",1
408,It's a fun movie!!! We left the theater pumped up and feeling good! People that compare this to the original need to get over it. Reset and move forward. Go see it yourselves! We hope there's another one soon!,1
409,"I haven't laughed this hard since Steve Carell's ""Get Smart"". The improv in this film is as good as it gets. And callbacks to the original were a welcome treat. Go ahead, see this one in the theater and watch it to the final frame. You're welcome.",1
410,"Even before it was released, this Ghostbusters reboot had already been the centre of great criticism, even becoming the most disliked trailer in the history of YouTube. But whilst it never feels like this reboot completely escapes the shadow of the 1984 original, Paul Feig's Ghostbusters has successfully defied it's poor trailer by building on the talents and personalities of its entire cast to create a fun, up-beat and all-round entertaining experience. It more or less follows most of the basic plot beats of the original film. After ghosts begin to pop up in New York, three scientists (Wiig, McCarthy and McKinnon) begin to investigate and along with a subway employee who witnessed the ghosts called Patty (Leslie Jones) they form a team to start fighting these ghosts. The only major difference is this time the ghosts are being lured in to our dimension by a man named Rowan who detests humanity and wants to destroy everyone. He's a villain so uninteresting and generic you'll forget about him as you're watching it. Fortunately the rest of the cast are all hilarious. They avoid falling in to the trap of being gender swapped versions of the original Ghostbusters cast and instead let their own comedic styles and personalities form unique dynamics between the new characters without relying on the 1984 original. Wiig plays Abby, a paranormal expert who loses her tenure due to her belief in the paranormal. She is the most restrained member of the cast whose best strength is playing off the other cast members. McCarthy also does well by moving away from her brash and outspoken performances in films like Tammy and Bridesmaids, instead playing a lovable upbeat scientist, in a role that gives her a good opportunity to show of her physical comedic skills. Leslie Jones is at her best when she's reacting to the strangeness of everything that's going on like running away from a mannequin that's come to life screaming at it to stop. Chris Hemsworth plays the dim-witted secretary, in what at first could have risked being a one note joke of role reversing the dumb blonde stereotype. But Hemsworth seems to elevate the source material with some great comedic delivery that makes him become a surprisingly likable mascot for the film. Though the real show stealer is definitely Kate McKinnon whose hyper-energetic style dominates the film whenever she's on screen. Even when she's not the focus she'll be in the background doing loads of visual gags. She's a weird mixture of an oddball personality and some great physical comedy to create one of the most charming and bizarre characters from any of Feig's films. The film is definitely at its strongest when Feig lets his own style takeover and focuses on letting the casts unique personalities and chemistries lead the film. Some of the films best moments are where the characters are just given an opportunity to hang out, like when McKinnon and Wiig are at their new headquarters and randomly burst out in to a small song and dance number that accidentally sets the place on fire. In contrast the films weakest moments tend to be when it tries to homage or throw in too many call-backs to the original film. At times these are hilarious with cameos from Akroyd and Slimer being some of the best moments of the film that are bound to appease both fans and newcomers alike. But at other times the filmmakers try so hard to show their love of the original film that they end up turning away from the fun personalities of the characters and instead stop the film dead in its track to directly quote lines like ""mass hysteria"" from the original film. They do references like this so often throughout that it ends up feeling like the film is unable to stand apart entirely from the 1984 original. Also Feig does seem somewhat limited when it comes to some of the films big action set pieces and seems uncomfortable working with the heavy amounts of CGI. This is particularly clear in the films finale where the film sways away from the actress's chemistry that made the film fun and replaces it with an extended fight sequence against generic looking ghosts that feels like it drags on for way too long. Though there are still some creative aspects to these sequences. It is cool to see all the different weapons that the Ghostbusters have including things like whips, pistols and grenades that are something genuinely different to what we saw from the original Ghostbusters. And the film as a whole is definitely a lot of fun to watch. Unfortunately it's not going to be good enough to win over people who go in to the film expecting to hate it, but for anyone hoping for a fun movie this will not disappoint.",1
411,"This was a surprisingly fun movie. Yeah, it's not as a funny as the first one, and it's definitely missing that intimate personal story line that the first two had (e.g. Bill Murry & Sigourney Weaver's story) that kind of gave everything more stakes. This one is just about the ghostbusting, with the same light-heartedness as the first two. The acting is fine, if anything I wanted more of the four together. Wish it was a better script, but overall totally fun Friday night movie for sure.",1
412,"Contrary to the haters who either went to this movie planning to hate or have just reviewed it without seeing, this is a great re-make. No wonder the cast of the original have given it a whole-hearted endorsement. The female Ghostbusters are surprisingly a comedic improvement over the original!! The four stars are simply hilarious throughout the movie, bringing great talent and comedy chops to each role.  The story is entertaining and engaging. The special effects are superb. It is a fun ride from start to finish. Things some might not notice are the way that the body shapes of characters are never the subject of jokes or ridicule. Also, the plot involves a Indian burial ground theme that is based on real-life Native burial ground and does not diminish or stereotype Native Americans or their ""ghosts."" I went to this movie with an open mind. Sometimes films you think should be great simply are not. This movie is great. And, although I assume some are genuine, I take many of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I note that many who give bad reviews (1) recycle the same lines as other bad reviews and (2) object to the ""political agenda"" of having women as the stars. To me these are red flags that the reviews aren't worth the time to read them. Go see this movie and enjoy yourself!",1
414,"I loved this movie more than the original. the characters, story, plot, and everything about it was great. I liked it more than Ghostbusters 2 and that is saying a lot because I love that move too. I loved that they dedicated it to Harold Ramis and loved the hint at the next possible movie!!! I loved that almost the whole original cast made cameos. R.I.P. Harold Ramis. The Ghosts were amazing!!",1
416,"Ignore the haters, this movie is pretty damn entertaining. All four leads are incredibly funny and memorable characters, and I want a sequel just to spend more time with them. Chris Hemsworth is particularly entertaining as the dimwitted secretary. The action, when it comes around, is actually really well-shot and creative, and the 3D effects are taken full advantage of. Downsides include a villain with a better concept than execution, an awkward transition into the final showdown, and an over-reliance on body humor in the first half-hour. But the rest of the movie is really enjoyable, and I recommend it for a lazy summer evening",1
418,"I heard a lot of crap about the new Ghostbusters movie, so I decided I would go into it with an open mind. It made me laugh, smile, and really got me with some jump scares. Overall, it was a great movie. I don't care if it's a remake. I didn't use that as a basis for my review. If you go into something with prior expectations, then it's going to be complete crap. Most of the people who rate this as 0 or bad are stuck chasing the past; trying to go back in time. But we can't go back to a time when that movie was super cool and a hit. The ""professional"" metacritic score is only -7 compared to the original. They tried so hard to give it the look the original had, that they had to hold back some of the effects that we are capable of today unlike the original. The kids in the theater I saw it at had a blast. Those kids... they're you. They are the little kid that saw the original in the trailer with such an open mind full of wonder and excitement. They were screaming and laughing like crazy. The original cast members even made some appearances, so to complain that they weren't in the movie shows you that that person clearly didn't give the movie a chance. I loved the strong performance by the ladies too. It wasn't too girly and cliche that showed a man was writing their characters based off of what he THINKS he knows about women. It was written by a man and woman, so the characters were real. Women in science are often overly sexualized or masculine, but the women I saw will definitely be a strong influence of the future generation of girls in STEM jobs. Chris Hemsworth's character was a little over the top dumb, but it's a comedy! I loved the movie. I didn't want to be the stereotypical girl and like it, but I can't stop myself from wanting to watch it again and again.",1
420,"Hilarious from beginning to end. I was cracking up 30 seconds into the film and never really stopped. The actions scenes are well-done, and the special effects are great. All the main characters have interesting personalities and story arcs. Kate McKinnon is flawless from beginning to end as the mad scientist.If you have daughters or nieces, you need to bring them with you.",1
421,"This movie was fantastic. Very well done and very funny, while being respectful of the source material. I highly recommend it; you can't go wrong by seeing it.",1
422,"Ironically neither as good or as bad as anyone wanted it to be, Paul Feig's ""Ghostbusters"" reboot brings the laughs, scares, and imaginative effects, but to nowhere as high of a degree as its 1984 predecessor did. High marks go to Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones for giving it their all in almost every scene, but it's the surprisingly well-conceived narrative that just saves this picture from the middling plains of mediocrity. It could have been much better and it could very well have been much worse, but - in the end - the simple fact about ""Ghostbusters"" still remains: the film just kind of ""exists"" and doesn't do much more than that.",1
423,"Who you gonna call? Paul Feig, to deliver a fun remake of a classic film. There are some hilarious moments here, and this remains true to the spirit of the original film, with excellent performances from the entire cast. The pacing is slow in some parts, and the storyline lacks coherence occasionally as well, but the visual effects and overarching ideas are well executed and engaging. The script is great and overall this is an entertaining, fun and enjoyable film. 8.14/10",1
424,"I was excited to see this movie, but the trailers had me wary; in the trailers, the jokes didn't land, the pacing was odd, it all just fell flat. No matter – the film itself is great. Uses the talents of its leads very well, has an entertaining enough plot, and has some great visuals. I find myself more and more bored with fight sequences these days, but the final confrontation was as entertaining as anything else, which was great. This movie was genuinely funny and at times genuinely creepy too. After having some concerns, I was really happy to see they pulled it off.",1
425,"So much frickin hilarious. Feel sorry for all the grumpers who're getting mad about a movie that is pure fun with brilliant female comedians. I had a smile on my face the whole time. Watched the original Ghostbusters last night after watching this one the night before... Maybe those that are calling it there favorite movie of all time should go back and watch it... it's pretty great, but a lot less funny than I remember it.",1
426,"Funny, goofy, and great to take preteens to, and it made for a fun adult date night as well. There are a lot of fanboy haters ripping on this movie and artificially driving down online reviews, but they're **** an old movie and clearly weren't in the theater filled with laughter I was sitting in. Ghostbusters brought the clever, self-aware humor of Bridesmaids into an action comedy that left me laughing the whole way through, with actors having an awesome time and an ensemble cast with good chemistry",1
427,"It was fantastic!! There were parts that made me really jump from fright and parts that made me cheer. If you loved the first one and truly loved them, then this will take you right back to the first time you saw it in theaters. So many things they did right with the original, they did right with this one and made it even better! The things they did badly with the original were left out of this one and it was a relief that left nothing but good feelings afterwards. I'm still smiling. I'll be buying it for home viewing as well as soon as possible!",1
429,I didn't expect to find Ghostbusters to be my humor at all but I was pleasantly surprised. I'd totally see it in theaters again and I'm not one for rewatching them at box office price ever.,1
430,"I think it's great that all these people who were so staunchly against this movie are shelling out money to see it, given the amount of reviews it has! Shame no one here seemed to enjoy it as much as we did; our screening was packed and shared several applause breaks! Long and short of it is if you like Paul Feig's other films, you'll like this one. Similar character-driven humor. If you don't, this movie's not for you. Ladies had great chemistry, the cameos were a delight and I look forward to seeing it again.",1
431,"I loved this movie and hoped it would live up to the original, and it did. I especially loved Leslie Jones as I had not seen her in much before this. What a talent.",1
432,"2.7? That's what I thought I was going to give it too. But then I actually went and saw it. It was great! It's a funny, likable movie. Honored the original while doing something new. Wiig and McCarthy are wonderful. Helmsworth was a bit annoying but contributed some good laughs. Lots of good subtle humor along with big laughs.",1
433,"I really enjoyed this movie!! The 3D wasn't worth the price but aside from that this movie was refreshing. Yes the original will always be better because it's a classic, but the way that the classic characters had minor cameos while allowing the new characters to develop and really lead the show.  I have heard that people felt that the special effects went too far but considering that this is suppose to be a sci-fi comedy I thought it was perfect. I really hope they continue on this trend of good re-releases (Star Trek, Star Wars) and give this movie a sequel using the criticism of users to improve the franchise.",1
435,"I really, really enjoyed Ghostbusters. It is not some brilliant film, but it is a great comedy. With very good comedic writing, Ghostbusters is funny from beginning to end and truly never lets up. Heck, I was laughing even during the credits and the post credits scene. The film is funny, through and through. The girls have great chemistry with one another and Kate McKinnon particularly is fantastic. Leslie Jones is no slouch, however, and is fantastic. I had low expectations for her since she is hit-and-miss for me, but she was phenomenally funny. All four have great timing, though they all kind of get overshadowed by Chris Hemsworth. His turn as the dumb bimbo of an assistant is terrific. Every word he says is hysterical and never failed to make me laugh. I was rolling in my chair with how funny some of it was. This film is a true joy to experience and is thoroughly funny. On top of this, the special effects were great. The ghost design was scary and light, while also looking quite cool. The gags with ghosts were also solid and very funny (especially during the final battle sequence). Additionally, I saw it in 3D and the 3D was fantastic. I rarely love 3D and think it makes a difference, but it absolutely was the case here. The 3D was great and, on one occasion, made me jump so bad. In short, I loved this. It was a great experience and it is sad that people were predetermined to hate it because it ""is ruining their childhood"" or is ""anti-man, Paul Feig hates men and I hate feminism ahhh"". Idiots. There are legitimate problems with the film, but few negative reviews actually rely on these and instead rely on perceived insults to men, none of which is the case. The villain is poorly done and the plot is certainly not fantastic, but neither really matter to me, because it is a comedy. It is supposed to be fun and boy oh boy is it ever fun. Go see Ghostbusters.",1
436,"I really enjoyed this movie. It pays homage to the original (not counting the second movie because that was absolutely terrible) while being able to stand on its own. It was funny, the fight scenes were badass and I even got scared at times. Each of the ghostbusters were emotionally complex and had distinct personalities and I enjoyed seeing their dynamic on screen. All in all this reboot fit the spirit of the series in ""dumb fun"". I also assume that about 99.99% of the negative reviews haven't even seen the movie, could be effectively tossed out,  and are only rating it bad because its popular to do so.",1
437,"I watched it. It was a lot of fun. The fan service/homage to the first movie was quality for the most part, and probably too much of it was done, but it didn't distract from the entertainment experience. It's not The Bicycle Thief. It's not even Sex Lies and Videotape. But it was worthwhile and fun summer movie, especially to watch characters in a movie just be characters in a movie who just happen to be women.",1
438,"Fleeting. I mean, this movie just whizzes by. The performances are great, and there's something to be said about Kate Mckinnon here. But this is about as disjointed as a Supernatural-Comedy can get. The genre's don't work together, they're just there. Pales to the original, but that IS a pretty high bar.",1
439,"Unfortunately this has become because of political correctness and its backlash almost impossible to rate objectively. In the 2016 North American wish to either redo every successful film ever made and present every conceivable variant in the process, for what could be deemed the lack of any possible originality of ideas, I still tried to enter this with an open mind, and see this as if the two films from the 80's (which I enjoyed very much the one time I saw each of them) had never existed. I should state I saw this in 3D (which I hardly ever do), with my lady and our respective sons. I felt that it was quite funny and that the special effects were excellent. Next to 'Avatar', the use of 3D was the best I have ever seen. It's a popcorn flick well-worth seeing. Though I haven't seen any other movies by Feig or starring McCarthy, it made me want to go back and give them a shot at some time in the near future. There was something for everyone--both my lady and I enjoyed it very much--and the boys, three and thirteen years-old respectively, loved it as well. Give it a shot.",1
440,"Sometimes a Director's style is so evident in a particular film that, in this case, the movie might have benefited from being called Paul Feig's Ghostbusters instead. I'll make this short as enough has been said about this film already. If you have seen any of Feig's previous efforts then you already know the tone of the film, add some familiar collaborators and you have Bridesmaids with ghosts. Both Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy give slightly-tuned versions of their usual schtick. Leslie Jones - despite reviews saying otherwise - gives us a sassy Metro worker that has an inherent love of New York history (which is shoehorned into the relevant moments so obviously, I didn't buy it). The standout for me was Kate McKinnon playing a manic, offbeat Kramer-style character that continued to hold my interest throughout the film--she was the closest in feel to an actual Ghostbuster character. Lastly Chris Hemsworth as a Himbo, plays a solid but forgettable comedic role that has its moments but was done better previously. Actors aside, the story is passable but not particularly interesting, the villian is (as we should be used to by now) serviceable but bland, and most of the gadgets (given greater screen time this time round) weren't especially memorable updates, with most showing up in the third act, just in time for a silly cgi-laden, ghostbuster showdown that ejects comedy for flashiness. Lastly, the modified theme tune is so uninspired they would have been better starting from scratch. This is a solid, entertaining family movie, quickly forgotten, that won't change minds stuck in '84'. Kids will undoubtedly enjoy it but as for the adults, well...",1
441,"A lot of fun! The kids really enjoyed it and despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it was awesome to have a bunch of characters in the same movie that my daughters could look up to!",1
442,The cast are amazing and work together perfectly. So funny and truly entertaining. so great getting to see women kick butt. Loved the cameos. Seen it twice already going to see it many more times.,1
443,"I went in with no expectations, and came out of the theater loving it!  I haven't laughed out loud like that in a long time with a movie.  The characters are great and relatable, and the effects reminded me so much of the original movie.  I honestly recommend this movie, I might go and see it again just to catch things that i might have missed",1
445,"Had a blast! This review is partly based on the reactions of my two little girls, who were amped up to see this . And they were not dissapointed. Ghostbusters is now theyre favorite movie. So happy :)",1
446,"A surprising number of the 0-2 point reviews remind me of a certain character in this film... that said: I never see a movie on opening weekend, ever.  For this movie I made an exception and I was not disappointed. This movie had every member of our group in hysterics the entire way through.  If you're looking for a film with the right peppering of subtle callbacks to the original, yet entirely its own movie, this is it. This is a more coherent telling of the Ghostbusters story than the original, with a dynamite cast and an excellent script.  Go see it, you won't be disappointed.",1
447,"Not as effective as the original but funny nevertheless, Ghostbusters (2016) is a light and enjoyable reboot.",1
451,"More a comedy than the original, and often funnier. It's light fare, but very fun. I think kids will absolutely love it, and I look forward to the next offering, if it's in the cards. Thumbs up!",1
452,"The internet and Ghostbros are all wrong.  This movie is amazing fun and the start of something bigger!  Trying to compare anything to the original is a cop out.  This movie does a great job in tribute to the original while at the same time standing alone.  Nothing will beat the classic, but this is a good start to the reboot of the franchise.   GO SEE GHOSTBUSTERS!",1
453,"The Film Most Controversial of The Year Scares, Entertains & Satisfies I want to release my review - principally positive - of profane languages and emotions towards the haters, the only thing I will express would be: ""Swallow your own sh_t, fu__ing haters"". Now, let's start. 'Ghosts from Our Past' is titled the book written by Dr. Erin Gilbert and Dr. Abby Yates, in which establish how to identify and counteract a paranormal entity. The book is a failure and as a cliche of ' female buddy films ' take directions different. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) works as a professor at Columbia University, while Abby continues to studying the paranormal with a peculiar engineer, Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), However, ghosts from past will return to torment to Erin. She find out that Abby returned to publish the book in digital platforms such as Amazon without her consent, decides to reunite with her partner for remove from the network the stormy book that will possibly ruin her life. Abby accepts with only one condition: She guiding them to a museum in New York, where powerful supernatural forces have evidenced, this, the first venue for a series of conspiracies to will free all the vengeful spirits of the city. A very suggestive and promising initial plot that will impressed even the most skeptical with the best of a summer film. We all remember with affection and nostalgia to supernatural comedy film released in 1984, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, which left an indelible hallmark on the global pop culture and became a obliged reference for corporate films of today. Although, we are in the period of resume ideas ("" Mad Max: Fury Road ""-"" Ben-Hur "") and apparently the productions of Hollywood is being obsolete, however, this not means that all reboots has been a fiasco. 1984  are gone, and new generations deserve to know the foundations for the comedy films, therefore, Paul Feig's ""Ghostbusters"" is a complete delight. The reboot offers some tributes to the original - it is obvious, they were inspired by it - but the atmosphere is different, team is different, the spirit is different, so it has to be assessed as a individual product, it not as the cheap copy that they have sold us detractors. The relationship between the new team is palpitating, glorious and powerful; showing its hefty power in each frame. Which makes innovative and entertaining to progress of the film is not its screenplay itself, it is the analogy of its characters, the colossal and different attitudes of its protagonists, each one struggling to dominate, but it is nonviable to declare the winner, is like a frenzied crescendo. We have already seen the knowledge that McCarthy possesses for the comedy genre, with the comical film of last year ""Spy"", ""Bridesmaids"" of 2011 (directed by Feig), or even this year with ""The Boss""; a woman with a so unique and bold humor that has become the humorous lady of the decade in the film world, I am a great admirer and outside the world praises her; with so much potential, it's no wonder her performance in her last movie, boundless guffaws. Kristen Wiig goes by the same road, and despite she is not stand out like Melissa, the duo plays of wonder and remain in place of beginning to end in the film, with their supernatural form of make laugh and also cry. Rowan North (Neil Casey) plays a villain singularly strange. A guy inspired in the book of Abby and Erin that want to avenge of the world that called him weird, he is part of the heterogeneous mix developed around the film; his quality is proportional to the progress of the film - his final manifestations are fantastic, they will be a pleasant surprise for fans. North is also responsible for guiding Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) to the team, an African American woman, who works in the subway of New York requests the help of the Ghostbusters for later inundates of laughs and exceptional moments to the audience. Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) is the queen. She portrays a crazy engineer, with a couple of screws loose but with strengths and well represented in the corresponding scenes. Perfect and ideal complement to the team, it is not the silly addition says absurd and irritating comments, that role fell into the hands of another. Holtzman is the brain of the operation, constantly, makes improvements of her weapons, her technology and her defenses, a character special. Hemsworth has tried to venture into the comedy world, he had a small cameo the last year with ""Vacation"", but this time, he dared to be the sexy secretary of the 'Ghostbusters', Kevin, a young man with glasses without lens and with childish pants invades in the life of the quartet to fill of comments to some extent funny, but Feig knows how control it and do not exceed this resource until the end. Characters, creatures, ghosts and songs from the original are perfectly implemented by Feig and his team, something that fans will love of the original, I did it. Special effects are unreal, obviously, but just enough to implant his own hallmark and his signature on each frame. Neon colors, rays and smoke, the new team annihilates to ghosts and adversities present in the story. Multiple cameos were used, but the less surprising and satisfactory was the of Bill Murray, who appeared in form of bitter person and without nothing of his humor of the initial, this was another character, but he could rethink his role. Paul and his team have done an extravagant work, a puzzle  meticulously armed which only falters in small and invisible aspects, nothing is superfluous nor badly worn, it is simply ""Ghostbusters"". I confess, when I heard the emblem song the franchise felt nostalgia, but after seeing the final result, I say with confidence: ""It was worth"". 1984 has its own, but 2016 screams perfection. Beyond of the purpose of the film (Entertainment), the extension of the film and especially the end after the credits is a clear analogy to the revocation of the female voice in a misogynist and discriminatory world , the girls say: ""we have achieved it"" and successfully, they have achieved it with honors.",1
454,"Movie was awesome! I keep hearing people claim that their theaters were empty and no one laughed, but nearly every seat was filled at the showing I went to and it was filled with laughter. I loved seeing strong, intelligent women as the leads of the movie, because a movie with this many female leads is hard to come by. Hope there's a sequel!",1
455,"Ghostbusters isn't a bad movie, but it isn't great either. I guess it was watchable, but I can understand why people hate it. For me, I haven't seen the original, so I wasn't really expecting much. What I got was kind of what I expected. Now I love Melissa McCarthy, Paul Feig films (The Heat, Spy) and I think she has a humorous personality. In this movie she kind of was the same character as before. The other three ghostbusters were fine and they were entertaining for the most part. Chris Hemsworth kind of felt like an idiot in this film, but that was okay although it felt like he was just an additional character casted into the film. The film itself had a pretty strong beginning and then it just kind of dragged. However, the film itself had some pretty good elements and this film kinda reminded me of TMNT2. Ghostbusters was overlong and did feel like a cash grab remake, but it's watchable for the most part and it certainly doesn't deserve a 2.3 user score. (69/100)",1
456,"It's very very awesome movie for ghostbusters franchise. hilarious, high-tech gadgets, and brilliant. I love story, CG, 3D technology especially all original casts in old ghostbusters come back to cameo. I lovin it!!",1
457,"Best summer movie hands down. At least as far as b!ockbusters. And stay past the credits. Theres a little something extra at the end? Would i see this movie again? Nope. But then again, I only saw the original once.",1
458,"The female led Ghostbusters reboot is finally here, and I’ve got to say I think it’s a pretty good movie. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, mostly from internet hacks who were clinging to the sexist chant that “women aren’t funny.” Ghostbusters is clever and funny, features cool special effects, but is admittedly a little cliched. That being said this film is very good, and I would say don’t let the audience reviews online sway your opinion too much.For those who don’t know anything about the Ghostbusters reboot, it’s being made by the same people that made Bridesmaids. Bridesmaids is one of the funnier recent comedies, but i’ll go so far as to say I enjoyed Ghostbusters more. While Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are their reliable selves, the show stealers for me were Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and Chris Hemsworth. All 3 brought an unexpected level of humor and screen presence, and almost every joke delivered by Leslie Jones had me laughing out loud. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon may have entered this film as almost exclusively SNL stars, but after this film I think you’ll see them in a lot more.The rebooted Ghostbusters, much like the original, uses a lot of special effects, in an attempt to mix big budget CGI with comedy. The original Ghostbusters, sort of broke ground by proving that comedy and big budget special effects could work together, nowadays it’s commonplace as every Marvel movie uses the same approach. That being said the effects in this movie, especially the sound design, were cool and looked good. I will say that some of the effects reminded me of Star Wars, but they aren’t the first and they won’t be the last to copy that movie.The only big problem I had with the movie was that it felt somewhat derivative. Many moments in the movie it felt like they were nodding to the original instead of trying to be different. That along with the reliance of Paul Fieg on the overly talkative humor, where characters refuse to ever let the audience figure a joke out for themselves, are really the only things that seemed weak in the film. That being said major fans of actions films should beware that the action sequences are nothing special, and some characters aren’t all that well developed.So in essence Ghostbusters is no masterpiece, it’s really not even a great movie, but it is pretty entertaining. The cast is great in the movie, many of the jokes worked, the effects were cool, the soundtrack was nostalgic fun, and the movie even featured cameos from the entire cast of the original, that are still with us. For those who feel weary because the online fan reviews and ratings have been bad, I fear many of those reviewers never saw the movie, and instead gave the movie a bad rating out of hatred that women are in a traditionally male movie. This is a fairly entertaining comedy, and regardless of what you’ve heard if you like comedies check this movie out.",1
460,"Contrary to popular belief i personally thought the movie was a pretty good re-imagining of the original, sure it will never be as good but it was still a pretty great movie",1
462,"I enjoy this movie, I'm not huge fan of the Old Ghostbusters, but this was fun, good entertainment value this has. Better than the original.",1
467,"Is the reboot of Ghostbusters the greatest comedy ever? Hell no. Does it have problems? Oh absolutely. The CGI is horrible, and some jokes fall flat. However, the chemistry of the actresses, more than some of the jokes DO land, and the variety of the action kicks ass.Even if you didn't like it, there were clearly worse movies in 2016.",1
468,I really enjoyed this film. It had toilet humour and silly jokes and they got me every time. Also the blonde weird chic was hot AF,1
469,"Yeah, this movie is genuinely garbage. I watched it a second time too if maybe I was too harsh but it turns out I was spot on, and in some ways maybe even kind. It's trash.",0
474,"I'd heard all about the dreadful way this movie was conceived, but wanted to watch it with an open mind, free of all the controversy. But the movie is abysmal. In fact it's probably one of the worst movies i've seen in the past 10 years. It's shameless, it's crass, it's unfunny, it's complete nonsense.",0
476,"I hated to say it, but the haters got this one right. Let me be clear, ripping on a film you haven't even seen is still a bit childish, but the movie is just awful. I took my family to see it last night, and never in my life have I ever seen an audience more stone-faced during a comedy. It was a weird almost uncomfortable atmosphere.It doesn't work as a comedy targeted at adults; many of the jokes are beyond worn out and predictable. The effects are cartoonish. The film doesn't work as a family picture either. Some of the humor actually pretty crude. I can not recommend this for those with younger kids. Throughout the entire film, i sat there wondering: ""Who exactly was the target audience for this?""My girls did not enjoy it, and I was bored out of my skull after about the first half. The only redeeming thing for me was Wiig. She was her usal offbeat, but charming self. McCarthy was just awful. Literally nothing redeeming about her performance. Jones who is usually hilarious, was saddled with a bad script and some truly horrible lines. McKinnon is just kind of there. She was utterly forgettable. The males in the movie don't fair much better. Hemsworth hammed it up, but it was way over the top. Even the usually solid Andy Garcia looked like he was phoning it in. Cameos from some of the original cast members felt shoehorned in as well.All in all, I wanted to like this, hell I defended this, but it falls well short of the mark. Save your money, and wait for it to hit the bargain bin.",0
479,"Not As Awful As Everyone Says It IsWhile it is a bit too political and is generally another unnecessary remake, This Movie still has plenty of funny moments and good chemistry of the 4 leads.",1
482,"An insult to the Ghostbusters franchise. They think that by putting the original actors saying phrases filled with nostalgia the movie will be saved, but not even that can do it, plus it has terrible jokes and to make it worse they are constantly trying to throw them at you. This movie is the perfect representation of how SJW calendars are changing movies for the worst.",0
483,"This only gets three points because the cinematography and editing are fine. It's definitely a movie. Everything else falls flat; the plot, jokes, CG and ugly cameos from the original cast. The acting was like a series of SNL skits, nothing consistent.I don't even think kids would be engaged by it, and considering the first joke in the movie is about queefs, it's probably not intended for them, anyway.",0
484,"This movie was by no means great but it was often times good and definitely didn't deserve the level of hate it got. The four central characters were actually pretty good for most of the film. Holtzman was actually great in parts. The four leads did a good job with a script that goes from mediocre to bad in parts. The script is kind of bad, though the actors did an admirable job with it. Now, one thing that does deserve some criticism is the way the movie handles men. Just about every male in the movie was either evil, a jerk, or incompetent or stupid in some way. Literally almost every single one. I didn't really notice at first because I generally enjoyed the movie (except the cringe-worthy ghost fight towards the end) the first couple times I watched it but every viewing since the first it stood out to me more and more. This has nothing to do with the female stars of the film, whom I actually liked, but rather the script.",1
485,"Ghostbusters -> HORROR-ComedyGhostbusters II -> Horror-COMEDYGhostbusters (2016) -> SlapstickThe basic Story is okay, not great, but the stories of GBI and GBII weren't great also.The visuals were technically okay, but the bubblegum visual apperance is kinda crappy and anoyying.The maincharacters were ... well not characters but female versions of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. What made Paul Feig hate women that much to make direction choises that bad?",0
486,"As I always say, ""Don't make what's old, new."" As many movies and TV shows have possed in this new century is that there is never original movie work, just reproductions of timeless classics that can never be made again. I also was disappointed at the idea of why are they making a movie on Ghostbusters with the original themes and stories just with a different gender of cast members. It's beyond me why the director, screenwriter or producer, could have done a movie on before they were the Ghostbusters or fans of the Ghostbusters who try to be in their image.",0
487,"I skipped seeing this gem in theaters because of all the bad hype about it, a decision I wholeheartedly regret!As with all Paul Feig’s films, Ghostbusters: Answer the Call is a laugh-out-loud experience with great action sequences that the whole family can enjoy.Some criticize the men as being ""dumbed down"" or purposefully rude/ignorant in this film, but they’re really on par with most of the bit characters in the original.As someone who grew up with the original films, cartoons, and comics; I’m glad to say that this reboot is a refreshing take on the franchise that’ll leave you feeling nostalgic and wanting more.

489,"You cast lively, talented women in one of the most loved franchises of all time under the banner of Sony. Why do a remake? Why do fart jokes? Why the incessant insult to the lore? You had such an opportunity, and this under the auspices of promoting female lead characters. It’s actually a disservice to that cause. Do not watch. The writers shouldn’t be allowed on a movie again. Horrendous. No imagination. A quick cash grab by Sony.",0
490,"I think it was after reading critic reviews, then actually watching this film that I realised you really can't trust film critics anymore. I'm not sure what exactly their agenda is, however I'm pretty sure it's no longer about being honest. As this film really is extremely poor in every way. Dull characters, terrible script, poor storyline and absolutely no humour. Simply awful.",0
491,"I love these ladies, they are so funny, really great comedians but this movie is a dumpster fire fueled by methane extracted from a hungover pig's **** The jokes are **** the story is **** the villain is **** the cameos are **** and it's more than obvious that they did it for the paycheck. I still love these ladies and I love their comedy but this movie was made as a **** you' to the original story, cast and fans.",0
492,"The fact this film is certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes is worrying to me because the film was everything but fresh. I'm not a fan of these all women cast remakes just because they seem very forced and gimmicky. Whatever happened to organic feeling female lead roles like Sigourney Weaver in the Alien series or Geena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight? From the start it was clear the humor wasn't going to be subtle, witty or clever and that instead it would substituted this with over the top, slapstick, haha-we-mentioned-Starbucks-how-relevant-because-that's-a-real-thing humor that films seem to go for these days. The whole thing was very confused - the cast all seemed to be constantly vying for the ""funny one"" spot which just created this very 2D experience, there was no variation in character, the bad guy was completely forgettable and un-intimidating, the story was very ""meh"". The only thing that was funny was the fact that Chris Hemsworth's character only managed to get the job as the ghosterbusters' receptionist because they found him attractive! Can you imagine for one moment if it was the other way around? Alas, it's an all women cast so it's ""empowering"". I'd like to comment on the plot a little more but it was honestly that forgettable. Overall, a waste of 2 hours and unfortunately I can't use that thing out of Men in Black to erase this from my memory.",0
