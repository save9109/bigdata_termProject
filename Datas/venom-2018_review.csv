0,This movie is no worse than Thor Ragnarok. The only thing - Venom needed filmed for R rating and not PG-13.,1
2,"In fact, the film is not as bad as many critics say.Yes, in some places the plot of the film sags, some scenes were cut, etc.I still want to draw attention to the advantages:1. Tom Hardy's acting. Tom is a great actor, playing excellent in this film.2. The interaction and relationship between the protagonist and his symbiote. Yes, they are not fully disclosed (for example, why did the symbiote so quickly become attached to Eddie?), But still it is pleasant to watch them. If there is a second part of the film, I hope that this relationship will be revealed to a greater degree.3. Despite this age rating, the film is cruel in some places, but mostly it is an action with elements of comedy. The jokes were basically where they should be. Anyway, for Tom's charisma, I’m ready to forgive the film for some moments.4. Venom is an interesting character, which perhaps was not enough for us. Not a superhero, but something more.",1
3,"For whatever reason is causing this to become the biggest Marvel letdown since 2015's Fantastic Four, Sony fails to utilize Venom's problems that could have easily been fixed if they had to take a minute to backtrack problems that could cause the hype train to die off easily. There's just so many missed opportunities that could have made Venom more than what it actually is, but of course we know that Sony doesn't care about that. They just care about your money and nothing else. Sony should just give up the film rights to Spider-Man back to Marvel Studios at this point. It seems that they don't know how to make good movies anymore without influencing their money onto it.",0
4,"Don't listen to the ""critics"" if you want to call them that. The movie was great and entertaining. Very good movie!",1
5,"This movie is bad! It’s not well-written, it’s not technically well-made, and it is stupid! However, I actually enjoyed it a little. Most of this movie I found to be slow and kinda dull. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, I started having fun. This movie is at its best when it is being crazy and over-the-top! However, there isn’t a lot of that in the movie. That only really happens in the middle of the movie. It takes a long time to get going, it goes for a little bit, and then it just kinda ends abruptly before it even really begins. It’s very poorly paced, probably because of the re-edits. I thought there must’ve been more to this movie, I was only 90 minutes into what’s supposed to be a 110-minute movie, but nope! That was it! There are, no joke, 20 minutes of credits! That’s including two post-credits scenes, but you can just turn the movie off after the first one. The second is just a clip from Into the Spider-verse, nothing special. I heard there were about 40 minutes of footage cut from the final film, and yeah. It shows. Overall, this movie is a hot mess. If you’re in the mood for garbage, give it a watch. It’s like one of those less-than-wonderful 70s and 80s B horror movies. If you like that sort of thing, you’ll like this. If you want an actually good movie with a similar premise, however, watch Upgrade instead.",0
8,"Venom isn't a bad film by any means. If anything its refreshing that its actually a comic book film that doesn't have the same generic cookie cutter formula that Marvel has really started to tire out....Its far from a perfect film, but atleast someone is trying something different and there is enough here that can be improved on in a sequel...Hopefully in 2019 when Sony's deal with Marvel ends they take back the character and insert him into a Venom sequel...Its sad that a bunch of whiney little Marvel fanboys want to pretend that this film is terrible without ever having seen it hoping to push Sony into somehow selling the rights for Spider-man back to Disney....",1
10,"This is not bad like critics say it is but definitely needed to be R rated to achieve its better self. In my opinion, a better cinematographic adaptation of Venom than Sam Raimi Spiderman 3, really good acting of Tom Hardy quite good visual effects comedy used smartly not forced or excessive like Thor Ragnarok for example, done to take advantage of the popularity of the character but in a decent way, a good comic book/superhero movie but maybe not a good movie per se.",1
11,This was definitely better than I expected.  It all falls apart with a horrible CGI climax but the build up was thoroughly enjoyable. I felt the level of violence was just right - people who want a hard R rated Venom movie must not be familiar with the comic iteration. This felt faithful to how I remember him from 90s comics.,1
12,"So, Just seen this movie and I must say I was impressed. Had very little hopes going into it but left happy. If you are expecting a masterpiece this isn't for you. If you are a person that likes to complain about everything, this isn't for you. Eddie Brock and Venom's Chemistry is what makes this movie enjoyable.Venom is portrayed very well for the anti-hero/villain he is. Some comedy thrown in as well. Great Ending and End Credit scene YES! Everything else is just kind of irrelevant. Don't listen to the critics or even us. If you want to kick back and enjoy a flick then right here is the way to go.",1
14,"Tom Hardy is great as Venom, the movie is good right up until the third act at which point any notion of pacing get thrown out the window and they seem to rush through the last 20-30 minutes of the film. I get they cut chunks out of the film to keep it PG but the whole things becomes quite unbalanced, it really feels like sabotage and I hope there is a directors cut or extended version of the film.Again Hardy is good as Venom so I have hope the sequels will flesh things out a bit and they take some lessons away from this.",1
15,"Excellent movie. As a 30yr long fan of the character, I can honestly say this is a fantastic portrayal of the character. The humor, violence, and horror of the character, a staple of Venom since 1988, is all on display and excellently performed by Tom Hardy!Only complaint is the villain is a little boring.... not a problem with Riz, just the character is nothing more than Evil Doc That Thinks he’s God. Tad cliched.CGI is excellent, movie is great for 13 and up, but there are several S bombs and one F bomb. If you or your kids like the recent X-men movies, they’ll LOVE Venom.",1
16,Good enough. Worth the money. Glad to see Tom Hardy without a mask(I was worrying how it will be). But he did it very well. It was interesting. It was funny ).,1
17,"Very enjoyable. Not a horror film, but more like an action comedy. Definitely not 3/10 like the critics are rating it.",1
18,"I really don't understand why there are so many negative around this film. I found it very funny and cool, plus Tom Hardy so awesome actor. The film is not a masterpiece, but definitely recommend for viewing.",1
19,"Most definetely a enjoyable movie. I have some knowledge of Venom in the comics to know that is not as a faithful adaptation as Deadpool may be, and also know that the movie may have been a tad more enjoyable if it was rated R, but I had fun. Hardcore Venom fans may be dissapointed on the lack of blood, and that every scene does not have someone being decapitaded. General audience, action, or comic movie fans will have a fun time. It was a fun movie. Its not a master piece, but it waswell worth the price of admission.",1
20,Ok i don't know why its getting so many bad reviews the movie was very good for what they were trying to achieve.Good pacing funny when needs to be and serious at the same time. I'm interested on where they plan on taking it from here after seeing the post credits scene,1
22,"I just came back from watching venom and its really good, the movie is different from the original story but keeps the same idea of the original story, the movie has a lot of good jokes, and thankfully venom is not shown for just 5 minutes.Btw I watched in real 3dAfter credits carnage if u kno what I mean ;)",1
23,"Not sure what’s up with the critics. Was it the best comicbook movie there is no, but it was still decent. How I would improve it for the sequel should there be one, would be to go the Deadpool and Logan route.",1
24,"Tom Hardy saved this film for me because it was basically the same old Marvel comics movie – monsters, fights, spectacle. Hardy made his character more human than usual in a Marvel film, and his delivery was much funnier and slier. Riz Ahmed was a plus also. But I suspect the audience was a bit bored (I wasn't) and they talked (some walked around) and several checked their phones, which was annoying. I may go again because of Hardy and the rest of the cast, and to see if I can get a better (and smaller) audience. Sometimes a bad audience can really wreck a film. The “transformation” was also fun and interesting.",1
25,"to be honest i don't understand the pro critcs , 3,5 lol luckily i don't trust professional critics that much , i trust more on users and good reviews all of u did , i had a good time watching the movie , not even a singles moment feeling bored",1
26,"I had a quick look at the reviews before deciding to see this movie and am glad I checked the viewer score, this movie was thoroughly enjoyable, I have no idea on earth how people came up with a 35 score, did someone not pay them enough to do a review, the movie was not what I expected as someone who has read a few venom comics however it was overall a very enjoyable movie. 8/10 Would Recommend.",1
27,"Rad as hell, and a ton of fun. Tom Hardy delivers excellent dual performances and Venom looks phenomenal. It's a full origin story (which the film uses the Life Foundation to tell without Spider-Man, doing a pretty solid job of it) so it may start a little slow for some. As a long time fan of Venom, I had a great time and I'm very excited for more.",1
28,"I’m not a Spider-Man fan, so I don’t really care about it being “canon” and I don’t know much about Venom’s backstory either. As a film on it’s own, I actually enjoyed it. Tom Hardy’s dark humour fit perfectly. The symbiots are cool, very sci-fi. Reminded me of Aliens. No where near the best of Marvel’s own films but it’s definateky entertaining. Awesome post credit cameo too...",1
29,"Critics were unfair with this movie. If you are in doubt about going or not going to see ""Venom"", please just go, I guanrantee that you will not regret it. The movie may not be amazing or fantastic, but it certainly is fun, and it has its strong points, like Eddie Brock and Venom`s relationship. It had some great action scenes with a good CGI. It is also very funny, im pretty sure that everyone that saw the movie, even if they disliked it, laughed atleast some 3 or 4 times. The villain was not well explored, same as the relationship between Eddie and his girlfriend. Still, a solid 7.5, definitely a good movie that will entertain you and even make you laugh.",1
30,"Venom is a really fun and enjoyable movie. If you are a fan of him from the comics than I can't see why you won't like this movie. Tom Hardy is the perfect choice for Eddie Brock as he delivers a really great performance. The movie has some really great humour and action sequences as well. It gets really dark at times which works well for the story, but its a bummer they didn't go all the way and make it rated R. The villain is a bit generic but the overall story is well done. If you're a fan of action movies or superhero movies than you'll definitely enjoy watching Venom.",1
31,"Now I'm a big fan of Marvel movies and characters such as Venom. I saw that the critics who watched the movie did not like it, so I decided to watch the Venom movie and give my opinion about it. And I have to say, it's pretty alright.I enjoyed a lot of the goofy and silly scenes, but venom is more of a dark comedic type of alien. It would have been better if the movie was rated R to add in those extra 40 minutes of dark scenes that would have made the movie better. The story was a little bit too long and a little unnecessary. The one unnecessary part is where he breaks up with his ex, gets fired and etc. It doesn't tell us about Eddie's character. It's just drama that was added in there. I would feel empathy, remorse and another type of sympathetic feelings for him if they built off of the characters a bit more in the beginning and told/showed us more about the person to get more invested in them. But they don't and I feel very little for them. Another thing is that I don't like the villain that much. Sometimes the movie would have a thing about him that I'm supposed to get interested in, but I really don't get that interested because it isn't that interesting. He also has a common motive, but something that we the audience can't really relate to. I mean, of course, he wants to, ""Save the planet from extinction"" but that's a motive that many people have and it isn't unique or interesting in any way. The story was linear and went straight forward, but it did not do so well in explaining the characters moving forward and trying to make us establish bonds with them. The only good things about this movie are some of the funny scenes/action scenes, the actors, and the venom redesign. Especially the venom redesign. I mean it's like Sony looked back at Spider-Man 3 and said, ""We can fix this."" and then did it and they did an excellent job with the redesign of venom, especially with the great additional vocal talent by Tom Hardy. But, sadly it doesn't make up for the mess of a movie. It seems like it is in between of being a comedy superhero film and a dark comedy superhero film. But as if now, it's just a neat little movie with a relationship between a dude and an alien. It isn't worth the massive hype, but it is still pretty enjoyable to watch.GRADE: C",1
33,"Don't listen to the critics. This was a great film and felt like a whole new genre of superhero movie in comparison to the slightly formulaic movies being produced by the MCU these days (not saying I don't enjoy MCU movies just saying it's starting to feel formulaic). It seems that many critics are regarding it as an MCU film without doing their research and expected a light-hearted comedy film with some action. While this film has an element of comedy, it is much darker than most MCU films released in recent memory - maybe on par with The Winter Soldier. Venom's reviews were also bombarded by Lady Gaga fans around the time of previews, which I'm sure had an effect on the critic's scores also. I am scoring this film a 10/10 as the critics have also scored this film unfairly however I would have actually scored this film a 7 or 8 out of 10 if not for the critic reviews. Overall, great movie and 100x better than TASM movie previously released by sony (terrible),and it also beats the only film released with venom in it previously by a long shot (spider-man 3).",1
34,"A bit too short with a kind of lackluster villain, and you can clearly tell this should've been rated R. But Tom Hardy is absolutely fantastic and the film overall is a lot of fun. Hopefully we get an unrated edition when it comes to Blu-ray.",1
38,"The movie starts out kind of rushed and silly, but settles into it's groove later on. It is a really silly movie, but that's actually what redeems it. Without the entertaining silliness, the movie would have little leg to stand on. The best parts are the parts with the Venom voice in Brock's head (especially initially), and the action scenes with Venom. Overall, a silly movie with a different approach to the superhero genre, but nonetheless, entertaining and a bit unique. Watch, even if it's just to see how silly a movie can get.",1
40,"As a casual movie watcher who doesn't care for who directed the film, who's in it or any other import things about the cast or crew, I really enjoyed Venom.Yes it's not the best movie, It doesn't deserve any award but it's fun to see and that's because:Tom Hardy who is ""Eddie Brock"" and ""Venom"" both have a great sense of humor and Tom acts excellently which really gets you to be involved with his characters, it was so good I didn't realise Venom and Eddie were done by the same person.It's not too full of action like many movies are nowadays and it's annoying when they rely heavily on CGI. But this one doesn't. Yes, there are moments of action and lots of CGI, but it has a build up of the plot towards it and so you become invested in both what's happening and the characters.I find the whole premise about space really intriguing as having a rich figure who can do as he pleases and is above the law is really interested, it almost make me think of what Elon Musk could become one dayBut in conclusion, I don't understand why critics are so hard on this movie, yes it has moments where it isn't as good but it has lots of fun and enjoyable ones too. So it really provides for a fun viewing. But don't go if you're looking for an incredible masterpiece.",1
41,"Once again we see that the movie reviewers are out of touch with the general public. You’ve got Tom Hardy in another great performance, some decent comedy value and good action sequences. Whilst it may not be a ground breaking awe inspiring movie it was enjoyable not the 35 score they have giving it.",1
42,I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. Venom is tremendously underrated by critics who are nitpicking every wrong detail. There is so much to appreciate about this movie from the mix of different emotions from each and every scene to being constantly tuned as to what was going to happen next. It's clear that the user reviews heavily outweighs the critic's views on this one. Venom is 10 out of 10 and I suggest this movie to anyone who likes comic book heroes or anti hero movies.,1
44,"not bad at all. i enjoyed the movie, don't listen to critics.i love the chemistry of venom and eddy Brock",1
45,just go see the movie for yourself instead of just listening to what rotten tomatoes or the critics are saying about this movie. if you really want to go see the movie then ignore the critics until you have seen the movie! lol,1
46,"I was on this film with my gf and it was the funniest film that we watched together. As I understand,many of negative reviews sais “it’s PG-13” and a plot is boring and isn’t canonical. May be they are right,but for simple person,who didn’t read comics and don’t like rivers of blood,venom is really good movie,not a masterpiece,but just good.",1
47,"Pretty good for a superhero movie.Venom good at least because of I can understand motivation of every single character. Simple ""they killin' people"" is not enough and long introduction contains all answers.",1
48,"You can tell the movie is missing that 40 minutes, but for an origin story I’ve seen much worse and was left pleasantly surprised with this film.Venom/Hardy were great - definitely worth a watchHopefully a sequel will prove this to the critics",1
49,"Enjoyed the movie but the lack of an R rating really detracted from it, and you could tell from some of the action scenes and humor. It has funny elements but one of the lines near the end was incredibly cringy and I felt the chase scene of Venom/Tom Hardy lasted too long. I didn't mind the 'villain' and feel the film lends itself well to a sequel.",1
50,"The plot is just ok, but Tom is just amazing. Definitely not as bad as some of the media claimed.",1
51,"What do critics play? Are they bought? It's not a bad movie. It doesn't respect the origin of the symbiote suit as in comics, but it's a lesser evil since all superhero movies do the same thing. Weak Villain. Action and Fun. Critics go home plz!",1
52,"Better than Black Panther! I loved it and so did my girlfriend. She's not even a comic book fan but wont stop asking about Venom and quoting the movie. Dont believe the Lady Gaga fans and their bad reviews, it's an attempt to get more viewers to watch the crappy remake she just put out. It was definitely worth ticket price. If you're a fan of comic books you should see this movie today!",1
53,Знаете очень интересно но не понимаю как метакритика 35,1
54,this is good but I can't understand how to survival venom in a fire.and I want more action,1
55,"I can't understand why this movie has bad marks from critics.In my opinion,Venom is a great film about famous character in Marvel comic universe.Tom plays well,plot is amazing too.I like this movie and looking forward second part!))",1
56,"So, this is another ""superhero"" movie type underrated by the supposed professional critics. With a difference though, this is the most underrated one of this year...so far. Really? This movie is a 35/100? They are crazy! I ask to myself as a critic of games myself: why the movie critics are so unprofessional when they review this type of movies? Venom is good people! The story is compelling, the movie have great moments of action and the movie have the surprise factor in his side. The only thing i can complain is the villain. I like him, but i think the movie deserve a better final fight. But in general, i love the movie, like my best friend and even my family, who love this type of movies. So, people, don´t even read the reviews, they don´t know what they are talking about...they don´t even appreciate this type of movies. But certainly they will give a great review to some **** movie, as usually.",1
57,"I had a great time with Venom, I was a bit worried how everything would play out without spiderman what with him being an essential role in the story tradtionally, its explained early on and every thing feels believable as its own standalone story. If your a fan you gotta see it. Also these critics should be fired, they obviously don't have taste or at least know how to critique a film based on what it is, instead of what they think it should be",1
58,"Venom is an ambitiously accurate portrayal of the anti hero comic character that sets itself apart from the tired and formulaic MCU as a highly entertaining standalone origin story. While it may break away from the comics slightly by not including the Spiderman origin story, the true characterization integrity within Eddie Brock/Venom is bombastic and extremely close to source material. The story alteration might even improve the overall direction of this new standalone Venom series because now we can truly focus on Brock/venom and not have Parker/Spiderman constantly take away from his attention. I believe we’ve had enough of Spiderman, and honestly after the travesty that was Homecoming imho, I’m fine with that for now. Venom starts off with a bang and we get some nice new aspects to how the symbiotes came to be in this earth as well as some great character development of Eddie Brock’s life before Venom. Let me just say that Tom Hardy Makes this entire film work with a completely passionately versatile performance showing immense acting talent like he always does. Once Eddie Brock achieves full symbiosis, it becomes an absolutely intense and fun experience to witness, and it really brought me back to the old comics. I’ve been a fan of venom for nearly 30 years and I can honestly say they nailed the relationship between Brock and venom, and it’s damn right awesome to see it on the big screen. The action never lets up after that and there were some insanely well done sequences full of amazing visuals. I honestly thought the CGI use for venom looked spectacular, and about as good as you could have it. The unexpected X factor of this film was it’s hilariously twisted dialogue between Brock and venom, and honestly at times it was almost charming in a way. While there were a few bits that were absolutely ridiculous I was able to overlook those few and far between moments. I thought Riz Ahmed what is a serviceable enough Carlton drake/riot, and played the conniving billionaire villain decently. I do think the plot was a bit rushed towards the end, but the finale was very exciting regardless. The post credit scene leaves you with an incredible sense of anticipation for the next venom installment as it introduces one of the most violent and brutal characters in all of comics. I did however think he was going to be in this film a lot more and was slightly disappointed ,but when I know what the future holds, I can forget about that slight nitpick. Another huge aspect of this film that breaks away from the safe MCU formula, is its sheer visceral brutality minus any blood really. They actually did a great job on a PG-13 rating making it still a very dark and violent film with some outstanding body horror sequences. I do really hope that they will go for an R rating for the sequel once carnage starts wreaking pure havoc. They would benefit so much from making it R rated. Overall an excellent origin tale,and a surprisingly funny film that deserves a ton of credit for going against the grain and breaking out of MCU formulas to start its own Venom universe. I cannot wait for the next film.",1
59,"This movie was just what should have been expected of it - quippy, chock-full of CGI, and a pretty good time to boot.  I specifically think that those viewers who are fans of the comic book character are going to like this.  I think, too, that people who like comic book movies are going to enjoy it as well.  If you arbitrarily need an R rating to justify your interest or enjoyment?  Well, you might not like it.",1
60,"""Venom"" is the best superhero movie I've seen in a long time, partly because it turns the superhero formula on its head. While good, I find The Dark Knight movies usually too intense and serious, while most Marvel movies are too tongue-in-cheek for my liking. It's interesting then that this film, about a character who looks like a demon from Hell, manages to strike that perfect balance between being dark, intense, and light humour. I walked out of the cinema smiling: I haven't had this good a time at the movies in a while. Part of that is because Venom, as a character, is so much fun: he is a real monster. He eats the brains of his foes and his voice could make the Predator wet himself. But it's not all dark and intense: Venom is *likeable.* He doesn't make quips; he's earnest. If Venom isn't telling the hero to eat the brains of villains he is egging the hero on to get back with his ex-girlfriend. That is *genius,* and this interest that Venom has in people leads to some fantastic moments in the movie. There's a scene where Venom convinces the hero to apologize to the ex, and the hero does so, ending resentment between the two. When this happens Venom says, completely unironically, ""Aw. That's nice.""I love Venom, the character, and watching him interact with the people around him is just as entertaining as the insane fight scenes where he is decimating whole teams of armoured, armed men (which are beautifully spectacular, by the way). Venom is charismatic and fascinating; I'd love to see more of him interacting with Eddie Brock (the film's protagonist character) and seeing the conversations they'd have. I have to commend the filmmakers on Venom's design: he is huge and brutal and he animates beautifully, from the saliva dripping from his lizard tongue to his creepy, bulbous eyes. Venom should always have that insane, rictus grin on his face; I never like seeing Venom in the comics without it. Having Venom wearing the grin throughout the movie was definitely the right way to go. Even the way Venom prowls and hurls himself through the city bleeds with character: Venom is originally a dark mirror to Spiderman, but while Spiderman swings gracefully, Venom proves he has his own brutal style just by the way he gets around.Tom Hardy is a great actor and his talent delivers the human element of the movie. He's played Bane in Batman and Max in Mad Max; here demonstrates further range by playing humorous scenes and the fish out of water character of Eddie Brock, who is utterly bewildered by becoming the host to Venom. Michelle Williams is great as Brock's ex; she is spunky and tough and Hardy and Williams work well together. But Venom steals the show. The chemistry between Venom and Brock is more interesting than the chemistry between Brock and the love interest.The opening of the film is somewhat slow, but they have a lot to set up. The post-credits scene features Brock meeting Cletus Cassidy, and Woody Harrelson is the most perfect choice to play the role, but the wig they gave Harrelson was ridiculous. But apart from that, I loved ""Venom,"" and I can't wait to see more. Hopefully it won't be too long before we get a sequel.",1
61,"Этот фильм точно не заслуживает 10 баллов. Но исходя из того что этот фильм просто убивают негативными отзывами я ставлю 10! ВЕНОМ ШИКАРЕН! Это вам говорю я, заядлый любитель супергеройской тематики. Не слушайте критиков, они лгут. Да к фильму можно придраться, но точно не настолько. Мой вердикт: 8,5/10 Я в восторге от всего что было в фильме. Начиная с саунд дизайна и музыкального сопровождения, заканчивая сценами после титров и хорошей игрой актеров. Каждое появление Венома на экране вызывает мурашки и ты максимально чувствуешь всю мощь этого симбиота. Такого я давно не испытывал. Жду продолжения!Как же жаль что сейчас можно просто завезти денег критикам и они без капли угрызений совести поставят фильму минималку. Да фильм действительно был слит за бабло и этому есть масса доказательств, которые вы сможете найти в интернете погуглив пару секунд.",1
62,"I give this movie a ten because of all the stupid ""critics"" giving this movie bad score. It deserves a 8/10. There are a lot of badass and hilarious moments as well as ""holy **** moments in this movie. Though I think the action need to be more intense and characters need to have more stake. At the end, I felt the movie was too short and ended abruptly. But after all, this is a solid movie and worth watching.",1
63,"idk  what the issue is here, i found it funny and it honestly felt like it just needed to be  longer. It was really great movie i loved the fight scenes with venom. Screw these negative reviews i am on board for the 2nd movie",1
64,"Not as bad as people said,even though the editing is dreadful(Justice League flashback),the story is very typical and they should have kept the R rating(Thanks Sony),at least Venom is far better than The 2 Amazing Spider Man movies with much better action scenes,and Tom Hardy is very likeable as Venom/Brock.The chemistry also works solidly and i had a good time watching Venom",1
65,"It's a mix of good and bad but no where near as bad as some critics say. Yes, I cringed at times and the pacing feels a bit off but the dynamic between Venom and Eddie is interesting and it's actually hilarious at times. There's defiantly a great (anti)superhero movie in there somewhere, it just doesn't quite work as a whole. Still, I can see this becoming a bit of a campy cult classic for a lot of people if only for Tom Hardys gloriously unhinged performance!",1
66,"Wow people don't read the duh mass critics on this! Venom is great, funny, entertaining and classic comic book style movie that makes total sense start to finish and doesn't try to be something it's not.Gotta believe this movie will have legs and lasting power beyond the theater release. Kids of all ages will immediately get the whole premise.",1
67,"This movie has some salvageable parts. Eddie Brock looks like he just woke up from the beginning of the movie when he's a successful reporter to the end of the movie where he's possessed by a parasite that makes him devour human flesh. Tom Hardy does a good job with a terrible script, and his dialogue to Venom become one of the few highlights in the film. The worst part is the performance from Reid Scott. It was a completely ham fisted and corny performance with a terrible script. Eddie's girlfriend also had some very weak performance.The movie is really violent for a pg-13 film, the death scene of a homeless person who was infected with a parasite was actually pretty disturbing, Venom/Eddie literally eats police officer's heads.. It's a strange but interesting movie and I hope they have a chance to rectify some of the mistakes and make the sequel.",1
68,"The dynamic between Eddie and Venom was interesting and very compelling — it would've been great to see more of that. With that being said, from about midway through the film and onwards, things progressed a little too quickly which did hinder the narrative's pacing and appeal.",1
69,Though not as bright and friendly like Spider-Man Venom still was an entertaining unique kind of film. Venom isn't quite supposed to be a comedic character but I guess that just adds a new unique personality to Venom's character. The symbiote effects are amazing and the fights scenes are intense and crazy. Even if its not connected to the MCU it was still a super fun ride to kick off a separate franchise and adventure.,1
71,"People are getting to much influenced by some ""critics"" and forgeting to see the movie by themselves. With that first, lets begin.This movie is awesome. Is better than you think.The story was made very well, with so much space to new movies with differents symbiontes. The beginning of the film is slow, like you know that at any minute everything is gonna blow up, but that is understandble for the plot and you have to wait. At the moment Eddie gets Venom, the story TRULY begins. Action scenes are awesome and with the rock soundtrack makes even better. Wait for the post credit scenes, if you is a comic book fan, your head's gonna explode.All the characters are good, some of them have more spotlights than others, but that is normal to all movies. Tom Hardy is incredible in his character as Eddie Brock and is AWESOME as Venom. The bond between then is the icing on the cake. The villain could be more intense, but I liked and convinced me. We are on an era of critic change the mind of people who not see the movie already. People critizes before go watch just because ""I saw in internet that was bad so now I think is bad too"". We need to change that. Count how many films you like that is bad in critics, how much movies of your childhood and youth and even in your adult life that people put a 0 when makes their review, and that review much of the time is just ""Its horrible, dont go see it"". The movie IS great, the actors ARE good, Venom IS AWESOME. But not trust me. GO TO THE MOVIES, go see it and make your vision with open mind, but if you go there thinking ""i read that is bad, so i'm gonna see already thiking is bad"", dont go. Stay home. Go see other movie. Movies are to make us forget about the **** world we live, to make us look and say ""holy moly, that was AWESOME"" or ""that was the most beautiful thing I ever saw"". They are there to make different views about things we never thought.Go to the movies, and make your own conclusions.",1
72,"We have to be aware that this movie had many problems, I'm going to the movie, it's entertaining, it has mistakes that can not be forgiven, but the movie is acceptable, although I wanted to see a more violent venom. 6.5 / 10",1
73,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot, tom hardy is excellent in the schizo role and the humour is on point. The action is innovative and fresh in how powers are used. It's good fun especially when venom starts to emerge. The plot is generic but so 95% of superheroe films. Go see it you'll have fun with a more edgy film than usual safe fare.",1
74,"I have no idea why critics hate this movie so much. Funny, entertaining, interesting, great fight scenes, perfect Tom Hardy performance. It looks like a great mix of Marvel and DC  movies.I really hope that critics were just wrong, but not paid for hatred. I'm gonna see it again on a big screen. Totally worth it.",1
75,"The best movie stand alone of a evil character, this is a real venom not like the venom of spiderman 3, im waiting the secuel whit carnage",1
76,"I had a really good time. The movie entertained me and thats what a film should do. Were there some problems? Yes, but overall the audience at my theater had fun, good laughs and by the end of the movie were open to see the sequel. I truly feel like Sony did good enough job to proof to the world that they do not need Spider-man in their Venom-Universe. The small problems with film were: editing, some cgi, some dialog. But for me it didn't take me out of the movie. Tom Hardy was amazing. I think that Sony needs to move with thier Venom-Universe and use the things that worked in Venom movie well and throw out the things that did not work. Thanks to Sony i got the Venom that I've always dreamed of seeing on the big screen. The movie is not perfect but its good enough....and thats what matters.",1
77,"My kids and I were smiling the whole movie!! The critics are smokin’ something on Venom reviews. 35 really?? I would honestly rate it about a 7.5, however I had to give it a 10 to balance the critics poor reviews. Yes it has flaws and was rushed a bit. That aside it was a blast to just sit back and enjoy!",1
78,"The movie turns the Hatred Brock in to a needly hero, one that besides have a charm, has a great chemistry with the parasitic alien.",1
79,"ok so it had issues. but here's the thing: they nailed venom. and in these days of ""creative liberty"", thats refreshing.  i feel like maybe they paid so much attention to venom that the rest of the movie wound up feeling bare, somewhat sparse. but most of the excessive negativity is uncalled for. give it a try, visually it wont dissapoint at all, and its a good if somewhat vague first entry into venoms universe. looking forward to the next two. bring on carnage!",1
80,"I'm ignoring the critics. They can go watch Topher Grace play Eddie Brock. I loved the movie. It's not an Oscar contender, true, but it's entertaining, fun, funny, and our group of 6 enjoyed it. People will pick everything apart in movies these days until they find nothing enjoyable about them. I'd rather enjoy myself and not expect perfection. I wanted fun, action, comical Venom and I got it. I'm happy. Bring on the sequel!",1
81,"Ok, just finished watching Venom. It was honestly fun and great entertainment, I really liked it a lot. I think the PG-13 rating was a great move, I saw kids having fun watching and adults enjoying the movie. At the end of the movie, I witnessed the entire audience clap...CLAP seriously its a good movie. These critics want to dissuade you from watching this movie, but I'm here to tell you that this movie was worth it in my opinion. I am a huge Spiderman fan and grew up reading the comics and enjoyed every minute of this movie. Tom Hardy did an amazing job at the character, he lightens the mood and was a great fresh start! Go see the movie it is fun and entertaining and a great watch, I'm getting the blu ray when it comes out",1
82,This movie was great! Interesting how all these 'critics' scored it low while majority of the public is 90% positive.,1
83,Venom is the Second best comic book movie of the year. Totally underrated..,1
84,"I really enjoy superhero movies. Most are over the top, but are enjoyable. Venom on the other hand is a disaster to watch. Its not enjoyable, you don't enjoy the ride you are on. There's so many plot holes, that you wonder why the people who made the movie would even allow to make such a bad movie?  The movie felt very rushed. I turned off my brain while watching Venom, but even with no brain? the movie is Terrible.",0
85,"No idea what movie everyone else saw. Is this film perfect, no.  Hardly any movie is ever perfect.  So, I really don't understand why this movie has so much hate.  But the film provided much character depth to Eddie Brock that allowed you to get to know his life, while still going forward with the movie.   While yes, Venom's backstoy leaves you wanting more, we do still get an idea of what his species is like, how they work, and overall what their goals are. That can easily be expanded on in the future. It was just under a 2-hour movie trying to cram together years of storyline from the comic books, and I felt like they were successful. Giving us a strong foundation, while still sitting up a future sequel.  The speed and action of the film was really consistent, without any dull moments.  My first and foremost major concern with the film was the lack of Spider-Man. however, the film did an excellent job of setting up a completely different origin Venom without the web Slinger that I can honestly say I am happy with.  It does not fit in our traditional sense of how Venom comes to be, but I find it truly acceptable.  ***Spoilers ahead***  the only major concerns I can see what the film is the sudden shift from the Symbiote wanting to Simply stay alive, and then turning sharply into wanting to stay on Earth with Eddie. Granted it was difficult to try and convey that thought process with so much else going on, I feel like at least a little bit more depth to it would have really helped the film.  but at least we did get somewhat of an understanding, and knowing that Venom is actually a weaker, and loser, among his species. So having the chance to shine and be a superior being for once, does answer some of those questions. A lot of people seem to be really confused about the medical examination results. And which Eddie is shown to be dying and the doctor believes that the Symbiote is killing him. While this is proven that other hosts were being slowly killed off by their symbiotes, those test subjects were not being properly fed. and also with Venom stating that the doctor did not know what he was talking about, and that he can cure it, gives away a lot of Clues. In the comic books, Eddie contracts a rare and deadly form of cancer. The cancer slowly eats away at his body and the only thing keeping him alive was the Venom symbiote. So I'm almost positive that the thing that is actually killing his body will turn out to be cancer and has nothing to do with Venom. plus, it is doubtful that Eddie had ever had such a massive examination before gaining the Symbiote. So it is highly unlikely that they would have ever even noticed cancer eating away his body prior to that.  Also, a lot of people are complaining about the fact that Venom was able to bond with other beings besides Eddie. However the bonding was only temporary to others. He had also gone through several hosts at this point, and probably learn to at least temporarily coexist with an inferior match.  Riot, however was a extremely different case. Yes, we saw him take on several hosts throughout the film but it was a completely different method. His hosts were more like prisoners. There was not a bonding process, and seem to be more like a possession. Which seem to fit his character very well, considering he was like a general among his species and one of the strongest. He apparently did not need to have a perfect host in order to bond. it was not until the end of the film that he actually found a kindred spirit and the two of them were able to work together.  Beyond these minor issues, the film did not have many. For some reason, the critics have chosen to be extremely harsh on this film. I don't know if it's because people in general seem to hate Sony films, or if the reviewers have become jaded with superhero films all together. Regardless, I suggest to everyone go watch the movie.",1
86,"First off, I am a MASSIVE Venom fan. I am reviewing this movie for what it is, a COMIC BOOK Movie.I feel my love for Venom surpasses anyone I've encountered in person or otherwise. I have read every venom comic I discovered and own most of them in loosies. Not to mention the $1000+ in statues and action figures I own.I gave this movie a metacritic score of 2 out of 10. This accounts for two things they got right in the movie. They cast Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and the symbiote came from space. That's where the parts I enjoyed, ended.The most successful comic book movies, in my opinion, have been those movies who have been most loyal to the source material. This ""Venom"" movie deviated far from that. -I am a Venom fan first, but I am sorry, there is no Venom without Spider-Man being tied to Venom's Origin. You don't get the full appreciation of Venom without seeing the stark contrast of how the two do business. Not to mention how Spider-Man effectively ruined both the symbitoe and Eddie Brock's lives (in their eyes) turning them into one of his most devout arch-nemesis.-They changed the very principles of the symbiotes to be ""mind controlling"" parasites. -The very look of Venom isn't correct because of the lack of his signature white spider. (This was explained by the creative team that it was due to a lack of Spider-Man. God, it is almost like they were on to something for a moment.)-The supporting cast for Tom Hardy was chosen very poorly. Just plain not interesting, didn't suit the roles.-The relationship with his ex-wife was far too kind. In comics his relationship with Anne is mostly horrible. -End Credit scene teasing Carnage. Woody Harrelson looks more like carrot-top than Cletus Kasady. With this being said, I think Woody IS a solid pick to play the part.There is so many more issues I had with this movie, but most probably won't get this far into my review, so I'll end it here.I wished for this movie since I was a young child. I'm extremely disappointed that this is the result. It truly felt like the creators read little to none of the source content.",0
87,"I really enjoyed it. Hardy is terrific. Everything about the movie is exactly what I expected and there were even a few surprises thrown in. I especially liked the some of the snappy dialogue and humor between Venom and Brock. Go see it, the critics are wrong",1
88,"'' From where I come from I'm kinda of a loser too ''That line of dialogue of the Symbiote told me everything I needed to know about this film and in terms of blockbusters Venom is definitely the biggest disappointment I've had this year.Sony's greed was bigger than quality and instead of allowing Marvel to exploit the character inside the MCU - One of Spider-Man's biggest foes - they decided to make easy money making a film of him without Spider-Man. Success right?But no, now we have just another discouraging film in the superhero genre. If it wasn't for Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed, this film would have been a disaster of epic proportions.Generic plot. Bad visual effects. Lousy music. Simplistic performances. Yes, a total failure.And right now I say it. Morbius will be another failure. But will Sony learn? **** no.",0
89,"Фильм зашел!!! Офигенная игра Тома Харди в союзе с Веномом. Сюжет интересный и не такой однозначный, как кажется в первое время. Шутки Венома просто в тему. Есть проблемы с графикой Венома, но они не такие значительные на фоне всего остального. Баллов 8 баллов этот фильм заслуживает!)",1
90,This isn't so bad i don't know what people were complaining about the action is good apart from maybe the 3rd act but a lot of good superhero movies have a bad 3rd act and the dark humor and the relationship between Eddie and Venom is very good and interesting. Overall wasn't a bad movie and is kind of a good movie,1
91,"Medium well movie. Tom Hardy is wonderful, Venom is impressive, Venom's CGI is excellent. The plot is weak, but the humor perfectly compensates for the lack of expected gloom in the film. Stan Lee is best in the end. No blood for all time",1
92,"Мне фильм Веном понравился он не плохой порадовали спец эффекты и звуковое сопровождение, порадовало что главный герой и Веном как то общаются и шутят. Сюжет неплохой. Персонажей более-менее описали в общем фильм не плохой 7.4 из 10",1
93,"Honestly do not listen to what the critics are saying about this film! Don't get me wrong I am not saying its the next darknight or anything like that  but what I am saying is that its really quite a nice ride. Venom is a breath of fresh air as compared to the usual superhero formula were used to seeing today. It separates itself quite nicely from the MCU superhero films however it does not separate itself for the sake of separation. Venom stays true to the character in a way which not only is a joy for the comic fans but the average movie goers as well. Venom is different in that it has two different tones which coincide with Eddies personality and Venom's personality. Its truly a pleasure to watch the chemistry and interactions between these two. In venom you will be laughing at times then in others wandering if you should scream, laugh or cheer because the scene is so damn cool. Venom is a pleasure to watch and if you go and see it in the theaters I guarantee you will come out satisfied.",1
95,I thought it was fantastic. Tom Hardy was excellent as always. Venom's portrayal was amazing. Great action with just the right amount of dark. The mid-credits scene has me very excited. Hopefully all the haters don't screw that up for all the people who enjoyed it.,1
96,Action and fun. What I expected and exactely what I got. Laughed a lot and liked it a lot,1
98,en lo personal venom me gusto pero si tienes sus fallas en el guion pero no deja de ser entretenida  y no se por atacaron tanto a esta película,1
99,"Feeling and meaning gives rise to the action and CGIThroughout the movie they let you understand and feel Brock's character, the people he cares about and why.When he merges with the symbiote Venom we experience the strangeness of merging with this other form of life. The symbiote has adapted to survival as have we. It share's the hosts mind and fortunately the person he inhabits is a true hero, one who sacrifices for the greater good. This gives the symbiote a chance to learn something more important for survival than selfishness and responding to fear.",1
100,"This movie is far from perfect, but as it is one of the first super movies who is trying something new while still bringing high quality action and humour it is definitely worth seeing.",1
101,"Dont trust the critics, movie is great, full of action, fun. Its a great movie. Dont know why so many people are bashing it.",1
102,I do not understand why the critics attacked this film. It is a good movie for family viewing. Fully enjoyed the game of Tom Hardy and was pleased with the view.,1
103,"I came into this expecting to be disappointed, and I was. This movie has terrible action scenes, really bad pacing and average acting. The plot doesn't make sense most of the time and overall the movie is boring. The theater I was in was empty, I can see why. Save your money and time and leave this movie alone. Venom is one of the worst movies iv'e ever seen.",0
104,omfg this movie is so epic. I wish venom could live in me so he could solve my erectile dysfunction issues. Every day I wake up wishing I could have morning wood but I'm as soft as my grandmama. Venom is the only person who can get me hard anymore,0
105,"Bad movie, almost everything about this movie is bad. The story doesn't hold but some scenes were still watchable.",0
106,"Venom is definitely one of the better Marvel movies. Funny, intense, and even quite emotional, the film definitely kept me entertained throughout. The movie was way too short though and it did feel very rushed. However overall, Tom Hardy’s amazing acting and the brilliant action sequences left me satisfied.",1
107,"I thought that this movie was highly entertaining. Bringing one of my all time favourite characters to life. Definitely one to watch and I’d give it a 7 or an 8. The only reason I’ve given this a 10 is to be unreasonable, as the critics and haters are being with this movie.",1
108,"amazing movie love tom hardy role in it is awesome , all fight sequences are amazing ,don't understand why critics hating it so much enjoy as much as ant man and the wasp",1
109,"Great movie, very entertaining, very good visual effects and venom and tom hardy are the cane",1
110,"The movie is fun, you are just mean. Isn't the movie of your life, but Tom Hardy makes a great job.",1
111,This movie's critics almost made me not go see the movie. I'm glad I didn't listen because this movie was a very good entertainment. It's not perfect but I enjoyed every bit of it.,1
112,"I went into the theater expecting to see a mediocre movie but I got an awesome one instead! Don't listen to the critics, if you like superhero movies go watch it you won't be disappointed!",1
113,"Venom is a fun movie. It's not groundbreaking,and it could be a bit funnier,but it's a nice origin movie for a character most people don't know,and it does him justice",1
114,"It's not that bad. Venom is pretty entertaining, although it feels like Sony studios is trying a little too hard to emulate recent Marvel successes and ends up forcefully (and awkwardly) injecting slapstick into the film. The plot is on par with Black Panther, which is to say that it's just meh. My greatest complaint is that the CGI Venom looks kinda weird. It doesn't seem buff enough, and yet somehow the head seems too small for the body.",1
116,This was a fun comic book movie. It was funny and better than the only other live action venom we have gotten,1
117,"Great movie!!! I saw the movie yesterday and for me it's a 10/10, good story, entertaining and with good fighting moments. I do not understand the critics. I look forward to a second part!!",1
118,"The ratio of uninfluenced users who liked the movie,  proves this movies has spark and this critics scorecard is void.",1
119,Venom was a great time. Too much developing Eddie Brock made the relationship between him and Venom seem rushed. The action and special effects were great. Story was ok but nothing special. Venoms motivation was very weak also,1
120,"There are a catalogue of problems with Venom, both conceptually, visually, and structurally, but all things considered it is worthy of your time. Tom Hardy has proven once again that he has a flair for playing unhinged characters, and his performance is the sticky, viscous substance holding this hot mess together. It’s far from perfect, but with the humour injected by the exchanges between Brock and Venom (both played by Hardy) Venom is undeniably entertaining. It’s not quite the childhood reminiscathon we’d hoped for, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction. Thanks, Tom!",1
121,"Cinematography: 6/10 I feel like I'm watching an outline instead of a full story; I'm watching the happenings of set plot points but I'm not experiencing the connecting lines. Costume Design: 6.821/10 Alright: I'm not exactly experiencing  Cosplaying at it's finest here, but - that's what the Visual Effects are for - right? Film Editing: 6.712/10 I feel like I'm watching blotching happening.Make-up and Hair-styling: - /10 N/ASound Editing: 8.621/10 Solid. Visual Effects: 8.349/10 Decent. I want to see more of Klyntar.Story: 7/10 (Sigh) Interactions between different cultures may naturally be funny which is a small part of the reason Venom needs more Klyntar. Eddie Brock is not Peter Parker and feels ehhh without Peter Parker. I feel like the story should branch from Klyntar - but, as the story is - it's alright.Acting: 7/10 I feel like the acting partners are working with what they have in front of them. I think if I want to see the actors blossom, they will do so in Klyntar. Cause really I think they should be vessels… for Klyntar, a whole different conversation may ensue then. Personal: I rather watch a film about Klyntar than a film about Eddie Brock without Peter Parker as an introduction to Venom. The idea of Venom is so poetic that so much more may be done with it than has been. Venom makes me appreciate Spider-Man a lot more now. The film Upgrade comes to mind when I'm watching Venom (thinking of recent films with symbiont types). I feel like the film is attempting to take on a noble cause and does not really resolve anything. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is looking real interesting, and, I don't think they're going to be talking about Klyntar (hint-hint). Overall: 7.214/10-K.D.If you're into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest.",1
122,"I've thought this movie will be a full trash, but this film is gorgeous. Yes, it has flaws: darky picture to spare money from the budget on CGI and PG13 rating, because Sony was unsure, can they do a good anti-superhero movie. But they did. R rating could brings us a movie like Deadpool. I hope Sony will understand it. Don't listen to critics, go to cinema and give Venom a chance.",1
123,"The film in a whole good. In fact, the main drawbacks are timing and lack of cruelty.",1
124,"A fun movie that returns to the pre-grey wash Winter Soldier days of superhero movies.Some great cinematography (punctuated by a proper colour grade) lifts the broken elements into an enjoyable popcorn flick. Hardy is fantastic onscreen (lobsters) and I found myself involuntarily laughing at a lot of the humour. It's not Dr Strange' Beyonce cringe jokes and it's not Deadpool 4th wall humour. It's not great, but Venom never had to be. I'm a 6.5 but will let it round up for Metacritic.",1
126,I thought it was a nice movie with good humor and a lot of action the story could be better but definitely worth it,1
127,Slow to start but is definitely entertaining in the second half. The character of venom was correctly portrayed this time.,1
128,"A really good movie, at least for a non-comic book fan. The story is cool, the movie has a good balance between action, comedy, and darkness.Definitely not as bad as critics said.",1
129,"Hardy rocks the role of Eddie Brock and Venom adding life to a lifeless character.  The plot may not be perfect, but works within the realm of the marvel character and does justice to the subject.  I gladly look forward to any sequel.",1
130,"I definitely do not understand the critics. For me it was better than Black Panther, which was really boring.",1
131,I had a great time watching this film. You will laugh a lot and go on a cool ride with Venom.,1
132,"Объективная оценка фильму 6,5-7,но ставлю 8 за абсолютно не объективно заниженные оценки от критиков. Если честно, я ожидал чего-то сверх, типо ""Логана"". Но! Фильм хорош, Том Харди отыгрывает на все 100,идеально сыгран персонаж. Графика достойная. Сюжет на среднем уровне, хотелось бы ещё минут 10-15 хронометража. Для поклонников ""Марвел"" обязателен к просмотру. P.S. Больше не верю оценкам критиков. Они всякому шлаку ставят оценки выше.",1
133,"Critics have certainly not seen the right movie. The movie should not be exactly like Lethal Protector, it's an adaptation and has its flaws, but it's definitely not as bad as they say",1
134,"This movie IS AWSOME, it is worthy to watch, because it is a great movie, with a good reason.",1
135,"You know, these critics are really something. They gave the snoozer 'a bore is starred' like a 90 and this movie a 38??? wtf? i went in with zero expectations and found it to be entertaining and funny in a DEAD POOL meets THE HULK kind of way. This had moments and is definitely worth the watch if you like sci-fi, super hero kind of movies.",1
136,I never read what the critics say. This is a very entertaining movie. I'm giving it an 8. A few of the jokes were on the corny side but venom is played rather well. Go see it!!!,1
137,"This superhero movie was very different and had an intelligent motivation for the villain and Venom, which I love.  The many different parts of the movie are all entertaining and the diversity of what each part contains, creates a good mixture for a movie experience.  My brother didn't like it because he thought the beginning was too slow and long, but I thought it was all part of a good plot and I liked everything except for the relationship scenes.",1
138,"This movie is getting far too much flak for what it is; After having to deal with the mundane and repetitive nature of MCU movies for as long as I have, it really is a breath of fresh air to see something absolutely different like Venom. Sure, the pacing at times can be jarring, and the decision by which Venom becomes an Antihero rather than a villain is understandably vague, but I'd like to think of this movie as thus; Parasyte got away with largely the same story as this and was praised up and down, but what Parasyte has that Venom lacks is the human element; Eddie did not have the same sort of realizations about life and mortality as Satou had in Parasyte, the closest thing we had was Eddie's apology to Ann and the following events that took place because of it; In these interpersonal moments that litter the film (which is a good thing), you see the true chemistry between Eddie and Venom unfold. Those said moments are what make the film memorable, far more than the final battle or the police chase; The mundane, almost wacky bond Eddie and Venom share as they learn to live with one another.",1
139,"I'm still Amazed by the Movie, i admit i had the fear that it's was goin' to disappoint...But it was PERFECT, the Kid in me is Happy! The Adult is Pleased!For me it was a Solid 10/10Perfect retelling of Venom without Spidey first.For me it made it more interesting~And i really Bonded (heh) with the CharactersGot that goodie feelin' in mah Belly the whole movie~Don't understand the Low Scores, but i do try to respect non-hating low reviews!It is My Favorite Movie of 2018 so far!10/10",1
140,"8/10, actually. 10/10 just for... gtfo, fake-critics and Gaga fans. Thank you Sony, very cool! /trump/",1
141,"Saw the movie today and truly loved it.  After hearing about the poor critic reviews I was worried because I was so looking forward to seeing Tom Hardy in this role.  Silly me, I forgot, all critic reviews these days (or maybe they always were) are just so out of touch with reality.  Starting to believe the conspiracy theories that they are all fake or paid for.  The movie had a great plot, I'm fairly sure there was a Terminator 2 reference. It wasn't too long. I wanted it to keep going.  The relationship with Eddie and Venom was fun. I can't wait for the next one.  I recommend you see it.",1
142,"I really liked this movie. Plenty of strong action scenes, a faithful representation of the original character and his (their?) personality. It's a hundred times more entertaining and watchable than Spider-man 3's version of Venom. Even without Spider-man as part of the origin, the details of the symbiote's beginnings are well-explained. I love that Venom is an anti-hero, like he was always intended to be, rather than a straight villain or straight hero. Tom Hardy is the man. I'm looking forward to the next one!",1
143,"A much better movie than the reviews suggest. It's nice to see one of Spider-Man's iconic anti-heroes getting his own film, and it did not disappoint me one bit when I saw it. Humorous lines? Check. Good action scenes? Check. The CGI that made Venom look real? Check. It's a must-see. And big praise to Tom Hardy's acting. It was near flawless.",1
144,"I was pretty excited about this once it was announced that Tom Hardy would be playing the titular character in this film. However, I gotta say that while it's no fault of Hardy's (he did the best with what he was given), the film ended up being pretty average to me overall, with mediocre effects during several moments, very rushed plotting and pacing, and a lot to be desired.",1
145,"Going in to this movie I was aware of fake reviews from lady gaga fans trying to destroy the hype. I was also aware that the movie had issues with not having Spiderman in it, seeing that Venom is a dark version of Spiderman and Spiderman is an essential character in the original story. I was also aware that this movie was about a black jelly creature from space. Going in I had relatively low expectations and a bottle of Vodka. Some critics have complained about an inconsistent tone in this, a move about black jelly from space. Did anyone go to see this movie to measure the consistency of it's tone, and feel dissatisfied because there were both scary scenes and jokes? I think some of the critics had unreasonable expectations of what is essentially a B-Movie with a big budget. The space jelly is not great CGI but, who is to say what space jelly looks like, maybe it looks like CGI? It took me out of the movie the first time I saw it but I was OK with it by the end. The main antagonist is overshadowed by one of the most selfish and nasty girlfriends in history, I was hooked to see whether Eddie would retaliate to her insensitive actions and wondered if she was going to be revealed as a supervillain herself. What makes this movie good is Tom Hardy's performance as the only two characters that matter in this movie. Brock and Venom have distinct, compelling characters and there is a subtle but clever merging of personalities as they spend time together. A large portion of the movie explores their relationship and this is a real strength. Hardy joked that his best part of the movie was everything that was cut from the movie, I wonder if there will be an R rated cut of this? I would love to see more and hope that the teased sequels happen. If you want to see a movie in which alien slime controls Tom Hardy's brain, if that appeals to you, then you will really like this movie. If you think it is far fetched or silly, maybe this is not the movie for you.",1
146,"I was a little worried about the critics, but I went to see Venom anyway, because I wanted to since first trailer went out.The plot could be better. The movie had potential to be better overall, but it does enough to entertain you. It's enjoyable, has some good jokes, awesome CGI and actions scenes, and amazing performance from Hardy.Go see it and have fun! Don't be a **** ;)",1
147,"Entertaining, funny and ridiculous. Go in expecting an ""extreme"" throwback comic book movie with plenty of laughs and you will enjoy it.",1
148,This is a good movie with good graphics. I also really liked the humor. The film suggest,1
149,"Not bad film with some good jokes and excellent actor Tom Hardy. Symbiote has charisma, own position in this history. I like director`s work with camera position and gamma in Venom. Film have little defects but its awesome. The worst is PG-13(",1
150,"Посмотрев фильм, у меня были смешанные чувства, скорее всего из-за завышенных ожиданий, так как фильм основан на комиксах Venom: Lethal Protector и Venom: Separation Anxiety я надеялся что в фильме смогут показать и раскрыть каждого из отпрысков венома, но в итоге показали только одного антагониста. Сюжет фильма можно было узнать посмотрев пару трейлеров, но и были моменты которые приятно удивили. Также стоить отметить довольно не плохой юмор в фильме, но к сожалению его слишком много, и хотелось бы чтобы фильм был посерьёзнее. В целом фильм не так уж и плох как его раскритиковали, пусть он и заслуживает 7/10, но я поставлю ему 10 надеясь что снимут достойное продолжение.",1
151,"I was shocked that this film have so low rating, i really enjoyed this film,its funny and cool,the actors and ""characters"" are saving the film, you feel them,of course its not the best film, there are a lot of stupid things but they dont make the film worse!!! why its raiting now is 3?? that's stupid i just hope that there will be second film with these actorsi love it,really i enjoyed every min of this film",1
152,"I think that the film is quite good. Not without flaws, but still. The plot is full of clichés and understatements, but this does not prevent it from being an interesting and rather funny movie.",1
153,Entertaining movie. Acting by Tom Hardy is superb. No idea why they criticize it. I would say one of the better movies of Marvel currently,1
154,"I was apparently absent when the memo was being handed out describing why exactly we were all supposed to hate this movie pre-release.....So anyways - I went in ready to be disappointed, but was actually pretty surprised to find out that all of the complaints I had heard about were severely blown out of proportion. Honestly, most of the negative reviews seem to be rather petty or just bandwagoners.If you are a fan of comic book movies (casual or hardcore) then you will most likely enjoy this adaptation. Go see it for yourself before judging!",1
155,"Ожидал фигни после такой разгромной критики, но на самом деле кино очень даже неплохое. Начало довольно скомканное и сцены быстро меняются, видно, что вырезали куски, но затем повествование выравнивается и начинается довольно неплохой экшен, приправленный хорошим юмором. Смотреть было интереснее чем того же Человека-муравья, который оценили гораздо выше. С рейтингом R действительно было бы получше, зря Сони сдрейфили.",1
156,"Awesome film! Don't listen what critics say, go out and enjoy this film! Tom Hardy was awesome in this film!",1
157,"I can't believe the negativity this movie is getting. It was a delight seeing Venom in action. The origin story (though changed) did a good enough job explaining it all for my liking. Tom Hardy did a great job bringing the character to life. It's not entirely the comic Eddie, but enjoyable all the same. The humor is funny in an adult way, not the light Marvel humor. Great fight scenes. I'd definitely go back for more if a sequel is made. People are just happy to be negative about a Sony movie without the involvement of Marvel.",1
158,"After watching this movie, I was embraced by different emotions. Basically it was both joy and sadness and bewilderment ... but what went wrong?To begin with, I want to say that I am a big fan of this character and have read quite a few comics about the spider-man and venom. When I found outSolo Venom, then I was in seventh heaven with happiness. The day before the release, the first reviews of the film from ""promising"" critics appeared on the Internet.When I saw the evaluation of the film on Metacritic - it was 33/100, then I was very puzzled ... however, I took the white for 4 days, so I had to go anyway!Therefore, here I want to describe my emotions from this film.I want to start with the plot: it is not too much here. On the one hand, Sony did not have to suffer in order to come up with a complicated story for the entire audience, but on the other hand,Other aspects of the film were sold: patterned characters and the absence of normal motivation of the characters. I was dismayed by the way the story goes: in the film, the symbiote is already Venom(I hope that the fans will understand me.), but this was done due to the fact that the spidy was not. I was also embarrassed by the fact that he was suddenly, in the middle of a movie from an evil symbioteturned into good (Script of God?). In general, a lot of shortcomings ... Go to Venom for the sake of the plot ... well, this is such a thing for yourself.The special effects did not let us down, but many flaws could be seen: there was a lot of soap in the action scenes in order to smooth the graphics (personally, this is my opinion), but Venom himself told meliked it. Of course, we laughed with friends over the flaws in the effects, but this is a completely different story.Separately, I want to tell you about the humor in the film: it delivers. But ... the film seems to be positioned as a horror, and not as a comedy :D, but for me it’s still a plus.Well, the cherry on the cake is the relationship of Eddie and Venom. Here the guys tried because of all the forces. Yes, and as a fan of this, I was very pleased!As a fan, I'm basically happy with these films, but I have a few questions left ... but if you are not a fan and you went to this film just like that, then get readyto the fact that he can quickly get bored with you, or this character can interest you (it already depends on your preferences) :)Lastly, I would like to say that the film, of course, is not a masterpiece. Yes, he has a lot of problems. But I don’t want Sony to turn a blind eye to all these problems in the future,and would listen to how to improve the quality of their future films.If you are interested in this character, but you are afraid to go to the cinema because of bad reviews, then I would advise you to go to this movie and have your opinion already.P.S. I didn’t like that many critics refer to the comparison of Marvel's films such as Avengers:Infinity War and Black Ponter. I can understand that the Infinity Warasked a high level of movie comics, but in the case of Venom: 1. He doesn’t have such a big budget; 2. For the film, they didn’t Marvel, but Sony ... so it’s not quite clear to me:why they say that this is the crappy Marvel movie ever, although it was made by Sony.",1
159,"Fantastic, a really fun movie that stayed true to the character. Venom is a compelling character without spiderman, and maybe spiderman will show up later. It's fun, funny and a good time.",1
160,Alright the critics are hating it but it is definitly a good one to see. I doubt that anyone who goes to see it will not have a fun time,1
161,"Who cares about the Critics, Enjoyed every minute of the movie, will go to see again in the theater.",1
162,I just saw this movie last night and im super disgusted by the reviews... I looooved this movie. It especially better than that overhyped black panther movie that was meh.. No forced humor or corny lines. It was very entertaining and tom hardy did a great job. The only thing that I could see people not liking is it takes a bit for the movie to get going but I didn't care. Good character development. The plot of the movie was pretty simple but who cares. this is a marvel movie. If your a person that likes action from the beginning like the tards giving it a 6 then this isn't your movie. If your someone that likes great acting with good humor and decent amount of action then this is for you.,1
163,"This movie is Not that Bad. It funny, got some action Scene and love interest. The Interaction  of Eddie and Venom is Great and Steal the Shows. Dont belive those Critics .it not the best superhero movie but it by Far not the worst one !",1
164,"I really don't get the hate from critics. Maybe cause they sold it as a horror flick? I find it goofy fun, ironically in the same cheesy vein as the Predator movies.  It wasn't marvel quality, but it was nice and venom looks GOOD.",1
165,"To hell with the critics. The film came out interesting and positive, far exceeded my expectations. Liked much more recent marvel movies.I advise you to view.",1
166,"First of all, I m so happy to see that Venom is blasting itself to sky with its record breaking openings Worldwide! Take that reviewers! This is my first review and I m only writing because I saw all the negative and unfair reviews. Makes me wonder if Marvel has something to do with it? (blink blink.. wink)The movie was absolutely entertaining and we had so much fun! I wanted more! Tom Hardy has given a great performance as both a loser, broke Eddie Brock and Venom. It was a great Origin story. The villain was okay, but atleast he was better than most MCU villains (hello Whiplash, Mandarin, Red skull, Malekith) I wish we had more scenes with different Symbiotes , but it was okay. The got a great intro to Eddie Brock, his life's struggle, how he adopts to the new found power from outerspace. It has its share of flaws, but ultimately it was entertaining and in the end that's what I paid for! The so called ""Pro"" reviewers are being completely unfair and honestly need to stop comparing every movie to a Dark Knight or MCU movie!",1
167,"I love it, I didn't expect anything good cause the reviewers, but is a good movie to introduce venom, because not everyone knows him, I would prefer more violence but I really like it",1
168,"Venom is WAY better than most of these negative reviews are saying.  It is a fantastic, but quick, ride to the introduction of Venom in the MCU.  It was obvious why Sony went PG13 so they had some kind of way of HOPEFULLY getting Venom in a Spider-Man film or vice versa BUT even with the PG13 rating you still get what makes Venom fun...... A friggin comic book character biting off people's heads!!!.....literally, in the movie he is eating people on screen.Venom had a ton of fun moments including the standout introduction of Venom fully formed on screen using powers of all sorts.  The inevitable comedic moments were great, and one may be the funniest comedic moment of ALL comic book films for me on screen when Venom asks Eddie to jump from a high building.  It actually made me laugh out loud, along with just about all the other movie goers there with me, maybe 20 people at a Monday 11am showing.The ending setup for a future villain is amazing due to their INCREDIBLE casting of Venom's biggest, most sadistic villain.  This movie is fantastic good fun and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel.",1
169,"One of the worst movies in recent years. No effort was made to make anything resembling something pretty or even cleverly entertaining for someone over 8 years old.Like almost any popcorn flick coming out from hollywood in the last decade this movie was manufactured using the standard issue blueprint to make it a success in China, Russia and especially among the Social Media generation for whom having an independent thought is like some sort of spiritual death. You know, the kind of people who see any product placement or ridiculous fake ""stand against the man"" social/awareness commentary as a validation of their world instead of some basic trick by a marketing team to make kids feel validated by this product.",0
170,"Хороший фильм, смотрел на одном дыхании, отличная игра актеров и классные спецэффекты, куча отборного юморка, в общем стоит того, что бы сходить на часок в кино и глянуть этот великолепный фильм.",1
171,"Really good movie! I don't understand critics... Not so polished like Marvel movies, but really good one anyway. A lot of nice humor, some nice action. Recommended! PS. If you want more movies like this - try ""Upgrade""; great movie with amazing fightchoreography.",1
175,"Group of four, 2 females 2 males went to see Venom despite movie critics.Movie was simply great - Tom Hardy did an amazing job, the humor is very balanced nothing cringe like we are used to see nowadays, all four of us loved it and I even registered here just to disagree with the criticism. My first rating here and hopefully I will come back to rate the part 2 of Venom movie.Definitely recommend to watch.",1
180,"With the low rating of the critics i didnt expect much of the feeling, after seeing the movie i was pleasant suprised and actualy realy enjoyed this movie. Great action scenes, actors did an incredible job, the humour was nicely pased. Great movie to watch in a theatre!",1
181,"This Venom movie is absolutely brilliant.The critics are full of feces, they are too high up their butts and forgot what going to the cinema is all about: having a laugh and an exciting time watching a good flick.",1
182,"I found this movie quite fun and entertaining. Of course, the story is quite typical to superhero movies and does not bring anything new really, but the comedic elements were interesting and the actions shots were decent too. Plus Tom Hardy is great as an actor.",1
183,"Not too sure what film the critics watched on this occasion but a 3.5 out of 10 this film is not.The film overall is standard comic book movie stuff, I can see if your a fan of the source material you may be somewhat disappointed but judged on its' own it is an enjoyable film with solid performances from the cast all round, Hardy in particular does a great turn during Brock's more unhinged moments and the action sequences are well put together, the CGI can be a bit jarring at times but not enough to really detract from the film.The interactions between Venom and Brock are equal parts funny and menacing which is even more amusing when you consider both are played by Hardy.I won't go into spoiler territory but suffice to say this isn't Citizen Kane and if you went in expecting that it would be that's more of a you problem than any failing of the film, as I say I understand people upset that this isn't a faithful adaptation of the source material but the fact remains this is a solidly enjoyable comic book film well worth your time and money.",1
185,"The Critics are only being Movie Critics, and not movie fans or comic fans. If you are a Comic Book fan, Venom is fun movie that got it right with non-canon origin story. They did it right with not having Spider-Man in the film. If you are a movie fan, it was a fun story that told a point of view of an Anti-Hero on the TV as a street reporter and then an Anti-Hero with a man eating symbiote attached. I cannot wait for Venom 2 with Carnage!!!",1
190,"Not the best marvel movie, but far from the worst. Was enjoyable enough and surprisingly one of the few superhero movies my wife actually enjoyed watching too. After the abysmal critic reviews I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised. plenty of action and good CGI and a relatively fun movie to watch.",1
191,"Imagine a cross between “Batman Begins” and “Guardians of the Galaxy”. This was a slightly darker film, probably because Sony was in charge versus the more familiar MARVEL partner, Disney. I really appreciated this fun and unusual combination though, and I am super excited for the sequel. This movie was fantastic and I would highly recommend it to any superhero movie fan.",1
192,"It was not a perfect film, but also it was not bad. Bad rating, i mean pg-13 better will be with 18 but for first time its ok",1
193,"Movie is not bad. 3 of 10? Are you crazy? Yes, this movie is no masterpiece, but it's not bad. I enjoyed it and It's main criteria. Stop hate it, it's cute and fun!",1
194,"I understand what the critics are saying and I also get what the audience is saying, generally speaking. Critics are looking for Cap Winter Soldier or something of the likes and the audience is just looking for a good time. This can be worth a ticket at your theater or if you are mixed just give it a bit and watch it through a streaming service. It is a fun ride and Tom Hardy and Venom talking together is alot of fun. I would be okay with Venom 2. With or without Spidey. Obviously I would prefer Spiderman for fun but it isn`t necessary the way this Venom is set up.",1
200,"It might not be an elaborate storytelling masterpiece, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again.",1
201,"I really liked this movie. It was fun and totally funny. There are some bad moments, but they are immediately out shadowed by the good moments, but this movie is really good, and my favorite movie of 2018.   9.8/10",1
203,As a non-comic fanboy or massive fan of comic book based movies I found this to be a refreshing take on the usual formula for superhero movies. Tom Hardy did a fantastic job and overall I wasn't disappointed.  Looking forward to the next one!,1
204,"Okay I thought that the movie was fine. It was good, but not as good as I wanted it to be.",1
206,"To be honest, I didn't want to watch this movie. This was no small part due to the critics ripping this movie apart. I also did not like any of the trailers that I watched. Needless to say I went in with zero expectations but left wanting for a sequel. It was funny, action packed and overall a thrill from beginning to end (including the animated spidy short after the credits) It really reminded of deadpool or guardians of the galaxy; obviously not as good but enough to keep me engaged. My suggestion, see it for yourself. It's a good movie.",1
207,"The action sequences were awesome, and the humor was just the right amount. The story lacks a little but I didn't go see this for Cohen brothers style plot.",1
208,"LoL for people complaning about a comic adaptation being different from the original.The movies is not a 10 it's an 8, but there was so may ridiculously written critics that I'm giving 10 just to bump this movie up.",1
209,"Venom is a bit of a mishmash of good and bad ideas, but ultimately I was entertained.Odd attempt at a New York accent aside, Tom Hardy was pretty likable as down-on-his-luck reporter Eddie Brock. The chemistry between him and Venom, an alien symbiote, is surprisingly good considering that half the time Venom is just a voice in Brock's head. Heck, the inhuman, cannibalistic creature is rather charming and funny.Venom looks great too. I was worried, because the original comic design wasn't the easiest thing to adapt to live-action, but they really nailed it here. Venom is this 'roided goo creature with a shark mouth and he looks great. The action is inventive. Director Ruben Fleischer has a good eye for scenery and lighting; there's one scene in the woods that is particularly well-shot.On the other hand, the film waits far too long to introduce Venom. There were a lot of parts that could've been cut or shortened. The main villain is super-weak, both in performance, dialogue, and general competence. Justice League's Steppenwolf, Thor: the Dark World's Malekith, and X-Men's Apocalypse were all stronger villains that this. Jenny Slate as a scientist is given nothing but trash dialogue. Whenever the scene is on these two, you're desperately wishing they'd go back to Brock.This is isn't a perfect film, but I walked in expecting to be entertained and I was.P.S. Be sure to stay through all the credits.",1
210,"OK, It's not a marvel official movie but...is good!! I really had fun at the movies with this film, the relation between eddie and venom was so funny.APPROVED!",1
211,"The movie is quite enjoyable. I went to the cinema expecting an awful (due to the critics reviews), and I ended up watching a funny, with just enough actions scenes, movie. Go watch it yourself, the movie is not as bad as they say.",1
212,A bland and predictable story line and semi-shallow characters takes away from what is otherwise a very entertaining film. There's much to pick apart but if you switch off your mind then you'll enjoy this action romp.,1
213,"The critics are being really unfair to this one.  I don't know what they were expecting it to be other than a pretty entertaining superhero movie which it is.  I thought the symbiote was really funny and I'll come back for a better review later.  Right now I'm just doing my duty helping to correct a DEAD WRONG CRITIC SCORE and letting people know that it's worth seeing, unlike the unwatchable garbage that the critics will try to trick you into seeing instead.   It's not really a ten, in fairness I'd probably give it a 7.5.  And it's funny, maybe not Thor Ragnarok funny but it got a fair amount of laughs out of a guy who rarely laughs at the movies.  The 10 is really just there to help thwart that 35/100 that is the average score given by 44 people with either a hidden agenda, unfair expectations, or just plain bad taste.   Oh and Venom, if you're reading this I have a recommendation for your next 44 meals...",1
214,"Es buena, no es tan mala como la ponen. No es los vengadores, pero es buena.",1
215,"Ever since I saw the first trailer to venom I was on board. Having wanted a venom movie since Spiderman 3 dishonored venom I've been waiting for venom to get the spotlight and boy does he have it now. The pacing is a bit slow at first but once the symbiote takes hold it is a wild ride. The action scenes are top notch and fun to watch. The cgi looks great especially venom and other symbiotes. The relationship between Eddie and venom is the best thing the movie has to offer. Tom Hardy nails his role and his dialogue with venom is both funny and a blast to watch. This is definitely an underrated movie it isn't bad at all. It's definitely not perfect, my main issues being the overall story and some out of character comedic moments but most of it is great and venom steals the show. I actually wish the movie was longer so we could see more of venom but he's shown enough so its a fair exchange. Oh and the pg13 rating feels about right, though yes venom does bite heads off in this movie and it shows it so I'm not mad about the rating. Overall it's a great movie and I hope to see more of venom and even Spiderman in future films. 8/10",1
216,"#helpvenom Хороший фильм, который явно не заслуживает всего хейта, который на него выливается.Будь главный герой гей или афроамериканец, все бы только и говорили какой этот фильм шикарный.Он не сильно отличается от фильмов, которые открывают новых героев у Марвел, при бюджете в 2 раза меньше. Том Харди очень хорош тут. Не слушайте никого, сходите и составьте свое мнение.",1
217,Three Fs.  Fantastic Fun Film. See it in IMAX. Hardy is hysterical doing the voice of Venom. Bet you didn’t know that fun fact. Go see it. PG rating is good for young people.,1
219,"Очень рад, что наплевал на то , что говорят критики и сходил на этот фильм и скажу честно, я не тот человек который готов писать ревью и тп , но ради сиквела , я готов это сделать. Фильм отличный сумел меня зацепить и принес мне положительные эмоции, после всех этих слухов про то какой фильм плохой, я ожидал, что хотя бы разочаруюсь, хоть немного, но нет! мне он понравился! и советую каждому с ним ознакомится, есть мелкие недочеты, вроде резких перемен венома и довольно простенького сюжета, но это все не замечаешь за легкостью данного фильма! обязательно к просмотру и ждем сиквел!!",1
221,as a long time Venom reader and Fan of everything Venom...this looked like Venom it is called Venom...but this is not Venom... they took the character....just the look and created a completely different character...it is a below average movie guys.,0
222,"No, it's not perfect, but is shure a lot of fun to watch this movie. Somentimes the passing of the movie seems a little bit rushed. A underdeveloped villain and poor motivations from the characters are the worts problems, but the relationship of Venom and Eddie Brock is spot on!",1
223,"Althought purists to the Spiderman story will find this movie rough around the edges, the movie is a lot of fun to watch. The story was lacking key development points but Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock was fun to see and with hints of comedy. It was a good time and has potential for rewatch value.",1
225,"Amazing movie !! Don't listen to anyone, go and watch it by your self!!!!!!",1
226,"Cool marvel fimlm. Cools story, Tom Hardy cool actor. All aspects of this film is cool, i cant understand why some peoples hate movie. I like it and recomended see to my friends",1
227,"Well, the movie could have worked even better, if they stopped catering to the MCU formulaic approach and dragged the first 40 minutes onto stuff that really made it stay on as a R-rating instead. It does affect some of the character development along the story pace thus lessening the potential of what the symbiote-human threat could have implied. The Eddie Brock - Venom relationship is the best thing that works for this movie resting completely on its shoulders to rise on many occassions as a classic piece of entertainment for fans. This aspect alone makes the movie even a second time watch for Venom fans too. Trust me , the tonal mess to nurture the PG-13 audience is what holds the potential back. A slight concern might be there for VFX but that does not break the movie at all one bit. Forget that aspect and you are clearly in for a 112 minute fun ride. Oh yes, the post credit scenes are also worth watching.",1
228,"Отличный фильм. Ставлю 8, потому что, 9 или 10, фильм не заслуживает.",1
234,"Overall a very decent Super Hero or be it Anti-Hero movie. It isn't great, but I'd put it up there with Ghost Rider or Ant-Man.  Tom Hardy does a great job, and had excellent special effects. The only real thing I didn't like was the amount of Shaky Cam they used.  I'm not a fan of it in general.",1
237,"It doesnt deserve a 10, but it surely doesnt deserve a 3 too, like professional critics are saying by exaggerating on the negative side. To me its a solid 8/10 , fun time, serious time, drama and action mix with a good pace. Hardy is perfect as venom, looking forward to the future of this franchise",1
238,"Cool movie.It's enjoyable and funny and has a good story, i recommend it to anyone, go watch it and have fun :D",1
239,"Великолепно провели день с друзьями, познакомились с девочками и похоже я нашел много новых подруг",1
240,"I liked the movie. I do not understand the critics, although there were a couple of ridiculous moments",1
241,dont let the score of this movie fool you it is way better than that. this is better than any spider man movie ever made. it was funny and entertaining. i was pissed that they didnt stick to teh comic book but i think if they did they might would have **** it up. im so glad its doing well in the box office as we will get to see sequal. and im really glad they ddint bring the 12 year old spider man into this.,1
242,"These critics are losing touch. No one is going to Venom expecting a great movement of work. It could have been better sure, but it certainly wasn't as bad as these uppity ""movie experts"" would have you believe. The critics aren't totally wrong however... it is noisy, a little messy, probably cut up incorrectly due to behind the scenes issues and should have been released with a 'R' rating.... but despite this, Venom is a cool anti-hero and that pulp story still packs lots of fun. If you can ignore its flaws, it's a good time.",1
244,"the story too weak, and I see the Venom is like  stitch. dont waste your time to see it",0
245,"Ignore the critic reviews, I loved Venom, and I think that the character stands up well on the big screen.We don't always need to have heroes, but as Deadpool as proved we can have some pretty good antiheroes holding up the banner",1
246,"This movie is way better than how critics projected it.It appears to be different from comic and it has to be different since it is a movie and limited to creativity. Hence I believe that critics gave it low scores. but who really cares about what critics think? just book your show for Venom blindly. I guarantee it will not disappoint you. I will personally rate it as 8+ 1 for tom hardy. filled with action scenes and It is actually more focused on Eddie Brock managing his two different ego. Or let's used the term alternate egos.""Good and the bad side"" . Last but not the least, don't you dare to miss out post credit scene :3",1
247,"La crítica puede simplemente irse a cagar, a mi me encantó la película, al principio es lenta pero de igual forma entrega momentos muy divertidos, las escenas de acción son bastante asombrosas y el tono sombrío contrasta bien con el humor, la química entre Venom y Eddie es muy agradable, la escena post créditos promete bastante por lo que espero que hagan una secuela.",1
248,"Not a wow movie, but it is not that terrible as the critics claim. Go for it without fear.",1
249,"Haters gonna hate, movie wasnt EVEN CLOSE as BAD than the CRITICS made it OUT to BE.",1
250,"I dont understand why the critics put such a low rating. There are gaps in the film (why did they cut 40 minutes?), but it's not that critical.",1
251,"После просмотра фильма, понимаешь, что SONY делают гораздо серьезные, атмосферные фильмы про супер героев. Жаль что фильмы про человека паука делают не SONY а MARVEL.",1
252,"I don't think the movie deserves a perfect 10, but since the critics want to compare it to Catwoman, i might as well be as unfair. Now the movie has it's flaws and ass pulls, but is it bad overall? Not even close. In fact, I enjoyed it more than other superhero movies, like Black Panther and Deadpool 2. Venom's CGI was a lot better than Black Panther's for example and so was the action. What I didn't like though, was the fact that the symbiote turned out to be the good guy, which was...eh.. I'm not some comic maniac, but I always saw Venom as a raid boss in the Spiderman Universe, something that this movie doesn't make me feel. Lastly, we can argue that everything was ""rushed"" but as I said before, I'd take action over pointless character development. Tom Hardy was a great Venom and I'm looking forward to the second movie.. It will have my favorite villain.",1
253,"This was good, from my point of view. I'm 17 and have not really read any comic books,and first I heard of Venom was from the trailers. With that in mind I did enjoy it and left the teather with a big smile.",1
254,"I'm with the critics on this one, this was an all around garbage movie. I don't know why other users are giving it such high scores, the acting, dialogue, and general storyline were all painfully bad.",0
255,"Unfortunately, the majority of people who like this movie don't know what they are missing.  Sony had all the tools to make this series huge and now it ""might"" get a sequel. This is a typical Sony film, pluck the fruit from the tree without nurturing the roots.  The dynamics to Venom are so much more than this and could have been cultivated into something epic.Now he's just a semi-dark superhero.  Way to go.",0
259,"Ein toller spannender Film! Ich habe ihn gestern im Kino gesehen. Ich kann die schlechten Bewertungen absolut nicht verstehen. Tom Hardy geht hier in seiner Rolle vollkommen auf und es macht einfach nur Spaß ihm zuzusehen. Es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall den Film zu sehen, besonders wegen der Symbiose von Venom und Eddie Brock.

260,"I can see why the critical reviews are low. I can also see why fans enjoy it. We deserve a better Venom movie, but what we got wasn't the worst comic book movie ever.",0
261,"This movie should not be called Venom, it should be called venous black testicle, from the moment I knew it was not Spider-man I knew it was going to be a bad movie, but even so I gave it a try, and I went to see it with my best will, but nothing, it is impossible to consider it acceptable, it was too bad, it looks like the movie of the fantastic four but with an alien with Jim Carrey sadist disorder.",0
262,"Venom was just a huge dissapointment. There was almost nothing unique compared to other superhero movies and There was almost no story development, character development or character depth to begin with. Overall it just led to a boring shell of movie that was trying to be dark and edgy but happy and funny at the same time and it was just a mess.",0
263,"This movie is the worst Marvel movie ever made, i have seen alot of marvel movies because i am a marvel nerd and have loved every single on, even the incredible hulk.  venom is ugly and i am a dad. **** lasgna.SImen out!",0

267,The movie is very funny. Venom is a troll. An anti-hero movie for the meme generation.,1
268,It's Venom without Spiderman. WITHOUT spiderman. Sony should just give up already.,0
269,"As I remembered from seeing the first trailer I had high hopes for Venom to be good especially with an honest-to-god R-rating hack-and-slash horror genre, but I was wrong, this movie is a big throwback to the 2000s so bad it’s good superhero film decade and the absolute result of this film is surprisingly mindblowing with pure insanity (fun.) Venom is so bad that everything from the direction all the way to writing cannot save this film and for some odd reason, this movie is really fun to watch. Most casual audience members will indeed love this film if they don’t care about the art of filmmaking, but for those that are diehard film fanatics will bash it either way. Hate to say this but Ruben Fleischer will go down as the new Zack Snyder of Sony’s Marvel Universe in the textbooks in film and goddamn, Amy Pascal is the one to blame for all this mess especially after hearing that a 40 minute cut has been removed from the final film that Tom Hardy has mentioned about to the press not long ago. Hopefully an R-rated sequel will be in the works if Sony has a brain clicking in their mindsets because there will be Carnage coming in the mix if they chose someone that actually has talent to helm the sequel. This movie had me very justified since BvS and honestly, I think it’s worth checking it out if you like Spiderman or Venom. Looks like a cult following will come in like a turd, in the wind..",0
273,"Venom, a character study.Wow, this movie snuck-up on me. Hearing the overwhelmingly negative response from critics, and the reasonably positive response from movie-goers, it had left me jaded walking into the movie, however, I was very happy with the final result. Oddities:In Australia, this movie was M15+, the profanity in it was pretty prolific (now, I'm not one to worry about that at all, as my favourite comedians are/were horribly profane - Jim Jefferies, Bill Burr, George Carlin, Bill Hicks), and the movie was thematically and visually dark - I wouldn't take my children to see this movie but we watched Ant-Man & the Wasp together and it was the same rating. My point here is that - surely, this wasn't far off an R rating and I don't think it would have undermined the box office performance - which I am very excited by because it opens up this entire world and universe - and brings the potential for one of the most immoral villains to come to the big screen in the sequel.Anyway, I digress...I really instantly connected with the character. I suffer ADHD, which essentially means that before I was diagnosed and receiving treatment, I tended to (often) make poor choices in interpersonal situations - saying inappropriate things without thinking of the consequences, I also lived very slovenly and was, generally - 'clever, but a hot mess'... So, Tom Hardy played to that aspect really well in the initial beats of the film. Now, I don't know if that's what he was going for, or if he was trying Schizophrenia/Dissociative Identity Disorder on (which seemed to be the modus operandi once infected with the symbiote), but nevertheless, it was clear that he too suffered from ADHD and wasn't receiving treatment for it, so the connection for me was instantaneous and highly personally gratifying, whereas for others, I know that they'd likely not feel the same way as I did...I know that people were worried about the anti-hero aspect of the film in that ""he's a hero as he saves the world"" for the most part - yes - I will agree with this that he is more righteous than we may have thought he should be, however, he's not self-righteous, and he does bad, terrible, horrible things, like eating heads - or entire people (as he does in the end when he devours the convenience store robber) - and I'm sorry folks - HEROES DON'T DO THAT. Heroes do what they can to protect the innocent, and provide the bad guys to authorities so they can face consequences, they don't eat them... I am partial to a good anti-hero - I love the Punisher on Netflix - Jon Berenthal embodies him spectacularly, and I honestly didn't think that anyone could do it after Tom Jane's excellent turn in the movie in the early naughties, but again, I digress... I think Tom Hardy has done a marvellous job in this. I could see that there were numerous issues with the technical aspects of the film (CGI seemed cut-down and lower-budget) and a lot of it was left on the cutting-room floor, however, I had no trouble following the fights (which others have complained about) and I think that Michelle Williams and he were absolutely spot-on in their relationship - speaking from personal experience, ""we"" tend to... put people off, even our most loved ones, so for them to not have a great deal of chemistry, well that to me, was natural - I have messed up so many relationships as a result of my impulsivity and lack of self-awareness or of consequences, so it was reasonable that when he destroyed his and her career, that she would have had enough - clearly he'd messed-up before and hadn't gotten out of his own way.I actually liked the villain in the piece, and I saw how both he and his bonded symbiote were driven to the same outcome in the end - infect humanity to save humanity, so to me that too was spot-on.So, can I say to you, that if you watch it with very low expectations, as I had - you WILL be pleasantly surprised. I can't wait for the next instalment, Spider-man or no - but I do think that if some sort of deal can be spun, this would be perfect for a team-up for Maximum Carnage. Tom Hardy rocks and his performance in  this movie is no exception - see it - just don't take your kids because it'll scar/scare them.",1
274,"Omg it's been a while since I watched a movie so poorly done. You can see they did it fast and without thinking too much about anything. The script is bad, the CGI is bad, not funny. They should let the superhero movies to marvel as they are the only ones that know how to do it.",0
275,"""Don't expect too much."" it's true. I don't wanna say anything just that, this is disappointed.",0
276,"One more to the Sony's Turd in the Wind Cinematic Universe. A dark Lilo and Stich in a generic romantic comedy with dull action. Sad for Tom Hardy, he try... hard.",0
277,"I do not mind making a 'fun' film and not bothering with all the artsy-fartsy intellectualism and technicalities. I also do not mind (too much) the shallow development of its characters because that usually comes with making a 'fun' film. I also do not mind making a cash grab. Seriously! As long as its executed properly. What I do mind, though, is how much this film struggles to do as little work as possible in the department its most interested in: 'fun'.Ripping apart the credits, the duration sits somewhere close to 1 hour and 40 minutes which is closer to a b-movie local television evening running than a theatrical release. Of course, length is not an issue on its own. Its what is contained in it. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is over 3 hours long but somehow this feels emptier. And that its mostly due to its awkward pace resulted from its excessive editing. Ruben Fleischer's lack of interest is simply to obvious here. Characters change their mind at an illogical pace, villains depart and arrive out of nowhere, and some decisions contradict each other. These are not movie ruining directing moves when your idea is dynamic action, but its just too obvious and shameless here.Despite its merciless cutting, we have many unnecessary scenes still left somehow. Mostly, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) stumbling through life and having wanna-be hard times themed everyday conversations with local folk. Out of all these interactions, the only ones which are a bit funny are Brock interacting with his symbiote, but even these wear thin quickly. And Hardy definitely gave his best. His performance is maybe one of the only two redeeming features of this film along with its killer special effects and dynamic action scenes (especially the motorcycle chase) and special effects.In the end, 'Venom' is nothing more than a glorified action flick. Talkative epic villains, cool brooding action dude and a snowflake girlfriend. But its spread to thin and its shallowness is too obvious.",0
278,"Should have been much darker. Too much dumbness in the story, and action-scenes. Expected more than this mess. There are some cool scenes, and Venom himself is badass, for most of the time... He gives in way to easy several times... AND the human bad guy is extremely boring, and Riot himself is an old lady for over 6 months!! He uses half a year to get to the Life Foundation, wow he is stupid beyond belief.",0
279,"Couldn't watch it whole without fast forwarding, mainly becouse main protagonist is an annoying idiot.",0
280,I saw that with my bf and it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. He liked it tho.,0

282,"I wanted to love this film, however, no way around it, it's a bad movie.  The CGI is lacking.  The story is underdeveloped and simply not exciting or compelling.  Long-time fans of the Marvel Universe should be furious about this film because we waited so long for a good film about Venmon and once again we were let down.",0
283,"Bad acting, predictable plot, very boring during the first hour, poor CGI, only good characters are the store clerk and the symbiote.",0
284,This movie is a waste of time. An offensive paint-by-numbers Sony product with no reason to exist.0/10.,0
286,"I don't get the negative press for this one. It's a perfect film in every way. It has a good buildup, good acting and dialogue, loads of cool actions scenes.  Don't let the low scores put you off as you may enjoy it as much as I did.",1
289,"Nobody channels Eddie Brock / Venom like Tom Hardy. As someone who had hundreds of Spider-Man comics when I was younger (I even owned a copy of Amazing Spider-Man #300 featuring the first full appearance of Venom), this is the PERFECT Venom origin story. And when I see Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, Venom's alter ego, it makes me feel happy, contented and as fuzzy as the symbiote. In the comics, Eddie Brock is a character that is a bit of an outcast, is unsure of himself and gets even more confused (initially) when Venom entered his life, and Tom Hardy channels Eddie Brock to perfection!!! Venom in the comics had some dark-ish humour, and the humour that Venom spouts in the movie is spot on - in fact Venom gets the best one liners. And the biggest laughs from the audience. The movie portrays a beautiful symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom, and shows progression in their relationship throughout the movie. The CGI for Venom is also spot on, making him a highly flexible and versatile character with the symbiotic extensions doing some cool stunts. It makes Venom look cool and dangerous at the same time. The pacing is just right, and Tom Hardy's versatility as an actor really stole the show, so much so that this would work even if this was a one man show. And the post-credit sneak preview is ""one to die for"" - I DEFINITELY want to see the next Venom - it'll be CGI carnage...Peeps, forget the previous incarnation of Venom, this is the REAL deal. Possibly the best movie I've seen in 2018 to date. Stuff the stuffy professional critics. They haven't had any clue for the past 25 years and are no longer credible sources for good movies - much like the fake news. Go watch Venom. It's da bomb!",1
291,"I did not trust the critics but the public and I went to see it. It is a very rare movie, the first act is very slow and at times you cry out for Venom to appear and once he does everything goes fast, a mess of rhythms. The end very hurried and many things were missing in explaining (you notice the 40 minutes that are missing), very ridiculous moments and a villain that just in the last 5 minutes of film we got to know and what their intentions are. The loose music and the action scenes are not understood very much.The good: Tom Hardy, the CGI and the Eddie / Venom interaction (although it is rare).Not as bad as Catwoman but not as good as the fans say.",0
292,"Went in expecting Venom to be so bad, its good. Turned out to be straight good. The audience seems to agree, because Venom is bringing it in at the box office. Some parts are cheesy, but the producers knew what they were making and didn't overextend themselves. Completely recommend.",1
293,"I really liked it. I don't know exactly what the critics had against this film. I am a highly educated person, like films, storytelling. Am a student of Jung and Campbell. I thought it was a good, complex enough myth. The characters seemed human enough. I am not sure the CGI was spot on. However, that sort of thing is forgivable. CGI is to support the movie, not be the movie.Storytelling, all was good.",1
294,"there are soooo many plot holes in this movie lol, i can't enjoy a movie when the writing is this dumb. on the plus side venom (the character) was fun! i loved how funny he was.",0
295,"Critics are way too harsh on this movie. Venom is so much better than Black Panther IMO in terms of pure fun and entertainment. The story and writing are weak like pretty much all the most recent superhero movies but I had a great time watching this and wouldn't mind watching it in the theatre again, it's really enjoyable watching Eddie Brock becoming Venom. Marvel has the critics in the palm of their rich hands (they're too afraid to bash a Marvel movie for fear of their careers).",1
296,"So this movie was kind of crap, but also kind of amazing too! It's a mess but I had a lot of fun laughing at it's expense. It was basically everything that I hoped for...well okay an R-rating is what I hoped for but ehhhh...Tom Hardy has a really bad New Yorker accent that's like a cartoon, but looking past that he did a good job here. He really gets his character and does add a lot to the movie. And the relationship between Venom and Eddie is pretty great. It's not quite a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" situation, but the whole interactions between the two characters were pretty great. And the stuff with Venom that we do get is also pretty cool too. I like the buildup to when we see full Venom in action, and he does remind me a lot of the comics. So that is the one real genuine praise I can give outside of some odds and ends like the motorcycle chase being pretty fun to watch and Michelle Williams is also good here too despite her weak character, but more on that later. Unfortunately for some, but fortunately for me, the movie is broken!The action scenes are pretty bland. While I did like the motorcycle chase scene, outside of the Symbiote power there really isn't much new when it comes with the framing and stunt choreography that I haven't seen before, and honestly better. The motorcycle chase is the only good action scene, because every other action set piece is poorly shot, jumbly edited, and depending on the setting also hard to follow sometimes when it's in darker settings. Which is especially true with the fight sequence with Venom and Riot. Both characters do look rather similar and seeing them duke it out with the mess of editing it makes it hard to figure out who was fighting who. But it does have a roundabout way of being funny to watch when you see these reoccurring elements done before in other action films.Riz Ahmed makes for an underwhelming bad guy. Sure he is a generic bad guy, but if you ham it up it can be fun to watch. However Ahmed plays him very reserved and not very expressive, always having a very blank expression. Which I guess is kind of the point given the character is supposed to be cold, but I just never bought him. The character is a more evil version of Mark Zuckerberg, but he comes off more like Gabe from the Office! Although Ahmed got nothing on Jenny Slate! She is flat out terrible in this, underacting and looking so bored on screen! She always has a super bland and blank expression! Like there's a scene where she gets caught whistleblowing the company she works for, and her expression when she is caught comes off like she left the lights on in her apartment when she left. Like...why?There was some bad publicity leading up where Tom Hardy blatantly said that 40 minutes of the film was cut, I don't know if it was the more gorier parts of the film that was promised to us, but I think there was a lot of development cut out, because judging on the theatrical cut this script is underdeveloped! I gave Michelle Williams credit for being pretty good in the movie, and she is, but the relationship between Eddie and her character is extremely underdeveloped, especially when there are like some kind of romantic tension with her and her new man, who is absolutely pointless in this regard. I honestly did not care about Tom Hardy and Michelle William's relationship at all. The relationship with Eddie and Venom also felt underwhelming too. Like the general tension between the two is fine, but Venom turns from a ""I wanna wreck things in this world"" to ""actually this planet is pretty cool I'm gonna save it"" in the blink of an eye! Like...where was the development? The movie flies by so fast too! It's barely 2 hours long but it feels a lot more like an hour and a half film. Which does run into a problem with the short development and story arks and especially the third act which flies by very quickly. The tone is also a mess. It's not a straight up horror film, but it does have a ton of psychological elements to it mixed with a campy Marvel movie, it's jarring but it's also hilarious having these two different tones at odds with each other.  Like the third act has a song cue right out of an Avengers film and it is so out of place, it's amazing!If there is one thing I can credit about the script, it's the dialogue. There are some intentionally funny scenes and quips, but for the most part it's poorly written and pretty cheesy and edgy. It was hilarious, and probably unintentional too which makes it better!Overall the movie is garbage but go in with the right mindset it is a fun movie to rip apart with friends. The jarring tones, underwritten screenplay, and corny edge makes this a hilarious romp!",0
297,"Left wing ""critics"" writing about a good moive.The result: A bad score. Everybody who want to see the real results just ignore the ""critics"" ONLY watch the user score!Venom is a good movie! The ""critic reviews"" are FAKE NEWS!",1
298,"This is a fun and entertaining movie!  The script, acting, and effects are well done and the story has lots of humor interspersed with symbiote violence.  Tom Hardy turns in his usual stellar performance as a down-on-his-luck reporter who stumbles upon an interstellar plot and becomes host for Venom.  Mayhem ensues and I feel it pays homage to the comics while introducing a wider audience to this excellent anti-hero.",1
299,"Very bad plot and poor CGI, lot of mistakes in characters behavior. Lazy action episodes.",0
300,"I did enjoy this movie. Yes, it's a little bit messy but refreshingly dark fun. It goes out of the standards and typical cliches that superhero movie now have. Just enjoy.",1
302,"totally wasted a good character , the movie was boring , the villain was never a threat , Venom was almost immediately turned into a non lethal shell of what makes him popular with fans , I have no idea why they think they can ever make this movie popular with SJW logic but apparently they are going to try anyway , the story is a mess the once supper deadly characters are now all declawed and there's no reason to be interested or care",0
303,"Venom feels like it should have been at least 30 minutes longer.The only positives i can think of on this movie, is Eddie Brock's character, Tom Hardy works wonder with a dreadful script. The interactions between Eddie and Venom are definitely the best part, but we got almost nothing of that.Other characters however just seem to be there. Carlton Drake is a weak villain, who you will forget as soon as you get off the theatre. Riot, oh wow, riot was such a disappointment. We got 5 minutes of Riot vs Venom, and i actually liked it. But it was only 5 minutes.The script is absolutely awful, certain characters decisions just seem to happen out of nowhere. When Venom decided to stay on Earth, he simply decided, there was no scene or point of turn around, in a space of 10 minutes he went from slowly killing Eddie, to wanting to stay on Earth.End of the movie, i felt like i was robbed at least 30 minutes of important scenes, this movie felt like it had more to give. It's another complete misfire by Sony. I hope in the sequel they can make turn this around",0
304,"I believe that the film was conceived with a rating of 18+ However, the greediness of the Sony company spoiled the plot. I am sure that a huge number of scenes were cut so that the rating became 13+Now for the plot. 40 minutes is stupid chatter. At 45 minutes we are shown Venom for the first time. Then another 30 minutes stupid talk. And at the end of a small fight. It's all. Why did Venom decide to save the planet? How did Eddie convince him? I am more than sure that the relationship was developed in the cut scenes. Plot this can be explained by a symbiosis, but you yourself understand how rotten it is.Why did the ""bad"" symbiot choose an antagonist? How did he find him? Why is there no protection in the top secret lab? The journalist walks like at home. The little girl also entered the building without any problems. Idiocy",0
305,Forget the critics (who are mostly on the Disney payroll). This film is great fun. Entertaining all the way through. Hardy is excellent as always.,1
306,"I have to say that I read the reviews before I watched the movie, so I went to the cinema with any hope but I had to watch the movie  Because it was VENOM one of my favorite characters from my childhood and it was really enjoable. Maybe people thought that it was going to be a ""Terror"" movie and thats why they did not like it. In my case I trust that they did a great job mixing the different types of genders.",1
307,"a very good movie , i had a lot of fun watching it and it's pretty funny too, the transition of venom into a semi good guy wasn't as smooth and logical as i wanted(it was kinda sudden!) but still a very good movie!",1
308,Venom is not as good as the other marvel movies but it was still extremely entertaining. The action scenes were spectacular. Tom Hardy's performance was stupendous and funny. Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed's performances were amazing as well. I loved the soundtrack it was fantastic. Even though the writing and tone of the movie was not great everything else was great.,1
309,"Venom is not a bad movie, I liked  the action and even some dialogues. the problem is that it is a great mistake. I don't know how this obedient funny venom is going to be spider man's enemy!!",0
311,This movie was awesome.. Im a huge venom fan and overall this movie was fun and entertaining. It has Its flaws but I was hooked from the moment it started until the mid credit screen great movie by sony hopefully the second one gets better and better.,1
312,What a trash. Only thing I liked about the movie was Tom hardy talking to Venom. Action was terrible and the story was horrifying. I hope that Sony doesn't make any more Venom movies.,0
313,"Too awkward to stand as a solid action flick, but not funny enough to be a comedy. All throughout, there are glimpses of the better movie that it could have been.",0

325,This was worth the time. No movie that i have seen created such intriguing blend of comedy horror and great acting. Personally as a person who has seen decades of marvel movies this introduces a fresh step in the franchises recipe.  Words can only justify so much this is a must watch for all in my opinion,1

329,"Never believe a Metascore, thats paid reviews. This is a good movie, will certainly buy a DvD of it to have in my collection of Superhero movies. I like how they show you the interaction between Eddie and Venom. The control of who is the boss is a fun twist as well. It has some comedy mixed in with a ton of action. Venom is not your typical superhero, yet certainly not a villian. Movie is well worth the watch.",1
330,"This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my entire life.As a superhero movie, Venom, the first installment of the Sony Marvel Universe, is a dismal failure. The script is laughably bad, the action sequences are...fine, I guess, and the stakes feel stale. It makes the much-mocked Spider-Man 3 Topher Grace version look like a masterpiece. None of the jokes are funny. The CGI is outdated for an 80s movie. Almost all the characters are dumb and boring. The only person who makes the movie interesting from time to time is Tom Hardy. Simply because he is Tom Hardy and he's a good actor that basically carrys the movie. The symbiote is nothing like venom from the Marvel universe. It doesn't even behave like an alien, more like a pet that needs to be trained....[  It is here where I should mention that the movie is not worth watching,  because....  this is where spoiler starts!]...Trained by Eddy to become the new superhero. For real??? Venom used to be the bad guy yet they actually made him a hero? A hero that kills and eats bad people btw.I honestly don't believe that I tortured myself till the end of the movie. As a fan of Venom I really wanted the movie to be good, but I won't even watch the sequel not even the trailer.",0

333,veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood,1
334,"Venom is a good movie, no doubt about it, but there are certain points that are just bad. In the beginning, there are so many minutes wasted to build something that has no purpose or doesn't pay off. No to mention the beginning is slow, and I mean really slow. Like, 1/3 of the people in the theater I was in had left before the exciting things to happen.  I believe it takes 30 minutes for the real exposition to start. And then, boom. Someone's dying from a symbiote. Oh, look: Eddie has Venom. Oh look, someone else died. And there's Riot. Oop, Venom doesn't have Eddie anymore. Oh, now he does. Oh, now Riot's dead. Oh, credits. IMO it feels like this all happens in 10 minutes when it could have been beautifully separated and used a lot of that opening time to make it a better movie. With that said, it is so fun. Th effects are incredible and they do a really good job of creating an origin story without Spider-Man. There is also a lot of great comedy that doesn't slow down the story (for example, the absolute funniest moment in the whole movie only takes away 5 seconds from everything else, and then we're right back into one of the best scenes). My main critique is the screen-time Venom and Riot get, which is not a lot. But with all that being said, its just really good. I hope any sequel it gets is able to improve on this, and give a future to a lot of seemingly impossible comic book movies.",1
335,"I was pretty sceptic about this movie due to all the negative feedback. I still ended up watching it and was pleasantly surprised by the movie. I understand the comments about how a Spiderman villian can exist in a world without Spiderman. I see it like this, how can he not. In a universe where there are infinite possibilities on every different universe, why can't this be one of them. I see this movie as a different universe than we are watching in the other movies. On it's own it is a pretty descent movie. Not a 10/10 but not horrible to watch either. The story could be a bit more fleshed out, but i'm kind of excited to see more symbiotes like in the comics.",1
336,Venom is the kind of movies that need a high attention to the CGI. And it's the biggest flaw in the movie.,0
341,"The plot was the only weak point of this movie, tons of holes and way too short and focusing on the backgrounds of wrong things, foreshadowing time that took up significant chunks of the movie for singular joke scenes instead of foreshadowing proper plot points. Honestly I think Tom Hardy did a fine job in the beginning of creating this broken shell of a man, but he didn't translate it very well into a character who regained his confidence and strength later on, Venom having a complete 180 in attitude after almost being killed (on purpose) by his host doesn't make sense either.The comedy probably isn't for some people but it is a really good 2 man banter with Tom Hardy acting as the straight man (the guy that sees things logically) and Venom being the one with the punchlines and setting things up, pretty decent duo to be honest, but it isn't artistic comedy it is more like the comedy you would have with your friends, which is why I enjoyed it so much, a homicidal monster making a poop joke is just something I can really appreciate.CGI gets a lot of complaints and I genuinely don't know why, people are so insanely picky, the CGI represented Venom very well in my opinion, it could at most use a bit of touching up but especially the fight between Venom/Eddie and Riot/Drake was excellent to watch and look at.",1
344,"This was super fun to watch, Hardy was weird and excellent.   No idea why this got review bombed, unless Disney or Gaga fans were out to down it or something.  Still, feels like a chunk got cut out that I'd like to see.",1
345,"All in all a perfectly okay superhero movie, and in this age when anything outside of the MCU is hit or miss, that gets a kudos. But there's an issue here with the potential to ruin the future of the franchise...Here's what I liked: the classic Venom banter... the effects were a bit ropy but clean, especially during this one scene that had no business being visually decipherable... awesome car chase... the fact that it made me forget the total, permanent absence of Spiderman ""in this universe.""Here's what I didn't like: it could (should?) have run an extra 20-30 minutes... and this movie had no right to be as utterly bloodless as it was (except for the obligatory heroic near-fatal wound.) **spoiler alert** To completely shun the color red in a movie where aliens wield giant f*^&-me battleaxe arms and people get their heads bitten off is, dare I say, a true feat of artlessness. This movie would have been a near ten if it wasn't so afraid to be what it was. I f*%&ing loved seeing Woody Harrelson with red hair in the post-creds... However, again, I have instant reservations about seeing Cletus Kasady in a franchise that flinches at showing actual carnage. If they even try it, the sequel will be a spectacular failure.Don't wimp out on us now, Sony. You have a chance to really do something special with what you're teasing here. Just go for that R like you mean it!",1
346,"It's fun and creeppy, funny and scarry with a lovable loser protagonist. This blend reminds me of Raimi movies. A really solid film that keeps you interested till the post-credits scene with a sequel hook. I'm not sure that ""R"" rating would have made it better, I kinda like that there are no ""carnage"" on the streets and Venom kills verry sparringly and only to eat, he's such a sweet monster :-). To all gore-hounds: wait for the sequel ;).",1
347,Was it dumb?  Of course.  Did I care. No!  There were parts like the motorcycle chase that were waaaaay too long but there were plenty of redeeming features.  Tom Hardy. Check!  Michelle Williams! Check.  Some Venom humor!!  Double Check!  I would definitely be up for Part 2 with the same cast and sense of fun.,1
348,"A very enjoyable movie, better than any recent Marvel or DC movie.  Ignore the ""critic reviewers"" and their political agendas.",1
349,it was a good and pretty funny movie and tom hardy did a great job doing as Eddie Brock,1
350,"this is vintage venom from the comics. if you've been a long time fan of venom, you'll love this movie. i can see why critics would not like this, b/c it doesn't cater to the mainstream like transformers...it caters to ppl who came to see this movie because they liked the character from the comic. he's socially awkward, has his own code of good (which might makes some of those uptight critics cringe when venom bites off the head of a bad guy, even though he give a homeless lady $20 who asked for $5), tells weird jokes that cracked me up. i thought this was on the level of the dark knight and spiderman 2 which were previously the 2 best superhero movies imo.",1
353,"I loved the movie, Venom was awesome and Tom Hardy delivered an excellent performance. Much better than Black Panther as I couldn't finish that garbage",1
354,Venom is a fair movie that isn't too serious. The good is that it's not generic comic stuff that we've seen with Avengers movies. More for your comic book fans than casual fans.,1
357,"Pointless to have Venom without Peter Parker. Venom is surprisingly entertaining nevertheless. Due to only Tom Hardy.Riz Ahmed Is pretty bad as the villain. He gives an overly low key and one note performance throughout. Michelle Williams is Katie Holmes Batman Begins like miscast as well. While this might be the Venom character done right. Again, it’s just hard to utilize him without Spider-Man.Yet Sony Picturrs has more movies like it planned. Kraven the Hunter and Black Cat, without Spider-Man.",1
358,"Apparently, there is nothing I like that the critics do not hate, and vice versa.  I was very nearly prepared to give this film an 8 simply because I expected one and all to rate it a 10, or maybe a 1000.  Clearly, I should've known.Having seen Hellboy (Ron Perlman), and Deadpool 1 & 2, and Antman (both of them), and now Venom, I have to say that these comic superhero flicks are much easier to take, and more entertaining, than the spandex flicks which take themselves seriously.  It's a little like watching yet another John McClane actioner.  Without the humor, the sarcasm, the irony, I start yawning and checking the elapsed time in hopes it'll soon be over.The effects are fine.  The action sequences run a little long at times, but not so long that I'm tempted to sledgehammer my DVD player.  I wouldn't say that there are any Oscar-worthy performances here, but everybody gets the job done.  And it was interesting to see the current boyfriend of the former love interest actually taking a role of some significance in the unfolding of the plot.Technically, I'll give Venom a [7.5].  It was better than just OK, though I don't feel it's quite worth an [8].  Admittedly, it came close.",1
359,"""I am Venom. And you are mine.""This is not a superhero movie or a anti-hero film. This is a love story.It's funny how Tom Hardy has more chemistry with himself than he dose with Michelle Williams.'Venom' is an absolutely mess of a movie, but there's never a dull moment. The acting from everyone is really bad and the action scenes are poorly filmed. Still, it's fascinating to see a movie that's so all over the place with talented people involved. Hardy climbing into a fish tank is a remarkable sight.We are Venom? More like we want money.",0
360,"The story follows journalist Brock (Tom Hardy) gaining superpowers after being bound to an alien symbiote whose species plans to invade Earth.I love complicated main characters with good and evil sides to their personality or agendas. In this movie, it is the righteous Brock who believes in uncovering the truth, even if it means going up against the rich and influential figures, without fear of the consequences. This point alone makes me like the character a great deal. Exuding fearlessness in the name of righteousness and truth is undeniably a very admirable trait in a meaningful purpose.When Brock gets infected with the symbiote parasite later, it gives him the power to stand up against the villainous force he has been fighting against morally. Though the idea isn't entirely original, it is nevertheless thrilling and gratifying to see a character you care about (yes, at the point where he got infected), to be able to kick asses in the most thrilling fashion. The parasite itself being not entirely benign, even violent and carnivorous against humans, makes their eventual physical and emotional bonding, a drooling, heart tingling, eye candy treat to savour.Tom Hardy puts up a very charismatic performance with his genuine, natural, light hearted humorous lines that can be heard throughout the film. Not a moment of cheesiness. A big thumb up for this!Why only a '7' for this movie? I would say the villain could be improved in terms of depth. Maybe if more were known about his past would be good. Making people care about characters including villains is one of the essentials to a good film.The story, though pretty decent, is not that amazing. The plots aren't that unpredictable. Some unexpected twists would really be nice. I feel that the film is a bit reliant on the amazing action chorography to make up for that. But still it is a crucial missing element that brings down the movie by at least half a notch.Verdict: Watch this movie!",1
361,"It is unlikely that anyone will be indifferent to the play of Tom Hardy in this movie. He saves this simple and slightly warped storyline from comics, making it a good movie for the whole family.Tom Hardy's play is reminiscent of Tobey Maguire's play from the first the spider-man movie trilogy, do you believe that his hero is a really good guy and it's great.",1
362,"Venom feels like a movie that simply couldn't decide what it wanted to be. The film has its issues, particularly with respect to its pacing and characters; however the chemistry between Tom Hardy and Venom carries the movie to stable standpoint.",1
363,"Wow, could the movie ""reviewers"" be more wrong? I went in to Venom with incredibly low expectations, and was more than pleasantly surprised! Tom Hardy was fantastic. The pacing was good, the length was good and the rest of the cast was good. I will for sure be watching this movie again.",1
367,"A Marvel fan favourite has appeared on the big screen yet again, it didn't work the first time and unfortunately it doesn't work now. If you go to see Venom and take it too seriously you'll leave disappointed, yet if you go in with low expectations and hope for a few laughs you may still leave disappointed. It's so ridiculously terrible it has found an audience, and if you don't believe me just take a look at how it did at the box office, nearly four times it's budget and it's still going strong. I didn't enjoy it, and a lot of other people definitely didn't enjoy it. But that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. Maybe when it was compared to being ""Catwoman levels of bad"" you rushed out to the cinema just to see how bad it really was and you ended up laughing your head off. And all I can say to you people is you are the reason we'll get a sequel.Starring Academy Award nominated actors Tom Hardy, and Michelle Williams. You can throw around the word Academy award all you like but even the combined acting talent of Hardy and Williams is not enough to save Venom. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) has brought back some symbiotes from space and is determined to merge symbiotes and humans to create a perfect being. But uh oh one of the symbiotes escapes and finds his perfect match in the form of Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). Now Eddie has one hell of a parasite which is becoming harder and harder to control cause Venom has some pretty strong cravings for human meat and doesn't really like taking orders. Yet another boring and predictable origin story, miscast and at times just silly. The script is hilariously terrible, the only thing I wanted to see was Venom chomping some heads off, and of course you get that but at a 15a rating. Hardy really is the best thing about Venom but it's not saying much and he does look like he's having a lot more fun compared to everyone else who pretty much looks like they don't want to be there. In the right hands this could have been so much better and it's frustrating to see Venom hasn't been done justice on the big screen yet again. Not recommended, unless you purposely go out of your way to see bad superhero movies.",0
368,"I jump on the ""better than I expected"" train: I liked it and I don't understand all the hate.There is humor that is not excessive (fewer jokes than Ragnarock or Suicide Squad for example), there is violence and action in the right amount...almost no gore but Eddie eat people and you can feel the punches during fights...it's not a slasher movie and does not need to be, almost no abused slow motion action sequences, main baddie isn't memorable but it does a good job in being the bad guy viewers will hate, right length, it has quotes and references from comic book (4 example dialogue between Venom and Eddie, aftercredit surprise, lethal protector comics quotes and so on) .This Venom is a much much much better one than the one in Spiderman 3: It is a big guy, use tenacles and morphing attributes, Symbiote is merciless-dangerous and have an ""alien"" mind and morality.    Negative aspects are: Plot is predictable, there is no trace of Spiderman whatsoever, Venom ""suit up"" a little late in the movie...but, apart form spidey absence,  they aren't a big deal .I hope for a sequel.",1
369,"Venom was a movie that was unexpectedly good. I went in expecting the normal treatment given to the old Spiderman movies, but this was a nice turnaround. It felt like a fun Marvel movie story, just not quite as flashy. If your looking for a great movie by the critic defined standards this probably isn't it. If you are looking for a great movie about Venom that uses a lot of Spiderman style humor and action? Than this is the movie to see.",1
371,"Тоже не понимаю откуда такой низкий рейтинг 3.5. Можно, конечно и лучше сделать было но фильм явно не провал.  Больше шуток.",1
372,"For the first time I have to agree with the user score, this movie isn't so bad as the critcs say it is. Tom Hadry does the best to what the script gives to him, Venom is actually a fun character and the movies has a really good pacing. But of course the story is bad, plot holes are everywhere trough this movie, there is 0 chemistery with Hard and Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed is a really bad villain, no memorable soundtrack, and I think there is a lack of vision in this movie. This is a good/average movie, you will get your money worth but it's not a perfect movie like many are saying it is but it's not a bad movie like the critcs say.",1
374,"Don't listen to critics who seem to want to compare everything to the seasonal Oscar bait. This movie was awesome! It knows what it wants to do and achieves it, with humour, action and great acting. Venom and Eddie are both portrayed in excellent fashion. I saw the movie with my son and a friend of his and we all had a great time. Don't believe the hate.",1
375,"I don't know what's going on with all the negative reviews. People are really hard to please! I went to see that movie without any real expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Tom Hardy does a fantastic jobVenom is an interesting and fun characterThe plot is fairly classic for this type of movie; nothing good or bad about itThe special effects are great - I loved the transformation scenes.Overall, I recommend it if you like the genre, want to have a good time with a dose of laughters and aren't overly hard to please.",1
376,I don't know why such low score. Was it good move? Yeah...? Was it cringy? AF. Did I enjoyed it? Yes. A solid 6 from me + 1 for awesome Tom Hardy performance.,1
378,"I honestly do not understand why many people did not like this movie and why rating on Metacritic only 35. To me the movie was poisoned first of all thanks to excellent acting of Tom Hardy. Yes a plot very weak, but it such in any movie Marvel. I am not a fan of movies of Marvel, they in some sense even kill modern cinema. But this film is deysvtitelno well shot.",1
380,Se ha llevado malas criticas pero la verdad que es muy entretenidaEl actor esta bastante acertado y el desarrolo de la pelicula un poco rapida pero bastante bien,1
381,"Me parecio entretenida, divertida en ciertos momentos mas que todo por la dinamica entre Venom y Tom Hardy, los personajes secundarios son bastante planos y su interpretacion es bastante apagada, las escenas de accion dependen mucho de los efectos especiales, no estan mal solo que no son memorables, ojala las proximas sean mas secas y dramaticas tipo Jason BourneEl problema con las peliculas de super heroes es que siguen siempre tienen que seguir el protocolo de complacer a la productora, y la libertidad creativa se va a la ******, que no puede ser muy gore, que no puede tener demasiadas referencias por que la gente se pierde, que tiene que tener humor, que tiene que haber una mujer, y que debe haber escenas provocativas, todos los cliches habidos y por haber, todo para complecer al minimo comun denominador social",1
382,"I've always been a fan of Venom when I was young and so was excited for the film, unfortunately it doesn't live up to expectation, the plot is weird, things happen out of nowhere, plenty of laughable (not in a good sense) moments and many purely what the f*? moments, Tom Hardy is a terrible actor in this, there wasn't any depth to both Venom and Eddie Brock, I love his other films but this is definitely his weakest performance. The film tried to take cues from Marvel's approach to comedy but with terrible execution. If I wasn't with a friend I would walk out of the screening half way through.",0
384,This movie is definitely better than what critics think. There were no boring moments and the pacing was pretty good. The movie is perfect for people who are new to Marvel movies but it is still enjoyable for veteran fans.,1
385,"Honestly Venom was a good movie nothing award winning, but whose says that it has to be. I get that critics have a job to do as to make sure us as the viewers don’t waste our time and hard money, but I highly enjoyed watching venom. It’s not a perfect movie and you can tell some story plots are missing, but it didn’t ruin the movie for me. I wouldn’t mind seeing what the next installment will be.",1
386,Great movie funny in parts and plenty of action.Don't take the critics view see it for yourself you won't be disappointed.,1
387,"Ja Endlich! Endlich mal ein Marvel, der süß und nach mehr schmeckt. Ein toller Charakter, ein klasse Film. Hervorragendst abgemischter Sound, ordentlich zu Lachen, 3D und 4k gar nicht nötig. Kein zusammengerühter Einheitsmüll der letzten 20 Marvel Filme. Ich war fantastisch unterhalten im Heimkino. Wird überall gekauft. Digital und Retail! Gesehen über AppleTV4k, Arcam, Dynaudio und Panasonic",1
388,"I loved this movie!I would have been really happy to see an R version.The only gripe I had was the villain, the doctor was over the top for my taste and not really what I felt was someone to fear. He was more of a wimpy dick to help explain the beginning of how the Symbiotes got here. Even with that I still thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the movie.",1
390,"Venom wasn't such a bad movie. The story is decent and the fun aspect of it, is the relation between Venom and Brock. If the action was good, it was way too fast. I think the speed of it will annoy many viewers. The main villain is kind of an Musk style of rich guy, but he lacks charisma and has poor dialogues. The relation of Brock and his girlfriend doesn't ring true, and change too fast in a way or another. I give it a 65% because Venom and Brock were interesting characters and some actions are pretty good. I wish the villain and girlfriend would felt less like an after though in the story. Second watch: The film was better then I tough initially. Still the girlfriend relation wasn't very well presented at first but got way better in the end. I think the ending action sequence wasn't very satisfying but all the rest was fun to watch. The villain was a miscast and his logic didn't hold up to anything realistic. The credit scene is absolutely amazing. I upgrade my review to 72%. Tom Hardy is a great actor, if they can give him a better cast around him, that would be great.",1
393,"I dont get the bad reviews, for me this was prob the best film from Marvel.",1
395,I enjoy marvels one offs. This might have a sequel coming up though. Venom didnt take itself too seriously. Casting choice was great once again.,1
397,Guter Aktion Film. Nicht zuviel erwarten und entspannt reingehen und genießen. Nur die weibliche Hauptrolle nervt ein wenig,1
398,"I have to say having read some bad reviews I wasn't expecting much. Thus my enjoyment of this film was all the more unexpected and pleasantly surprising. Remember: this is a self-deprecating, fun and action genre. It ticks all three. Venom character was hilarious. So many good one liners. The action was tight and well paced. Not a big fan of Marvel films in general, most are pretty lame, but this makes my top 3 alongside Dr Strange & Guardians of the Galaxy. Will I watch it again? Yes. Probably more than once. Hallmark of a solid and enjoyable movie.",1
399,"Отторжение или симбиоз? Вот в чём вопрос...Во время просмотра первой половины ленты складывается впечатление, что данный кинокомикс создавался по лекалам времён старой школы, по типу ""сорвиголовы"" или ""халка"", где о подаче материала, антигероев и общей структуры повествования особо не заморачивались, главное чтобы костюмчик сидел. В сравнении со вторым Дэдпулом или не дай ""Стэн Ли"" последним Логаном, начало фильма ""Venom"" бьётся в конвульсиях, как симбиот при низких частотах, потому что не несёт какой-либо смысловой нагрузки, а если задаться вопросом: ""Какой у картины посыл?"", беря в обиход, как критики любят делать на этом акцент, то становится ясно из-за чего у них такая низкая оценка, ведь ответом будет словосочетание: ""Его нет!"". При этом как только кино преодолевает рубеж десяти минут размазанных на час, ""Веном"" из ненапрягающего уныния с парочкой смешилок, становится добротным боевиком с парой десятков бугагашенек, где игра Харди - фон для закадрового голоса ""чёрной грязи"", что и тянет всю оставшуюся часть киноленты.",1

404,"Dear god, this movie was SO boring, I couldn't even finish it. I can't believe a studio would produce something so bland and predictable in 2018. Well, from Sony, I wouldn't have expected better, actually. The plot is dull, the acting is terrible, the action and CGI are bad. Nothing, really nothing stands out in this movie. It was just boring and useless. I expected something a little edgy like Deadpool. But this Venom looks more like a Transformers movie. Long, boring and unfunny.",0
405,"While still having issue's, it was good to see Venom done right. And it is one of the better entries in the Spider-Man franchise. (I know Spidey is not in this movie, but it's a Spider-Man character/villain, I personally count it.) I'll give Venom a B+. (8/10) ""WE ARE VENOM!!""",1
406,"misconceived on a much larger scale..Venom Fleisher's Marvel entry is neither marevellous nor plausible in any whatsoever form of cinema. Even a commercial cinema attempts with all the dedication to keep the viewers tangled in its self-created world. But this is a poorly constructed tale that brags about pulling off a faster and gripping screenplay, in each frame. Whilst the truth is, it skips out the essential bits and makes less and less sense as it ages on screen. And this is the only graph that grows as it moves forward, it never fails to surprise us on disappointing with a newer tactic. The emotions are shallow, the action is a big mess and the visual effects are questionable. Now these were the thing to be expected upon, since the storytelling that is worth listening to, gets shucked away within first few minutes of the feature. Fleisher's comfort genre i.e. humor, too is forcely imputed and barely draws out a chuckle in its almost and over-stretched two hours. The characters are undercooked and hence are immensely difficult to be read upon, despite of having such loud one dimensional characteristics. Hence, it naturally makes the actors to fill in those shoes, difficult. Williams is disappointing but she is not the one to blame, similar is the case with Ahmed and Slate. Hardy had a wider range and when I say wide, I meant he had two roles to shift in every now and then, which he does convincingly in here. And addition to that, Hardy is a hard working actor living among us, his commitment on justifying the beloved comic character, is crystal clear in here. But a sinking script like such has no savior, not even someone with a caliber like Hardy. The chase sequence that is unnecessarily long, is purely banal where if taken a step back and thought twice about it, its existence itself can tell a lot about the feature. The so called thrills that it aspires to achieve is misconceived on a much larger scale than usual, the ""awe"" moments are barely the ""oh"" moments. Fleisher's execution is the frizziest composition of all, and mind you it had to compete with its equally challenging script. There are few things that it gets right which is the repercussions that it causes when something enters into your body and this is probably one of the best bit of it, as Hardy keeps resisting his inner voice. But these are the things extracted from the comic books, on terms of originality there is a void to be filled in here. The narration seems in awful rush throughout the course of the feature, which is something that itches especially if your beloved character is getting ripped off on screen. This mishap of few stunts, a big cgi action sequence, few twists and turns and one big seen-this-seen-that motto that would end up wiping out the entire world, is why it is more sad than bad. Venom is Hardy's tale, no matter what echos through that empty hall, the work is always to be looked upon.",0
408,"(67/100)Venom is not what I expected, it’s better. Definitely don’t believe the critics on this one, it’s an ok to actually good movie. The soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson was phenomenal and the acting was good too. I heard critics say that Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is a blank slate without any character, but he does have character, there’s just no character arc. The conflict within Venom and Eddie was really interesting to see. I love how Venom at first wanted to invade the Earth but then decides he doesn’t want to do that anymore, or that he confesses that he is kind of a loser on his home planet, it gives Venom a lot more character. The acts were a bit inconsistent in running time, the first act takes almost an hour and the second and third act take almost half an hour each. But apart from that, a fun movie to watch.",1
409,"Pros:-The action is decent.-The performances are quite good.-The score is good.-The visuals for the symbiotes in particular look great. Cons:-The pacing feels a bit off in a way I can’t really describe but I feel this movie would have benefited from an extra 30 minutes or so.-Venom’s relationship with Eddie and his decision to save the earth feel incredibly forced with little to no build up.-They don’t even try to explain how Venom survived being burned up after the final battle.-Some of the action feels like it was held back by the movie’s PG 13 rating. I feel like this movie could have really benefited from going full on R rated.Final verdict: Venom is a decent movie with some glaring flaws and I really feel it was held back by it’s desire to be under 2 hours and to be PG 13. If they had allowed for another hour or so and went full R rated, this likely would have been a lot better. As it is, however, it’s still enjoyable enough and if you just want to see a decent cinematic representation of Venom after Spider-Man 3 failed to deliver on that regard, I’d say go ahead.",1
411,"Better than I expected. Tom Hardy's acting was top-notch. Also, I really liked the humor in this one, I even prefer it more than the MCU one.The problems I found about the movie are the pacing and the plot, but it gets overshadowed by the solid performances of the actors and humor as I said.You should watch it, and don't listen to critics!",1
412,"""SPOILER ALERT""As Marvel movies go, this is a solid 8. Tom Hardy nails the part, fans of the Venom cartoon will recognize both Brock and the Venom Symbiote, and the Anti Hero humor of the cartoons have been very nicely translated to the silver screen. I dont usually like Marvel Flicks that much, but this one brought back my days as a regular buyer of everything Venom. Allthough its not the original origins story, it does fit seamlessly into the franchise. My only beef was with Carnage. I dont know why the **** they decided to recruit a hasbeen actor and stick a silly wig on him for the obligatory credits extra scene. It felt so off it was almost comedic in it self.",1
413,"I enjoyed it , thought it was good,  Needed an R rated version and a better end fight, i couldnt make out anything.",1
416,"There is nothing outstanding in Venom, the plot is quite flat, the villain is nothing memorable or even frightening, the photography and music was boring and the most disappointing of all is the main character, it seems that Tom Hardy was not enjoying what he was doing, some of the scenes were laughably bad. It's unfortunate that at this point and knowing the standard of quality that have maintained superhero movies, they offer us something like this. I know this come from a different studio but still, this could've been much better.It's very strange that Venom has his own movie, i understand that he is an iconic villain of spider man but maybe a solo movie was not necessary.",0

Lo que mas me gusto sin duda fueron los diseños de Venom que aparecen durante los créditos, fuera de allí me partí de risa en la sala en muchos momentos, pero no porque viera algo cómico si no porque era tan absurdo que no me lo podía creer.",0
431,"This movie Is not horrible like the critics are saying just had potential. This movie was without a doubt meant to be a R rated and suffered bad script plot holes and cuts because of It. But had some good Venom and the protagonist was the best part about this movie obviously. Tom Hardy's acting was excellent even through the bad script, and Venom was on point his look and voice were incredible and they have great dynamic between them. Everything else was bland Its like Sony gave up on this movie and put there focus on the sequel those credits were better than parts the movie itself.",1
433,"I understand what the critics are complaining about, but this is still a really fun movie. If you can turn your brain off just a for little while, you are gonna have a blast.

Was it as good as the last Avengers which has had like 20 years to build, no. But good enough that I was satisfied with the price of the ticket and the cost of popcorn! :)",1
436,"Watched the movie 3 days ago and didn't expect much due to the bad reviews. But as so often you can't go by those reviews since everyone has their own taste. I liked the movie eventhough it has a few flaws (like most DC/Marvel movies) such as (spoilers ahead) the lab scenes, where brock walks around with that doc and there is barely any security personel or that you don't see what happens with 1-2 symbionts. Overall it was an enjoyable movie that can be easily recommended to people that like superhero movies.",1
437,"Don't listen to the critics. This movie is great! Funny, with a very good pace, and great acting from Tom Hardy.Seems to me that only sh***y boring movies get great scores from critics.",1
439,"Why the hell critics hating this movie? I can agree the CGI could be better and there are some moments that are a little lackluster that should have been more in depth, but overall Tom Hardy was able to give a performance of an amazing Eddie Brock and also a great voice for Venom!",1
440,I Love venom becouse its showing you that venom is 2 beings in one thats why he says we are venom i love the huor and if you think venom is a serious character he is not he is always funny in the comic books the problem with spiderman 3 is that its hat eddie wants not the symbiote like when he says i want the spider you want the spider theres no we and the people who made venom understand that venom is 2 beings in one.,1
441,Venom is powered by Tom Hardy's exceptional dual performance with added humour making this a entertaining film even though it wasn't the venom movie I wanted to see.,1
442,"I don't understand all the negative reviews at all. I am the first to admit if a movie is crap, and Venom was entertaining. It's not a classic, but it is certainly not the Fantastic Four. There is nothing here that garners all the vitriol from critics.",1
443,"I'll admit that I looked at the critic reviews before seeing Venom. After watching it, however, I see that critics can be wrong. Venom is a great film. It's not a masterpiece, but it's miles ahead of what I expected it to be.",1
444,"I'll start off by saying this movie is no masterpiece. However, it is still a well done and highly enjoyable movie. As a fan of the original Venom and all of his iterations I thought this movie succeeded in adding to his character while not overdoing it. Tom Hardy was awesome to watch as Eddie and the interactions he had with Venom were some of the highlights of the film. Not to mention, some of the fight scenes, like the fight with the s.w.a.t team, were so cool to watch!If you're going into this looking for perfection, you'll be disappointed. Keep an open mind, sit back, and enjoy the show. Excited for the sequel.",1
445,"Except relationship between Eddie and Venom and Tom Hardy(The Carry of The Movie), everything in this movie is so bad.",0
448,"Nothing like what critics say (I never trust their reviews, go by user reviews) - This movie did well at keeping a comedic approach to a dark series. Hardy does well at playing the part of dark characters.",1
449,I think that if you are looking at the reviews for venom and just forgetting about it you are making a mistake. While from a critical reviewers standpoint venom is a very below average movie form the average viewer (The people who don't have a degree in film studies) it would be a good movie to go and see with some friends on a Friday night.,1
450,"The movie was good, I don't know why many people say was bad, the movie is funny, have good action scenes, good interactions between Eddie and Venom and nice plot, I hope Venom have a 2° part where we can see Carnage or Spidey",1
451,"Finally we got a ""Venom"" movie that most of Marvel fans ""Including Me"" are waiting for, the movie has a slow start, but after 30+ mins things start getting interested, it is a good start for a Venom movie, like we used to see in other MCU movies, you can't expect to witness the same level of MCU movies in ""Venom"", but it provides a decent story kick-off a one of the most loved villains in Marvel's World, the story is not very rich of what was happening, everything happens just so fast, but the conversation between the symbiot and Eddie is so iconic and adds some comedy, it is a recommended to watch especially for the fans, my only complain is I felt the movie is some kind of short.",1
452,"Фильм хорош, не знаю почему критикам он так не понравился. Самое взаимодействие Брока с Веномом вызывает как минимум улыбку. Сюжет звезд с неба не хватает, но он и не плох.  Экшен для такого бюджета очень хорош! В общем советую посмотреть.",1
453,"I almost didn't watch this movie based on the trailers.  They made the film look like a nauseating gore fest.Yes, it is occasionally quite gross, but it is not a horror film.  It would be more accurate to call this an action/dark comedy.Ignore the 'professional' critics AND the user ratings of 10.  This isn't a movie that should be riffed by MST3K in 10 years.  It also isn't Gone with the Wind either.What it is, if you can stomach it, is a pretty fun and occasionally silly ride.",1
455,"Не лучший фильм, конечно, даже не лучштй супергеройский фильм, и даже не лучший супергеройский фильм в этом году. Но я люблю вселенную человека-паука и Веном мне очень импонирует и на мой взгляд его очень хорошо адаптировали. Да, в фильме есть минусы, так же как и в любом другом, фильм не глубокий и не пытается им быть, но блин, его интересно смотреть... Единственный весомый минус для меня - рейтинг и то, что Веном ведет себя не как безжалостный убийца и злодей, а как подросток, которому все ново и все интересно.",1
456,"An awesome movie about a supervillian from another planet. The director is Ruben Fleischer, who is director of popular TV Show ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live’. The main role was playing by Tom Hardy.Eddie Brock is authoritative journalist, and he going to expose famous businessman Carlton Drake. But his influence is stronger and main character lost his job. Eddie doesn’t give up and penetrates to Carlton’s office and find a symboit called Venom. All symboit from other planet and they are need hosts to exist normally. Eddie becomes a host for Venom and together they are doing some supervillian’s things.I really liked Tom Hardy’s act, the cast in this film is awesome. Special effects and computer graphics are great and realistic. Venom, as it turned out, is really funny guy, but sometimes he eats heads. The script could be better, it very simple, but some dialogs are cool.In general, I’d recommend this film, if you want to see a good cast, cool computer graphics and Tom Hardy’s face.",1
457,"The film is cool, I do not know why critics rated it so badly. the only drawback of the film is that it is short (It’s about a half hour movie). But I liked the movie.",1
461,"This show is definitely suffering from some unfair reviews. I love the way it portraits a side of Venom that that I used strangely enough wonder about when watching the shows. This is not really a spoiler, but the way that the relationship between the two characters grows is different to what you'd usually see in today's super hero movies and definitely makes for entertaining watching.",1
463,it worser than spider man 3 put it that way and the way that they did eddie brock and venom is just very disappointing and its a spider man film without spider man,0
464,"Venom is directed by Ruben Fleischer, written by Jeff Pinkner, Scott Rosenberg and Kelly Marcel, and starring Tom Hardy, Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams.Screen story by Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg and it's about an investigative journalist Eddie Brock attempts a comeback following a scandal, but accidentally becomes the host of an alien symbiote that gives him a violent super alter-ego: Venom. Soon, he must rely on his newfound powers to protect the world from a shadowy organisation looking for a symbiote of their own.As one of the most anticipated movie of 2018, this review will contain lots of spoilers.. you've been warned!The plot of this movie is showing us that the symbiotes has arrived to our little blue planet, apparently by Carlton Drake, and then one of them escaped, and that's all! I wanted more, I wanted at least to know how did Drake know that these creatures are even existing, not only seeing the plane coming to Earth just like that, it was more than fast-paced than it should actually be.. and this is my biggest issue with this movie, it might be not that big, but when it comes in THE PLOT, it must be the biggest!!!Now to the first act... It was good as an introduction of every-single-one in this movie, but it went so slow-paced, it was fine for me after that huge fast-paced plot.The second act begins and the fun starts by Eddie gets Venom by Maria, and from that very specific moment (when Eddie got infected) the movie got so fun and fast-paced, with some amazing chasing mixed with action and a very exciting soundtrack, but it's not sinless because the second act has some very bad CGI, especially when the camera was focused on Eddie while driving. But Eddie talking to Venom was so amazing I can't describe how amazing these scenes were!! Then we get the very first whole Venom appearance scene, which was very good, but very short though, and here is another issue, we don't get that much of Venom scenes, we get his voice and some of his gadgets, I wanted more of that amazing creature!The third act was very good, I got satisfied especially when I saw the She-Venom, I didn't even think that they would actually put her in! Everything was great, until the finale, it was breathtaking, but very very short, but still very entertaining, but I hoped that it lasted more than what we got. The CGI was pretty good, and the soundtrack too.The movie was really good, I liked it, it disappointed me because I didn't get that much of the things I wanted to see in it, I mean the movie is just 1h 52min, they could have make it longer, but anyways it's some very talented performances except for Michelle Williams as Anne Weying, she was very annoying and I didn't enjoy watching her, and it has also a good story mixed with amazing action sequences and a great OST. I'm gonna give Venom a B+.Alright, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, let me know if you like my reviews or not, and I welcome all the comments.",1
465,"The movie is so bad its good, I got some enjoyment out of watching them try to make this Clusterf***ed concept work but overall it is not good film and it feels like another failed sony attempt.",0
467,Decent movie. I'm acrually quite happy that I went to cinema for this one. Looking forward for next chapter.,1
469,"Cumplre con lo prometido respecto al objetivo de una pelica, el cual es ser entrenida. En cuanto a la adaptación, no esperen el venom asesino y maldito de los comic's...",1
470,"Its was Funny, ""evil saves the world"", somethink new. Хорошое кино интересная подача, с друзьями самый раз, работаем ребята, работаемю",1
472,It is rather quite good movie which is worthy that you watched it...........,1
473,"Much better than anything Disney's MCU has put out, which is probably why the reviews are so bad. MCU babies and paid critics hate it.",1
475,"This is my favorite Marvel movie yet! A breath of fresh air with an amazing performance from Ben Hardy. It's something new, gives another perspective of ""superheros"", it's real. 10 in my book! ;)",1
476,"Critics in general have no clue what fun is, at least it seems like it. It is a nice enjoyable movie",1
478,"First of all, Tom Hardy was great as Eddie Brock in this movie.  Perfect casting.  It's a little different than what I remember Venom in the comics, with him being somewhat of a ""good"" guy.  Good amount of action and great special effects with a couple moments where you'll say, ""Sweet!"".",1
480,i don't know why everybody is hating on this movie. It was a good movie. I actually thought this movie was going to be bad by looking at the trailer. But it turned put to be pretty good.,1
481,"Tom Hardy can always do better, and there are about four minutes of Jenny Slate.",0
482,This movie is better than my expected.Please don’t listen to the”Critics”.If it rated R I will see it.A nice Tom Hardy.Love you and SONY!,1
483,"I would like to imagine myself as a moviegoer that has little difficulty understanding the limitations and differences between screenplays and and source material, rarely skirting that dangerous area between fan and fangirl, but rather keeping my expectations in check.This was not one of those times where I was able to pull back my idealistic view of what this movie could have been.First let me say that the actors did an amazing job, they really came out and seemingly gave it their all.The technical aspects, the effects, all were more than up to my needs for this movie.Then I actually watched the film for its story.I don't know what time constraints were involved, I don't know how much this script was pinched and puttied back together after being cut up and Frankensteined into what was (incorrectly) assumed to be a workable and decent plot with rich character development; what I do know is that whomever had the final word deserves a kick directly in the taint for this uninspired, unoriginal, bland, tepid, **** show of barely sensible tripe.My.God.This script was an abomination unto the entire history of cinema (Okay, maybe I'm hyperbolizing a tad there, but it was really bad)Moving from the R rating promised was understandable, letting this script go as a watered down buddy cop movie, was most certainly not.A big, fat, disappointed, 2/10 from me.",0
484,"I expected nothing and I'm still disappointed. It's just so bad, there is no good Venom movie and I'm really upsset about it. He is one of my favourite Marvel characters and I really wish to see a good Venom on the screen but I guess it won't happen.. It's not only bad Venom movie, it's a BAD MOVIE in total. CGI is really bad, Venom doesn't look good at all. The plot sucks, it looks like it was written by a ten year old boy who likes superheroes and wanted to write his own fanfiction. Some characters (like Eddies girlfriend) are just pointless and the movie would be good without them (or even better). The dialogues are horrible, the only good scenes are some dialogues between Eddie and Venom (but just some of them, not all). This movie is bad , boring, poor written, poor looking, just horrible.. I don't get why some people say it's good, it was so boring that I was waiting for it to end. And btw the ending is just as bad as the rest of the movie. I just really hope there will be no part two, if I had one wish it would be to delete Venom film from the universe because they're hurting this character so bad that it hurts me too.",0
485,"Honestly one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. ""Critics"" just have their heads up in their ***.",1
487,"A good popcorn movie if you want to have fun. Nothing special, doesn't surprise, but good in general.",1
488,"'Venom' is just funny. Don't listen to the critics since they expected a really serious, sci-fi horror film. The film itself is good, but the comedy just brings it right out of the box. So if you want a good laugh, then you should watch this.",1
489,"It's not a terrible movie by any means but it's indeed a really bad one, in terms of filmmaking at least. The performances are bland (But Tom Hardy was hilarious), the direction and cinematography are mediocre, the writing is really bad at times, the characters...Are there any characters? Eddie Brock is an idiot that becomes a loser by his own stupidity and he doesn't grow, doesn't have an arc, there's nothing, same thing with all the other characters, like the villain, the villain was so bad, so boring and generic and the writing and the actor's performance really didn't help at all. The CGI is overused to the point that the third act is just a CGI mess and borderline incoherent thanks to bad camerawork, and the biggest problem of the movie is that it's completely tonally inconsistent. What does this movie wants to be? Sometimes is a horror movie, sometimes it's a comedy, sometimes it's the typical campy, fun Marvel movie, like seriously, I don't know what this movie wants to be, because there are scenes that feel straight out of a generic jump-scare fest horror movie, and other scenes that are funny...Or unintentionally funny thanks to bad writing and hilarious performances.Venom ended up being a disappointment and tonally all over the place, as a movie, this is really bad, but as a so-bad-it's good movie, it's amazing. If you watch this you'll not get bored, trust me, I could rewatch this just to keep making fun of the bad moments.",0
490,"Underrated movie. I just love Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock. Real, low-key and no edgy. The story is decent. I'd rather see this warmer, dumber and more family-friendly version of venom coz it's just a movie. It is supposed to brighten up my life other than anything else. For that reason, it is better than most things available. Smh, those critics are a bunch of unemployed people who got nothing else better to do. What can you expect from them? ""Sh&t.""",1
491,"Venom got a bit too chaotic and noisy in the film, biting heads and eating people, making audiences cover their ears but didn't make them throw their popcorns or leave the theatre thanks to the fine plot and good acting",1
492,"An extremely encapsulating, and often funny, thriller. The viewer is sent into horror as Eddie's life comes crashing down, and is seemingly condemned to a life of misery after being taken over by an abomination of a ""parasite"". The viewer's spirit, however, is subsequently lifted and thoroughly entertained by the epic brotherhood shared by 2 polar opposites: the perfect character arc.",1
494,"Фильм прикольный в том смысле ты оказываешься в шкуре Веном ,но так сюжет на твёрдую 5 персонажи тоже ,но фильме есть и отрицание это было уже давно уже не помню............................потеря сигнала......................................",1
495,"I know many people like this movie but it just wasn't for me. Its like the Movie itself does not known which kind of audience it wants to entertain, and than you have this weird mix of an Movie. Its stupid but its has at least some good Humor. There are just to many missed opportunities that could made the Movie really great.",0
496,"Filme muito legal ,curti muito a atuação dos personagens e adorei o estilo das animações !!!!",1
497,Very entertaining film. I would recommend this film to everyone. The film succeeded as the majority of fans seem to like it,1
499,"As expected. The symbiote is here! Wonderful film, love Hardy’s role and way to play it. Still more to come...you know: painting the town red ",1
501,"Like always the ""critics"" behave like crybabies, don't listen to them, everyone had a great time at the movie theater",1
502,"Great film, done very well, copied right from the comics, I do not accept the criticisms of the kind of venom that is not aggressive that everyone expected, nice also the exchange of jokes and relationship between Eddie and Venom, I recommend it to everyone, I look forward to coming out of the sequel Venom 2, I would have preferred to see venom more, but it's extraordinary",1
503,"Venom es una de las peores adaptaciones basadas en cómics  de Marvel hasta la fecha, en la que Sony ha desaprovechado una gran oportunidad para ofrecer un producto distinto a Marvel Studios. Un film lleno de incongruencias, agujeros de guion y con una clara falta de originalidad.",0
504,"Critics know nothing about this hilarious film. Mixes tension, great action and humour in the perfect way possible. And    makes it more mature to reveal venoms true nature to both normal audiences and venom fans. Give this a watch, I guarantee you will enjoy it.",1
505,It's a good movie ! But venom is the character that should be R rated ! With bloodshed and bad words .,1
506,"Wow how do I rate a film like Venom? It's gonna be tough because I remember pretty much all of it but forgot how the main character comes into contact with the black substance. Anyways I saw Venom in cinema's and it stars Tom Hardy as the main character, Eddie Brick and it's a sci fi/thriller rip off of the Spider-Man villain type of movie released in 2008 and also has bits of comedy.  It's well done and great but not my cup of tea so I'd say it's just okay. Nothing too spectacular.",1
507,"The lack of Spider-Man may have disappointed critics and polarized Spider-Man fans, but this movie overall remains a blast, at least once you get past the meh first act. The movie’s script is far from anything great, but the solid performances (particularly Hardy’s), the fun action and the humorous Venom-Brock dynamic make the movie worth watching.",1
