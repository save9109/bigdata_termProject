0,"After watching this film at the Chicago International Film Festival, my original plan was to wait until closer to the film's actual release date to give my thoughts on it. However, after sitting with it for two days, with the images and sounds still sweeping through my mind, I cannot help myself. I will be as vague as possible, because I do not want to ruin the experience of seeing it for the first time, but I have to talk about it.La La Land, as it has been advertised, pays homage to classic movie musicals. Not only does it visually allude to films such as Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon, but it also preserves the upbeat, wondrous tone of those classics. There is something wonderful about seeing this tone and style recreated for a modern film. Cynicism and pretentiousness are completely absent from this film, and nostalgia and joy take their place.But calling La La Land a terrific recreation of the classic movie musical is selling it short. Like director Damien Chazelle's previous work, La La Land has much more going on narratively than the movie may lead people to believe. On the surface, this is a love story about two artists trying to make their ways in Los Angeles. However, this framework is deceptively simple.La La Land forces us to think about the realities of personal relationships and artistic endeavors. It explores the excitement of our dreams, the hardships of pursuing these dreams, and forces the audience to question the importance of both. Fortunately, Chazelle never looks down on the audience with these ideas. They are not presented in a heavy handed manner, and he never forces you to think a certain way.On top of its thematic richness, La La Land has one of the best understandings of film as a storytelling medium that I have seen in recent years. On the surface, it is the most technically astounding. The cinematography is stunning, and the soundtrack is beautiful. Even better is that both the visuals and soundtrack are never used in a way that is shallow or uninteresting. La La Land has an understanding of how to tell a story visually. It understands the power of sequencing, the power images can have on the emotional impact of a story, and the way in which these images simultaneously indulge our fantasies and remind us of our humanity.In other words, for me, it embodies everything that I love about movies.There are instances that everyone can recall in a cinema where we have felt what I like to call ""movie magic."" These are evoked by the films that completely absorb us into its world, and movies that have a lasting, personal impact on us far beyond the theater. They are the films that we hold as the pinnacle of what makes watching movies so great.La La Land is one of those movies.During its 128 minute running time, the only time I wanted to look away from the screen was to turn to the people around me and check and see if they were experiencing the same kind of magic that I was. I can affirm that everyone I saw in my theater was.La La Land is a masterpiece. It is not only the best movie of 2016 so far, but also possibly one of the best of the decade. It's spectacular, stunning, moving, and absolutely magical.",1
1,"I do like musicals, but I didn't like this one.  It's been a long time since I walked out of a movie, but I really wanted to today.  I stayed to the bitter bitter end.  I've never cared for Ryan Gosling or John Legend, and I still have no use for either. The whole movie fell flat. The opening scene was not entertaining. Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and Donald O'Conner must be rolling in their graves and rolling their eyes at this one. Best movie of the year? You cannot be serious!",0
2,"Since we're over 60, my husband and I have seen a few movies. This is 2nd one we have ever left and the only one where he has ever fallen asleep. We thought it was like a tired, old, truly corny Hallmark Hall of Fame set to music. I was a bit more patient and got all the way to the hunt for the Prius...really?  Gee, I think I know the ending. ; By the way, Hallmark has become a bit more edgey",0
3,my wife and i went to see this on my birthday. the best and most affecting emotional part of this movie was when it said THE END! i almost cried with overjoyeous relief of being rescued.,0
4,"I'm normally not a fan of musicals but I am a fan of this one. Gosling and Stone do a fantastic job and the journey their characters go through perfectly blends with the music. IMO, This should have won best picture over Moonlight.",1
5,"this movie was another version of the 500 days of summer movie and there were some better songs and better end ,but i prefer the 500 days of summer because of better story",1
6,"Me sorprendió para ser un musical, muy buenas actuaciones de los protagonistas. Sin embargo, una historia muy predecible, es la típica historia de amor con un final distinto.",1
7,Absolutely Loved ItLa La Land is by far one of the best movies of 2016 in so many ways.,1
8,"This movie is the perfect mix between an homage to classic musicals and a modern take on film.  The 4-season metaphor was remarkably meaningful looking back at the movie.  The idea that life happens in seasons is powerful, and that sometimes great things come to an end.  The cute couple doesn't always end up together.The music was the best I've ever heard. As I watched the opening scene play before me, I was inspired by their choreography and musical complexity.  I was instantly entranced in the mood of the movie.  La La Land takes a well-paced approach to the idea of Hollywood and shows the biting realism of life.Overall, the movie mixes musical and instrumental prowess with skilled performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling to make a film that felt more real than any I've watched before.",1
9,"Fantastic dance scenes and I really enjoyed the song ""City of Stars"". Liked the ending choice. Everything else is boring and dull.",1
10,"it looks like the best movie ever. plot, characters, music, dances, atmosphere, operator work, etc. is 10 out of 10",1
11,"Gosling and Stone shines and as a result Chazelle marks his name on the wall.La La LandChazelle is on a strike. With successive jaw dropping projects coming out, his passion grows more intense and the cinema much larger. Coloring the 70mm screen with rich mesmeric visuals, the director, Damien Chazelle is boasting his love with proper understanding of the Hollywood culture that he so blindingly adores. Not an inch goes by in the film that looks pretentious, working over a year on editing along with Tom Cross, Chazelle wishes you to understand the ""if's"" and ""but's"" of this show business in one note. And boy what a note it is. I am sorry but that hooked theme of Justin Hurwitz, whispered in every line of the film always sobers me up.All hail the production team for carving out this desert as fresh as it looks, from clothes to designing and from locations to set pieces, the view gets better and better and so does the performance. And daunting as this task may sound, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling might be the new Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. But unlike them they aren't quirky but are goofy about the relationship and flirty about their first love. If Stone going over the montages of failed auditions is a threat, then Gosling on piano is her equal competitor.I have always preferred them alone, one is happy being stubborn and intuitive- something that she later on adapts from him- and other being mature and hard on herself. Together, they would fall apart, they are meant to be, no matter how in sync are they while dancing and how pitch perfect are they while singing, their rhythm is too vacuumed by the outer world to float in one room, maybe they should have just stayed in that cinema hall, but despite of claiming it to be a La La Land, this is the reality, they had to get out.",1
12,"Perfect dream! The music, The camera work, The actors … oh wow. It should have won the Oscar for real.",1
13,"Si si si yo digo que si, es muy very good, si si si yo digo que si.pene pene pene",1
14,"this movie is almost perfect, every scene is beautiful great direction and plot. best soundtrack i've ever heard, i love this movie",1
15,"Mucho mejor de lo esperado. La escena final es demasiado buena, con mas detalles de los que aparentemente tiene.",1
16,"É um filme simples, artístico, puro, talentoso e inteligente. As músicas são incríveis, bem como a história, as personagens, o drama, a fantasia e a teatrialidade envolventes. ""La La Land"" é muito emotivo, inspirador, romântico e diz-nos que nunca devemos desistir dos nossos sonhos.",1
17,"""La La Land"" talvez até não seria o mais adequado filme para ser indicado aos Óscares, mas foi um filme muito bom com uma história bem romântica.10/10",1
18,"despite of having praises by movie critics, la la land is that musical film, a film that leave marks to the movie industry. we are all sure this will go down to be a classics because of the amazing performances of emma stone and ryan gosling. The movie is perfect, truly rare to find, we might heard that this is overrated but remove that kind of point of view— this movie is an absolute gem",1
19,"""La La Land"" is a colorful, stylish and nostalgic musical for the modern era with beautiful musical sequences, top-notch performances and a sympathetic plot.",1
20,"the best musical comedy I had ever seensimply outstandingEmma, Ryan both had done great efforts to made mia and Sebastian alive",1
21,"From the talented director of Whiplash, comes another musical masterpiece: La La Land. This movie is about the romance of aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), they both have great chemistry and they're one of the best movie couples in recent cinema, director Damien Chazelle had the talent to write and develop their relationship really well. As this is a musical, it obviously has many musical numbers throughout the movie and they're all fantastic and serve a purpose to the plot.The Good:-The performances are amazing.-The script, dialogue and character development are great. The chemistry between the main characters is just wonderful.-The score and music is memorable and beautiful.-The ending scene is one of the best ending scenes I've seen in a long time and the message it tries to give is sad but true: That sometimes couples need to separate and both go in different ways to accomplish their dreams. It's a lighthearted, depressing yet satisfying ending and it's more tearjerking with the beautiful music, the last shot of the movie is Mia and Seb smiling to each other is an amazing ending, pretty refreshing to see a couple actually not ending together, it makes the ending unpredictable.-Obviously the rest of the movie is as amazing as that last scene. The musical numbers are memorable, catchy and well choreographed.The Bad:-I think the only ""bad"" or not so good thing is Ryan Gosling's acting as Sebastian. He did a good job but he didn't really shine as much as other actors, specially his in-movie couple Mia (Emma Stone).La La Land is a masterpiece of a movie, I could watch it over and over and nothing of it will ever get old at least for me.",1
22,"With the exception of the brilliant opening sequence, another critical darling this year that disappoints. With so much talent - and given that this is a musical - could they not find actors who were better singers and dancers!?",1
23,"Neither I, my wife, or our kids got into this.  We turned it off about half way through.",0
24,"Después de 5 meses, finalmente me pude ver La la land, y aunque mis expectativas no estaban tan altas con esta película, me impresiono a final de cuentas es sus mayores aspectos técnicos, y hasta argumentales, no tanto en estos últimos, porque quizás los personajes no sean los favoritos de muchas espectadores que se vean la pelicula. Pero hay una cosa que no se puede negar, la musica de esta obra, llego para quedarse, siendo mis favoritas Another Day Of Sun, Someone In The Crowd y City of Stars, son totalmente memorables y hasta uno le da una buenas energías al momento de escucharlas. Y pues claro, que se puede esperar del mismo que dirigió Whiplash, que ahora va a estar a boca de muchos en esta nueva era de cine como lo esta siendo como Iñárritu o Guillermo del Toro que esta volviendo a sacar relevancia en estos tiempos.Quizás no sea la película que va a cambiar la industria, pero es una que deben apreciar a los que les gusta de buen cine y de aprender a analizar las características que conforman una película para los estudiantes o críticos que estudian cine.Aunque mi favorita para los Oscares seguirá siendo Arrival.",1
25,"Damien Chazelle's La La Land is a beautifully directed, terrifically acted romantic musical that elicits plenty of emotion ranging from heartbreak to joy.",1
27,"There used to be a time when movie critics were tough. I don't how many of you are old enough to remember Pauline Kael of the New Yorker, Vincent Canby on the New York Times, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, and of course, my favorite, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times. In those days, you couldn't just pop out a cute little movie and expect the critics to rave, uncontrollably. Those critics would dissect every fabric and every film cell. When they were done with their reviews you knew, pretty much, what to expect. But not anymore, cutesy movies like ""The Artist"", ""Birdman"" and ""Silver Lining Playbook"" and the like, are given way more credit than they deserve by today's movie critics. In fact, I think todays movie critics go overboard for anything that is just a little bit different.  Well, ""La La Land"" is a little bit different. But its just a cutesy little movie that's nice and neat. That's all it is. All of the glowing praise by the critics is laughable. Actually the best parts of movie are the scenes with John Legend in them",1
29,"Incredible. Stone shines in this masterpiece, with lovely scenes and a lot of dreams. Chazelle's direction is assured and makes the movie even better.",1
30,"I'm a sucker for movies about music and art, so my rating's a bit higher than it probably should be. Ryan Gooooosling is great, and Emma Stone is even greater. Damien Gazelle has outdone himself again. It doesn't end happily (I was afraid it would), which I enjoyed. It made the movie feel more real, considering that it takes place in Hollywood.",1
31,"When a talented director and a spectacular musician made together a movie, you already know it's a wonderful one. The story, the music, the characters and the actors inside this made this movie an epic art that will be on hall of the fame during hundred years. Well criticized, La La Land made me like musicals and L.A, city where I want to live now.",1
35,"Majestic! The setting is awesome, music is soulful and the story is so heart-warming. If you've always been skeptical about musicals, this movie is going to destroy all your doubt and principles about it. The Oscar's for best picture goes to...",1
36,"Beautifully directed and choreographed, this is truly a film to behold. The magical song and dance numbers, the simple but deeply relatable storyline, and the fantastic performances from Gosling and Stone are all reasons to see this heartwarming and wondrous film.",1
37,A joyous spectacle about the desire to dream in Los Angeles. The music is amazing with every shot of a musical number perfectly capturing that scenes purpose. The film is an all around dynamic achievement that should get many award nominations. It's one of the best of the year. A,1
38,This film is a true modern masterpiece. It truly makes you feel like you are watching an Old Hollywood song and dance like Singin' In the Rain. It is incredibly charming and at the end I felt like I was walking on air. The cinematography and color contrast were absolutely beautiful. The choreography and chemistry was a dream. I am totally in love.,1
39,"An unique celebration of cinema, art, music and love. It's amazing in all sorts of ways. It's a musical that hits all the right notes and makes us fall in love real hard with it.",1
40,"Una película maravillosa. Magistralmente dirigida, con algunos de los planos secuencia más hermosos de los últimos años. La coreografía perfecta, las canciones sencillas, pero difíciles de olvidar, y cómo no, los dos protagonistas. Es imposible no caer rendido a lo que estás viendo en la pantalla. Es una película, que, una vez sales del cine, quieres volver a verla, te deja un recuerdo muy bueno sobre ella. En conclusión, vaya a verla aquel que es amante del cine, no solamente de los musicales, pues es fácilmente la mejor películadel año, en conjunto.",1
42,"Brilliance! Irrestistable La La Land revitalizes the musical genre with such heart and sundrenched soul it's like a miracle unfolding before your eyes. It's tremendous - pure, unadulterated, silver screen magic and quite simply why we go to the movies. Let me be very clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with randomly breaking into song and dance - on screen or in real life.",1
43,"Apart from being stupidly cliche, everything is beautifully seamless in La La Land. The emotions flicker through the seasons, the songs skip & drag with the characters mood, and both Gosling & Stone deliver the performance of a lifetime. Everything is a metaphor in this silly, soulful throwback to Hollywood's infatuation with hope & desire.",1
45,"“La La Land” is a charming drama, romantic comedy and musicall tied together nicely by writer/director Damien Chazelle. Ably performed by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the film tells the story of an aspiring actress and a dedicated jazz musician as they search to find and realize each of their respective dreams. Ms. Stone and Mr.Gosling have never been seen or known as singers or dancers so the viewer is at first suspect and in doubt that either of these two can properly fulfill the roles the parts demand. To the surprise and satisfaction of all involved, they are a delight to watch and listen to as they seque from drama to musical numbers all in a subtle and lovely transition. This also lends to the credibility of the film and its story under the able direction of Mr. Chazelle. The film also provides the viewer with a delightful series of songs and jazz sessions which add to the positive experience. I give this film a 9 for it is not only a sweet, simple and charming story of hope and ambition in the City of Los Angeles but a reminder that good films can still be made using the once forgotten formulae of mid-20th‘century moviemaking.",1
46,"This is an entertaining film worth seeing. So go see it.That said, I am not happy to report that the movie comes up way short to its Hollywood and French musical antecedents; the gap between what the film aspires to and what it achieves is too great to ignore. The wide-screen Hollywood musicals were a tour-de-force of great singing talent, great dancing talent, flawless staging, studio lighting and cinematography. The actors just are not up to the task of singing and dancing, and I would argue that Ryan Gosling did not even act that well and served as a bit of a downer when exuberance is what was called for. The steadicam camerawork is really sloppy, frequently mis-framing and not using the wide-screen effectively, with many blurry portrait shots. There is occasional and shocking dark vignetting at the corners, and oftentimes mediocre to terrible lighting. The story line, dialogue and plot turns are as trivial as the movies of the past. It seems that the main virtue of the movie is that it is a contemporary attempt at the genre, but really does not offer a great critique or insightful iteration to those movies, it just is not as good. The insertion of the fake super-8 ""memory"" footage is one of the few attempts to change up the format, but it is a horrible and cheap conceit in any movie. The first scene promises what the rest of the movie does not offer, where the entire world breaks into song and dance. The romantic sparks between the two main characters for the rest of the film are not very emotional.",1
47,"La La Land is hands down one of the best (if not the best) film(s) of 2016. Gosling and Stone's chemistry is outstanding, the musical numbers are catchy as hell and well coordinated, the story is engaging, the themes are prominent, and, most of all, the background score by Justin Hurwitz is masterful. Overall, one of the best times I've had in quite some time and one of the best musicals to hit the big screen in decades.",1
48,"Essentially the Best Film of 2016. La La Land is a masterpiece and brilliant, it is romantic and poignant. I love Musicals and this was just perfect in every way. Damien Chazelle, like Whiplash, creates a world and story that everyone can connect to, dealing with striving for perfection or reminiscing old love. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have perfect chemistry, add with great song, music and lyrics, the movie can't get any better.",1
49,"Absolutely stunning. I had to make a 260 km journey just to watch this movie and that means 5 hrs on train here. And it was totally worth it. Acting, Cinematography and the music, everything was was perfect. Soundtrack was magical.Just loved it. Watch it in theaters.",1
50,"I was thrilled to watch this spectacular masterpiece. This is one of a kind movie, with beautiful music and surreal visual art. Feel the pain and love.",1
51,"This is the only movie in years that I have wanted to see twice (in one week!). Note the nods to West Side Story and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, but it is its own original film. Some people are complaining about the ending, but there IS a happy ending; just not the one you were expecting. Brilliant.",1
52,"This movie has fantastic music, some great dance numbers, it's just beautiful. On top of that the character's feel real and grounded, something that can get easily lost in a musical. Great musicals are great musicals, but this is just a great movie overall, topped off by being the best musical in theaters in a long time.",1
53,"I can't stand musicals. I still can't, yet I loved this movie. Go figure...because I can't. I may have rolled my eyes at the opening number, but after that I was transfixed, and when it was over I was looking up local jazz clubs on the internet.",1
55,"Charming and dazzling musical film. Doesn't matter if you are in love or not, you will love this film. I believe that in 2050, when someone asks Who's Ryan Gosling or Who's Emma Stone, the answer will be ""Oh, he played a principal role in La La Land some years ago"". As the film approaches to become an all time classic, like Casablanca or Cinema Paradiso. Heartwarming film, loved the soundtrack, has a nice mixture between past and actual Los Angeles. Deserves at least 5 Oscars: Best Film, Best Original Song (""Audition"" is quite better), Best Actor and  Best Actress.",1
56,"I sat next to an 87 year old man. After the first scene, he clapped and said ""wow!""During the audition scene he started crying like a baby and as soon as it ended he took off his round glasses and wiped off the tears with his sleeve.As soon as the movie ended, he clapped along with everyone else and he shouted ""Bravo! Bravo! BRAVO!!!""He then said,""I haven't seen anything like that in a very long time. The music, the girl, everything!""The first thing I need to say is that everything I write will be an understatement. This movie is better than anything I could possiblely put into words.The second thing I need to say is that you need to watch this movie.Justin Hurwitz is a musical genius. And this film is a musical masterpiece. Someone said they were getting tired of Chazelle's boner for jazz. Well, if every movie Chazelle does is as powerful and driven as this and Whiplash, I will never get tired of his massive boner for jazz.Hurwitz sets the tone using music in a way I have not seen since Lord of the Rings. He develops themes subtly when you least expect them and then blasts them into your face to trigger a serious emotional response. The first two songs, Another Day of Sun and Someone in the Crowd, meld together throughout the rest of the movie in a way that they become almost indistinguishable. Audition's theme is subtly hinted at when Mia is talking about her childhood, so you already heard the kernel of it when she starts singing it. Finally, the epilogue blends together every piece of music masterfully and all the themes, all the emotions come gushing out. The fact that Chazelle and Hurwitz came up with the idea for the movie together is what allows most of this to happen. The bond between what you are seeing and what you are hearing is so intrinsic that it becomes overpowering.Best soundtrack of the decade by far.",1
57,"There's not enough word to express how much feelings this movie can make you feel while you're watching it, if you love art as i do, you'll travel to a thausands of universes with every single note, every single scene and at the end of the movie you'll be flying to a sea full of colors.. Happiness, Sadness and love, pure love for art.If you don't loved this movie, let me tell you that you don't know the meaning of art.",1
58,"La La Land is pure cinematic beauty. Accompanied by Justin Hurwitz's beautiful music, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring Damien Chazelle's floating, dreamy masterpiece to life with careful, singing emotion. Why is La La Land so good? I think because it summarizes the crisis, the passion and joy, but also the sorrow and pain of an artist's life. Set in a magical, half-imagined LA, every movement and magical note is essential to the wholeness of this film, from the very first glimpse to the ending credits. Ryan Gosling's performance embodies the very crisis of an artist who loves music but is overlooked so badly. His half-bored, half-enthusiastic impressions make the movie very entertaining. Emma Stone is brilliant. Without her elaborately subtle and honest performance, the movie would lose part of it's magic. I believe she is one of the very best young actresses. La La Land challenges you emotionally, but leaves you much more richer in the soul. One of the best films I have ever seen.",1
59,"The soundtrack is almost perfect. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone aren't good singers by any mean but they fit their role and aren't bad at singing at least. Someone criticised their dancing skills. Idk, didn't pay much attention to that (but just because i don't like dancing in general). The plot is simple but well told, you get attached to Mia and Sebastian through the movie. There aren't secondary characters worth of noticing.If you are not nitpicky on their dancind/singing skills this film is a must-see.Because, i'd like to remark, they are not bad. They are just not that good at it.They are actors, and they shine when they can play their roles.",1
60,"La La Land is that rare movie that starts at the top and then goes on and up. At a time when musicals are not at all fashionable this one knocks it out of the park on all emotional and aesthetic levels. It is without question the best film of the year. An audacious opening song and dance number on an L A freeway sets the tone and here is where audiences will either embrace it or leave. Those who stay will be treated to one of those transcendent experiences that are all too rare in today's cinema. Who knew that Emma Stone could be this good demonstrating a range, and a voice, that takes one completely by surprise. Wonderfully supported by Ryan Gosling, the pair effortlessly create chemistry usually not seen outside a lab. Their renditions of a clutch of memorable songs are dynamically performed and stunningly choreographed. Stone's dulcet tones singing' Audition- The fools who dream' is heartbreakingly evocative and succeeds in raising the hairs on one's arms and neck. In fact the score and sound make the film seem like a throwback to an earlier age as does the gorgeous colour cinematography. Technically, every aspect of this unique entertainment has the wow factor. Emotionally the film is very well grounded with its biggest flight of fancy taking place at the Griffith observatory. Director Damien Chazelle trumps his achievement on 'Whiplash' by triumphantly reviving a moribund genre. That he has produced such a dazzling and accomplished piece of cinema in the process is no small feat. If this doesn't win best picture and actress at next year's Oscars (it will of course be loaded with them) then the Academy members themselves must be living in La La Land.",1
62,"I was blown away by this movie, both as a technical masterpiece and a poignantly human story. I created an account just to rate it, and I like neither musicals, nor jazz. I do, however, like cinema - and that is exactly what this is. 24k cinema.",1
63,"It's a first class artistic simple movie, Pure, Very talented directing, Music is awesome, Fantasizing is incredible, The drama scenes perfect, Great story, Acting very good, Directing view and technical directing and overall very fantastic movie should be seen.Very emotional, motivational, dramatic, romantic and it says never ever give up on dreams.Ryan Gosling did really good work and Emma did a really good work too,but when we come to Damien Chazelle we must raise the hat for that young talented man who can take you to another world with his writing and directing, We all must learn from Damien how artistic movies should be, He's an art school.It's really a masterpiece, Every thing in it is done perfectly and correctly.From the best movies of all time.Really enjoyable, Best 2 hours in this year.",1
65,"""All your jazz heroes, they were revolutionaries. But how do you expect to keep jazz live if you're such a traditionalist?""This quote drives what Damien Chazelle and the people behind La La Land managed to accomplish. La La Land has the nostalgic charms and beauty of musical theater, was uncompromising in qualities that define and is celebrated in traditional musicals. La La Land didn't just bring traditional musical theatre to film, it used film to take musical theatre to another level. La La Land overcame the shortcomings and limitations of theatre with film. Imaginative gorgeous aesthetics, excellent unobtrusive storytelling, impeccable directing, precise pacing, magnificent performances by the leads.. What makes La La Land work so well for me is that amidst the romanticized nature of musical storytelling and visuals, the story of the film is grounded in harsh reality. La La Land beautifully celebrates idealism to deliver a greater impact when reality hits.For me, as someone who loves the imaginative liberality of animations, emotional impacts of musicals and enchanting fantasy of art that leaves you at the mercy of its creators, La La Land is the pinnacle of a movie going experience so far in my life.",1
66,Boring. Cheesy. I don't understand some of the reviews at all. In fact I almost walked out. I just didn't get it. Normally I love musicals but felt the singing and dancing spoilt the story. My husband disliked it so much he said it would be a long time before he went to the cinema again.,0
68,"Acting was great. Dancing was ok Singing was eh. Story was really good and it was serious, and not comedy. There was lots more acting than singing or dancing, which disappointed me some.  But, we definitely enjoyed the movie. I'd love to see more movies of this type, but with people who can really sing (Anna Kendrik, Jeremy Jordan) and really dance (are there any around?).",1
70,"Postmodernism is a film theory that suggests that there is nothing original anymore. If it could be made, it has been made and we are doomed to simply remake a once original idea in perpetuity. Postmodernism also includes ideas regarding nostalgia and hyperreality, positing that cities such as Los Angeles may physically be real, but are in fact, dream worlds that are not actually there. In Damien Chazelle's latest work and, dare I say already, his magnum opus, La La Land, this theory takes center stage. Presenting a world of nostalgia of past love, of old Hollywood, and of jazz, La La Land takes place in the hyperreality of Los Angeles. Though undeniably a celebration of the past and showcasing Chazelle's admiration for old school filmmaking, La La Land is also a critique of nostalgia.To critique and subvert rules, however, you must understand them. You must embrace them and then tear them apart at the seams so that may no longer be put together. In the first half of the film, Chazelle does exactly this. With large, kinetic, and detailed choreography and musical scenes, the opening sequence is straight out of 1940s/1950s Hollywood with the golden age of MGM. On the wall of Mia Dolan's (Emma Stone) bedroom is a poster of Ingrid Bergman. Another poster in the common area of her apartment has a movie poster featuring John Lancaster and Ava Gardner. Mia works in the Warner Bros. lot across the street from where Casablanca was shot. She and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) have a first date watching Rebel Without a Cause at an old school moviehouse that uses film. The scene of Mia and her roommates strutting down the road is colorful, bombastic, and embraces the vibrancy of old school musicals. La La Land, right down to the details, is about old Hollywood. Similarly, it is about old school Jazz. Sebastian, a piano player, loves jazz and its history. He dreams of opening a jazz club honoring Charlie Parker in its title and replacing the bastardization of the music he loves with its pure past. With bright spotlights, a deep blue hue to the scene, and gorgeous suits, Sebastian's every look and action embraces the history of jazz. The film lush, jazzy score in these moments and its nostalgic song ""City of Stars"" embrace this world. Yet, both old Hollywood and old school jazz are merely a mirage now. ""City of Stars"" - a beautifully written and composed piece of music - is dreamy in its melody. It glides by and paints a gorgeous picture of a world that does not exist. This applies to the elements that celebrated here by Chazelle. They are in the past, though they can still be loved, they are not to be emulated. In creating this world initially though, Chazelle strictly follows postmodernism. He uses Los Angeles' hyperreality to create dream sequences that play out in real life. From Mia and Sebastian tap dancing with a view of the city beneath them or them floating up into the stars in an observatory, Chazelle highlights the city's dream-like state of being. During the entirety of the film, the city has a blue filter over it and the end result is that it feels distant and otherworldly. It never feels attainable and - in the minds of Mia, Sebastian, and the audience - the city exists solely in our dreams. And boy do our couple ever dream. Both have huge dreams and, initially, they encourage one another to follow these dreams. Mia follows her acting dream by writing her own one-woman play. Sebastian joins a band in order to raise funds. However, their obsession with the past tears them down. Mia fails. Her play is a failure and no one attends. Her only hope is a TV show that mixes Dangerous Minds with The OC and bears no resemblance to the old Hollywood style of filmmaking she so adores. Sebastian plays music in a band with a guy he hates as the lead singer and music that betrays the soul of the jazz music he loves. Both have sold out and have careened off course. Why? Because of the nostalgia. They became so infatuated with their love of the past, they tried to live it and become a part of the past. Unfortunately, time travel does not yet exist and this is impossible. Times change and things move forward. If you move to the past, you will be left behind in favor of the future. Here, nostalgia can be a destructive force and serves only to distract one from moving forward and attacking life. For Mia and Sebastian, their love of the past distracted them from their goals and, instead of working towards those goals, their reverse focus led to them walking backwards away from their goals. Their relationship even falls into this nostalgia, as evidenced by the very end. Chazelle breaks up the film into seasons, beginning with winter. Here, Mia and Sebastian are incredibly cold to one another and barely know each other. By spring, things heat up and begin to simmer. In summer, their love is brimming with happiness and joy.",1
71,"My wife and I purchased this film on one of the streaming services and settled in for a pleasant evening of light entertainment on a big screen tv with sound coming from a couple of thousand dollars worth of audio equipment, but it turns out we were all dressed up with no place to go. That is, this multi-Oscar winner turned out to be a loser that let us down on every front.For those who haven't seen it I won't spoil the story by saying that it appears to be an updated tribute to the old musical romantic comedies. Instead of placing the young boy-girl couple back in time, we see them cavorting on the crowded interstates of modern Los Angeles which feature countless Prius Hybrids rather than elegant RR Silver Clouds. The effect is mildly humorous but not romantic. The lack of musical talent in the two leads is neither funny nor romantic. We were reminded of the fact that long ago most entertainers could sing and dance decently if not wonderfully but today's stars are not that versatile. And it's pretty depressing watching the talent lumber across a screen that the old movie-makers would have killed to use for their productions.  We live in a time of technical marvels. This movie made poor use of them.Take the matter of color, for example. The look of the old Hollywood musicals was determined in part by the lack of subtlety of the color film available at the time. Knowing the limitations of the medium the old filmmakers used sets that made a kind of fantastic beauty. Everything looked perfect, though unreal. The control that filmmakers have over color today allows for just about any imaginable look. My question is who would choose to dress the characters as if they were in an old Hollywood fantasy and then photograph them against completely realistic backgrounds featuring brown palm trees, wilted flowers, and roads and buildings that remind us that our country's infrastructure is crumbling (one of the few points that people of all political stripes can agree on).Finally, I'm forced to ask WHY the audience is supposed to care about our lead couple. There's lots of talent out there working its heart out to get some good, steady work. Why should we want this particular duo to make it. They don't seem especially brilliant. When the young lady isn't selected for a part by a rather rude producer, I found myself thinking ""well, I guess he had something else in mind"". I mean, her performance didn't immediately grab me. She didn't jump out at me. And that has happened on occasion hen a great actor does a bit part in a film and you find yourself saying, my god! Who WAS that?!So all in all another mega hit about Hollywood that got great reviews from people who live in that world--I've noticed that film critics seem to give extra points to movies about making movies. I call it the Barton Fink effect.Maybe I'm getting old and have seen too many movies. But frankly I don' think that's the problem with a La La production that just seems flat and ugly.",0
72,"Beautiful film and great performances, I would say it has a big chance of winning an Academy Award for best picture. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone make a great couple in it and have a beautiful chemistry between them.",1
73,"Far and out the best movie I've seen all year, and with the very end of the year rapidly approaching, I think it's highly likely that it'll stay that way! I simply can't heap enough praise upon this film! Everything it about it was absolutely perfect and amazing! The song and dance numbers were all an absolute joy to watch and did such a wonderful job of paying homage to many golden age musicals and classic cinema! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have never been better and were perfectly in tune with each other! The story and message is universal and was one I certainly felt that I could relate to and many others as well I'm sure, because if there's any movie that you need to lift your spirits and remind you to always follow your dreams, this is the one to turn to without a doubt! Just when I thought that director Damien Chazelle couldn't possibly outdo himself after 2014's also brilliant ""Whiplash"", man was I in for a pleasant and more than welcome reality check with this film! Overall, it's a film that made me laugh, smile, and even just about cry tears of joy from start to finish! Why can't more films be as beautiful and joyful as this!? Then again, that's what'll help this film stand out all the more and make it remain not just as an even more unique and special film, but also an even more unique and special experience for years and years to come!",1
74,"I feel like I'm taking CRAZY PILLS!  La La Land wins the award for most overrated movie of year, perhaps decade.  Does anyone remember Crash?  The patronizing L.A. movie that trots out endless, unoriginal ""gee it makes you think"" race tropes.  Crash, the Movie that beat Crouching Tiger in the Oscars, and then no one ever watched it or thought about it again?  That's how overrated La La Land is.  La La Land is a little bit different from the stereotypical musical, and wants the viewer to celebrate these tiny progressions as something artistic and revolutionary.  There's no art here.  There's no deeper truth.  This is a sugar-coated musical that mechanically a little bit of conflict, a little bit of drama, a smattering of bittersweet notes in an attempt to seem real and genuine.  But La La Land fails, the script is a **** formula out of a community college drama writing course.  It's as fake and self-congratulatory as the Hollywood film industry, pretending to be brave, when it's really a cookie cutter drama.  The sad thing is that, like Crash, the critics fell for it.  The academy will probably fall for La La Land too.  This movie will probably take attention and awards away from movies that deserve attention.",0
75,"With the overwhelming level of cheesiness in the opening two numbers and as I'm not exactly a fan of musicals I was worried I'd hate La La Land. Thankfully my fears melted away in this beautifully captivating story. Perfect chemistry, aesthetic set pieces and as for the music, well it's definitely one of the best movie soundtracks in recent years. Not necessarily the songs but the score itself is fabulous. Ryan Gosling looks better than he sings yet he sings better than I thought he would. The show stealer is without a doubt Emma Stone, giving an emotional and Oscar worthy performance. No my heart didn't break but I was lost in this wonderfully dreamy movie. Highly recommended.",1
76,"Was weary heading into this movie given that I don't care much for musicals, but I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by this flick. Beautifully shot, nice jazz numbers, and who could not find Emma Stone hot in a ""wifey material"" kinda way. Haven't seen too many classic hollywood films, but this movie inspires you to want to dig and see what's out there.",1
77,"Listen very carefully. I cannot imagine being the only person alive who interprets the ending to this exquisitely beautiful movie the way I do? Oh by the way the Oscar race for best picture is officially over two months ahead of time because La La Land will win in a landslide. But back to the confusing and vaguely nightmarish ending. If you insist on labelling it bittersweet then at least recognize it as five pounds of bitter and four ounces of sweet. But here is the clincher. The ending is not real. Think back to when Mia was in the restaurant with her boyfriend and another couple. Bored out of her mind and feeling out of place she is startled to hear the pretty piano motif that Sebastian was playing at the supper club she had wandered into earlier in the movie. Alas the music could not have been playing on the juke box because it was Sebastian's song and at that point he was just a nobody with no record contract. So it is our first taste in the movie that something surreal is taking place. She escapes and meets Sebastian at the movies to see ""Rebel Without A Cause."" As they are just about to explore their first kiss the screen dissolves. Later on in the movie as shadows start to hover while driving by the same retro movie house she notices it is shuttered up for good. Just like the real life star of the movie James Dean who died prematurely. During the latter half of the movie I was wondering and anticipating when the next song and dance number would take place  since the previous four were so swoony and catchy and sweet. Soon Mia and Sebastian have their first serious fight over a surprise dinner Sebastian had made which echoes a line in a Smiths song that goes "" I just liked you more when you were hopelessly poor."" Sebastian reels Mia back in after her seemingly failed one woman show and after some give and take he talks her into another audition. It is at this point much like another movie set in Hollywood ""Mulholland Drive"" where the story turns surreal. Mia sings her heart out during the audition in a song entitled ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream) with lines that include ""and died with a flicker and I'll always remember the flame and I trace it all back to that"".She has one last hesitant talk with Sebastian before heading off for Paris to prep for her breakthrough role. The movie jumps five years later and we see that Mia has obtained stardom as she orders form the very same barista she used to work at and jumps into her mini cab to be shuttled back to the studios we presume. But you sense a chill in the air and a lack of intimacy we have felt throughout for Mia. We discover she has a husband and small child around the age of two or so. Everyone in the audience is asking the same question? Why isn't she with Sebastian her lover and dance partner with the stars? Mia and her husband are heading to some event or something and there is another traffic jam similar to the one that opens the movie but this one is at night. Mia suggests they veer off and they end up stopping at a jazz club. Lo and behold it is Sebastian's club ( he finally opened up his own club) and it is named after Mia's suggestion Seb's with the cute bar note replacing the  apostrophe just like she suggested. After some music Sebastian,  master of ceremonies appears and spots Mia in the crowd. He sits down and plays ""their song"" the motif she heard the first time she saw him playing.  Her mind is swirling in technicolor musical magnificence as she imagines an alternative life with Sebastian and ""their"" child. Sebastian finishes the song and Mia decides they should leave. But before parting she glances back at Sebastian with tears in her eyes of memories and what could have been. So why the mysterious and vaguely bewildering ending to this sublime piece of movie making. Think folks. Do you really think it is plausible Mia would not know that Sebastian now owns a club in the very town she has been working in? Although it is not directly implied Sebastian in real life must have died probably while Mia was in Paris and Mia was imagining her love in an alternative setting. We first see Mia in the movie improvising in her car rehearsing. By the end of the movie she has nailed the acting part down with her heartfelt ""Audition (The Fools Who dream) song but this heartbreak carries over and fuses with her own life as her true love has vanished as well.",1
78,"This movie is cool. I barely had any flaws with it (except that it's not as excellent as Whiplash, of course :) ). This was the director's dream film that he completed the screenplay for even before he wrote Whiplash, and you can clearly tell. The change in location that the director made to Los Angeles (from Boston, I think) was not noticeable at all, especially since this movie makes quite a use of the location.",1
79,"This movie reminded me of lot on old Hollywood movies from 40's and 50's. I think it will get Oscar for the best picture .Is it worth to see. Personally, I don't watch musical, but I was not bored at all and this movie has lot of colors",1
80,"La La Land is an incredible film. Fans of old school musicals will enjoy the homage and references the film gives. Those tired of it will appreciate the meta-self-aware approach the film has and how it finds something new to say about it. Film buffs will enjoy the care put into the film from the cinematography, inclusion/lack of music, and meta-commentary. All of it comes together to form an incredible whole that deserves to be seen by everyone.",1
83,"Everything worked in this film for what the director was going after, and the result is not only the best film of the year, but also one of the best films ever. It's an instant classic, and I want to add this to my collection ASAP. If you'll notice, the major complaint that this film gets is just over the ending. And, specifically, that it's not how the audience wants it to end. Hear me out: those people are stupid and don't know how to watch a film. The core point of this film, and this builds gradually and gracefully throughout, is that sacrifices must be made in order to accomplish your dream(s). This film captures exactly what LA is - a wasteland populated by transplant dreamers too full of regret to not be bitter, to not be made jaded and cynical from a city that will chew you up and spit you out faster than you can scream for help. And its people; self-centered, and ambitious--constantly treading water just to keep their head above water in the hopes that they'll be alive long enough to find their own island of success. If anything, trying to find and maintain true love does, in fact, become the antagonist--just as it is in this film. At the end of the day, the inevitable choice must be made over the questions: why did you move here? What do you really want? To boot, performances by all were incredible. The soundtrack is perhaps the best in a decade. Though it is serious, and a harsh slap of reality to the face of any dreamer out there willing to pack it all up and move out to La La Land to go after their calling, it delivers 100%.",1
84,"Soaring and fierce, no wonder La La Land is sweeping all the awards. It is a movie from the heart, to all hearts, very well crafted and visually stunning. The most important factor is the performances. Ryan Gosling just gave it his all, and Emma Stone may have just reached the peak of her career (which she will last up upon with her pretty face and her funny persona). The soundtrack is dreamy and able to take you places. You will not stop smiling while watching this movie, take it from me. This film is gonna be in 10~20 years what Titanic or Shawshank Redemption or any Hitchcock is today. 10++++/10!",1
85,"In just his second feature film, director Damien Chazelle has transcended to the heights of such auteurs as Jacques Demy and Vincente Minnelli; two other filmmakers who cut their teeth in adapting musical narratives that could only be told through the filmic medium. And make no mistake, ""La La Land"" is one of those narratives as well. Do not read about it. Do not ask your friends for the CliffsNotes version. Don't even preview the soundtrack on your train ride to the theater. Just go and experience this joyous, wickedly funny, impeccably well-realized jaunt through the stars. It's well worth the anticipation.",1
86,"Wow oh wow! What a film! After much anticipation, I finally got to see the follow up to director Damien Chazelle's breakout hit ""Whiplash"". This movie blew me away. For someone who is not into musical's, this one locked me in from start to finish. Every song in the movie is fantastic and the musical set pieces truly compliment the songs in such stylish fashion. This is very much in the vein of 1940s and 1950s musicals while still being its own thing. The movie is also a love story between Mia and Sebastian played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. This is not only their third collaboration together, but easily their best. Both Stone and Gosling give the performances of their careers. They bring out a lot of great comedy and make you believe that anything is possible. I believe they both should get best acting oscar nominations. The movie showcases the struggles of following your dreams with the complications of being in a relationship. I love how the title has a double meaning. Los Angeles (where the movie takes place) is also known as La La Land. The place where dreams are made. However, the movie shows how difficult and frustrating that idea can be and how the real world is nothing like the movies tend to make it out to be. Which leads to why the movie ended in such a heartbreaking but touching way. It takes hard work to pursue your dreams, but not everything turns out the way you want it in the end. There are some sacrifices to be made in life and the ending really hit me hard with that message. This is by far the best movie of 2016! It is a beautifully directed musical that presents interesting ideas while paying homage to old classics. I give ""La La Land"" an A+!",1
87,"This is a fine movie, no doubt. I did go in expecting more based on the soaring critical reviews (one critic called it the best movie in 6 years, and said he went back 7 times.), so I was a bit disappointed on these standards. However, it is the best musical I have seen in a long time, it is exceedingly original, and the two leads are stellar. Definitely one to be seen on the big screen.",1
88,"La la is a genuinely spectacular movie. It is a musical which was not clear to me before I went in, but that just mad me even more excited to watch. La la land. La la is a love story between Gosling and Stone - a tale about a destined romance and chasing dreams set amidst a hotch potch of musical eras and themes.  It's a musical and visual smorgasbord - and the piano work by Gosling (real or produced) is amazing. the occasional dance scenes reinforced the nostalgia. Beautiful from beginning to end.",1
89,"Set against the backdrop of LA's burghal landscape, Damien Chazelle successfully evokes Hollywood's golden age of cinema. The characters are drawn to LA by the lure of glory and acclaim. From the opening number (gorgeously choreographed on one of LA's many freeway exchanges) the aspirations of many of those who dream of ""making it big"" set up the film to complex these dreams.The common tropes in musicals is starkly evident: opening number to establish current events, introduce main characters and then confuses their wants/needs. La La Land seemingly deviates from this typical structure by setting up their love before finally revealing that pursuing your dreams requires sacrifices- and the film leans heavily on holding onto your convictions of stardom no matter the cost. Chazelle beautifully shows near the end of what the two main characters lives could have been. Dreaming of aspirations despite insurmountable measures is what carries this film throughout- and at a time in the world where hope is needed most. Technically speaking, Linus Sandgren's cinematography is stunning at every measure, further paying homage to a dead movie-musical era; Gosling and Stone work expertly together in two touching performances; above all, the convictions of the film are worthy of among the best films of the year and an interesting case study of American-based hopes for a better life while not letting go of your identity.",1
90,"I really did not expect to enjoy this movie.  So many people I know hated it.  But, I have to say I loved it!  From the opening sequence that shows people stuck in a traffic jam on the freeway getting out of their cars to dance and sing, I fell in love.  The movie is utterly charming and some parts are dreamlike.  Of course, the singing is not up to a Broadway musical's standards, but you just have to love the music.  It boils down to a romance between two people trying to make their mark in Hollywood and how it all effects them.  Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are perfect in their roles, she an aspiring actress and he a musician who wants to make it in the big time.  But, I have found that people either love this movie or they hate it.  I hope you love it.",1
91,"""I guess I'll see you in the movies"".""La La Land"" follows Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a dedicated jazz musician, struggling to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts. With modern day Los Angeles as the backdrop, this musical about everyday life explores what is more important: a once-in-a-lifetime love or the spotlight.Back in 2014, there was a film called ""Whiplash"" that blew everyone away, including me. It was my 2nd favorite movie of that year and I had my eye out for the director next project. Wasn't very long until Damien Chazelle next film in was in post-production and was already a serious Oscar contender. I think ""La La Land"" and ""Silence"" was my most anticipated movies of 2016/17. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.""La La Land"" is one of the best musicals I've seen since ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Singing in the Rain"". It's a movie that lifts your spirit up and leaves you smiling though out. Even with today's generation of loud politics, four years of Trump, celebrities dying, and endless amount of pointless controversy. But then comes a musical about two people who are dreamers, that deal with inn conflict and show how dreams can lead to success. By making the impossible possible while living in a place where dreams come to die.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were both dynamite in this movie. The relationship was sweet and relatable that I actually cared for what was going on. Even with the singing and dancing use as a tool that the characters express their happiness, sadness or disappointment was terrific. This is the best I've seen from Stone and Gosling. Both of them sparkle in this musical.Damien Chazelle, what can I say about this guy. Chazelle as a film making is both amazing and inspirational. He's on a roll recently and if he's next two movies are brilliant, then he is the best living director today. In ""La La Land"", he follows a similar theme in his previous movie ""Whiplash"" about fighting for a dream and jazz, but this movie goes for more a light tone than a dark one. For the dramatic elements of the movie, I really like how he lets it go on for awhile as an emotional effect. He also got an eye for spectacle, because LA never looked so beautiful and fairy tale-like. What else is there to say, but Chazelle nailed it.Without spoiling anything, but the last shot of this movie was so beautiful and yet sad at the same time. Chazelle sure knows how to end his movies and that's with a powerful punch.My only complaint I have with the movie is that a few scenes could've been trimmed a bit, as it dragged for me. And while the homages to old musicals were fitting, but some was a bit down your throat. I wouldn't say repetitive (because it's not), but more of a ""alright, I get it"" kind of complaint. That's really it for flaws.Overall rating: ""La La Land"" is simply wonderful. It's a firework of joy and excitement that it's really hard not to fall in love with it. I'm already looking forward to ""First Man"".",1
92,"A musical filled with less singing (which was good) und dancing (which was okay) and with more story. This story of two dreamers, who find each other in troubling circumstances will charm you, bind you, but a spell on you and break your heart. A modern setting which feels like a trip back in time to 1960's Hollywood, a great performance by both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, along with original songs and a beautiful scenery, will let you escape the world for 150 Minutes. Let it fill your heart with emotions and live a story you'll never forget.",1
93,"La La Land is quirky, realistic and heart wrenching. Whilst coated with deliciously shot and acted scenes that will leave you smiling, the film never shies away from the harsh realities of life.",1
94,I am not one for romance movies but by god was this a fantastic movie. I loved the characters of Emma stone and Ryan gosling. They felt real. Relatable in the sense that they are two ordinary joe's wanting to pursue what they love but struggle at. The camera work and dancing were all fantastic as well. especially at the end which I will not spoil but you should see it for yourself. I love musicals and i love jazz music so naturally i was going to like this movie and i did. The trailers were so bad at advertising for this movie. I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for a good romance movie with two leads that have fantastic chemistry. I will be so mad if this movie does not win an Oscar of some sort.,1
95,"Surprisingly charming and well-produced bit of entertainment. A feel-good movie with a couple of actors who demonstrate their talents, energy, and charisma.",1
96,"La La Land is a beautiful film about the loving relationship between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and their passions for acting and jazz respectively. It tells a really grounded story that focuses on the characters making you fall in love with them. The casting is on point, Emma and Ryan give amazing performances and have really good chemistry together. The writing is thoughtful and clever as well, providing a great message and sastisfying twists along the way. And because it is a musical, I of course have to mention the dance pieces. They are wonderful. I love the song choices and the choreography of the dances. I also really appreciated the cinematography, as they chose to use a lot of long takes with smooth zooms and pans to follow the action rather than cutting all the time. And coming from seeing Whiplash I really enjoyed all the little references to that film, I feel as though La La Land is an unofficial sequel to it. Overall, it is a beautifully crafted film with a lot of heart and wonder. If you are a fan of musicals or just great movies in general you need to see this one.",1
97,"Damien Chazelle gives us another solid example why he is one of the best new directors of the last decade with his ever growing signature style of crisp production design, sublime cinematography, and a mastery of all things to do with music by perfectly resurrecting the big budget movie musical. Stunning single take numbers, wonderful choreography and composition, and of course the engaging chemistry of the two leads make La La Land a perfectly reasonable choice for the best film of 2016.",1
98,"Corky and endearing in the best possible way. Somehow Chazelle is able to make this tribute to old time Hollywood incredibly refreshing. While I would have been happy just watching Stone and Gosling dance and flirt for the entire 128 minutes, this movie packs a serious punch as well. The cinematography was insane throughout and really brings the whole movie together. I thought the sound editing in this film was pretty good, save for a few chorus numbers, which is actually great accomplishment for a movie musical.",1
99,"What’s it about?An aspiring actress (Emma Stone) and a jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) meet and fall in love in Los Angeles, musical style.What did I think?La La Land is simultaneously a loving homage to the golden age of cinema and completely uncharted film territory; nostalgic and new all at once. It delivers the feelings of falling in love in a heady, melodic rush that’s absolutely captivating. It channels films such as ""Singin’ in the Rain"" and ""An American in Paris"" whilst navigating the modern pitfalls of romance. But it’s so caught up in the quirky and magical “newness” of its concept that towards the middle it seems to rely solely on that. Unfortunately, this means the pacing feels at odds with the gloriousness of the rest of the film. But the magic returns for a finale guaranteed to take your breath away.",1
100,"I figured this would be a chick flick, boy was I wrong. It's a love story but it's also the love of their arts. The dancing, the music, the way its filmed. Movies like this in my opinion only come along once every 5-10 year. I'm buying this so I can enjoy it again. It's a beautiful story.",1
101,"It’s shot in cinemascope, it’s big on pizzazz, it’s packed with bold color schemes, the stage lights appear straight out of a dream, it’s big one minute and quiet the next, and every song and tune will replay in your head days after it’s all over. No, you’re not in the 1950s, and no, you’re not in Kansas anymore. This is the present-day reality. So forget about those loud action movies with no respect for the stage, La La Land proves what can and should be done with the long lost art that is the moving picture.The joyful musical genre has been in the Hollywood cemetery for too long now, but even rarer now is a musical with entirely original music in an entirely original story, which director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) achieves with expert choreography. While he may give Southern California a bit too overly glamorous of a view with no dark edge, he still recaptures the same zest of West Side Story while cranking the spectacle up a notch. It’s always a challenge for any serious director to stage a film where everyone breaks out into song without it oozing Disney Channel cheese, but Damien Chazelle has done it!Within Chazelle’s cinematic recreation of Southern California, he fastens our seatbelts through the bumpy relationship between two artists over the course of four long seasons, starting at the heat of Christmas. One is a ruby-red aspiring actress who cannot land an audition, and thus must serve coffee under a careless manager to make ends meet. The other is a Fred Astaire-Dooley Wilson mash-up whose fast fingers command jazz on the piano, no matter what his boss wants him to play. After they first meet over road rage at rush hour, these distracted minds find that destiny has forced them together with coincidental run-ins day after day. Everything after that is as pure and classic as dancing under a full moon.Once we learn about what these two have in common, boy is it the beginning of a beautiful friendship! He wants to revive Jazz as a modern art form, but she cannot stand listening to it, and this subject alone stems all the other conflicts that these two share over the course of a year. It is a pleasure to see the ups and downs of their romance, even if the other people in their lives are treated by the screenwriter as if they don’t even matter.Yet it’s not the supporting cast who helps us to understand their relationship, but the numbers that project their thoughts onto the moment. On their first formal meeting, she hears his piano playing as lit by a single spotlight, as if she’s glancing into his own little world. On second formal meeting, they tap dance in front of a skyline at twilight. On the first date, they are swept off their feet—literally, to a dance against the stars in a planetarium. On the tenth date, they sing an Oscar-worthy duet. As time goes by, the dream of making it to the top of the world in Paris quickly diminishes. Her tears swell up along with the audiences’; I’ll even admit I choked up as well, and I’m a man.This wide variety of tone in music is plentiful yet wisely spare, celebrating the history of cinema magic while wishing the best for its future. Yet also like the oldies it writes its love to, there are one too many white players in the production. There are two African Americans cast, but as dancers on the pier who say not a word, just as blacks were stereotyped in that golden age of Hollywood. If this production was less focused on making a musical spectacular and more focused on showing care and attention to today’s media-frenzied audience, then there would have been a better likelihood for this to surpass those repetitive comic book movies at the box office.I sincerely hope for the day when people return to their senses and offer their money to movies because of their cinematic quality other than their branding. Considering how much music is now taking over our culture, we could use that reminder of how much music raises our self-esteem when times are hard. After seeing what La La Land can do with both old and new styles of filmmaking, I can absolutely assess that I love musicals all over again! Therefore, I encourage everyone to go see this magical delight to raise the spirits for 2017. After all, tomorrow is another day!",1
102,"It is both very strange and fascinating that this movie is in my head for like one week and the best thing, is that i want to see it one more time, or even more that one more time. This is one of the best movie I have ever seen. 10/10!",1
103,"Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is a nostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' is anything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three films under his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like 'Singin in the Rain', 'Umbrellas from Cherbourg' and even 'Rebel Without a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least, after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helped them become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music is bouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sum up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los Angeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I have had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I would typically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic.",1
104,"La misma historia de amor de siempre, lo interesante es su final; eso la hace  deliciosa. Poesía absoluta en el montaje audiovisual. Fotografía impecable. El Director es un genio. Y por supuesto la música tiene un carácter memorable.",1
105,"Abis nonton Whiplash nonton ini ... emang bakal kecewa dikit. Tapi sebenernya ga bisa dibandingin, beda genre Gan. Satu thriller Musical, yang ini romansa musikal. Tapi emang keren banget ni film, ga heran Gosling dan Stone masuk nominasi. 7 nominasi Gan ... bayangkeun ... Ruarrrrrr",1
107,"This movie grew on me after leaving the theatre. I didn't think I would fall in love with the playlist, however, days later and the songs are there. While the story could use some work, the direction was incredible. Complicated long-shot scenes, show the commitment Ryan and Emma put into this movie.",1
108,"A charming film, and so nice to see a musical that plays tributes to the great musicals of old. Nice chemistry between the leads and the story wasn't predictable. More like this please.",1
110,"The poor dude carried the absolute crap out of her for the entire movie (gave her the motivation and confidence, made her write her own play, made her go to the audition) without ever complaining, only to be left heartbroken while she seemingly has it all in the end. But hey it's just the guy so who cares, feel good movie of the year right there 10/10.",0
111,"The best movie of 2016 -- two outstanding performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, excellent direction, and a story that will charm the socks off you. Sometimes it really is hip to be square, if you can surrender your cynicism about the world for two hours.",1
112,"I am not big on romance, and even less a fan of musicals. So the fact that I adored La La Land is saying something!Gosling and Stone play likable characters who you latch on to and root for from beginning to end, the direction and cinematography is perfect and (thankfully) the music is phenomenal. This'll be yet another 2016 movie soundtrack I'll be playing on repeat. The film also has a refreshing old-timey feel to it with the music and some certain scenes, it's a perfect blend of old-timey in modern day. Simply put, La La Land is a wonderful, euphoric, feel-good movie that I cannot wait to watch over and over again. In my opinion, the best film of 2016.",1
113,"I´m clonflicted on this one. I give it an 8 due to its beauty, charm, elegance and the perfect and very surprising cast. Emma Stone fits the role like a glove. She is the film in a way. Ryan Goslin is absolutely perfect in the role too, but he has way less to do in the film. The opening is so fresh and engaging. And I found the last 10 minutes to be perfect too. However, I was not that engaged in the story. Emma´s character is quite unlikeable. And Ryan´s character is cute, but still not engaging enough. For you to be really involved in a film you have to care about what happens. There are also a few moments where I lost the interest and got a little bored. It also had some stereotypes going on. I still give it an 8 for all the effort and the beauty in it, and the acting. I´d feel bad giving a film like this a lower rate. But it didn´t wow me, or move me.",1
114,"If this is not a masterpiece, then i don't know what is. The soundtrack, the plot and the directing were absolutely top notch! I believe its going to be remembered for many decades!",1

116,"As vezes assistimos a filmes antigos que nos trazem brilho no olhar e ao mesmo tempo nos perguntamos: ""Por que não fazem mais filmes assim?"" La La Land é sobre isso. Um sentimento saudosista que mescla o melhor da era de ouro de Hollywood, mas sem pesar demais na nostalgia, tornando-o assim, uma espécie de retro-futurista.  Mia e Sebastian são dois sonhadores vivendo em Los Angeles. De um lado Mia (Emma Stone) sonha em ser uma atriz famosa, porém em meio a tantos testes, ainda não encontrou seu papel. Já Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) é um jovem apaixonado por Jazz que sonha em ter seu próprio clube, porém sofre  com a falta de popularidade do gênero musical. Quando o destino dos dois se cruzam, temos o nosso filme.La La Land é, a cima de tudo, sobre sonhos. A força de vontade e a paixão que os personagens tem  seja pelo Jazz ou pela atuação, inspira o telespectador. Damien Chazelle triunfa ao mesclar elementos do cinema clássico com regalias modernas. A inspiração é clara no longa, mas em nenhum momento o filme se torna nostálgico demais, ele anda com as próprias pernas e cria sua identidade própria. Stone e Gosling já provaram sua perfeita sintonia em filmes como 'Crazy Stupid Love' e 'Gangster Squad' e agora, em sua terceira colaboração, os dois brilham juntos. Emma atua com sutilidade, seus gestos, sua voz, a dança...Tudo contribui para a construção de uma personagem que é ao mesmo tempo doce e atrevida. Stone é o coração de La La Land, ainda mais quando está junta com Gosling, que por sua vez, também não fica para trás. Ryan da vida com mestria para Sebastian, um personagem apaixonado e ao mesmo tempo apaixonante. Em todas as suas cenas juntos, Emma e Ryan conquistam um pouco mais o coração da audiência, suas vozes juntos criam um contraste agridoce que é tão agradável aos ouvidos quanto suas danças tímidas são agradáveis aos olhos. Mesmo não sendo profissionais em dança e canto como Gene Kelly e Debbie Reynolds por exemplo, é visível o esforço dos dois e seus passos acanhados e vozes suaves são mais que suficiente para relevar este pequeno detalhe.  Tecnicamente falando, La La Land é irretocável. Chazelle brinca com as cores no longa, sempre podemos observar a presença de uma luz neon refletindo no rosto de um dos protagonistas. O figurino é sempre com cores primas, cores estas que estão sempre presentes na palheta do filme, o figurino é um dos grandes méritos do filme, pois é moderno e ao mesmo tempo retro, assim como diversas coisas no longa.  A fotografia também se destaca. As cores vivas do céu contribuem para  cenas espetaculares. O compromisso de fazer um trabalho bem executado gera resultados aqui. A explosão de cores, seja no céu ou no figurino gera reação imediata da audiência e ainda é um deleite para os olhos de quem assiste.  Como dito a cima, a direção de Damian Chazelle atinge seu ápice aqui. Sua direção é extremamente competente. Logo na cena inicial do longa, vemos uma cena de musical em um engarrafamento onde todos os jovens saem de seus devidos carros e começam a dançar. Toda a cena é filmada em plano sequência com takes abertos e aí temos uma noção da excelência do diretor. La La Land é uma doce carta de amor para a era de ouro de Hollywood. Suas músicas doces e animadas ficam grudadas em sua cabeça e a beleza vista aqui vai muito além dos aspectos técnicos. Simplesmente um filme para ser eternizado.",1
117,"One of the most pathetic attempts at a musical.tell me damien, how do you go from an epic like Whiplash to a piece of garbage like this **** How almost everyone praises this movie is absolutely beyond me.Here's to hoping another Whiplash is in our way.",0
118,"The movie is good. I recommend you to watch it.First of all, I almost scared myself off at the beginning of the movie. The first singing and dancing of the big group. When I noticed the sound and the visual is not in syn, I was so worried that this is doomed. The first singing was not in syn, what can I expect for the rest of the movie. Thankfully, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling saved the day. All the singings are fine at the end.If I were the edition, I would definitely ask the team to reshoot the first scene, edit it, or delete the whole thing. But I know the first scene connect with the scene at the end, so it might be a hard decision to delete it.The story is great. The combination of drama and movie is cool. It does remind me of Birdman, but this is a more enjoyable and watchable.I love the music. I think Justin Hurwitz proves himself with his talent after Whiplash.If Hurwitz ever opens a bar, I will definitely visit it.",1
119,"I went to see this movie a little bit afraid that it won't live up to hype and all those good reviews, but man... this movie blow me away. I can't remember when was the last time I enjoyed a movie this much, and I don't even like musicals. Beautifully directed and shot (that dancing scene), amazing performance from both Emma and Ryan, great music and great down to Earth story with powerful message.La La Land is the movie you are going to caught yourself thinking about for a long time after you watched it. Perfect!",1
120,I've been holding off on my top movies of the year list just for this film and Silence and thank god I did. This movie was beautifully made and not one flaw in it. The music was superb and the acting from Gosling and Stone was great as always. The cinematography was fantastic too. I absolutely love the story as well with two young talented people trying to pursue and achieve there dreams. Damien Chazelle's first film Whiplash was superb and thus one surprisingly tops that.,1

122,"La La Land deserves the attention that has recieved because it is a movie musical that it´s not based on broadway or something else, but the script even when it´s not based in something, it´s not original. The music numbers and some scenes are memorable, but when the movie is not given us that, we noticed that we´ve been haunted because of the good music and dance numbers, but the movie itself, it´s boring and predictable. Maybe, even with this problems, at the end you´ll be crying, and it will be deserve of it. At the end, La La Land may be a good movie, just for entertaining.",1
123,"This has got to be the best movie of the 21st century and one of the best movies of all time. This movie is a masterpiece!Flawless acting.Flawless soundtrack.Flawless... well, everything.La La Land could be my new favourite movie.",1
124,"This movie made me feels things. I had smile on my fave throughout the whole film. The imagery is fantastic, the transitions from scene to scene are great, the music blends with the film perfectly and it is good without being too distracting from the plot. The plot was simple but it was done phenomenally. The acting in this film is incredible. The pacing is also very good and I was never bored during the movie. I really, really enjoyed La La Land and it is by far my favorite movie of 2016 due to it's simplistic but amazing music, plot, and complex (but ""real"") characters that are portrayed perfectly.",1
125,"La La Land might as well end up being in the awards stealing most of the wins especially for Best Film; nevertheless, La La Land still manages to live up its name by making it promising for the person behind the screen.",1
126,"La la land is an ambitious, energetic and surprisingly unforgettable result of Emma Stone and Ryan Goslin's best interpretations, mixed with Damien Chazelle's gorgeous direction.",1
127,"Magical, pure, simple and beautiful! One of the best movies I've ever seen! Emma is the soul of everything here! She proves, again, how amazing and strong she is as an actress! Damien also steels the scene as director with breathtaking takes! And the best part, of course, the soundtrack. A masterpiece! La La Land definitely is in history now.",1
128,"If you are a fan of musicals, jazz or old Hollywood at all, La La Land is a must-see. Damien Chazelle knocks it out of the park AGAIN. This movie sweeps you off your feet and leaves a pleasant taste in your mouth. The soundtrack will be stuck in your head for days after you see it!",1

130,"La La Land is a phenomenal, moving and powerful escape that triumphs in every department. The music, cinematography, performances and narrative are all exceptional. The film mixes the contemporary with the traditional musical format and the payoff is enormous. Audiences are given characters of substance and reality, surrounded by dreamy colour and choreography. It's a film about romance, dreams, hopes, music and above all, the human experience. An utterly breathtaking movie that offers constant wonder. Unmissable.",1
131,"Great script, acting and cinematography. singing, songs and dancing almooooost great. This one might have been a bit overhyped, but is still a fantastic film.",1
132,"No creía que iba a ver esta película nunca, pero las buenas críticas y la fama de ser una de las películas del año, levantó mi curiosidad. Creía que iba a quitar la película a la mitad de metraje, pero no. Me encontré con una buena película, una película simpática para pasar el domingo y al final me gustó. Un grandísimo homenaje al ""Hollywood"" clásico que, el que la vea lo entenderá.En cuanto a lo bien escrita que está y la interpretación de sus personajes por parte de E. Stone y Gosling, hace que ni te enteres de las dos horas del filme y te interese la historia. El final es BRILLANTE y de verdad que me encantó porque no me esperaba esa dureza/amargura. Muy bueno.En definitiva, es una buena película que me gustó, a pesar, que odio el género y por su final y algunas situaciones de los personajes, estuve contento de haberla visto. Mi gusto aparte, es un peliculón en todo. Un 8.",1
133,"A full musical experience as we haven't seen it in years, La La Land manages to transmit a wide variety of pure raw emotions, including love, hate, disappointment and most of all, hope. The acting by the marvelous movie couple Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is astonishing and helps the audience connect and reflecte their own hopes and dreams in their characters.",1
134,"I'm not usually into musicals, but this one felt so natural, that in the middle it got a bit dragged out and they could use a bit more of music, the cinematography is probably one of the best things in here, it's beautiful to look at, and the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is almost to perfection... like i said it got a bit dragged out in the middle but it went full circle to a beautiful ending",1
135,"I finally gave in and rented La La Land from Redbox for $1.59 this evening.  As I began to watch it, I kept waiting for it to get started and to develop some semblance of an engaging plot.  As I forced myself to continue to watch it in the hope that I eventually would discover the qualities that caused it almost to win the Oscar for best movie, I began to wonder if it would ever end.  Honestly, it was just plain weird in the artsy-fartsy sort of way that critics find appealing but many normal moviegoers find off-putting.  Compared to the classic musicals of Broadway's heyday, it could not even begin to hold a candle.  The one saving grace was the jazz music in the soundtrack, which was of a high quality musically.",0
136,"La La Land is a good mixture of excellent acting, excellent music and excellent plot that will bring you to a magical world. This movie make us thinking about life, thinking about the dream and give us strengh to fight for that dream.They would never make something like this anymore.",1
137,"A beautiful movie full of emotions. And yes, the story couldn't be simpler; but I don't think the filmmaker wants to tell a story. He wants to show pure romance between lovers. Not boring at all if you got feelings.",1
138,"Very fiew movies are able to tackle the fuel of human life: the power of the dream. However, this wonderful masterpiece is all about that.How many of us haven't been disparaged from trying to breathe life to the fantasies we own? How many times have we fallen? And just as much, how many of us haven't tried to pull the pieces together and yell ""Let's go for another round""? Well, it's through the compelling performances and the enticing musical numbers that this beautiful work of art  stands as a powerful memento to our dreams and hopes, making us realise that, when these dreams seek fulfillment, it may cost us the very lot.",1
139,"Praise Praise Praise! A subconscious and unspoken stigma and stereotype exists among movie producers and most people that a film is for children if it is all about bright colors, simple messages of happiness and verbally expressed joy through song and beautiful art as well as principles of familiar real life things that most good people hold as ideals such as young love or honor in various jobs. Somehow La La Land proves this utterly wrong and rips those biases utterly to shreds. It reminds us all that color and life and goodness is what we are looking to see in real entertainment, which is a childlike feature in all of us, the innocence we long for. It’s balance between serious themes and dreamy heart make it irresistibly attractive and intriguing. It proved that old fashioned values combined with art in simple and pleasant forms, as applied to art, are every bit as meaningful and held as respectful to a huge adult audience by the 340 million it’s already made. Obviously, it was made after the way of an older and “bygone era” of films that were classier, more innocent, more simple, more musical, and more jolly. But I believe it made a masterpiece of itself accidentally, perhaps because the more youthful producers fill in their absence of true experience with a bygone genre (the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) with their imaginations, that give their forbears the benefit of the doubt in the way of true quality and meaning, but, who cares? It worked! This film was a masterpiece among films in my opinion. It proved to me something I have long believed to the center, which is that part of the glory of being human is to embrace innocence, and the purer elements of art such as mastery of pictures, singing, presentations, and dance with honed practice by experienced and passionate artists…of a kind. La La Land proved to be more than paying homage or milking nostalgia to some supposedly greater and forgotten era, but a solid and deliciously indestructible piece of living proof that new and original pieces of entertainment not only can be made but can make today’s world brighter and more beautiful by remaining optimistic, original, and true to form in the process! This movie is gold! It could hold the potential for some kind of modern renaissance of worthwhile art in many forms. It didn’t make me long for the past, it didn’t break my heart, but it didn’t let me away easy either, it didn’t leave me critical, it didn’t leave me without a smile on my face, it didn’t leave me content, but it didn’t leave me unsatisfied, it gave me just that right balance of entertainment to not only pleasantly distract me away from the woes of real life but want to get back to it and make something more of it, and that is meaning! It left me wanting more true art in other forms, and if a movie can pull at my inner humanity like that, it’s masterful enough to be called an original masterpiece, if there ever was one. Like other great movies like Star Wars, somehow it just hit the spot with the perfect balance of just the right things; drama, color, comedy, originality, simplicity, easiness of understanding, heart, a touch of fantasy, a touch of realism, plenty of romance, seriousness, a little sadness, small aspects of uniqueness, and not overdone in any of those qualities. For this reason it should stand the test of time. What a wonderful film. My standards have been raised.Five out of Five stars.-	Sam Tomlinson    - 2/23/17",1
140,"I didn't plan on seeing this in the theater but I'm glad I did for the full experience. A great piece of work- heartfelt performances, and brilliant music.",1
141,"There´s no movies like this anymore! its just the magic aura of old Hollywood, the romance and the dreams (and/or broken dreams) of real people... amazing performance for Emma Stone, amazing score... it deserves your time and attention.",1
142,"It's the best I've seen in a long time, it's great fun and if you go with your girlfriend will be the best 2 hours of cinema you can spend. The story fails in some aspects but when they start dancing and singing you feel like getting up And start dancing.",1
143,"La La Land is so beautiful and well told! Musical Theater buffs, children, and all parents and adults can enjoy this masterpiece, directed by Damien Chazelle. It tells the story of an actress named Mia, who is struggling with romance and finding a job. She finds a pianist named Sebastien who plays Piano, and is struggling with a steady gig and money. After Sebastien (Ryan Gosling) ignores her in the restaurant he was playing in, they start to run in to each other a lot more. They start to realize that they could be together, and they get engaged. Sebastien teaches her about jazz, and they both help each other to become successful, until of course, the tragedy, which you have to see the movie for. I really like how this movie spends a lot of time in the ""musical theater"" phase, such as the opening scene where they used one shot to film a super- spectacular dancing scene. There are also stunning visuals that includes the dancing, such as the part where they fly into space and dance. The singing, music, and piano playing is beautiful, especially the original songs such as ""City of Stars"" written by Justin Hurwitz. I also really admire the story, it is very sweet and age appropriate for everyone. There are some very sad parts in the movie, but most of it leaves you to think, ""what would have happened next?"" You may be wondering if I love it so much, why isn't it an 10? Well, as a film critic, I would say that it changes tones very quickly, like from sad to intense, or happy to chaotic. But I do highly recommend this film to everyone! It is one of the best movies of the year, and deserved the Oscars.",1
144,"Hands down to Ryan Gosling & Emma Stones performances, they are deep and excellent on the role on this film. The music aspect is awesome, and that comes from someone who doesn't like musicals either this type of music. The plot overall is good, but some aspects at the beginning felt a little rushed, but the plot ends up been very charming. Summing all up, it's a nice musical, an awesome performance by both actors that will leave you breathless, and a loving story with good music & dancing.",1
145,"La La Land brings back to life a genre that seemed much dead, and it does so in a really spectacular way. It's a refreshing work with amazing production values. The film presents a rather fresh screenplay by using and mixing classic elements of cinematography -and appealing, in the meanwhile, to the remembrance of musical jewels that are often forgotten. While it's true that the overall premise may be quite simple, it contains many elements of the daily life most of us can identify with: dreaming, loving, happiness, regretting, frustration, letting go, and so on. The acting on the other hand is flawlessly played by its protagonists, and thanks to a great character development it feels human and appealing.The music is also memorable, well written and well played as the plot develops. Technically speaking is a masterful execution of great technique, relying in great photography, editing, sound mixing and production.",1
146,"Damien Chazelle solidifies his style of film with La La Land. It's certainly a green light of a 7-10 score, which means go and see this movie if it was a  traffic light. La La Land has an uplifting score which now and then, you would scatter to find the songs and listen to it on repeat or the full album as the songs reflect back on Emma's and Ryan's romantic relationship and the adventures they had. The cinematography is unique and almost reminds me of Alejandro G. Inaritu's directorial style and the story is almost as unique as it explores many themes. Themes like passion and love which made me come out of the theatre inspired. You can also appreciate Emma Stone's acting as her subtle facial expressions are left to tell minor points of the story sometimes. It's got, the acting, cinematography, score right but overall, they make up Damien Chazelle's signature for his films.",1
147,"I don't have words to describe what i felled when i see la la land, i don't have anything bad to say about la la land, greatest soundtrack i ever heard, with incredible characters, Ryan Gosling was great in the film, but Emma , she was perfect, she has my heart.",1
148,"After watching this film at the Chicago International Film Festival, my original plan was to wait until closer to the film's actual release date to give my thoughts on it. However, after sitting with it for two days, with the images and sounds still sweeping through my mind, I cannot help myself. I will be as vague as possible, because I do not want to ruin the experience of seeing it for the first time, but I have to talk about it.",1
149,MAGIC!!!! GENIUS!!!! I honestly have no other words to describe this masterpiece of a movie. Justin Hurwitz and Damien Chazelle deserve all the praise in the world for creating something that beautiful.,1
150,"A masterpiece musical. Emma Stone is incredible (love ""the fools who dream"" performance), she deserves an Oscar! Wonderful, want to watch it again and again. Perfection!",1
151,"Although La La Land was released in 2016, I figured ""Why not make a quick review?"" After all, it was my favorite film from that year, and that's saying something considering I've seen a lot of great movies from 2016.Anyways, from the director who brought you Whiplash, (which right off the bat, basically explains how La La Land was such an amazing film), brings you a musical romance starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as the two main protagonists of this film. And just a quick pointer, the chemistry between these two were terrific! Most scenes from La La Land, especially the epilogue, got me crying like a little A-Hole because of how beautifully this movie was directed! And how on earth could we forget about the soundtrack? Everything about La La Land was remarkable and I have not a single flaw.",1
152,"Drei Oscars gab es für das intensive Drummer-Drama Whiplash – entsprechend ambitioniert fällt Damien Chazelles nächste Regiearbeit La La Land aus: Zwar immer noch eine Ode an den Jazz, ist das mit Emma Stone und Ryan Gosling prominent besetzte Musical primär eine ultra-opulente Liebesgeschichte vor der glitzernden Kulisse der Hollywood Hills. Hier träumen die Schauspielerin Mia und der Jazzpianist Sebastian gemeinsam vom ganz großen Durchbruch – bis die Realität das trällernde Traumpaar einholt. Eine große Geschichte erzählt Chazelle also eigentlich nicht, dafür ist La La Land eine inszenatorische Wucht: Die kalkuliert-künstlichen Bilder sind betörend wie ein Wes-Anderson-Film, die Sing- und Tanzeinlagen stilsichere Ginger-Rogers-und-Fred-Astaire-Zitate. Außerdem reizt die episodenhafte Erzählweise des durchweg unterhaltsamen Spektakels.",1
153,"Beautiful Story!The movie gives a lot of sense.Start with excellent technique, then romantic and stunning scenes, above all the message.This is a must see!",1
154,I don't understand how this won awards.  I was basically hoping is would end from the beginning.  The singing and dancing were not that good nor was the story.,0
155,"Amazing beautiful film, one of the best of last years... If this film doesnt deserve the best film oscar who knowns whats happening inside the academy...",1
156,"This movie was a good comfort movie, like a cup of hot chocolate. I was considering a 6 but I give it a low 7, which may be a bit too generous. There was one song that stood out, the one Emma Stone sings at her audition, but the rest were just OK. The dancing was competent but very unexceptional. This is not Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astaire. The story is average, except that the latter portion skips over a number of years without explanation and tells us nothing of what happened in between. It was rather strange and seemed like a shortcut to end the movie in a way that appeared modern and cynical, as if the writers felt they had to do that since the rest of the movie was so old fashioned. I wish they written a better final act.",1
157,"They'd crossed each others life while chasing their dreams.I am not a big fan of modern musical films. So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. The best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.Yes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.Gosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with cliché than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.7/10",1
158,"I think it is a great movie, Ryan and Emma are really incredible actors (I remember them in ""Crazy, Stupid Love""). I'm not a fan of musicals. This is one of the two musicals I liked to date: the other one is ""Mamma Mia"". Both are great musicals but they are completely different. Personally, I liked Mamma Mia more than La La Land. I don't know why Mamma Mia's Metascore is just 51 and La La Land's is 93. This film is maybe a ""little"" overrated. I just saw it yesterday. Mamma Mia's soundtrack was made with songs of Abba, songs everybody knows. When they sang in that movie, it all seems normal. But in this movie, you can realize while watching that it's not real, not normal. I love the concept, the story. But I hated the final. It is different from the one I thought before. But, you know, a good movie is determinated by a good final. Good, but boring sometimes. I'm happy it won 6 Oscars, but I don't think it deserved 14 Nominations. Just a normal movie, I cannot wait to see it again. Maybe I'll like it more than the first time I saw it.",1
159,قبل از اینکه فیلم رو ببینم کاملا راجع به این فیلم منفی بودم البته فقط فیلم و نه کارگردانش، دیمین شزل با شلاق نشون داد که به عنوان یک کارگردان جوان از تبدیل کردن رویاهاش به فیلم هیچ ترسی نداره و همین هم منو ترغیب کرد تا فیلم رو ببینماما طولی نکشید تا بعد از اولین ترانه کاملا نظرم برگشت حتی کاملا به وجد اومدم و هیجان زده شدمکار شزل تو دکوپاژ و میزانسن فوق العاده بودترانه ها و موسیقی فوق العاده است که نشان دهنده اینه که شزل چقدر خوب موسیقی رو میشناسههمه چیز در بالاترین کیفیت ممکن قرار داره و تمام اسکار هایی که فیلم برنده شده کاملا به حق هستنداین فیلم رو به شدت به همه پیشنهاد میکنم,1
160,"Very well crafted movie. Beautifully and thoughtfully shot. Well deserved Oscar for Cinematography. Great acting and music. However for me... it lacked a bit with the story elements. Nothing new there really. At points there were some interesting drama but it kept me wishing for more at the end. Good film though, worth a watch.",1
161,"Lalaland é com certeza o filme mais artístico que eu já assisti. A direção de arte tanto como a direção de fotografia é impecável. Eu finalmente assisti o filme sem o hype todo. Eu anulei todas as críticas que eu li e só assisti o filme. O filme não é só sobre a Mia que deseja ser atriz e o Sebastian que quer abrir um bar de jazz. Vendo o filme com atenção eu percebi que é mais do que isso. Quantas vezes você não esteve em uma relação e acabou se sentindo frustrado pela pessoa conseguir realizar um sonho e você continuar ali parado? Quantas vezes a vida já te deu um não e você se viu sem forçar para continuar e acreditar no seu sonho? O sonho de Mia era ser uma atriz sim, um clássico clichê de holiwood. Mas não tem que ser isso não. Qualquer um que tem um sonho sabe como é levar um soco na cara da vida. Eu vi muitas pessoas reclamando do final também, mas e dai? Sinceramente. Vamos parar de ficar colocando defeitos onde não existem. Algumas pessoas talvez estivessem esperando um conto de fadas não sei e aí ao chegar no final do filme leva esse tapa na cara. Eu não tenho vergonha de dizer que eu me emocionei com o filme, principalmente com o final. Eu não pensei que poderia me tocar tanto. É tão simples e ao mesmo tempo tão intenso que agora eu entendo porque tantas pessoas amaram e odiaram esse filme. Se você assiste La La Land no hype de ser mais um romance clichê é nítido que você vai odiar esse filme. Emma Stone que eu cheguei a criticar eu percebi que nos 45 do segundo tempo ela conseguiu impressionar demais e fez uma atuação MARAVILHOSA. Os filmes tem alguns defeitos sim, mas acho que o que mais importou pra mim foi a mensagem que ele quis passar. Acho que daqui uns anos as pessoas vão perceber que, apesar dos clichês, o filme passa uma mensagem linda",1
162,"La la land no es ni más ni menos que una obra original por parte del director Damien Chazelle, una película que te lleva tomada de la mano por la mayor parte del drama. Sin embargo, llega a un punto donde se torna un poco aburrido. En si, la película está bien hecha (omitamos los errores, tal como cuando Mía (Emma Stone) se le cae su auricular y Esteban (Ryan Gosling) lo toma). Una película muy peculiar y buena.",1
163,The acting in this film from the two main leads in awesome. The music written by Justin Horowitz is also incredible. The  ending scene is heart wrenching and yet strangely beautiful at the same time. Looking forward to more of Chazelles's in the future.,1

165,"This year my love and I gathered a couple of dozen people on a warm summer night on the rooftop of a house in one of the beautiful Greek  islands and projected the film onto a neighbour's wall we spent all afternoon painting bright white.  Any film that makes you want to dance, sing and love out loud is a film worth many re-watches and this re-watch was my favourite one.",1
166,"It's cute, not as good as everyone is making it out to be. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are good in their parts as mediocre musicians that have talent, but they would not shine in any limelight outside of this movie. The story was also very simple but nice to watch and follow. The music was also good, I certainly have ""City of Stars"" on my Spotify, but much of the music is forgettable. I would definitely watch it -- just to create your own opinion and enjoy this modern day musical.",1
167,"La La Land has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time, if not my favorite. It's full of hope and challenge that is equal and pure to life. It encapsulates real emotion and ambition that I believe many dreamers can really relate to. All of this is told through a bold story and spellbinding music, making for what I would consider to be a near perfect movie.",1
168,"A fun, charming, romantic, old-fashioned musical with great songs and perfect direction. Damien Chazelle is on his way to becoming a great director. La La Land is a fantastic movie, the performances are so great, the chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is great, the dance scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. This is a really great movie, it will go down as a classic.",1
169,"O melhor filme musical e um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos, La La Land consegue fazer o que poucos filmes fazem, te prender e te colocar dentro do filme, e como quase nenhum faz, te faz olhar o quão é belo essa obra em todos os aspectos, atores atuando como se fossem apenas um, ambiente, roteiro, canção, trilha sonora, dança, filmagem tudo é simplismente espetacular, e esse filme mostra como realmente fazemos e pensamos, como poderia ser se é que me entende.",1
170,"LLL works brilliantly on almost every level and deserves its status as the top movie of 2016.  It is not flawless, but it looks and sounds great.  Kudos to Damien Chazelle for taking a moribund genre (the Hollywood musical), updating it for the 2010s, and giving it new life.  Gosling and Stone, who are great together, play a couple of struggling artists (he, a disgruntled jazz musician, and she, an actress) who meet and fall in love.  Parts of Los Angeles become key features in the movie and serve as wonderful backdrops for musical numbers.  The ending for me is a little unsatisfying, and it left me scratching my head over what really happened between them, which isn't the best way to end a romantic musical - but this is still a lovely ride, and one with no peers that I know of.",1
172,"An absolute masterpiece, grin inducing and tear jerking. Some of the most beautiful imagery ever seen in film and the stunning music that will stick in your head for days after watching. Instantly one of my favourite films and it'll be loved forever.",1
173,"Class personified from beginning to end. This film is fantastically realized if a little formulaic. The performances, visuals and direction all come together to help this film rise above other romantic musicals. Great cinema.",1
174,A musical masterpiece. La La Land is the kind of musical that non-musical fans will fall for.,1
175,Must see this film! One of the greatest Musical films ever seen! Awesome performances by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone!,1
176,"La La Land is a stunning, gorgeous masterpiece of cinema. It's triumphant from start to finish. With excellent and charismatic performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and visionary directing from Damien Chazelle, La La Land is the best picture of 2016.",1

179,"I have been a big fan of musical films for many years. I recently watched a movie called ""La La Land: California Dreams"" again. For the first time, I saw this movie in the cinema last year when we went to see it with classmates. The genre of the film is a musical romantic, comedy and drama film, and the film was released on August 31, 2016. The film employ and location is in California. In the same year, the film also nominated for the Oscars.Actress Mia tries to play a famous play where she wants to take part. She will work in the breakfast cafe otherwise there is a waitress. Because she has a sad mood the same evening, then she will have a restaurant in the evening and a muscian Sebastian, whom she will soon fall in love, will play the piano. The same night, Sebastian was fired from work, as the restaurant manager wanted to put his restaurant around for a band to listen to people. Sebastian goes to work on one of the record labels, and Mia begins to create her own play. The film employ is very fast-moving. At the end of the film, they admit to each other that while they care about each other, they will not be able to live together in the future.It seemed to me that the film is light-hearted and there were different twists and turns in the film. There were a lot of different details and effects in the film that changed the film´s environment. This film had a big-budget, but it is a world-famous piece of musical.My opinion about the film is very good, because people dance and sing a lot, and this make the movie a great one. I recommend this movie to people: first, who like musicals and secondly, dream far away from the world.",1
180,فیلم را سه بار دیدم و موسیقیش را ده ها بار گوش داده ام لذا بیشتر از فیلم موسیقی آن برایم جذاب و گیرا بود اما جدا از شگفت انگیزی موسیقی آن و هماهنگی اعجاب آوری که با صحنه های فیلم داشت موضوع و ساخت فیلم هم خالی از جذابیت نبود یک فیلم موزیکال خوش ساخت هرچند طولانی ادای دینی خوب به سینما و البته موسیقی جز و در نهایت عشق.چیزی که بیش از همه در فیلم برایم جذاب بود تصور نویسنده و کارگردان از آرزوها در حالت ذهنی و آرزوها در حالت عینی بود که در بیست دقیقه آخر فیلم به نمایش گذاشته شد با فلش بکی به گذشته,1
181,"La La Land is one my favorite movies ever. It includes impeccably choreographed dancing, great songs and an excellent score, along with excellent performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Chazelle's direction is very assured and the movie has excellent cinematography. It's visuals and excellent musical numbers allude to classic musicals with an upbeat, and dream-like tone. The movie can be interpreted in several ways, but for a less discerning viewer the subtle message of being willing to let go with each other to follow your dreams could be missed, if so i recommend a second viewing. Both Mia and Sebastian achieve their dreams but the movie shows a beautiful and heartbreaking montage of what could have been if their relationship was perfect. But the whimsical tone is contrasted with raw emotion and shows the reality of going to L.A. to achieve your dreams. La La Land was the best movie of 2016 and must be seen. I watched La La Land recently, my expectations weren't that high, I was expecting a good movie, but not a masterpiece on the level of this film. La La Land is an instant classic.",1
182,"This is one of my favorite films of all time.  The music is catchy, the story is very sweet, and the acting/dancing/singing is great.  It isn't cliche at all and the the music is so amazing.  My favorite songs include Someone in the Crowd, City of Stars, and Another Day of Sun.  The ending is intense and unexpected.  I also like how they go through the four seasons and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's on screen chemistry is amazing.  Overall I would give this movie a 10/10!",1
183,"I freaking love this movie from beginning to end. It's such a feel-good movie. When i watched i for a second time, i could sing along with all the songs, which are great as well. Every song stands out. The story is maybe not that Original: girl meets guy, fall in love, be in a relationship, break up. But it was put in another 'jacket' as i would say, which made the movie a whole new experience. Acting is great. You'll be smiling from minute one with the Original intro with 'Another day of sun' sung by a whole bunch of dancers dancing on the freeway. It ends a bit more sad, with the broken up couple looking back to the movie with some happy and sad music.Great experience, if you didn't liked it the first time, be sure to give it a second try, changes your perspective and gives you a better look at the movie and its characters.On of my all time favorites for sure.",1
184,"This movie will forever prevale as a timeless classic, which is utterly hard to achieve. Beautiful to look at, the production design is mesmerizing. Beautiful to listen to, the original music is perfect in every way. Beautiful to read to, the screenplay plays a huge part in this. Every bit is better than the last. La La Land achieves everything it once aspired to be and more. Congratulations Chazelle, only few people can make an iconic movie, and even more, form part of the iconic culture.",1
185,So many references to 1950s and 1960s America. I just couldn't help but crying dreaming of love.,1
186,"The greatest masterpiece of this century so far, sustained by Emma Stone's perfect performance",1
187,"Sinceramente, a la hora de ver esta película, no tenía expectativas muy altas, pensé que sería un simple y tonto musical como otros, o incluso que sería una historia patética, pero logró convertirse en una de mis películas favoritas.Es perfecta por donde se la mire, una historia perfecta, actuaciones increíbles, gran dirección, fotografía, escenario, un guión de lujo, escenas divertidas, canciones muy deleitables, etc.Una mención especial a la maravillosa Emma Stone, que se luce con su mejor papel hasta la fecha y la verdad, tiene bien merecido el Oscar que ganóOtra mención especial a la creatividad del director y al cast de la dirección artística, también a los guionistas, quienes crearon una fiesta visual y auditiva.Sinceramente esta debió ser la ganadora del Oscar en lugar de Moonlight.",1
188,"No me gustan los musicales, pero para hacer una critica no importan mis gustos personales. Para comenzar la banda sonora es increible las canciones nos cuentan puntos de la trama y no solo eso los colores son vivos y hacen que una escena se vea genial de verdad los diseños del escenario me gustaron mas que los de avatar. Esta forma de narrativa tambien tiene sus defectos porque si quieres transmitir emociones profundas o tristes no se lograra del todo puesto que el sonido ritmico y el escenario colorido de la pelicula te dira todo los contrario y aunque la iluminacion es bastante buena en otras escenas se pudo mejorar. En el resto de puntos la pelicula es muy simple la trama, el guion y movimiento de camara, se lleva un 11 de 10 en banda sonora y escenarios pero el resto es normal para una pelicula que toma mucha fuerza con lo ya antes mencionado. Es una gran pelicula pero soy de esos que esta de acuerdo con que Moonlight merecio el oscar, me hubiera gustado sentir sensaciones indescriptibles con la musica en La la lan pero falto muy poco ,de verdad casi lo consiguen.",1
189,"A film that provokes falsehood that results in an alienation that in the average viewer will cause happiness, but in some experienced people will achieve a mediatic nervous pulse of which only the symptoms of a presumptuous homage to the cinema will be seen; but that in reality is a Hollywood conquest towards the indie. A masked dictatorship in a homage.",0
190,"Seriously probably the most over hyped, overrated movies I have ever seen.  This movie completely fails as a musical.  I don't remember any songs or was even compelled to download them.  Also Emma Stone's character blah and the ending was dumb dumb dumb.",0
191,There is a lethal sentimental softness about this movie.  The theme song is repeated to death.  The two stars have not enough chemistry to fill a test tube.  It's hard to believe the same director did Whiplash.  This is not a musical film; it doesn't revive an old genre--it kills it forever.,0
192,"Perhaps their are two musicals named La La Land from 2016 starring Ryan Gosling and Emma stone, because the one I just saw was terrible.  The only award I would have nominated it for would be a Razzie.  And I do love a good musical from time to time.  This was nothing but poorly drawn film, with two dimensional wooden characters jumping from cliche to cliche.",0
193,"The 30 million dollar budget were spent on the actors' salaries and buying all these awards. Besides, whats with people loving it without even watching?",0
195,"La historia: dos perdedores que sueñan con hacerla en grande en Hollywood,  Mia (Emma Stone) aspirante a actriz sin éxito y Sebastian (Ryan Goslin) un músico de jazz desempleado que se encuentran en una fiesta y se enamoran, pero ¿cuánto puede durar ese amor cuando lo que siempre han soñado se vuelve realidad?Lo bueno: la manera tan acertada en que Damien Chazalle toma temas actuales como el desempleo, la frustración, la presión por ser alguien y ser exitoso y los transforma en un clásico musical americano, lleno de nostalgia y bailes de salón y tap (hace demasiado tiempo que no veía tap en una película), referencias a grandes películas del género como Dancing in the Rain o New York New York; creando una fantasía elegante y cruel a la ves. El guion sencillo pero efectivo nos lleva de la comedia romántica rosa hasta le melodrama, cerrando con un maravilloso epilogo musical espectacular.Mención aparte es la fotografía y el diseño de producción, los dos perfectos y hermosamente cuidados. La fotografía limpia, saturada de color, recreando ese tecnicolor  de los años 40’s, con el uso seguido de grandes angulares para darle un aire de Cinamascope a toda la cinta (como te lo anuncian en el primer segundo de la película). Y el diseño de producción en donde los colores solidos son los importantes: amarillos, rojos y verdes para  Mia reflejando energía de una joven aspirante a actriz  , lo colores ocres, tierra, negros y dorados para Sebastian con la calma de la edad, de la espera y de la frustración..Pero toda esta maravilla no podría lucir sin el par de actores protagonistas, que hacen un trabajo excelente. Emma Stone destilando energía y vulnerabilidad y Ryan Goslin tranquilo, calmado, lleno de pasión. Lo malo: no hay nada malo con esta gran cinta.En conclusión esta película es una joya del cine contemporáneo, recordándonos el pasado pero siempre mirando al futuro, llena de romance, música y baile.",1
196,"The opening shot of La La Land shows us a jammed highway of Los Angeles on a (snowless and warm) winter morning. Almost as if caused by the evident claustrophobia, everyone exits their cars and, on cue, sings us their individual stories. This is Los Angeles, the land where dreams are made and destroyed. People hop on cars, dance in sync for miles and miles, and play instruments out in the open like nobody cares. Magnificent. This is what the rest of the movie’s going to feel like.Go back and read my first sentence again. I said “opening shot.” Yes, the entire opening scene is one whole goshdanged shot. The entire movie is made out of long shots. Most of the time, longshots don’t work well other than to show off some technical feat; they make you feel like you’re holding your breath for an unnecessarily long time. On the other hand, La La Land’s opening shot is like letting out a breath.This shot sets up the chaotic atmosphere of the first meeting between Mia and Sebastian. But it’s not how your typical friendship would start: Sebastian honks his horn at Mia with the what-the-heck look; Mia gives him the birdie and returns the what-the-heck look.After that encounter we follow Mia around in her daily life. She’s an employee at a café in a major studio’s lot trying to make her big break in acting. Beginning with the incident on the highway, her day hasn’t been going too well. And after a party that frustrates her more than enlivens her—a funless event that ends with her car being towed—she follows a wisp of beautiful piano music that drags her inside a bar where she encounters the pianist: Sebastian.Here we jump back to their first encounter in the morning, but this time, instead of following Mia this time, we follow Sebastian and note his daily life, too. He’s a jazz pianist struggling to pay his bills while his one job is in a bar playing boring Christmas songs that nobody wants to hear and he doesn’t want to play. Then, in a feat of both emotional bravo and idiocy, he plays an unassigned piece, consequently getting him fired. Mia approaches him, but he violently brushes past her. It’s like they were meant for each other but they don’t think so.The story’s simple. Plot twist or surprises are lacking. It’s a path that goes up and down the bumpy road of their lives. A guy and girl meet, but their careers make their relationship to struggle. Should they follow their dreams, or sacrifice their dreams to spend time with each other? The story builds(or descends, depends on how you look at it) in small episodes that lead the tension to a depressing finale. Each episode is a link in a chain, not a piece of a puzzle where the story calls back the earlier scenes for an important event.The finale is surprising at first, but—think about it—it appears that the movie has been leading up to it the whole time—we just didn’t see it coming because we hoped so much it wouldn’t happen.Director Damien Chazelle obsession with music is very evident, not only in the film but also within his career. His directorial debut was a musical much like La La Land; he made his sophomore product about a drummer and his violently dedicated band leader; he wrote a screenplay about a pianist who has to play a concert perfectly or else. Through his dedication that soaks through this dream project, La La Land soars beautifully.Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle’s college roommate, composes a score so vibrantly rooted in the old musicals yet engrained with that modern 21st-century intensity (he had supposedly sent 1,900 piano demos to Chazelle before settling on... six songs). This is a guy to keep an eye out for.There is no film like La La Land. Thinking revolutionary like Les Miserables? Or bombastic like West Side Story? Or oddly magical like Wizard of Oz?This is the best way I can put it: it’s all the great movie musicals and romances you have seen, but, at the same time, it’s not. Though it borrows heavily from almost every classic, it is unique in its entirety. Don’t miss this movie. Some of you probably heard me quote this paragraph from The New Yorker’s Anthony Lane, and I can’t stress it enough:“Catch the film on the largest screen you can find, with a sound system to match, even if that means journeying all day. Have a drink beforehand. And, whatever you do, don’t wait for a DVD or a download. The mission of this movie will be fulfilled only if it is seen by those—especially kids—… who may not know what busy thrills can bloom, without recourse to violence, from the simplest things.”You won’t have another chance to see it in theaters until—maybe—it’s rereleased into theaters in a couple years. But by then, it’ll be too late and regret will not be enough to compensate your missed opportunity.",1
197,"Endlessly charming and effortlessly original, La La Land is a magical experience that resurrects a long forgotten genre with pure class and style, not least thanks to its irresistible lead performances and spellbinding, unique direction. This is truly wonderful film making. An instant classic.",1
198,"Simply amazing, i have no words to describe what i'm feeling, the photography, the songs, the colors, the ambient, the actors, the direction, ALL it's perfect and passionating! Loved the movie",1
199,"Speechless and sobbing. It's a normal love story that you have to be brave to be there. Be in love with someone is easy, but be in love with your dream is harder",1
200,La La Land strikes the right chord in provoking emotion and thought towards any dreamer's ambition to succeed. The incredible dance sequences and catchy original songs will stay with you as soon as the credits roll. Emma Stone shines in this role and Ryan Gosling is charming as well and you grow to like their characters and believe in their chemistry that you root for them to succeed and hurt for when they are struggling. At times you do believe that you're watching a 1950's movie in modern times and it felt great. Definitely watch it! 10/10,1
201,"A movie for the dreamers,real movie lovers & for the people who appreciate art. Director/Writer Damien Chazelle is an artist with a beautiful soul. Amazing acting from the amazing duo Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone. It deserves all the nomination it got & deserves at least 5 Oscars !",1
203,"Without a doubt, 'LA LA Land' is the best film of the year and one of few films I plan on buying when the blu-ray is released. La La Land is an update to those Fred Astaire - Ginger Rodgers movies of the 1930's. Think 'Top Hat' or 'Swing Time'. Wonderful music and songs, great acting against a colorful backdrop of Los Angles locations. The quality of the cinematography, lighting, and set design is simply astonishing well done.",1

205,"La La Land is simply wonderful.  You watch this movie and you just can't help but smile; it's such a heartfelt, sweet and uplifting movie about proving to the naysayers that you CAN do it.  Gosling and Stone both play performers who fall helplessly in love with each other, and while their performances aren't anything groundbreaking, it's their chemistry that makes them enjoyable to watch.  Keep in mind, this isn't a movie about the struggles of making it in the music or actress business; this movie is meant to show the lighthearted side of life in L.A.  The choreography is great, and the music is simply magical, City of Stars in particular is just beautiful.  I guess my only real complaint is... well, Gosling can't sing, but that really doesn't matter, because Emma Stone makes up for it.  La La Land is a fantastic film about dreams, passion and beauty, and it's by far my favorite film of 2016, and quite possibly one of the best of the decade.  If you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for?  Go experience it.  Go dream.La La Land gets a 10/10.",1
206,"""La La Land"" is a thinker.  The well put together dancing, singing and conversation interaction is truly a walk through life with support. Music and conversation entwined perfectly. No guns, No bombing, no fires, no cuss words for affect.  I would see it again.""",1
207,There are many great movies out there to enjoy. But it's only occasionally that a movie can come along and totally shift your perceptions of a certain genre. La La Land is that movie for me and musicals. I hate musicals. All that unnecessary singing and dancing and saccharine sweetness. No thank you. But La La Land legitimately blew my mind out the back of my skull. It takes you up to peaks of dizzy joy but also plunges you down into the abyss of heartbreak. It's an emotional rollercoaster ride of a film and all that unnecessary singing and dancing... I loved every second of it! La La Land is an absolute masterpiece and easily one of the best movies I've seen for a very long time. Plus the soundtrack is incredible!,1
208,"The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone keeps amazing in this movie like no other. It has everything to make it a very enjoyable 2 hours of screen time of laughter, sadness, dancing, romancing, and life. Enjoy it!",1
209,"Rather than being a merely another take on the musical genre, La La Land is a vivid and energetic cinematic experience, crossing borders between melodrama, comedy and coming-of-age story. Utilising near-perfect non-linear narrative, Chazelle managed to create a modern fairytale, steering widely from the tacky, too-much-sugar approach to the subject matter. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are top-class and watching and listening to their singing is sheer pleasure. I am convinced that La La Land will turn out to be a masterpiece of the generation, although it so richly finds its inspiration in the classic Hollywood cinema.",1
210,Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are really giving their all and it shows. Their chemistry and the perfect musical score blended together make La La Land something very special and the whole theater was just jamming lol. The soundtrack is gonna be on repeat for a while. La La Land is an easy recommendation.,1

212,"""La La Land"" Is The Supreme Full-Length Feature Film of 2016 & The Most Sublime Musical Movie of The Last Two Centuries""Whiplash—""winner of three Academy Awards, one Golden Globe, three BAFTAs, among others—was the shrewd introit of a filmmaker who categorically intended to shake superfluous and commercial Hollywood, a gallant American with a transcendent and irreplaceable film intellect which has to be perpetuated, praised and enjoyed in its entirety in these recession times, he is Damien Chazelle. It was the preliminary feature film of three of the most solemn festivals in cinema, now Chazelle manufactures a modern masterpiece that is going to live on perpetually since not exclusively sketches the reviving of a relegated genre out, but runs blindingly and naturally a romantic study aesthetically stunning, tunefully stunning, narratively stunning, and functionally sublime.""La La Land"" is titled the third film led by the director; this has stars Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling and J. K. Simmons—although with an unusual minor character—among its ranks. Several people have pigeonholed it as melodramatic thing with musical taps, nevertheless, the celluloid transcends its own confines, splitting events course within four branches (the four seasons), which accentuates nature of every chapter in the story; however, although we are witnesses visibly of a narrative segmentation, spectators will not take long to apprehend that it is distributed in three fields directed by different genres and themes, what ultimately leads us to say that they are three independent stories correlated each other.The story relates idealistic couple's adventures who lives in the district where professional disillusions of the planet settle: Hollywood, an arbitrary fable which will split up our divergent players. She yearns to predominate intransigently in the city of dreams; nonetheless, her aspirations are crumbling and dying by the unsuccessful castings and his job as an assistant in a coffee shop into Warner Bros. (an unbearable face to her suffering). On the other hand, he's a pianist who makes shows at weddings and private bars in order to open his own pub, getting his biggest design: protecting and rekindling the jazz exhausted flame. Later, their lives are adventitiously connected after a nocturnal walk in finding their automobiles, which originates a passionate love, overtakes a series of individual troubles. Although each of them obtained whom they loved, the nature of the unexpected will be at risk and the intrinsic of their relationship will keep them to the edge of the cornice, what in Hollywood would signify a death foretold.It's irrefutable that Chazelle does not perform a neophyte exercise about actions which unfold with sections accompanied by singing and dancing since in his directional debut ""Guy and Madeleine on a Park Bench"" in addition to run notably his first steps within the matter, also emerged victorious in emulsifying melodrama with dazzling spontaneities. The initial section focuses on setting us in context within the dominant air through choreographic assemblies exuding pure vintage, these performances are honest reminiscences from monumental MGM productions: ""Top Hat,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" ""An American in Paris,"" and more were potential sources for revitalization of classic musicals. ""Another Day of Sun"" is the attention epicenter and an ineffable and arduous choreographic display takes place along the vehicle bridge, acts recorded in false long takes as if it were Iñárritu. A frantic and exciting prelude, which adjusts the environment where our main leads are going to get along. In the second part grandiose dances ala Broadway drastically lessen and are replaced by sentimental treatment; and what we cannot forget in a film by the director are the symphonic scores which are maintained potent, nevertheless, it provides gradually more preponderance on screen to jazz. This is where the narrative arcs obtained greater strength and Stone's and Gosling's roles shine with profound and authentic performances. After it moves through the crazy musical of the first part and the plausible dramatic affair of the second section, Chazelle concludes with a final flourish with a sudden, indefatigable, agile and the cunning mechanism in the concomitant of the events which transmute narrative in films; It makes you feel as if the tragicomedy would come to an end, but indeed one twist more is coming. Finally, choreographic ensembles break out again, but this time, we have not seen them with the same dynamism and explosiveness, dances are carefully chosen to express story grief. He provided an inspirational greeting with ""Whiplash"", with ""La La Land"" consolidates himself as one of the major American filmmakers, permitting Stone's and Gosling's performances and entire components of the celluloid to receive a guaranteed nomination at the Oscars for this love letter to Hollywood cinema.",1
213,"""La La Land"" was a fantastic film, music, songs, editing, cinematography, history, and performances by Ryan Gosling, and Emma Stone, I liked everything about the film, it would surely be one of the great classics Of cinema, really I loved it.",1
214,"Simplesmente perfeito, cenas dificílimas em plano sequencia, cores incríveis, ótima direção de arte, perfeito entrosamento entre atores, e a melhor trilha sonora de musical que já ouvi. Além de ser uma perfeita homenagem a Hollywood e a vários filmes históricos.",1
215,"I love magic. And that’s what I felt when I watch La La Land. Enchanted. There are a lot of complaints about this film, I assume mostly due to the never ending positive buzz it’s gotten. There was even an SNL skit about how widely (and overly) loved it is. But I can’t help it. I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I love a musical, and I love the classic style. You can tell me all day long about how Stone is breathy, Gosling looks at his feet when he dances, I don’t care. I liked the way it made me feel, and I left humming under my breath and dancing up the stairs. I went into the theater for my first viewing in the throes of an existential crisis (which come around every other week). I was immediately invested in the characters and cried for a majority of the second half. A few weeks later, I went in for another show time because I was worried I wasn’t in a stable mental state the first time around. I cried (slightly) less in my second showing, but it still felt as connected. Flat out it was a beautifully shot, exciting, catchy frolic through every young dreamer’s fantasy in LA. 9.8/10",1

219,"A terrible musical with horrific singing. I mean really, this musical makes GLEE sound good. I mean, dear god. Just  Ugh. The main sins of this film include:1. The obnoxious and distracting camera work. They try and look clever with all these contentious shots. The issue is that ruins the pacing of each scene since it leaves no room for properly edited cuts.2. The music, the singing and sound mixing are all atrocious. ""Another Day of Sun"" is possibly one of the single worst opening numbers I've witnessed. And I say witnessed, not heard, because you can't hear a damn thing. The music sounds like what you'd hear in an elevator. Competent but boring. The singing is the same, but none of the few decent singers this movie has can harmonise properly. It's hard to notice that problem though, when you can't hear them over the damn music. 3. Yeah... The ""white guy trying to save Jazz"" is problematic as hell. It's like how in RENT all the white people are being gentrified out of their neighbourhood by a black guy... Like, are you freaking kidding me? It doesn't bother me that much, but it's an issue.Look, if you like this. Hey, that's great and.. No, I can't do this. Like, if you enjoyed this, I genuinely feel sorry you haven't been exposed to better musicals. I mean go look up Hairspray's opening on youtube. That's a song about Baltimore, yet it sounds more inviting than LA. Or go watch ""Singing in the Rain"". Sit down and listen to some of the musical numbers from Wicked or Hamilton or The Book of Mormon. Hell, if you're rich enough go see them while you still can.There is a world of far, far, faaaaaaaar superior musicals out there for you to enjoy. La La Land is an insult to them all.",0
221,"La La Land is a pure cinematic musical experience. It's one of the best musical films since Mary Poppins. All thanks to its charming story, likeable characters, brilliant acting including the performances of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, excellent cinematography, unique production designs and unforgettable songs. You should all go and see this movie. It's worth a watch. You'll have no regrets.",1
222,"This made a refreshing change from the usual sort of stuff I watch. I thought it could have been a heck of a lot better though – the song and dance routines were a bit bland and uninspiring if you ask me. The choreography in the opening number seemed a bit ‘loose’. I’m not sure if this was intentional or not. The songs were….okay….it’s hard to really know after one listen. I have been humming the ‘City of Stars’ song all day though.  Gosling and Stone are delightful. They really carry the film. Emma Stone is the best young actress around and she has a lovely singing voice. However the acting from John Legend is diabolical. He really is terrible every time he speaks. I don’t know why they gave him a speaking part in this film. But overall, I enjoyed my time with this movie and this would encourage me to go and see more musicals. I think musicals work much better in the movie theatre than at home.",1
223,"This is not a romance. This is not a drama. This is not a musical. This is maybe one dream that I cannot make true. I agree, what a waste of lovely night. Here is to the fools who dream.",1
224,"I didn't know it was a musical going in, but that shouldn't have mattered. I love musicals. They just need to have great singers, dancers, and music. This one didn't. To be fair, I didn't watch the entire film. I couldn't sit through the whole thing. I didn't care about the characters, and I couldn't tolerate the musical performances. Did anyone leave the theater whistling one of the tunes? No, not memorable enough.",0
225,"Gerek verdiği aşk duygusu, gerekse müzikleri için bile bu film izlenir. Aşk duygusunu hissederken müzikler eşliğinde büyülendim. Normalde müzikal sevmeyen biri olarak, kesinlikle bu filmi izleyin diyorum.",1
226,"Doubtless, the cinematography, the plot, the score and songs cooperate well to deliver a beautiful, but heartbreaking story. Play the good actors and actresses, the characters lead us to feel their ambition and enthusiasm of being a big star and a jazz player. This recounts the dying genre of jazz and the remote dream of a number of dreamer who hopes to live inside the screen, more importantly, it shows what arts truly are, and bring a new, refreshing movies that is rare nowadays.",1
227,"This movie is a cliche with a wonderful soundtrack that moved me a lot, moreover, it makes a beautiful homage to the old/classic movies that we both love!",1
228,"Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is a nostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' is anything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three films under his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Umbrellas of Cherborg' and even 'Rebel Without a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least, after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helped them become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music is bouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sum up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los Angeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I have had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I would typically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic.",1
230,"La La Land is an extraordinary masterpiece among masterpieces, not only did it pay tribute to the Hollywood's classic musicals which the young generation doesn't give a damn, and the beautiful city of Los Angeles, it also showed a meaningful lesson that real success in any type of work requires determination, passion, and an absolute crucial, sacrifice, which maybe hasn't been forgotten, but many times overlooked. La La Land, with or without the meaningless awards, definitely earned it place as an incredible movie and an excellent symbol of how the modern  film making industry could and should be.",1
231,"I LOVE jazz, love stores and Hollywood musical movies so why is my reaction to ""La La Land"", which right now seems to be the one to beat for the Best Movie Oscar and Golden Globe, so blah? Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have chemistry as the lovers from the boy meets girl, boy loves girl, boy loses girl in the acting department but are sorely lacking in the singing and dancing department though Gosling acquits himself in piano playing.Everything you read, including comments by the director and screenwriter Damien Chazelle, has remarks about it being a salute to old Hollywood movies and to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Judy Garland but,with no disrespect, unless this was a take-off of all mentioned, and even if Charisse's voice was dubbed, ""La La Land"" fails miserably. I have seen some talk about it saluting Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand's movies ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""The young Girls of Rochefort"" which it does in some departments such as the production design by David Wasco and the costume designs by Mary Zophres. Regarding the choreography by Mandy Moore the opening is really a winner but in other scenes she is let down by Stone and Gosling who just don't have it when it comes to doing the steps she has for them. There is one scene where they are dancing in the stars, at the Griffith Observatory planetarium after watching the James Dean movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"", that is more special effects than dancing.The music by Justin Hurwitz with lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul sort of get lost except for the jazz music which comes across strong, melodic. The love theme lyrics are still somewhat a mystery to me though it is sung and played a few times.The climax lasting about twenty minutes, a recap of what has taken place for the first 100 minutes, jell everything together but, for me, it was too late.I think I would have been much happier and appreciated the movie, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just seeing that section.J.K. Simmons, who was in Chazells's ""Whiplash"" and won an Oscar for his role does a brief cameo here while John Legend does an extended one, neither adding or taking away from the movie.The bottom line is that ""La La Land"", for me, was not worth the time though I am sure I am in a very small minority. It might have helped if I hadn't seen the Broadway version of ""An American In Paris"" in Miami this past Tuesday where the leads were amazing dancers and strong singers.P.S. When will the fad of young actors wearing that 5 o'clock shadow stubble on their faces end? ARGH!!",0
232,"I DONT UNDERSTAND THAT! This movie is BORING. It is just a crap. It is a bad movie. The plot  doesn't have any sense, the graphic/effects are POOR. Stone's smiles and  eyes are ugly, but she's a decent actress. Gosling is a BAD actor, he  has one smile on his face during the entire movie, a smile of a poor  dog. They sing only few songs and they don't even ""sing"". Stone moans,  Gosling mumbles. The plot is cut into few pieces, the dialogues are **** the plot is boring and bad. There's been 10000 of similar plots - they met and hate each other, then they fall in love, then they break up just to come back again. Boring. I can't believe it receives golden globes, I can't  believe Gosling and Stone won for ""best actors"". It's pathetic.If you want to see it - please DON'T.",0
233,"How nice to see singing and dancing from our favorite young movie stars.  Nice humor and romance.  The story was confusing at times, but that is overshadowed by the wonderful music and dancing.",1
235,"My wife and I went to see this on a date night last Saturday, and was wowed by the opening scene, the wild and fun dance number on the overpass. Wonderful! Then the movie went right into the crapper. The instant the Emma Stone character flipped off the Ryan Gosling character from her car it was done. The rest of the movie was just as awful. And the next day this film went on to set a record for most Golden Globe awards. Who are these people who think this dreck is anything? It is another in a long line of pathetically pointless postmodern films, it has no direction, no depth, no dramatic tension, nothing to draw you into the story or the characters. Ryan Gosling's an okay actor (I liked him in Lars and the Real Girl and The Big Short) and Emma Stone's a poor one - she's just trying too hard and it was difficult to watch. What was this movie trying to be? A musical? A fantasy? A love story, comedy, drama??? Today's reigning postmodernism allows filmmakers to feel they can string a bunch of vacuous scenes together that appear to have some artistic novelty and think it's quality work. What is most scary is that Millennials eat this up. ""Oh that part is so unique and special and it personally speaks to me because I myself have no direction or meaning in my life!"" I see it in young adults' eyes everywhere. ""There is no truth, I can make my own world, nobody can tell me what to do. And we can dance and sing to it!"" Neither Gosling or Stone did those things very well, and the music was dreadful. It was agony to sit through this narcissistic adulation of nothingness. It got two Metacritic rating points here simply because of the first number.",0
239,"The perfect amalgamation of Hollywood past and present. The slow transition from the wistful allure of dreams to the tangible pop of reality. The music and the songs are instant classic (by the second viewing it felt like coming home they fit so snugly and felt so right).What's equally amazing is the character work, the re-molding of archetypes. How neither is an answer so much as a piece of a bigger puzzle. Seb's passion and devotion are his own undoing. He gets what he wants but he also is let down in nearly every other facet of his life. He doesn't ""save"" jazz. John Legend's Keith saves jazz (or at least starts to) and gets the best speech in the film when he tells Seb that he's too traditional and that jazz is about the future. But that's because Seb is selfish and he only cares about what he wants, at least insofar as it pertains to his dreams. He changes for Mia, but also realizes he has to let her go. Ironically this unselfish act leaves him alone. His passion, which we normally prize so much in films like this, doesn't make him big or famous, but instead leaves him small and alone. His type, the classic bold and passionate man with a dream who can't be stopped type, isn't real. But as an example to others it does (much like a good musical on our lives, more on that in a bit).Mia in her empathy, grace and selflessness attains her dream and makes a family. Yet she doesn't have the person who helped her achieve all this. She tells Seb that his passion will become other people's if he believes in it enough, but it's his passion for pursuing A dream that affects her and causes her to write her play and sing a song and nail her audition. Her sensitivity is what makes her strong, a conduit for passions on screen and off.What this movie could be suggesting, much like Whiplash's carefully constructed ideology about the costs and sacrifices of pursuing a dream, is that everyone needs a push. A push in the direction that you may not be capable of on your own. Mia developing a backbone, believing in herself because Seb does. Seb dropping his stubbornness and pride so that he can make money playing for a real gig so that he can open his club later. And that this is in effect the true beauty and romance of our lives. What the epilogue suggests is not ""what could have been"", so much as ""what could never be."" Life is a beautiful breathtaking musical of love and passion and romance and adventure, even if it doesn't end up how you think and doesn't follow a tightly scripted path. If you spend too much time worrying about why your life isn't a Hollywood fairy tale romance, you will miss out on the musicality and the truth of the present. Classic musicals are a state of mind not a state of being.",1
240,"Wow, I knew this movie would be pretentious, but i thought it would at least be interesting.  I was wrong.  I actually fell asleep in the theater, the first time I've ever done that.",0
241,"This movie was absolutely terrible. I took a date to see it as she wanted to see it (of course), I was bored out of my mind. The movie had absolutely no substance.",0
242,"There are some delightful sequences here in what should have been a wonderfully serendipitous film, but sadly the overall experience is lacklustre. Stone and Gosling make magic on occasion, but both have singing voices which aren't suited to a musical, and whilst their performances are polished, they're not good enough to save the storyline from fading into mediocrity. The cinematography again has a few shining moments, but these are hampered by intermittent framing issues, producing blurred or confused compositions which detract from what are some magnificent sets. Finally, the score which is of the highest importance in a musical is adequate throughout, with a few moments of exquisite crafting that ultimately and disappointingly fail to elevate this film to the soaring heights which I expected. 6.97/10",1
243,This movie is so overrated that I had to run on my PC just to give it a rating it deserves. People are full of **** movie is pretty bland with terrible ending.,0
245,"La La Land, not quite my tempo.In general, I do not enjoy musicals, so I kept my expectations as low as possible before viewing this one.I do not think I have ever been more bored in my life, and I have literally watched paint dry. I cared a little about Sebastian, because he was devoted in jazz, even in some weird way, but not at all about Mia, who wanted to become an actress but had not even watched ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and did not convince in any other way during the movie about her devotion in acting (e.g., saying something about her favorite scene or actress and how that made her feel, we just see her going through terrible auditions).Someway along the movie we get our scheduled love-fight, meant to temporarily separate the couple, so that the plot can move on. The way the fight escalates is laughable. At this point I realized that the script might have been written by an AI and not a human being. But, anyway, Sebastian makes it up for her, and the couple is about to reunite, but they put their relationship in a pause in order for them to pursue their dreams. That is logical. It turns out that Mia meets someone else, marries him, and has a child. That is also logical and can happen in real life. What is not logical is the fact that they have not kept in touch during all those years and act all surprised when they meet by chance again after 5 years. Doesn't technology exist in this movie? Phone calls? E-mails? Airplanes? I would have fought nail and tooth to reunite with my loved one, and if failed, put some closure, within months, at most. This is so stupid!",0

252,"Beautiful and mesmerizing. La La Land is what a modern musical should be; fun, colourful, dramatic and full of real life humanity.

I felt that the world had paused, it hit me hard with the brilliant ending sequence. I've since seen La La Land 3 more times and each time it still affects me emotionally, Damien Chazelle has done it again. I had no idea he directed this and Whiplash when I had first seen this, but I was a huge fan of Whiplash as another movie that affected me emotionally.
