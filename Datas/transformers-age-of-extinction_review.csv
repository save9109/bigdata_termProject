0,"Even going to this movie with low expectation set and telling yourself ""It's another Michael Bay's film, don't keep high hopes"" wouldn't prepare you for a total train wreck. Mark Walhberg's protagonist, polished actions sequences, shiny new Autobots and badass villian Lockdown,  won't be able to help cover the film's clunky plot, excessive characters and secondary villains, unlikable female lead and her useless boyfriend. Everything about this movie is either about the director's addiction with explosion and destruction or about nothing at all except its existence being another means to make more money for another sequel which we don't need. Either come up with a reboot or pass the license to another director like Guilermo del Toro. Stop making films this way, Mr. Bay.",0
1,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bay took a cliche gun and blasted everything in sight. Bad dialogue, wooden acting, terrible science, awful story.",0
2,"Let's put cards on the table, alright? The first Transformers was okay. The second Transformers was, undeniably, a great piece of sh*t. The third Transformers was slightly better than it's predecessor, but it was still a piece of trash. Now, it comes the next installment directed by Michael Bay just to destroy the franchise once and for all (but still the film will, unbelievably, make 1 billion dollars). The film show us Cade Yeager trying to get money in order to put his daughter Tessa into college. Oh yes there's no Megan Fox, let's just put the chick from the ""Last Airbender"" into this excrement. And in case if you're wondering, YES, this movie has annoying characters just like the other three movies. Meet Lucas: The most annoying character in the whole film (Thank god he's dead), the guy was so stupid, so stupid that in the beginning of the movie he couldn't catch a ball right in front of his eyes. Later, Cade brings an old truck which is by the way, OPTIMUS PRIME!!!! What a happy coincidence!!! I was saying that he brings an old truck to remove and sell the parts (for the reason I already mentioned) and bla bla bla bla, why we need that character development anyway? Meanwhile, the humans try to hunt down the Autobots (even thought that Autobots save the Earth like, 3 times) for a very, very poorly conceived reason that my brain is still processing such an undeveloped plot element. When they find that Mr. Yeager hid Optimus in his barn, they go to his little house and the movie introduce us: Titus Welliver, yeah the guy with the sunglasses! Titus send his men to search the whole place in order to find Optimus and then Cade says ""Oh wait! You can't search my farm without an warrant!"", Titus replies ""My face is the warrant!"" *Stares in silence* *Sighs* Okay... I think I'm okay.  Moving on, Titus threats Cade's daughter and in the last second, Optimus shows up and says ""HERE I AM!"" Seriously? He couldn't just ripped off ""Dexter"" and say ""Surprise motherf*cker!!!""? Cade and his daughter are saved by Tessa's boyfriend, oh yeah wait until you read this. Cade, Tessa, Lucas and Shane are running from the police and in the middle of the chase, Cade finds out that his daughter is dating with Shane and instead of just focusing in WHAT'S IMPORTANT, he starts arguing with Tessa!!! Yes, of course! When I'm being chase by dozen of police cars and police choppers, I'll just ask why my girlfriend didn't ate her cornflakes in the morning. There's a scene where Cade is fighting with Titus in a building and instead of picking up a knife to stab him in the neck or in the heart, he decides to use an american football. Really? I mean, really???!!!! Meanwhile, in the final battle (because I forgot the confused and meaningless plot, it doesn't matter anyway) Joshua becomes, inexplicably, a comedian. And, can you believe people actually laughed at Michael Bay's stupid comedy? After the end of the battle, Tessa realizes that they don't have a place to stay and Joshua says ""I think I might help you with that"". What a stupid miracle! Michael Bay didn't even tried to make a decent ending! For almost 3 f*cking hours, the filmmakers were kidding with my face. The narrative is overstuffed with crazy action sequences (that never end) and nonsensical plot elements, there is no plot, the cast knew the movie was **** but they didn't tried, the dialogues are so f*cking stupid, the run-time is too damn long, there's too much product placement, the character development is completely unnecessary and THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS SUBSTANDARD AND RETARDED MOVIE DIDN'T GIVE A F*CK ABOUT THE ESSENCE OF A GOOD ACTION MOVIE! This movie removes my taste for good movies. I wouldn't recommend it neither to my worst enemy.",0
3,"I went into this movie wanting to like it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first Transformers, I thought Revenge of the Fallen was awful, and Dark of the Moon was decent.  I figured Michael Bay would improve in Age of Extinction after learning from the mistakes from the previous movies.  I was wrong.  The story makes absolutely no sense, the editing is extremely sloppy, and Bay has this strange fascination with making Optimus Prime a bloodthirsty killer.  When it comes to the action and effects, Age is a step down from its predecessors, pure and simple.  Bay also had a very good chance to introduce a new villain who had potential to be so incredibly badass throughout the new series of films, but that hope is quickly washed away.  I can honestly say, this is one of the worst movies I've ever watched.",0
4,"Honestly I can't find a worse way to WASTE 2.5 hours of my life and $12 than watching this. If you love lots of explosion, robots, mindless characters, bad dialog, bad directing, bad humor, too much action scenes and idiotic editing, then this is for you. You are better off watching Mythbusters. It has better explosions, smarter robots, better characters, better dialog, better humor, better editing and best of all, it is free.",0
5,"CRAP that is all..... if you love the past 3 transformer movies well you'll probably love this crapfest and clap at the end, and think its a good movie! however everyone else can see that Michael bay has remade the same movie 4 FREAKING TIMES!!!! the same movie! again, crap acting (except wahlberg), crap dialogue, crap writing, crappy everything!!!!! gahhhhhhhhhhhhhh and whats worst is that this movie will surely make a billion dollars again because people are stupid and love to watch crap! you people go watch your crap, i will rewatch X-Men Days Of Future Past again for the 4th time a brilliant film!",0
6,Urrrgghhhhh.... plausible storyline? nah. good dialogue? nope. good action scenes? negative. crappy jokes? check. heart felt conversations at the stupidest possible times? yessir.,0
7,"This film is terrible. Much worse than the first and third, and even worse than the second. The action was solid, as I expected, but everything else was soooooooooo freaking bad that I have to give this film a zero. The plot sounded good on paper, but was executed so badly by Bay & co. The acting by almost everyone was so bad, even Kelsey Grammer and Stanley Tucci couldn't save this film. Along with soulless product placements (i.e. Bud Light & Red Bull), there were so many errors on the film set and the film disregards everything (and I mean EVERYTHING, plot and all) from the first three films. I thought the humor would be better in this film with TJ Miller in it, but the same poor humor reigned on from the previous films. However, the biggest problem in my opinion was the length. 2 ½+ **** hours was waaaay too long for a film like this. It's painful to sit there for that long, and if it were shorter, I would give the film more remorse. Lastly, there was such little explanation when it came to the Dinobots', who had a very limited role, and Lockdown's existence. Outside of the generally solid action sequences and good CGI, Transformers: Age of Extinction was a terrible film that I will (and hope i will) never see again. As good as the 1st and 3rd films were in this action-packed series, this series will probably go on the decline after this atrocity. Don't see this, even if you liked the first three films, like me.",0
8,"Transformers age of endorsement! This pile of rubbish has more product placements than regular television. The characters were exciting a wallpaper paste and the visuals were pornographic. This is 165 minutes of Michael bay madness. If you wish to see this, don't think too hard about the plot or you will hurt yourself and make sure you are comfortable.",0
9,"Slightly better than the second, which frankly sucked, and not as good as the third, which was mildly entertaining.  Even with his best heroic effort, Mark Wahlberg could not save this film.  He barely managed to be mildly convincing in his earnestness to save his daughter from all the evil humans and machines.  Admittedly, this in itself could be considered quite a feat given the incredulous stupidity of what constituted a plot.   Family discovers Autobot.  Everyone wants to kill Autobot and family.  They fail.  Autobots save family.  Family saves Autobots.  Rinse and repeat. What the first film had, and the third one at times achieved, were Autobots with whom the audience could at least identify.  This movie utterly lacked any semblance of the rapport that Shea LaBeouf had established with Bumblebee in the previous films.  Here Bumblebee was little more than a caricature.  Optimus was dogmatic and stifled.  All the machines, the Autobots most especially, were for the lack of a better word, soulless.  The movie would have been improved by removing all human/machine interactions.  When a Transformers movie would be better without any Transformers in it, then that in itself is sad statement.",0
10,"I loved the first film, the 2nd was bad but it was not that terrible compare to that one. Seriously? No scenario, the acting is really bad, why all people try to save that ugly thin girl? The boyfriend is useless, and the whole story make no sense.",0
11,"What could have ended up being a pretty decent action film is ruined by the overly long run time and poorly put together plot. Very disappointing that Michael Bay was allowed to return, This could have been the film that they ""rebooted"" the series with should they have put another director in his place.",0
12,"Not that great. Felt more emotion out of the Autobots rather than the humans. Stanley Tucci was nice surprise, and so was TJ Miller's character (he's an actual comedian).In summary, maybe rent if nothing else is better, or you like the series, otherwise you can skip this one.",0
13,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is bland, boring, clunky and generic. The 'reboot' of the cast does nothing to shield the inevitable overlong Michael Bay money mayhem",0
14,This movie should win a oscar for the worst movie of the year it hardly makes any sense that ratchet got killed by the military and that optimus was killing humans the only good thing about this movie is the last 45 minutes it would've been the best of the series if the story if decepticons and autobots switched like to make ratchet kill the guy who killed him and ksi was making autobots and then the decepticons get jealous and then make a factory then big war blaa blaa blaa the point is the movies rubbish oh yeah and one thing why didn't steven speilberg not direct it?oh yeah and bmaster if your reading this I accidentally pressed disagree when I actually mean I liked it like whoops,0
15,"Its as bad as I expected, its Michael Bay so what did you expect? There is something wrong with you if you expected a 95 percent movie here. The worst thing about this movie is that it took away the ONE thing Bay does well, big special effects loaded action scenes.  The effects looked cheap in this one and there were very few transformers in it.  Say what you will about him, he can do those like nobody else, its like all his talent is bunched up on that one thing. There are still many thing I don't understand about the series like why the hell do they shoot bullets and throw physical grenades? They are robots, why don't they shoot lasers like on the show? Movie logic issue, if these cheap new transformers turn into flying blocks when they transform then how are they killing them? They are like the T-1000 now so if you smash them can't they turn back into blocks then reform? can they drop the whole bumble bee doesn't talk thing? that got old 10 minutes in. biggest problem with the movie, the Dinobots... They are in 3 scenes, don't apear until almost the end, there are only 4 and they don't talk.",0
16,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is the king meaningless trash. Unbearable length, endless action sequences, no story at all, way below average acting and a director that simply doesn't understand how to make a film.",0
17,A 2 hour 45 minute slow motion explosion fest mixed with extremely poor dialogue and as many shots of women in short shorts as possible.  To sum it up a Michael Bay movie.  D,0
18,"I wasn't even going to bother rating this movie, But people out there have to be warned about this god awful lump of trash.  Michael Bay is better than this.",0
19,"""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" 10 Scale Rating: 3.5 (Bad) ... The Good: The human cast is an improvement over the previous casts. While they were mostly in the way, they were at least mostly tolerable. The story, at least initially, wasn't bad. A black ops mission to kill all Transformers, while convincing the public/government that they are only hunting evil Decepticons, was promising. Kelsey Grammar was excellent as the film's human antagonist. When the Dinobots (finally) show up, it is a pretty amazing spectacle. The Bad: First off, the film clocks in at just under THREE HOURS. That is three hours of bombastic Micheal Bay action and at around the 1:15 mark, the decent story falls apart and becomes silly. Revolving around a rare mineral called ""Transformiam"" (I kid you not), we watch as Bay re-creates the first three films with the same scenes, same action sequences, and same silly dialogue. I'll give him credit, the potty humor was gone ... but Bay couldn't help but interject a series of one-liners from every character's mouth regardless of the situation. As in the previous installments, the robot villains are mostly drones devoid of any sort of personality and the overwhelming majority of them are targets that seem to explode on contact. Also, as usual once again, the humans seem invincible and had no problem jumping into a battle involving anywhere from 3 to 20 robots leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. I can suspend belief to an extent, but our heroes survived crashes, long falls, explosions, shrapnel, repeated hails of bullets, and all out attacks from Decepticons. Give me a break. Moderately better than the last two Transformers films, the fourth installment is just as messy, boring, and disappointing as it's predecessors. Bay clearly does not care about the mythology or story behind the Autobots and Decepticons and is simply using the license to make a horrible robot/alien invasion film. Purists and fans of the source material will once again walk away shaking their heads.",0
20,"Michael Bay has officially hit the bottom, even in his standards; watch has he creates the ultimate 3 hour, repeated slow motion, Victoria's secret/ Budweiser/ beats/ Lamborghini/ other crap endorsement-filled, **** cast and their horribly bad acting movie that is ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"".",0
21,"Another million dollar waste. These Transformer films are all the same, massive budgets and lacklustre revenue. The story is poor, the characters are poor, the idea that a fourth instalment is acceptable is poor. Nothing about it sets it apart from previous instalments convincingly. The use of CGI is incredible, but misplaced, within an unworthwhile production that nobody will even remotely remember.",0
22,"How can a movie about giant transforming robots shooting each other in the face be BORING?! It truly takes a master to fail so bad, that he could make a movie where after what feels like 4 hours of explosions leaves me snoozing in my seat.insanely dull and prolonged. 1/10",0
23,"Thank god for the robots as the actors with a sub-standard script nearly ruin the movie! Bay - you dont have to only use lambos, paganis and other supercars - theres plenty of classics out there without (as an earlier reviewer said) choosing your cars like you choose your female actors - that being purely on looks with no substance! The movie dragged on too long to shoehorn pointless scenes in to what is a chaotic plot which struggles to keep coherence. Whilst we all accept a but of ""unrealism"" - Motorbike stunts which would leave people with broken limbs, flying vehicles crashing which would leave (unbelted/secured) passengers with a broken neck along with wahlbergs repeated whiney ""i love my daughter you're all that matters to me"" makes getting through the first half of the movie hard work. When wahlberg proceeds to use his men-in-black style cricket gun to obliterate enemies that optimus can't seem to dent with his sword I gave up on hoping for the movie to redeem itself. Frasier shouldnt have been in the cast - again another character who repeats his mantra, this one being ""ive worked 20years for my country, i have no money now i want to get paid"" - I would have preferred to have seen him killed off half an hour in. Stanley Tuccis unfortunate role as an ironic ""poor-mans"" tony stark billionaire attempt - his bipolar switch from greedy millionaire to selfless goofy romantic is really sloppy and non-nonsensical. I love good action scenes but the last hour left you with action-fatigue as bay rams in as many locations and city obliterating weapons as he can. galvatron was the main threat when his 50+ bots start trashing Hong Kong, but  then we switch to the bounty hunter for the rest of the movie, galvatron must take a coffee break for half an hour because he doesnt seem to get involved until after the autobots deal with the bounty hunter... For the next one bay - stick with 95% transformers as your cast or spend a bit more on the script before this franchise drops off a cliff.",0
24,"I joined Metacritic purely so I could rate this latest pile of nonsense from Mr Bay. Even Dark of the Moon had a couple of decent moments during its bum numbing running time but now he has hit a real low. This is by far the worst of his films (I love Armageddon and The Rock). The plot is overblown and the running time far too long. I actually fell asleep at one stage (at about 5.50 pm) Far worst still is the script and I quote Male lead to 17 year old female love interest ""Take hold of the stick (gear stick), she's the best at it"". Stanley Tucci (shame on you Mr Tucci) has replaced Ken Jeong in the annoying slapstick role. Finally the picture quality looked positively Low Definition compared to the Planet of the Apes 3D.",0
25,"I thought this one couldnt get any worse than the first trilogy. It did. I actually liked the first movie, every of the next was absolutely crap. If you want to have the same effect for less money you can watch a 3 hrs TV-AD of all these famous, expensive brands, where everything explodes. Wahlberg was ok, his daughter gorgeous.",0
26,"Michael Bay..... go **** yourself. You think this is ""entertainment.""  Then I guess ramming my **** in a blender and slamming th puree button is just a BLAST!! This was probably the worst experience I've ever had in a theater. I hated everything about this movie and as this trainwreck tugged along at a GLACIAL pace, my hatred for the people involved with the ""film"" and the people in my audience who were clapping, laughing and cheering grew to the point of pure fury. 2/10 - Abysmal.",0
27,"Otra película de Transformers??? ¿de verdad? analicemos un poco las anterioresTransformers: Muy bien hecha, la historia, los efectos y las secuencias de acción son entretenidas y muy bien hechas (la mejor de todas)Transformers 2: Es increíble como la primera película es una excelente adaptación, si hubieran respetado el mismo estilo que la primera parte, no hubieran caído tan bajo, repleta de chistes malos, trama aburrida y lo unico que recuerdo es como un robot se follaba la pierna de Megan FoxTransformers 3: Mas de lo mismo pero con una duración de casi 3 horas...Transformers 4: MAS, MAS MAS Y MAS DE LO MISMO!la historia: aburrida, floja, sin chiste, lo unico llamativo son los efectos (Que en esta son cansados hasta morir) muchas explosiones, (Michael explosiones locas Bay) cansan, los chistes son tontos, dan pena, y su duración eterna hacen que sea insoportable.",0
28,"This is a new low even for Michael Bay. This is the worst movie I've seen all year and worst of all, it's NO DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER THREE. Michael Bay gives us the same exact movie and at this point, stop making these cash grabs! This is a terrible movie!",0
29,How do you think this film turned out? Bad. Its not as annoying as the second one but it is a bore nonetheless. It has all the problems that the previous films have had but they are even more prevalent this time around and it doesn’t help that this film is ridiculously long making the whole lot of nothing overstay its welcome even more. This film makes me feel empty and lifeless. The new cast adds nothing to the film since they lack as much character as the characters in the previous films. Unless you are a die-hard Transformers fan and loved the previous films then you should definitely skip this one.,0
30,"As an Michael Bay action movie, nobody could expect a serious story line, but it would be nice if we had at least some resemblance of a story, and that said story made as much sense as it could in context of fighting robots.Instead we have characters with no personality, no history, no context and are there merely to give the Transformers a bad guy to kill.The whole concept of the seed makes no sense, and conflicts with the concept of the All Spark from the earlier movies. You don't transformium to make transformers, you just need the all spark. So, does the action save this film. No, not really. Nothing outstanding in the action stakes. Completelty forgettable scenes and nothing that stands out. All in all, save your money",0
31,Watch the Honest trailers and Everything wrong with videos on youtube regarding Transformers Age Of Extinction that's all I can say................Bye,0
32,"Well the good news is Age of Extinction isn't as offensive as Bay's previous Transformer outings.Though the trailers promised something different this time around: more focus on character than bang, Age of Extinction quickly becomes more of the same big screen megalomania we expect from Mr. Bay.Mass destruction, exceptionally incoherent and punishingly loud and long.Best watched in several sittings, Age of Extinction is an exhausting piece of American excess.",0
33,Ratchet dies.    .,0
34,"My opinion of this... ""movie"" has only deteriorated over time. The effects are actually WORSE than the previous installments, and the acting is also downright awful. I would give praise to Walberg and Tucci's performances, but they played characters so generic and cliché that it completely undermined their acting talent. In addition, there is an ABSURD amount of obnoxious product placement. It's almost as obnoxious as if you're watching a huge battle scene, and then one of the characters randomly turns to the camera, holds up a Bud Lite, and says some corny line ending in ""Drink Bud Lite!"" In fact, it actually almost does that in once scene. On to the dialog. It is so poorly written that I almost laughed at one point. Optimus is beating the crap out of the massive Dinobot Transformer who is supposedly Grimlock (even though he submits in under a minute) where Optimus yells out, ""We're giving you freedom!"" and then a few seconds later, when he has mounted Grimlock (Yes, mounted), he scrapes his sword against Grimlock's face saying, ""Defend my family, or die."" Being forced to do something doesn't quite sound like freedom to me. Speaking of, there are Dinobots in this movie... I think. If they are, they're only in it for the last twenty minutes or so with about six minutes of total screen time, and their names are never spoken of once (hence why I said he was supposedly Grimlock; they never even tell you his name in the movie). Not to mention that some don't even look like Dinobots; a few look like botched genetic experiment involving lizards that got a few tons of rusty metal welded onto their bodies. Did I mention the plot is idiotic and a complete copy/paste from the previous installments? My last criticism, is the run time. This movie has all the content you'd expect from a Michael Bay Transformers wet dream (ten explosions per second, battle scenes erupting around random hot girl extras, an UNDERAGE girl for the movie's main hot chick, and a moronic plot), and seemingly has the length of a Lord of the Rings film. Also, don't just look at me and say, ""Oh you're just a guy who jumped on the Michael Bay hate bandwagon"", because I'm not. I'm one of the few people willing to go on record saying that I liked Dark of the Moon. That being said, I hope it carries some considerable weight when I say that this is an awful film.  Lastly, to those defending this garbage and saying that people who dislike it just don't know how to have fun with movies or some other stupid derogatory insult (seriously, I saw this one guy who said people giving this negative reviews should be hung), quit lying to yourself and realize that there are these things called opinions.  In addition, you can't say that this is good if it lived up to your expectations.  If you go in expecting this kind of crap and you get it, that still doesn't make it good.  That just means it was what you were expecting; they're two completely different things.  If it lived up to your expectations of being an explosions-fest with wooden characters you don't care about, you still can't say it's better or even as good as an action movie with good characters, good dialog, good acting, and a good story.  This has none of those. Verdict - 2.3/10Seriously though, the things some of these 'positive' reviews say just make me lose faith in humanity.",0
35,"I thought the first 3 Transformer movies ranged from ""good"" to ""OK.""  I had hope for better when I heard there was a new cast and new Transformer designs, but this is far, far worse.  The plot and editing are non-sensical.  I rented this through Netflix and literally stopped watching 2/3 of the way through because it was so terrible.  I have never done that before.  I give it a 1 only for the amazing special effects and I don't believe in giving 0's.",0

Transformers: Age of Extinction is one of the longest movies I've ever watched. It's running time rivals The Lord of the Rings movies. I absolutely hate Transformers: Age of Extinction.The only thing I liked about this movie was seeing Mark Wahlberg act and thinking about how he would make the perfect Nathan Drake. But of course something like that would not get me to budge from a 0/10. Oh, and what makes this movie even worse, is that I saw one of my favourite movies of all time in the next week!

40,"Michael Bay for sure had blew away more than we can suffer on his table of torturous Ka-Boom!an insult to a generation which tends to have you vomiting on your popcorn and choking to the point you won't be talking for days Director Michael Bay has returned and has officially ruined the Transformers franchise by taking a much larger tsunami dump into his faltered grade B- trilogy with a solid grade F reboot fourth installment the film had more lazy direction that you can notice most of the scenes weren't visually edited, more explosions, domestic violence that will scar your kids for life, more of Bay's signature explosive trademarks, hot girls with no shred of shame or morality, more favorite autobot deaths, gory retribution, new but unimpressingly lame Autobot characters, and probably Mark Wahlberg's biggest mistake since The Happening, starring alongside alongside new Bay girl of the year Nicola Peltz from the much more painful the Last Airbender, the film is so bad they found a lazy excuse to cut the filming and shift the entire remainder of filming to Hong Kong (also in an unedited shot you can see the Chicago Sears Tower WHEN YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE IN HONG KONG!!) a terrible gimmick to get more money at the Box Office by buying foreign nations to buy the film by filming it in their country overseas, that as an average american viewer, you can't stop it from being an elaborate staged box office success the franchise has suffered enough by the hands of the f@#% dyne-rector Bay who is probably the only director who gets away",0

44,"Wow, what a total letdown! I thought this movie could be at least entertaining in that typical Michael Bay fashion. However, even Bay's love for over the top explosions has officially went sour. Not even the brand new cast could have saved any redeeming quality about this crap fest of explosions and sh*tty story telling. Literally the only good thing about the movie was the first 3 minutes or so. After that, it all went down from there. If your a film lover, SAVE YOURSELF from this embarrassment! Overall, it's one of the worst if not the worst in the franchise thus far! I'm still debating between this and the second one! Either way, it gets an F for FAILURE!",0

Crapping on storyline aside(movies have their own take on things thats the way it is) there is little redeeming content to this film. The human protagonists are little more than simple character tropes, the gaps in logic you usually just chalk up to hey its a movie leave you feeling like your stupid or the director thinks your stupid, and the story is little more than action cliches strung together to make kinda sense. Who would have though the only thing keeping this string of farces from being wholly soulless was our shared hate for Shia Labeouf.",0
49,""" The Best GROUNDBREAKING  Transformers film ever "".  Every generation comes on by then a transformer movie releases and it has impressed me. Its 2014 Transformers get release so far the graphics are a perfection , I think that Erhen Krueger ( Co-Creator of Scream  3 also written the two previous transformers movies). Really made awesome transformers creatures realistic he was not the reason that transformers was not a disappointment). Mark Whalberg as a dad also the girl form the"" last airbender "" Nicola Peltz as the daughter( she was not the reason i wanted to watched the T4 or Whaleberg). I wanted to watch it because i seen the trailer it got me interested in seeing this movie. So far Shia LeoBouf is not returning i do not know what to say he was good in the  Transformers Trilogy also he was in basically in the war with optimus fighting the bad robots ( By the way he will not be returning for Transformers 5).  Mark  Whalberg replaced him which was something that Transformers needed he was outstanding in this film with that weird alien gun and actually fighting with it and doing things that  was able to do in the war his performance was a  great conflict between decipticons , war with the anti Transformers humans. I am glad megan fox was in this film she is not hot she is just a stereotype character who loves motor cycles and stripping  on it. LeBouf well he his performance in Revenge in fallen , Dark Moon and the 2007 Transformers were pretty awesome  which was an A+ performance. There are few stereotypes in this movie were the daughter has a secret boyfriend which the dad never knew about every father and daughter drama movie does that DING DING DING !. also where the girl gets caught in the ship with prime and all she did was scream and bang glass DING DING DING !!!!!!!!!!!! #stereotype. Thats whats Rosie Hunginton Whiteley did in Dark moon. Micheal Bay did it AGAIN !!!!!!!  adds stereotypes to his films. Its  Micheal Bay's fourth time directing the installement to the transformer series. Which he made T4 awesome and good direction and good adventure for bay directing.  i  reconsider directing transformers 5.Grade A+",0

52,"Wow, this movie sucked. I liked Transformers 1 and 3 quite a bit and I was expecting to like this one. For a start the run time is atleast 20 minutes too long for a Transformers movie, the humans are really weak, even worse than Sam. This movie was written by the guy who wrote TF 2 in 2009 and it shows. The writing is **** dredfull.3/10 only because some of the action was pretty cool.",0
53,"Bay once again butchers another franchise. I could not believe what i was actually watching. The only interesting thing in this film was the transformers. The rest utterly stunk. Whats bay going to come up with next transformer love story's ?. 2/10. Disappointed.",0
54,"When you think of Transformers, you think of awesome CGI and big explosions right? Age Of Extinction has those, but in a very, very long dragged out 2 hour and 45 min movie. Lets start out by saying the acting is terrible, there is a funny character at the beginning, but the comedy dies down after the first 25 minutes and things start to get boring, with suckish plot twists and no aim what so ever for plot or character development this is just a long waste of time. 3/10",0
55,"Transformers: age of extinction -  a bitter disappointment. usually I a quite a fan of Michael Bay's moving camera and grand action sequences with lots of explosions but I can't help but feel this time  he has gone a little too far. with the new introduction with Mark Wahlberg was a good move for this series as he brings a more action role to the movie however the other additions was left a little flat with barely any back story and no chemistry between the daughter and alleged driving boyfriend. over all I i would not recommend this film it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for watching it, however i will still watch the next follow up if there ever will be another transformers film.",0
56,"Had great expectations, waited almost an year and to be frank enough, it was one of the greatest disappointments i have had. Poor storyline, well keeping aside the basic contents that are common in all the movies, the script lacks a backbone.  Few good action sequences and the graphics(which is quite remarkable) are the the only positive points i can raise after watching this movie. Not many expectations for the sequel after this.",0
57,"This movie sounded like a videogame instead of an action movie. I was victim of lotsa cliches, a generic plot, AND A UNBELIVEABLE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIONS!This movie sounded like an amateur invention. The other three were much better.I went direct to my Games folder on Windows after watching it. At least I can do a lot more.Transformers is exhausted. It can't continue anymore.",0
58,No. Just no. Don't watch it. What a waste of time and money. The only thing that's worth your money while watching this movie will be the popcorn in the theatre.,0
59,"Please let this franchise die....... Special Effects were awesome, story, acting and pretty much everything else just sucked! This movie has brought down the entire franchise, it has officially Jumped the Shark with this pile of garbage.",0
60,"Whoever did the sound design for this movie, probably has no job now. It is so bad that miscued clicks and clanks, reloads and movements, will immediately jerk you out of the movie, over and over. On the other hand Extinction does have some decent fight scenes, but they aren't as polished as the previous Transformer films, (meaning they include graphical glitches and tearing, low resolution textures, and an overall CGI quality that makes the entire movie seem less alive.). In a film that is all about  Autobots vs.Bad Transformers with Decepticon Brains, this isn't something you can afford to fail at executing in any way. Speaking of transformers, those big guys do have some very good bits of voice acting, a lot coming from John Goodman and a little coming from Peter Cullen, John Dimaggio, Ken, Reno, and crew. That single fact made me care about their survival, These few voice-actors might be the only real strong point of Extinction. Luckily now this film is on Blu-ray, so you can rent it, and then skip through the 50%-%60 of the film that should have never made it out of the editing room. The film is well-over an hour too long! Mark Walhberg tries but his character feels out of place here. The rest of the cast, including Nicola Peltz from The Bates Motel; All have very little depth and are all very weakly established. I literally hated the painful lack of chemistry among the actors so much, it made me wish they would be replaced by the previous cast. Yes, Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox would have done better. Oh.. and on top of all that, Kelsey Grammer gives a particularly off-base performance and Micheal Bay made another terrible movie, they should both earn  Raspberry Nominations for this. The film is horrifically debilitated and cliche. In one word it is, 'Extinct. Be thankful for that.",0
61,"i can't believe michael bay is getting away with just throwing the same rubbish that i din't like the first time on screen over and over again. it was too long ,too dumb and once again relayed too hard on it's special effects over telling a story. It's the worst film 2014 for me in so many ways and i'm convinced mark walhberg is trying to kill his career. oh and bay just because you point out what you're doing is painful and stupid doesn't make it any less painful and stupid",0
62,"Transformers: Age of Extinction lacks in originality, an interesting narrative or any sense of empathy towards the characters. The focus is on how much bigger the special effects can get from the previous film, evident in the emergence of the Dinobots in this film (which were definitely cool). However this does not warrant the absolute lack of any proper story, especially so when the film is bloated with tons of fight scenes with nothing remotely intellectually stimulating.",0

66,"Oh my god this movie was 3 hours long!!. The movie is about the government has decided to cut all ties with Autobots. They may be forgotten - but they are not gone - and a mechanic and his daughter discover one of the most powerful of the Autobots in their possession and it ignites a full-blown showdown between the Decepticons, Autobots and the government. This movie has terrible looking visual effect's and the characters are forgettable as always. The only good thing in this movie is Optimus prime and Mark Wahlberg, but anything else is crap.",0
67,"In my opinion, this is the worst out of the entire franchise. This movie has an almost 3 hour run time. The main characters you really don't care about at all. Forced humor, forced romance. This movie just gets really lazy. The CGI in it is really bad and very disappointing. So much product placement as well. This movie is full of Bay-isms. Explosions, racism, product placement, hot extras. It's terrible. They ruined a character that had so much potential, Galvatron. I could go on and on about it. Keeping it short, this movie sucks on every level. The worst one out of the franchise.",0
69,"HOW THE **** DO YOU MAKE A MOVIE THIS BAD?!?!? Jesus, I really don't understand how a human being with a functioning brain ban make a movie like this! The CGI is horrible, the product placement is just distasteful, the pandering (more like cock sucking honestly) to China is so prevalent, the acting is just bland, and the story is just, Jesus, it is something to behold.... If this site allowed for negative ratings I would go for a nice -10 and an actual human **** inside a jar shipped to Michael Bay.",0
71,"I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but... I miss Shia LaBeouf. Dear god, why Marky Mark as the lead role? Why so much product placement? Why do you use ROBOT DINOSAURS as a major selling point and barely even show them in the film?! Just stop.The only thing that saves the movie from a 0 or a 1 is the CGI. That's fine. Next time, Michael, just give us a 3 hour robot fight, please.",0
73,"This movie is stupid enough (from the story to the dialogues everything is really really dumb)  and long enough to get annoying and then irritating 1 point out of ten because the vote for the movie itself would be -10, but special effects are worth 11.",0
74,"Michael Bay is a director who doesn't know when to stop. Every single time one of his movies gets bashed by critics and audiences, he carries on making his movies, I'm not sure if that's an inspiration, or just that's plain ignoring everyone who is offering constructive criticism. I did not have high hopes for 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' simply because after having sat through three of his other films, what could be so different about this one? Yes, it has a new cast, but new actors doesn't always improve a franchise, as long as the people behind the scenes remain unchanged, then you're getting the same product with some cool looking features. Mark Wahlberg replaces the noisy Shia LaBeouf as Cade Yeager, a single father who lives in Texas with his daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz). He claims himself to be an inventor, often collecting old scraps of metal, and taking them into his barn outside his house, and trying to create something innovative. He comes across a Transformer in the form of a van and tries to fix it. The Transformer, of course, is Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and after having his life saved by Cade, Optimus promises to protect the Yeager family. Kelsey Grammer is the main antagonist here, he believes that all of the Autobots are evil ever since the events that occurred in Chicago (check 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'), and wants to wipe out all of the Autobots. We also meet a man named Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci), the head of KSI who develops his own line of Transforming technology. It seems that the plot needs to be put on hold for the sake of trying to focus on the Yeager family drama, as it seems that Cade's daughter, who is 17, is dating a 20 year old Shane Dyson (Jack Reynor). Obviously, any person will know that it is unacceptable for a man in his 20s to be dating someone under the age of 18, but there is one scene that actually lets the two love-birds explain why it is acceptable for the 20 year old and 17 year old to be dating. Shane even goes as far as to present Cade an official card which is basically saying that they are allowed to do some ""naughty stuff"", just because they have a card saying they could do so. Michael Bay is known for trying to objectify women as much as he can (remember, he cast an underwear model who is not an actress in the previous installment), here, even though Peltz may have been age appropriate to appear the way she did in this, the fact that her character is under-age is just nothing more than a new low for the director. I apologize if it seems like I am going off-topic about the film's main plot, but clearly the film itself went off-topic hoping we wouldn't notice...but we did. The action is your typical, slow-motion, low-angle, people running away from explosions and cars flipping over on a motorway style. There is nothing new, or different that makes this movie stand out from the previous installments, except that it's even more intolerable than before. Time and time again, my attention just wandered because this film is not very good at holding my interest, it is devoid of any intelligence or gripping moments. The characters are nothing more than archetypes...the hero is your typical hero, the villain is your typical government official villain, the young blonde girl is your typical, attractive, damsel getting herself into distress. This proves once again, that Michael Bay is a hack, cynical filmmaker, there seems to be a lack of focus and innovation in his skill as a filmmaker. He is better off directing more of those ""Victoria's Secret"" commercials, which is actually highlighted in this film. The product placement here is very in-your-face. Clearly to Bay, subtlety is overrated, everything has to have some form of exaggeration in case it wasn't clear to any of us. The run time, which is at roughly 2h 40m...is way too long to keep us entertained, one minute of this film feels like 5 minutes. You just want it to end, but Bay is clearly not sick of this roller-coaster ride which stopped being fun ages ago.",0
75,"Michael Bay has often said how he loves to ""blow things up real good."" Well, if that's his desire in life, there's little doubt that he tops himself in Transformers: Age of Extinction. This is as excruciating a movie as is likely to be experienced by anyone, anywhere. It isn't merely that the story is insulting, the characters are bland, the action is dull, and the CGI is everywhere - it's that all this goes on for nearly three hours. That's three hours of your life you'll never get back. Bay keeps saying he's done with the Transformers franchise but it draws him back like flies to **** This time around, the human actors from the earlier films have been jettisoned. At first glance, that might seem like a good thing until one realizes that people in Bay films are as interesting and important as background décor. It's really all about the robots, the orgiastic display of CGI destruction, and (of course) the explosions. I wish I could say ""just sit back and enjoy the ride"", but there's a reason roller coasters are only a few minutes long. Is there a story here? It's not War and Peace but there's something that might be mistaken for the skeleton of a plot if viewed in dim light. For those who care about continuity, events in Transformers: Age of Extinction take place five years after those of the previous film, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. By this time, the Transformers have been virtually eliminated from Earth as a result of a ruthless cleansing scheme spearheaded by CIA Black Ops hotshot Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer in full Stinky Pete mode). Attinger has help from a Decepticon called ""Lockdown"" (voice of Mark Ryan), who has come to Earth in search of Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen). The CIA bad guy has also formed an alliance with billionaire inventor Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci), who has figured out how to build Transformers. His pilot project is something he calls ""Galvatron"" (voice of Frank Welker) - a robot that looks an awful like the dreaded (and supposedly dead) Megatron. n the acting department, Mark Wahlberg is an upgrade on Shia Labeouf, although it hardly matters. Walhberg does his job and stands around looking suitably awed, angry, or frightened, depending on what the script requires. Somehow, Stanley Tucci manages to rise above the material and leave an impression. It helps that he's used partially for comedic relief and gets to utter the best one-liner (one that uses up the movie's PG-13 single ""f-word"" allowance). Tucci's success is counterbalanced by Nicola Peltz's failure. The Transformers movies have had their share of annoying characters but none (not even the one played by Megan Fox) has achieved the apex occupied by Peltz's Tessa, who one-ups the worst horror movie heroine in terms of incompetence, ignorance, and irritation factor. On more than one occasion, I was actively rooting for a robot to stomp on her or for her to fall from a great height and make a satisfying splat. I guess this could be considered a step forward for Bay - he made me feel something about a human being in a Transformers film. n the end, there's a sense that nothing much happens in Transformers: Age of Extinction, although that ""nothing"" is long, loud, and flashy. Bay's approach, which is technically proficient but without charm or life, bludgeons viewers into a near-catatonic state. If one takes a step back and looks at Transformers: Age of Extinction from a distance, the story isn't confusing but, while watching it, the sense of chaos is almost overwhelming. Shakespeare didn't know it, but when he wrote of ""sound and fury signifying nothing,"" he could have been describing this franchise. I understand that this is a ""fanboy"" driven production intended only to please those who either play with Transformers toys or have fond memories of doing so in their youth. However, it's disappointing to see how contemptuous the filmmakers are of anyone who pays good money to see a movie in the hope that it will offer more than cool special effects (that become progressively less ""cool"" the longer the film runs). This is blockbuster moviemaking at its worst - a product so cynical that it doesn't try to pretend it's anything more than a mindless spectacle. It's endless, tiresome, and tedious, but it will make so much money that Transformers 5 is a foregone conclusion. I can't think of a more compelling reason to hate Transformers: Age of Extinction.",0
76,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is best watched as either a comedy or a two hour session of mockery. In this sense, the entry price was well worth the entertaining experience. My expectations going into this film were low as it was, but I at least thought it would have some redeeming qualities as its predecessors did. I have never been more wrong in my life. With terrible dialogue, atrocious camera work, non-existent character development and a predictable and unoriginal storyline, Age of Extinction follows the pattern of it's previous instalments, only to a worse degree. Most of the film simply doesn't make sense, with contradictions around every corner. I found myself nitpicking everything wrong with the film, which was the vast majority. However, the real sadness comes when you start to imagine how you would re-work each conversation, each camera shot, each sequence. In doing this it occurs to you that you would be able to make a Transformer's film at least five times more powerful and exciting than Michael Bay's version. Given Michael Bay only looks like failing more and more with each film he makes, unless Transformer's changes directors, it will continue to remain the laughing stock of movie blockbusters.",0
77,"After watching this movie, I figured that the only thing that was on the Age of Extinction was HUMANITY! Am I right? Anyway, on with the review: Transformers 4 is longer, stupider and duller than the past three movies. The first one was watchable, the second was crap and the third was pretty bad. THIS one? This was near to unwatchable. Not worth the price of admission.",0
78,"The battle for human survival never been more visually catchy. Unfortunately, the camera handling, too much tilt screen display, and close-up made me dizzy. But I like the father and daughter relationship.",0
79,"He promised it would be shorter. He lied. Michael Bay’s fourth Transformers film clocks in at a bum-numbing 165 minutes, making it longer even than the patience-trying Dark Of The Moon. The juggernaut success of the franchise presumably gives Bay carte blanche to do what the hell he wants at this point. Disappointingly he’s simply opted for another baggily plotted, cacophonous three-hour migraine. Picking up four years after the costly Battle Of Chicago, Age Of Extinction ditches its previous human cast to introduce blue-collar Texan inventor Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg); his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz); her racing driver boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor); and Cade’s assistant Lucas (T. J. Miller). Cade has a kind of Doc Brown operation going on, building dodgy robot guard dogs and butlers in his shed. While trawling an abandoned cinema for parts he can fix and sell (the previous owner complains that audiences are now only interested in a “bunch of crap sequels and remakes”) he finds the wreckage of an old truck, which turns out to be a down-and-out Optimus Prime. In a thrown-away political metaphor, the post-Chicago Transformers are now positioned as illegal aliens, no longer trusted to “fight American wars”. Washington’s official line is that only Decepticons are being hunted, but for rogue CIA bigwig Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer), “There are no good or bad aliens: it’s just us and them.” With his henchman Savoy (Titus Welliver) and the help of an alien bounty hunter of unclear allegiance, Attinger is on a Transformer eradication kick. But he’s also in cahoots with billionaire design genius Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci), whose company has a government contract to melt down old Transformers and build new controllable ones from the leftover programmable matter. He’s got Megatron’s head. That won’t end well. The magic metal is dubbed “Transformium”, which edges Unobtainium in the stupid-name stakes by at least being a joke coined by proud-of-themselves lab dorks. So that’s working-class heroes; the government and CIA corruption; Big Business; outlaw Transformers; and a third set of alien robot hunters that are neither Decepticon nor Autobot. We’re only 40 minutes in. The extinction device the title refers to is a cyberforming “seed”. It’s important as a MacGuffin, but isn’t introduced until around the halfway point. There’s so much plot — much of it left hanging for future sequels, including a tantalising thread about heading off into space to kill God — that even at the length it is, sections still feel abridged: on one occasion we’re suddenly regaled with a Wahlberg voiceover explaining where he’s going and what he’ll do when he gets there. And yet, all this story is still just a loose string on which to hang the bludgeoning set-pieces. There are car chases, the first of which actually has little Transformer action. There are smashed buildings and massive explosions (“Possible civilian casualties,” someone warns. No **** There’s a sky-chase, and a thrillingly vertiginous high-wire sequence. For seemingly no other reason than the franchise’s Eastern popularity, the film ups sticks to China for its final act. And there are copious hero shots: a father-daughter moment made epic by a Bay sunset; a meeting of the remaining Autobots in Monument Valley; a spaceship flying over the Great Wall Of China; Optimus Prime riding a Dinobot. (Oh yes, the Dinobots. Much trumpeted, they show up for the final half hour and have no distinguishable personalities or point.) In some ways Bay does seem to have been chastened by previous criticism. While there’s still racial stereotyping afoot — Ken Watanabe’s Drift is a samurai Autobot who spouts Japanese homilies and calls Optimus “Sensei”; everyone in Hong Kong is a kung-fu fighter — there’s nothing quite as egregious as Revenge Of The Fallen’s Skids and Mudflap. The lecherous camera has also been reined in to an extent, although Bay’s low angles still can’t resist the odd Peltz arse ogle. That this doesn’t happen more often reflects the extent to which Peltz is quickly sidelined in the narrative; female characters in general come out of Age Of Extinction poorly. Li Bingbing, though strong in the ballbreaking sense, also makes little impression, and one has to feel particularly bad for Sophia Myles, who begins the film with a seemingly important role and then disappears for two hours. When she comes back she plays no part in the proceedings except to be physically present. In fact, it’s debatable what role any of the humans play in the story outside of Kelsey Grammer and Stanley Tucci. Tucci is the standout, despite a third-hour lurch from oily camp to broader clowning. Wahlberg, on the other hand, while a bigger presence than Shia LaBeouf ever was, inexplicably handy with a space gun and able to fly a ship at a moment’s notice, has so little effect on the film’s outcome that Optimus might just as well have left him and his clan back in Texas.",0
80,"It's too long and boring for a guy who's been in the theaters expecting this to be over. As for the Transformers, the age of extinction should've just came out fast so no one would see this movie anyways.",0

That might be true, assuming the kid is pugnacious, antisocial, afflicted with an attention span approaching zero, and lacking in anything remotely resembling a creative impulse. My inner child often delights in silly, loud, or otherwise unsophisticated films. Parts of Godzilla gave me chills. Misgivings aside, I'm looking forward to the next Star Wars. And, despite its recent precipitous nosedive, I still adore Doctor Who. But that inner child quails at the thought of enduring even one more minute of a Transformers movie.

New character designs for Optimus prime and bumblebee look fantastic, and the soundtrack is pretty solid. Everything else fails spectacularly, even the action. The action itself is pretty bad, especially since it's poorly shot. I can hardly tell whats going on, and it's hard to care about the characters since nothing interesting is going on. The story in this movie is poorly written and has the same problems with the other installments. It has poorly written characters who are so generic it's just pathetic. The humor in this movie is just as bad as the other two movies, which is no surprise, and the dialogue is so bad, no actor could pull this off.

97,"Although not quite as spectacularly abysmal as Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction really is one of the worst movies I`ve seen this year. It features, as one might have expected, entirely unbelievable characters engaging in entirely unbelievable activities while saying entirely unbelievable things for entirely too long.So to camouflage this sad state of affairs the movie has been attempted drowned in CGI effects, loud noises, whizbangs, pointless romance, a pointless and entirely unbelievable father-daughter intrigue and about three moments of comic relief. Most of the time you spend staring at the screen in a futile attempt to notice all the unbelievable things going on there.What really did this one in for me though was how entirely unrealistic it all was. In scene after scene all the protagonists have near death experiences, yet nobody is so much as lightly injured, with one early exception. One scene in particular just broke new ground for lack of realism, when it had three people balancing down some anchor chains, 80 floors up, then being attacked by robotic dogs while doing it and then having all the chains gradually cut, before they were caught in mid-fall by a transformers robot which then slid down the entire facade of a skyscraper while holding them in its hands. As this ludicrous scene ends they simply walk out of the hand of the transformer unscathed, and immediately go back to being in love for no apparent reason, assuring each other that they admire each other and somehow, magically, becoming proficient warriors, after having spent their lives in a barn inventing beer-fetching robots.After this of course nothing can save the movie, and it goes from ridiculous scene to ridiculous dialogue line for what in the end seems like an eternity. With the notable exception of The ""Amazing"" Spider Man this is the worst movie I have seen this year I think, and I wouldn`t recommend it to my worst enemy. Only watch this if you usually love terrible movies.",0

The only people who could possibly like it are children that car nothing about the plot and only want to see gray on gray violence.  If they cut out all the unneeded slow motion scenes the movie would have come in at less than 2 hours and 45 minutes.  If you want a good Transformers movie, watch the cartoon film from 1987.",0

104,"I went into this movie wanting to like it. I liked the first Transformers, I thought Revenge of the Fallen was awful, and Dark of the Moon was decent. I figured Michael Bay would improve in Age of Extinction after learning from the mistakes from the previous movies. I was wrong. The story makes absolutely no sense.",0

109,"Poor story, poor acting, absolutely amazing action. One thing Michael Bay does know is how to put together an action scene which is a shame the same can't be said about his story telling.I'm a fan of the first 3 regardless of how bad they were which is why it pains me to say that this is the worst of the series. The things I was worried about like the dinobots turned out alright and the things I thought was going to be fine we're awful I.e mark whalberg and co.The typical Bayisms are still there, sexualisation of the women, the lower than low toilet humor which hits rock bottom in this entry. Two of best things in the movie was finally seeing Prime in generation 1 form and Stanley tucci. A new director and screen writer are needed for the next film.",0

113,"I can't believe that this **** pile of a **** movie was able to hit the screen. I also can't believe that a transformers movie could come along and be worse than the second one. You know when a movie is bad when my friends (who liked the second one) thought this movie was terrible. The flaws were so noticeable, that Helen Keller could point them out to you. The first hour of the movie was literally **** useless. It set up **** that I could give two ****s about. Imagine setting up characters that get maybe thirty minutes of screen time in the movie. We then get to the middle of the movie it just **** drags on for about another forty five minutes to an hour. Pointless **** after pointless **** We finally get to the dining where they then start to rush things. We get two hours of straight of bull**** and 37 minutes of rushed action scenes that were alright. These movies are known for its great special effects, but it seems like they took the cheap route and decided to make graphics that would be terrible for a 2005 movie. Some of the graphics looked straight up cheap and were actually glitch most of the time. The first transformers had better graphics than these. So basically imagine taking the second Transformers movie and making the graphics ****tier, the characters more unforgettable, having two hours of **** around, with terrible acting. Well the second transformers didn't have the most stellar acting, but dear god was it better than this movie. Speaking of acting and characters. I could literally give tow **** ****s about anyone in this movie besides Optimus Prime. Mark tired to save his character with some pretty descent acting, but dear god was his character a **** He was getting run over by his daughters boyfriend the whole time. Saying **** about his daughter and without blinking an eye. . It was as if Michael Bay wanted one of the worst families of all time. At least Michael was smart enough to kill that brain dead **** in the beginning. Save us from 2 and a half hours of ****ty jokes. Though the worst acting in the movie goes to the daughter. See looked familiar and I had trouble pin pointing. If you don't know, she's that annoying girl from the last airbender. That's all you need to know about her acting ability The storyline wasn't even cornerstone half the time. They had like five different story lines going at one time, with flaws that were so damn obvious. Michael bay keeps trying to bring back Megatron and it's flipping annoying. He's now brought back as Galvatron, a man made transformer that was built Stanley's company. He basically has the same memories, but a different boy. Boy was he dumb looking as well. We move onto this random bounty hunter that wants Prime because the creators of these Transformers want him. Probably the worst looking transformer, with the ****iest back sorry, and pretty much disappears randomly throughout the movie. While that going on, we Stanley's character working with Kelsey Grammar's character to true and get the seed to get more metal. This metal is what the transformers are made out of and they're a able to make man made transformers out of it. Some how this **** can float and break apart whenever it feels like it, but not when it's convenient for survival. It's as if monkeys made the story for this movie. The only thing I liked about this movie was the Dinobots, they were pretty **** cool and were the highlight of the movie. Though they decided to only have them in the last thirty minutes. I would have to say Mark also was good. Did his best to not make his character totally **** unmemorable. I need to stop or I will just go on and on about this **** terrible movie. Basically, **** Bay and I will never pay for another Transformers movie. 1/10",0

116,"this movie is an absolute flop. The visual is eye-catching but rather fake, not as stunning as its prequels. It lacks of character development and contribution to the plot, as the protagonist' daughter is an useless character who drag the team onto outrageous situations. I just don't have any idea why she and her boyfriend are involved in the movie. This film also uses an stereotype which have already been used in all prequels: the lengthy and glorious battlecry of optimus and a tough boss. Is that all you got Michael Bay?? One more thing, i don't see the scene showing the Chinese governments and generals has anything to do with the story. Plenty of plot twist... So dissapointing",0
117,"If I had those 165 minutes back, I could so much more creative things with my life. Much better than this movie - like for example smashing my head against the wall... Movie lacks continuity, good story, people you cheer, it is full of explosions and nonsense",0
118,"Following much of the formula of the previous Transformers movies, but without the relative novelty of the first two, this one is subpar at best. The script is practically garbage. The characters are poorly developed, shallow, and much of the acting is terrible. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor and does the best job of the lot, but I think he was miscast for this role. The movie is outrageously long and drawn out - almost 3 hours of basically CRAP that not even the pretty visuals and fight scenes could save. While the special effects, explosions, and overall action scenes are spectacular as usual, some of the camera work is basically wobbling and out of focus as robots zoom by shooting at each other so that you don't really appreciate those parts of the fighting. The plot is shakier than ever, and as usual a major villain is still alive and manages to escape once again. The humor is too forced at times, and many of the lines are eye-roll and head-shake worthy. The sexy girl is for the most part lost, helpless, and put in more for the looks than anything else. There are the usual prodigious camera close-ups and various angles showing off her sexy body. The characters are once again rather shallow and dumb, particularly the girl and especially her boyfriend, who seems to have been more of an afterthought in the script. I don't even want to go on anymore with this review. Suffice it to say, I hope this is Michael Bay's last foray into the Transformers universe, for the sake of everyone genuinely interested in the Transformers.",0
119,"I actually liked the first Transformers,the 2nd is horrible and the 3rd was slightly better but still wasn't that good.I actually thought this movie was going to be good of how the plot sounded,with Mark Whalberg and the dinobots.I did see it get critically panned but I want to judge it for myself and I would have to say that I agree with the critics.This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever saw.This is probably on par with Revenge of the Fallen.This is basically a rehash from the previous films with a new cast.The action scenes aren't interesting.Its just nothing but explosions that are never ending and offers nothing new.The plot is poorly executed cause all you see is explosions than what's going on with the plot.It is also not very convincing.It is also twisted at one point where you feel like that shouldn't happen right now and later.The camera work is awful and hurts your brain after seeing it.The autobots have no soul including Optimus Prime and the movie seems lifeless.The dialogue is bad.I also didn't like how the dinobots are shown towards the end of the movie.Also the length is ridiculous with it being almost 3 hours.The only good things I can say about this movie is that the transformers look better,the plot was decent, and the performance by Whalberg and Tucci.But that can't make up of how many flaws this movie has.This movie hurts your mind and I really suggest you don't see it.Save your money.This is one of the most unpleasant experiences I had at the movies.",0
120,"Transformers as a film series has a reputation for visual excess & narrative deficit.  This movie takes this reputation, supercharges it, and rockets the results at the audience and break-neck speed and expects to satisfy - and to a large proportion of the film going public, seems to achieve its goal.  At this very moment, as I write this review, Transformers 4 has 101 positive reviews on Metacritic.com.  These reviews are littered with repeated phrases like ""no Sam Witwicky"", ""*insert robot name here* was badass"" & ""omg the action was awesome"".  And you can't really argue with these sentiments.  The visuals have always been impressive in the Transformers movies, and while I personally never felt one way or another about the character of Sam Witwicky, it appears to be consensus that he was highly disliked.  What lacks in the Transformers movies is, among many, many things, is a coherent story and fleshed out characters. The story - if you can even call it that - leaps from action set piece to action set piece with no regard for common sense, mood or character motivation.  The story plods along at snails pace (for an insane 165mins) transmitting relevant information to the movie-goer almost solely through exposition and overlong establishing shots.  Further, I was never sure about why anybody was doing anything. Nothing is explained in any detail - we as the audience are just expected to accept that humans in black clothes = bad guy, humans in pastels = good guys.  The same thing corresponds to the Transformers themselves. The characters in this latest Transformers movie are among the weakest and most poorly written of any I have seen at the movies in the longest time.  While Mark Wahlberg attempts valiantly to inject some energy in to this train wreck of a film, he is weighed down with a daughter/boyfriend subplot (communicated wholly by only the snappiest Michael Bay dialogue) and the convoluted (and pointless) good-guy motivations of the hero.  The daughter and boyfriend were dead weight, contributing nothing whatsoever to the film.  Bay, nonplussed with his failure to contribute anything meaningful character-wise decides to go full-retard instead adding a frustratingly unfunny ""slacker-employee"" character into the 1st act, who vomits rapid-fire sarcasm into the air during the initial action scenes.  His death at the end of act 1 was highly satisfying, and in line with the terrible storytelling, largely ignored by the other characters. The characters in Transformers are an unequivocal failure on all levels.  Of particular disappointment to me was Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammar, who like Wahlberg, are clearly here just for the paycheck. And since I've used the terms rapid-fire and failure already, lets talk product placement.  This is a particular peeve of mine as a movie-goer which partly explains the rage I felt as I left my local cinema.  Michael Bay, while never shy about plugging products in his film, takes it to a whole new level.  Its as if he is standing in front of the audience with a shotgun, which he uses to simultaneously blast you in the face with hip and happening products (Beats headphones - **** you) while insulting your intelligence by thinking you won't notice it happening.  Unforgivable and further evidence that Transformers is first and foremost advertising.  Who needs to consider the art of film-making when you can sell stuff, right? These monumental failures reduce my interest in the film.  No amount of explosions and car-driving montages can supplement for these deficits. Once upon a time, I had hopes that the great cartoon from my childhood would make for a great adventure movie.  4 movies later, my hopes have been well and truly dashed.  I will not be returning to the cinema to see any more Transformer movies.  I implore you all the do the same thing.",0
121,"You have to have low expectations and your brain in neutral to watch a Transformers movie, but even so this movie is BAD. The transformers don't really look anything like the cartoon series characters they are based on, they're all pretty similar and the film just ends up like two junkjards fighting eachother for nearly 3 hours. A film needs to be Epic or have a compelling story to entertain for that amount of time, and this has neither. Its dull, mind-numbing, rubbish.",0
122,"Surprise surprise, Micheal Bay Transformers movie is complete garbage. You have to be extraordinarily thick to see anything positive in this cacophony of digital noise.

124,"I had unrealistically high hopes for this film for no reason whatsoever.  What you should know is that if you're looking for action and fun scenes, there's a lot of that here. So much in fact that it'll bore you 'til the third act. The new cast is better than the old, with Mark Wahlberg in the real role, but still none of the characters are relatable, and the effects at times seem a bit unfinished. All you need to know is that it is still a Michael Bay film of 165 minutes of brain cancer on screen.With some redeeming moments, it's still not enough to call this film a ""good"" one, even though the cast has improved immensely.",0
125,"Thank you, Michael Bay, for killing Transformers for future generations. This movie is similar to the previous Transformers like a formula. Pointless characters, no plot, plenty of explosions, its all there. The movie is extremely long at 2.5 hours and it dragged halfway through.

Like why is Optimus Prime being injured a big deal when all he needs to do is scan a passing truck and become shiny and new again? UGH.  It pains me that this movie made money.  LOTS of money.

133,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is Michael Bay's 4th movie in the series, and at first glance it seems like this sequel is a departure from the previous 3 movies in the franchise. Brand new actors, Transformers, stories, and so on are all packed in here. Does it sound like this movie will be a change to the series, and maybe even for the better? The true answer is this: TF4 is the same movie as the previous ones, and that's not good. Michael Bay tried to make us care about the characters in this movie, especially the main family that includes Mark Wahlberg as the one and only father, Nicola Peltz as his daughter, and Jack Reynor as the daughter's boyfriend. At first, I started giving a slight amount of care towards them. However, as the movie progressed, the dialogue with them just became completely stupid, and I didn't care about them in the end. Speaking of dialogue, it is awful. Michael Bay still puts his terrible humor and one-liners in there. In terms of story, it becomes so similar to the past films, which also means it becomes jumbled and clunky. In my eyes, most people come to see the Transformers movies to see non-stop action and explosions and amazing visual effects. I will admit that the visual effects set a new bar for the franchise. The action at its core, though? It's exactly what you would expect out of a Michael Bay film. The first few scenes of the action entertained me. Then, it just went on and on and on, and it got so tiring. As a very young child, I loved dinosaurs. TF4 has something awesome: DINOBOTS. Yeah, no. They are only in there for a few action scenes, and they brought nothing new to the table. Great. The only thing good in this movie, as I said before, were the special and visual effects. However, even that should be expected out of this franchise and this day and age. Everything else wasn't good at all, and I walked out knowing that every other movie that would come out of this franchise here on out would be the same.",0

142,"The director, screenplay writers and producers took everything that was tedious, incoherent and ineffective from every previous installment of this franchise and turned the dial to 11. Long ago I thought that Shia LeBouf was annoying naturally, by the high order of his genes, now I stand forcefully corrected when an actor that I actually like, Mark Whalberg, was transformed into the only main character model that Michael Bay obviously understands or knows: Shia LeBouf. The same can be said of any female protagonist. Now instead of Megan Fox, there is a blond actress that has been turned into Megan Fox by a similar conjuration of template swapping, with the added annoyance that she is not even capable of the already meager autosufficiency her previous incarnation showed in her turn as ""the film's girl"". This time, she is twice-damsel-in-distress by having to be rescued out of her screenplay stupor by TWO main male protagonists: father and boyfriend (both miraculosly looking the same age).Disjointed and incongruent even for a movie based on toys and boring and long beyond any wet dreams Michael Bay has ever had about pushing his style to the limits and making the ultimate boring and long film.Do not reward these people with your money, and what is more important, do not ENCOURAGE them with your presence at some theatre, to keep on making these abominations they call cinema.",0
143,"This was pretty bad. It's been a while since I really felt like walking out on a movie and this one's 2.75 hour run time didn't help at all. The acting was atrocious.

Even the action scenes were boring and rehashes of what we've seen before. To top it all off, for the first 3/4 of the movie Optimus acts like a jackass and the autobots he ends up with are a ragtag band of misfits that you want to see die just as badly as the bad guys.

151,"Sifting through the different reviews though the weekend I have noticed one primary criticism of TAOE – The movie’s length.  Personally, I felt (somewhat stubbornly) that as long as Michael Bay just keeps me entertained I can look past the length and enjoy the movie.  The problem – The first half of the movie was a drag, with little entertainment, little humor, little action and terrible (nonexistent) character development. Michael Bay could have easily trimmed the first hour and a half into a half hour. (Thus you have a 2 hour movie instead of a 3 hour movie – those movie theater seats are tough to sit through for 3 hours) Halfway through this movie was well on its way to being the worst Transformers movie to date – and then something rare happened – Bay finally found his niche – and when he did – it was something special. The human story and the Transformers story found cohesiveness, the action picked up, the musical score made you care and a terrible film turned into a really solid entry.  As usual the plot serves as an excuse for Michael Bay to blow things up, but it wasn’t as atrocious as the last two entries, it just needed to blow things up faster! (Pros – Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammar, Lockdown, Dinobots and the final battle – Cons – The entire first half of the movie and the lack of humor) – Side Note: Mark Wahlberg’s character is an upgrade over the previous protagonist but you don’t realize it until the second half of the movie. To conclude - it was all about the length - had Michael Bay trimmed (and he could have easily done so) an hour off of this film - it might have turned out to be the best Transformers yet - but one cannot look past, nor forgive the first hour and a half bore that this movie was.  First Half gets a 5/10 and the Second Half gets a 10/10.  Final Rating 7.5 out of 10 (Rounded to 8)",1
152,It's unfair that this movie is a box office success. Question: anyone else noticed that the characters keep changing their clothes throughout the movie? Or did I miss something when I was asleep.,0
153,"Going in with proper expectations, I quite enjoyed this movie.  It didn't feel extra long unlike other movies.  The story was actually interesting and helped connect the action scenes, the part I care for more than the dialog.  Mark Whalberg as a nerd was funny, but his lines could have been shorter and wittier.  Stanley Tucci was a delight.",1
154,"It's a Michael Bay Movie,do you need more than that name to immediately turn you off from watching this movie,if not then you are clearly into watching yet another poorly thought-out,poorly scripted,horribly shot movies.On the other hand,people are saying its better because Shia Labouf is no longer in it,but don't be fooled its just as awful as the previous movies,except Mark Walhberg is in it,not that I think they are bad actors, they just needed to reconsider working with Bay.",0
156,"Words cannot describe how dreadful this movie is. If you watch this, at least a year will be taken off your life. It's so bad, that I've heard someone DIED after the 5th or 6th climax. With out a doubt, the WORST movie I've ever seen. At least Troll 2 is laughably bad, this movie just leaves you with all the negative emotions a person could possibly have.",0
157,"I went to see this movie with low expectations as i was not a huge fan of the first three movies. I feel this film broke free from the common ground of the last two (World ending, 2 hours of fighting, not much plot or anything else). Don't get me wrong this film is very much in line with those movies but instead of the constant war we get some nice plot and much needed breaks in the action, this helped pace the movie better and also let the viewers get to know the Autobots more where as the other movies just threw in new ones with no personality or care whatsoever. This film is far from perfect, it's 2hr 45min run time is very long but i feel the pacing was sufficient and the time did not drag except for a few places here and there, the dinobots were also underutilized a lot which was to be expected really as it would have been a short film with such powerful bots with them at all times. Overall i would say this was a fun action movie for the summer, plenty of fun car chases that hark back to old 70's chase films, plenty of robot action and some enjoyable story aspects make this, in my opinion, the best transformers yet, not perfect, but definitely an improvement and definitely worth a watch.",1
158,"The film was made good, a lot of amazing special effects. But the storyline is lost in the middle of the film.Very ill-conceived storyline, sometimes it is very boring. But all in all film is good",1
159,"Hey what do you except from a transformers movie? When you wanna watch it : it's in order to see enjoyable action sequences, non stop action scenes and spectacular CGI effects!! The story might have been written by a 6 years old child but .. WE DONT CARE. AND WE SHOULD NOT CARE!! If you liked the previous transformers movies, watch it! To my mind, it's the best transformers movie! :D",1
160,"This movie for me wasnt as bad as some people put it. Its got some bad things, yes, but can you really expect a movie to be 100%? I did have to admit that the film was decades long but sometimes its long for a reason; to build up the characters. I liked the special effects and it had some gripping moments. The plot was ok, but if you never watched transformers, then you will have no idea who is who. I really liked the dinosaurs as well but I can see where people are coming from. Not the best film but fight scenes, emotional scenes, funny scenes, they all seemed legit. There were times where they included humor in places not need. Example, the Soya Milk scene... That wasnt really needed because that wasnt what you would do, but it was nice to have some humor. For me 8/10 would be appropriate.",1
161,"I loved this movie. Sure, there were a few corny lines here and there, and some obvious toy marketing, but this was just a really fun movie. I haven't really enjoyed much about the other Transformers movies, but with Age of Extinction it feels like Michael Bay has finally learned how to make an actual good movie. I would gladly see this one again. Also, Frank Welker voicing the same character he did in the animated series and video games. That blew my socks off. I really want a few good monologues out of him in the next movie! To sum it up: This movie FINALLY seems to get the Transformers right on the big screen. This is really a must-see.",1
162,"If you are a fan of the transformers, you will love this movie. michael bay's directing is diffrent from other directors and not one of the best, but he makes movies with action in his own way and i like that :) so well done ;)",1
163,I really enjoyed this movie. Although I slightly missed the feeling I got from the first three. That doesn't mean it's still action packed. The villain Lockdown looks very sinister and overall really cool. Peter Cullen returning as the voice of Optimus Prime was again very good. There was a lot transformers in this movie and was overall very fun to watch.,1
164,the film was awesome. i loved it and the cool transformers they had. the movie was well thought out and properly put together and made well. lots of action through it as well. better than all the other transformers.,1
169,While this film is not perfect it is an improvement among the previous instalments mark walberg is brilliant the plot makes enough scenes to carry you thought the long length and the action is very on point in addition to this this film just about fingered out what elements to leave behind leaving us with a average robot flick,1
177,"Just the sheer number of hot sexy vehicles in this film made up for Bays' weak one liners in this film. This film had all I expected from Bay-formers. I could careless over the human characters really. They always had the weakest one liners & character development anyways, but I don't go to TF movies for the humans of course. Mmm. Lots of metal clashing metal... if that's what you are into this the movie for you. Plus how many movies do you know that includes a blue and black Bugatti Veyron, Stingray, Camero, Earnhardt racing car, Pangani & a Lamborghini oh my... all in one film within 10mins from one another or all together at once. *drools* The one liner jokes (there were a few funny ones here and there; others were just pathetic) don't bother me as much as the one dimensional dull vague characters, one of which I felt like punching her face, the teen **** Tessa. She was most annoying of all. Wanting to be a real normal teen? Really? Going out bagging some 20 yr old guy, end up pregnant and then he leaves you for another. oh yes very risky and fun Yea that's being a real teen alright. Her orange skin and cheap light pink lipstick didn't help the matter. I was so glad the alien being within Lockdowns' ship wanted to tentacle rape her and was hoping for it too. Hey, she wanted to be a ""normal"" teen right? Getting into trouble and screwing around right? Well in Hentai such gals get tentacled. Back to the reason why I went to watch this film in the first place... the hot sexy mechanical sentient beings. Meow... I was stuck admiring either Lockdown or Drift... whose alt modes were making me drool so much I came out of the movie with cotton mouth, especially Drifts' blue Bugatti *fan girl moment*. :) I also definitely wouldn't mind having abomination of babies with Lockdown. Tall, dark, handsome, intelligent, and very resourceful (the guys' face turns to a huge cannon what's not to like). I agree with so many comments/reviews here, Lockdown is one extraordinary character. and I would have liked to see more of him in the future but he was killed off, too easily. Then Optimus Prime converts his physical plates into a knights' armor... sexy deliciousness! Then there is Drift who everyone seems to complain about him looking like a samurai. I didn't notice anyone, including TF fans, whining when Prowl in TF Animated reformatted his physical form into a samurai. If anyone who read the old Marvel US TF comics or Marvel UK comics in Cybertron there were a class of martial arts subcultures, one of which I could easily name on top of my head Metallikato (yes the one Bludgeon is most famous/infamous practitioner of this form). If you never read the comic books (Marvel US, Marvel UK, DW, and IDW to name a few), pay attention to the original G1 cartoons particularly season 3-4 (they mention the Quintessons being the creators of Cybertronians, originally as slaves for the Quintessons), & never read Convenient of prime (mentions a few primes as creators of all cyber-forms, one prime created Decepticons, another prime created Autobots & so forth), so of course many would be lost at some of the things mentioned & brought upon in this film. One thing that baffled me were Galvatron & Stringer, upon first seeing them I actually was going ""Stunticons?"" Galvatrons' alt mode would have been an awesome form for either Motormaster (another I thought of was Nemesis Prime because the humans wanted him to look more like Optimus Prime), while Stringer made me think of Deadend. When Lockdown mentioned about something greater, I was thinking of either the Quintessons or Unicron, in either case gave way to a sense there will be a part 5 in the future. That & Optimus Prime flying into space at the end taking with him the Seed (a thing that turns Earth into another Cybertron) gives a hint there may be a part 5. For those wondering why OP was strong headed & aggressive with Grimlock, Understand that the Dinobots had always had a mind of their own, & usually allowed their primitive prehistoric alt modes (dinosaur minds and souls) to relish themselves and run wild. You basically have to smack a Dinobot to get his attention like a disobedient child or overtly aggressive dog. If OP didn't smack Grimlock around, he & the other Dinobots would've easily cause destruction wherever they would go. Which was why I was upset and confused when OP let loose the Dinobots, that's putting a lot of faith into beings who have still very primitive animal intentions and behavior. More clues for a potential part 5. Besides the review posted here that complain over Cybertronians having creators, which dates back since season 3&4 of G1, was the one over humans creating TFs. I highly suggest watching TF Prime or read the original Marvel comics. Overall, I enjoyed this film. For a Bay-formers I wasn't disappointed. Micheal Bay is Michael Bay. He is no Ridley Scott, Tim Burton or David Fincher, so I knew to expect very little plot, story & lots of explosions",1
180,"I still contend that everyone is entitled to their own opinion because opinions have nothing to do with truth, therefore my review will follow this philosophy. I am a fan of the movies as I am a fan of the cartoon series growing up, I did not embrace Shia LaBeouf's character for obvious reasons that limited space will not allow me to express. I however embraced Mark Wahlberg's character even though the unnecessary banter between he and his daughter somewhat took away from the very basic action plot. Most reviews I have read seem to take extreme offense with the plot as if they wrote the story and director Michael Bay had no regard and completely butchered their work. With that said the plot in an action movie needs to have basic pieces: heroes, villains and the proverbial evil tries to triumph over good, with the unlikely hero emerging, Transformers: Age of Extinction has these pieces and then some. In an action movie you want good action, good fighting, good acting if possible and a climax that will make you say that was cool. The showing I went to see drew applause at the end as the credits began to roll, which was not a total surprise but caused me to rethink my overall review. I always say even though we have the right to offer our opinion does not excuse us from being responsible with our right (refer to Transformers: Dark of the Moon, which was reviewed in a very critical way but grossed 1.2 billion dollars). Transformers is an age old program as along as you have Optimums Prime coming out on top in the end, I will see the movie every single time. In my opinion go see it you will enjoy, but only if you wish to be entertained.",1
181,This movie is a big budget movie about alien robots fighting. Plain and simple. What more do you want? What did you really expect to see when you went to it? It delivers on what it promises. I went to see it for that reason and wasn't disappointed. :),1
184,"Not nearly as bad as the professional critics would have you believe but not the glorified film making the diehard fans describe either. Overall, the movie takes the franchise in a new plot direction but the film making formula is the same. The action is enjoyable and the special effects are some of the best I have ever seen. Overly long but worth it if you have 3 hours to kill. I hope the sequel is tighter and more coherent because this movie is a great spectacle at least.",1
185,"I liked this movie more than others. A plot a bit more polished, and a little' less trivial. Obviously with the usual nonsense from the blockbuster movie, but all in all with some nice ideas.",1
188,this movie was just wow amazing explosions badass transformers and one of my favorite actors the plot was like call of duty were people try to save  the world from a bomb but everything else was amazing,1
193,"Good film, but i felt that it needed more autobots and decepticons, metaphorically. action and violence sometimes are so short: i wanted more scenes with the dinobots. I'm agree with Wahlberg being the father who protects his family: his daughter. Tucci and his obsession, sometimes insane and maddening, makes laugh. for the next time i think that mr. kruger and mr. bay must add more development on the characters. finally: it's a good film but it need more elements.",1
194,"I enjoyed Transformers Age of Extinction to the point that I watched it twice and snuck into the showings that had started a bit after mine so that I could simply catch that last 30-45 mins. Negative reviews are partly based on the fact that we had seen this before and that it was all done before. And that’s valid. But I approach each film by seeing if the transformers film I want to watch is playing before me. And so far it wasn’t. It had dogs humping, robots peeing, masturbation jokes, very little robot action, and blurry action when you got it, and an abundance of comic relief characters. I hate them all (comic relief characters and films)!And then I got this one. It had all the robot action I could need, and clean longer shots you could follow, the robots were distinguishable, and the humans didnt piss me off to no end. You might find this a very juvenile list of needs, but we are talking about a movie based off a toy line in the 80s. For so many films I just kept thinking “how hard is it to mess this up, it’s about giant robots fighting, just show us that” and I finally got it. I finally got my big dumb robot film that doesn’t annoy me. Now, I never ever need to watch the other ones again. It might suck that this is the same film as the others for you, but I am thankful because to me it’s the better version of the film Michael Bay was always trying to make, and I am glad that I now have a transformers movie I can bear to rewatch. That’s my review!",1
197,"The Fourth Installment in the Transformers Movie Franchise in which all directed by the well-known ( in certain aspects ) Michael  Bay! I was able to purchase a ticket and see this movie in the cinema. One of the best place's mankind has ever invented. Anyway, I liked it, because I gave it a 7/10 and my own Metascore to this movie? A 69/100.  Of course, I gave those ratings the day after I saw the movie and I never finished my review, so I plan to buy it on blu-ray and see it there ( maybe 3D If I'm lucky ), and then lets see if I will still give it a 7/10 and a 69/100. If not, then I will change my score and I will mention it in the re-posting the comment here. Lets see what happens!",1
198,"I understand why most people don't like this movie because it is directed by Michael Bay, and all the previous movies that suck, but I feel like the story this time isn't that formulaic like the previous one. Therefore, not matter how bad or terrible the story is, it give me some surprise. Like the previous movies, it has a lot of action, if you are looking for stunning CGI effect or realistic destruction,it is a must watch, but I think that some action scene is very fake because human enemy can't even shoot, they are literally blind. There is some problems in this movie. The movie features 3-4 villains but I feel like that the movie only focuses in one only while neglected other major ones especially at the end of the movie. The movie also makes me hate some human character. I don't really care about the human character story because they are poorly-written. Also, what I don't like is they killed Ratchet and Optimus Prime suddenly know how to fly.",1
199,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is a movie that recycles almost everything you have seen in all the three previous movies, but this time with a fresh cast that is surprisingly redeeming to the one blockbuster franchise that knows it is so pathetic, but I was enjoying it. At the end of the day, I found myself the only one applauding at the end of the movie; yes it is a guilty pleasure of mine.",1
200,"The best transformers movie ever..................Dont listen to others who say its a bad film.They dont know anything about how to review a movie.Awesome story,awesome action,and awesome humours.A must watch in the theatres.",1
201,"My god! Michael Bay is so awsome at directing films. The film was funny, action packed and heart pounding. The Protaganist kade (Mark Whalberg) Produced an amazing performance and I cannot understand why people hate Michael Bay. I would'nt take your 4 year old child for bad language and adult humor but an all around great film!",1
202,"I'd love to jump on the sweaty heated boat that every other reviewer has embarked on, I'd leave my fancy new shoes if I had every faith I was being led in the right direction but I won't. In fact, I was extremely surprised that the storyline pulled together quite brilliantly. It may not match the stature, the huge epic force that is the Transformers, an empire of fans, a legion, a behemothic clan of die-hard fans and reluctant editorial reviewers and heads of literature departments. I actually enjoyed Age of Extinction. They synchronized with the previous blockbuster, seamlessly, without putting up my spoiler alert sign and warding off all fans that haven't seen the film. Go and see it yourself! I completely understand with Michael Bay here that it clearly gets difficult when you've thrown in every ounce of effort and pulled together all the loose ends, driven the film to huge successes. When is it right to take a new direction? Yes, it's almost completely different to the last films, yes, there are new characters, yes the whole sequencing of events from the get go is different. There seems to be more of a protagonistic outlook, characters are clearly thrown into their cliche stereotypes and remain there throughout but I still watched and was amazed by the depth of detail that has gone into this film. Maybe it was nice to add new characters, new robots, new areas of interests in the script, maybe it was time to add what was not added before. It had to be different, if it was Shea LeBouf saving the day again, and Megan Fox strutting across the screen, wouldn't you all of just said.. ""We have seen this before"". It's only a sellout when there is no reason for the release, and Age of Extinction has buckets full of content, cut scenes, CGI, emotion, raw passion and effort that you can see just like all the other films. It's Transformers, but with a twist. It's like fashion, you follow it for a certain amount of time and eventually it changes. Albeit with fashion, you can still wear your old clothes if you want. You can't go through what you've already thrown out to people in their millions on the silver screen, and show them what they've already seen. No-one saw this coming. No-one saw the difference. And that's why everyone is complaining because it's different, it's new ground, it's new territory and all these die-hard fans are now lost in an abyss, a new setting, a new backdrop for which Age of Extinction was brought towards. I enjoyed Age of Extinction, just like I enjoyed the first, second and third. Someday, the plot has to change. Not all the characters can live on, it simply cannot be the same film you gotta watch every other year. My final thoughts:Different, wild, surprising, breath taking CGI as always, good referencing to the previous additions, new content, new territory...",1
203,"They took the biggest flaws of the original 3, and shaved them down.  Less ""comic"" relief, less black-ops-ey crap, no Shia Lebouf, and less Jar-Jar robots.  One of the badguys didn't have a big role, but when he/she survived, it made it rewarding.  Secondary villains is only a bad thing if their role doesn't live up, and with the assurance of more movies, no complaints here.  The target audience is still teenagers, but it swears as much as it can to lighten that feel. Plus, its based on a cartoon so..  cmon.  Everything else is great. I'd like to hear better scripting.  Make the characters sound smart.  Even if intelligent script flies over some people's heads, well.. Star Wars: A New Hope confused me as a child but I still watched it daily.  Eh, and the liquid-metal transforming thing is just so un-mechanical that it kinda kills the techy setting. I know its probably too late, don't watch the trailer.  It spoils a highlight of the last act.",1
204,"Before I even get started with this review, it'd be worth noting that I consider myself a fan of Transformers. Not just the originals, the Cybertron games, or the new animated renditions, but Transformers as a whole. Heck, I even like Bayformers, as these movies are a blast to watch despite betraying the core group of any franchises fandom: original fans. This betrayal is so bad that I can't go to a single place on the internet without seeing these fans complaining about how 'bad' the Bay films are, and in a sense, I agree with most of their complaints. There's far too much focus on humans, there's an incredibly goofy tone with unnecessary, raunchy jokes everywhere, Bumblebee is a freakin' mute that can't be fixed somehow, telling the difference between Autobot and Decepitcon is kinda tricky, history is re-written, and much much more. Fortunately, Transformers: Age of Extinction fixes some the things people hated, but was it enough? Yes. Yes it was. Here's why in an attempt not to spoil anything. First of all, Age of Extinction is a lot more serious this time around. Taking place an entire 4 years after Dark of the Moon, we lose Sam Whitwicky/Shia Labeouf and get Cade Yaeger/Mark Whalberg as our human protagonist. Fortunately, this change of leads also changes the entire film's pace. No longer are we forced to endure the antics of a young adult who is heavily involved with his goof-ball parents, dumb friends, and requirement for a love-life, which I can't be any more thankful for. Instead, we're forced to endure the struggle a single dad who just wants his daughter to do well in life despite lacking requirements to do so. Much better already right? Well, it gets slightly better. Unlike the previous trilogy, this film doesn't rely too much on making the audience laugh as it does making the audience wonder what this film is actually rated due to how dark it's tone is. For a PG-13 film, some of the death's are pretty graphic, there are quite a few colorful words [we're talking multiple F-Bombs and overuse of the ""Sh-"" equivalent of ""crap"" here], and even the clean dialog was riddled with disturbing lines. Even Optimus Prime was a bit too dark for me to handle at times with his talk of actually killing humans and his plots of revenge, which I did not see coming. It's almost as if Ehren Kruger wrote this film after having a bad day or coming home from the funeral of a loved one. Graphically, Age of Extinction does a pretty good job but occasionally kills the mood with a few hiccups. On the plus side, Transformers are much easier to tell apart thanks to the noticeably brighter color palette used to represent the Autobots, and the lack of color for everyone else. As much as I'd like to say that ""everyone else"" is a Decepticon, it's impossible to as the majority of antagonists and the Dinobots didn't have a faction. On the down side, there are more than a couple scenes in this movie that were poorly animated. This never applied for the Transformers of course, but some green screen's were obvious to detect thanks to terrible lighting, and a lot of other three dimensional objects just didn't sit right with the surrounding environments. It's kind of upsetting really. Personally, I think the worst part about this entire movie is what we all thought served as the film's main focus: Dinobots. Every advertisement for this movie from video to image form highlighted their existence and made it out to be a pretty big deal, especially the T-Rex Transformer who fans of the franchise could only assume is Grimlock, and Swoop as the pterodactyl. Unfortunately, every scene involving the Dinobots is a pretty hard smack to the face for anyone who knows Transformers lore, and an even bigger smack to the face for everyone else who was simply anticipating something new, as they didn't even appear until the film's final moments. I'm not going to get into what the Dinobots are in this movie, but I will say this: it has been about 12 hours since I walked out of that theater, and after explaining what the dinobots 'were' to a few friends that didn't know, I can't help but facepalm in disappointment. Their history wasn't only completely changed, but they weren't given names and had no way to communicate aside from brute force. Look guys, Grimlock may have been slow, but he could at least speak, dang it! Overall I enjoyed this movie. Actually, I think Age of Extinction is the best of the Bayformer's movies and I'll more than likely see it again in IMAX. I would have done so originally, but I feared that this movie would be bad and saw the normal version first. This movie definitely could have been a bit shorter though, despite it not feeling as long thanks to how entertained I was from start to finish. Also, I'm beyond excited to see where the next film goes. Without spoiling too much, let's just just say that we may finally be getting a Transformer's movie that focuses on the Transformer's.",1
205,"It's what you would expect from a Transformers movie. **** story, useless characters, awesome battle scenes. But, you only come to Transformers for the battles, don't you?The fighting is the only part I really cared for. 8/10, because it could get boring.",1
206,It's a great film with some holes with a massive problem. The writer ehren Kruger the writer. It's his writing style which has caused everyone to hate transformers. There's only one way to make transformers better and that to get rid of him and get the original writers back from transformers 1,1
207,"So I decided to skip Dark of the Moon and just go straight to Age of Extinction since that's the only one that people care about right now. This movie is just a really fun and enjoyable experience and their really isn't too much to say other than that. Sure the plot doesn't really make any sense and it wont be winning any Oscars but who really cares about that in a movie where Optimus Prime rides a giant, robotic, fire-breathing dinosaur (Grimlock but he is not actually given a name) into battle. The only reason I didn't rate this movie higher is because its WAY TOO LONG. Seriously I know all of Michael Bays movies are about 2 and a half hours but 45 minutes could've easily been cut from this movie. (P.S Lockdown is AWESOME)",1
208,This movie is better than any other transformers movie directed by Michael Bay with the number 4 in the title. Its also better than getting Aids.  *Explodes violently.,1
209,"This is a movie that you should know what you are in for before entering the theatre.  I asked my wife if she wanted to go and received the expected ""are you kidding?""  Giant robots ripping things apart, action scenes, destruction, lame dialogue . . . it met all expectations.  I would not rate this as high as Pacific Rim or Godzilla but worth the price of admission just to see it on the big screen.  People who are looking for an ""experience"" or tear jerker; wait in line for Notebook 2 or 3; I liked it!!",1
210,Great movie! Sad alot of people hated it though... I really loved this movie the action and character development were really cool. The only thing i noticed was it was kind of long i was getting tired in the last few minute's. Great movie deserves more credit.,1
211,"Both scores, professional and public, ring false. Feels like a few lonely voices nattering as Transformers makes its way to another billion dollars or more. Somebody is flocking to the theaters to see this movie in defiance of those who see it as some sort of  IQ dissolver. Well, the movie was entertaining. Mark Wahlberg brought some welcome energy to the movie. And Michael ""laughing al the way to the bank"" Bay did his job, as expected. Lengthwise one certainly got their money's worth. There was a tonne of new stuff. So, who are these whingers? Some class of movie intelligentsia dedicated to stamping out mindless big summer billion dollar movies? The movie is for children and anyone who doesn't have a bit of child left in them is in a sorry state indeed. My kid loved it; and he has an IQ well above average.",1
212,"this movie is really awesome if you want to see action and action and action, just turn off your brain and enjoy those special effects, and if you don't like that don't go and watch this movie",1
214,"Transformers: Age of extinction, con sus avances en los trailers, podemos ver bastante acción y explosiones, por tanto es lo que probablemente varios espectadores esperaron, y es lo que en gran parte se vio en este film. Esta película se podría decir que era una de las más esperadas en su año y que al final en donde se esperaban varios explosiones, acción, peleas, y grandes transformers (como fué en las anteriores entregas), y, al fin al cabo, no los entregó de una manera potente. Sí, es cierto de que tiene un guión un poco flojo y que resulta bastante larga (más de 160 minutos) por tanto se podría decir que la primera hora llega a ser un tanto pesada., pero al final toda la acción que nos ofrece y la potente carga de efectos visuales (merecedores de al menos una Nominación al Oscar) logran darle mucha más vida a este largometraje bastante explosivo, por así decirlo.",1
216,"I can't make a movie, so my score originally as me as the audience. The CGI was really awesome.  It's better than Superman last movie or Pacific Rim. It's also a smart twist protagonist characters issue, better than Robocop remake #LOL. I did hate Optimus Prime since the third movie. I mean he's really not a good leader. So, the problem was the character of the robots. They're being boring. So, if it's the last Transformers from Michael Bay, I think he did the best. And we know, now, Michael Bay is Jurassic Park fans. Well, one lack thing about the movie was how lucky all the human main characters survived. There's the moment when one of them fell and rolled to the street, but not get hurt at all. #awkward",1
217,"This site just proves that most of these are opinion based.  Everyone has their opinions and looking at some of the movies that got great reviews compared to some of the ones with bad reviews proved that.  Some of the high rating movies were horrible, while some of these with lower scores should have been higher, but that's only my opinion. This is a pretty good movie, much better than the last one. Plenty of action, decent actors and as many have said, no Sam.",1
218,"The original, Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon were all fairly adequate Transformers films, but suffered due to the direction it took, Michael Bay is by no means a bad director, and with the arrival of the fourth film, Transformers: Age of Extinction is a step in the right direction, it steered clear of some of what made the previous films less enjoyable, while it may not have been enough to compensate for the previous films, they successfully make up for it by including new and refreshing elements such as Dinobots and Transformers & Humans that have actual personalities, in addition, there are little winks and nods hidden within the film, Mark Wahlberg is a very welcome protagonist to the film and Peter Cullen completely embodies the role of Optimus Prime, additionally, the visuals and special effects were outstanding, especially the details Watching this film in IMAX is a unique experience, and I recommend watching it in IMAX if you can, it's worth it",1
219,"This movie is very good and revives the Transformer franchise. The first transformers was amazing and it lived off the fact that we have never seen anyone bring the transformers to life the way that Bay did. The next two transformers movies tried to live off of that success which did not work. technology evolves so fast these days that you may get by on a great concept and cool special effects on the first film but the next time out you better have a great story line behind it because the new technology is no longer impressive on its own. Well after a steady decline from the first transformers to the 3rd it seems like Bay and his writers finally got it together. The introduced a new villain who is strong and makes the audience fell the actual danger he presents to optimus and the rest of the autobots. Also I liked the change in characters as the old characters were becoming to boring and predictable. Walhberg in Age of Extinction helps ""transform"" the Transformer franchise from a action franchise trying to be a comedy back into an actual action franchise that has some comedy within it. Also the addition of some new concepts and (CGI) characters also make the plot and storyline, as well as action that much more interesting. Transformers is back with this installment.",1
220,"Best movie ever. Love the line ""There a missile in the living room!"" The plot, lines, sound quality, and actions are out of this world outstanding. The is movie may be long, but it keeps you on the edge of your seats. This movie is really good even though I'm not a fan of Transformers. People who said this movie is horrible, like IMDb, Rotten Tomato, and others should fire and hang themselves. Could be the movie of the decades, if it wasn't for those bastards who rate below 4.5 stars! I never went to the restroom even though I really need to. If I'm the theater managers, I would sells the tickets for this movie about $124.99 dollars. This movie is not for the low-intelligence who can't even rate a movie correctly. Better than Mr. Turner and Life Itself! If I can change this movie, I would add two autobots who is a Lexus LFA and a Subaru BRZ STi!",1
222,"I no not why some people are hating on this film as much as they are, in comparison to the other three transformer films this is by far the best and most entertaining. Far from perfect, but I would easily watch again. If one can overlook its forced humour and scripted pieces, then you should enjoy it. If you don't, in my opinion, you just went to the wrong cinema screen and now your **** about it. Don't expect 12 years a slave from Transformers guys, its supposed to be this way.",1
224,"This movie is too long, but it's badass fun. Sound Mixing was Really Loud and I liked it. Actors were OK. Storyline Fact: No Storyline. It Will get you confused. So Much Action! This movie is kind of Recommended.",1
225,"I definitely enjoyed this movie. It was definitely better than the 2nd or 3rd and almost better than the first. Marky Mark was definitely better the Shia in all aspects. The only MAJOR issue was the ""Irish Boyfriend."" Mark calls him ""lucky charms"" but I only remember an accent in one or two scenes. Terrible commitment to an accent. Other than that, I liked the story and the dialogue. Stanley Tucci was great is usual...",1
226,"So it's time for another Micheal Bay explosion filled Transformers movie, and that's exactly what you get. Just like past Transformers and the new TMNT movie this one is filled full of amazing eye watering CGI action. Because that's all you really need for a movie like this, The story is...well it's there but not much past the whole ""Oh no someone must save the planet from this super strong robot"". If you are looking for a great weekend action movie Transformers will do you good, It does run a little long but you wont even notice because your focused on everything exploding.oh and did I mention, Dino-Bots(Robotic Dinosaurs)?",1
228,"Really good movie, id like to see Transformers continue like this in the future. Truly outstanding, good job Micheal Bay! I really hope that the rating for this movie increases. It does at least deserve a 7.5 score.",1
230,"Dear director of Transformers, I upload this here because I couldn't find the right way to send my Ideas to director of Transformers. Please read it and share good feedback. ^^ I am Yoo young jin, Grade 2 student.I love Transformers soooo much. I 'd like to share Ideas about the next Transformers 5.I've listed some of my ideas here.: 1. I'd like the Characters to be the same as Transformers 4.2. I also want the antagonist to be Trucks.3. Can you also make a new Antagonist and a new good team? I mean additionally,I want a new antagonist (named Stuckers) is made of special liquid.When the car goes, suddenly it will turn into liquid and transform to a robot,When someone shoot the gun to him he will not die. Because it is liquid.And his Armys will be a sports car, very very nice sport car. I can send you a picture of my ideal car.4. When Optimus fight with Galvatron there minds will be changed and Optimus will be a bad, Galvatron will be a good side.Real good team will not know their minds are changed, so they will kill Galvetron but when they fight Glavatron will kill Drift. 5. Optimus will find a girl friend and they will kill Stuckers.6. But some Army will have an electric transforms,7. If can I wanna to see the place when you make new film.That's all. ^^",1
231,"This movie is pretty fun. I saw this with my dad and we both liked it. I think it is the second best of the series, the best, of course, being the first one. This movie is still way too long, and the dinobots weren't in the movie enough to warrant them being on every single poster promoting the film. But Bay seemed to actually make this movie with a thought in his mind about having a plot. The animation is great in this film and the plot is actually pretty cool. It's nonsensical, sure, but it's easy to follow. This is a legitimately good picture, and does provide a refreshing new cast and tone to the series.",1
232,"This new sequel to Bay's Transformers' saga offers another impressive show visual effects, but they're not enough to save this picture from a fatally cliched storytelling, characters, and a somehow disappointing result.",0
233,transformers is amazing! i now realize that everybody hates this series because everybody hates Michael bay! this movie was funny it was very thrilling and it had a lot different storyline. this movie changed the face of Transformers. i love the part when the Dinobots come!,1
234,"lots of giant robots and action. That's what I like, that's why I watch films like this, that's what I expected this film to do, and it did it very well. If you were expecting something with a good story, good script, good acting, then you, im afraid to say, are an idiot.",1
235,"This is great !! Start and middle were amazing, good plot and it went something, only negative was the last 15 minutes were Michael bay decided to blow up everything. Apart from that this was much better then the others!",1
237,"This is a very good movie. Forget the critics reviews. This movie's 3D effects are great, and so is the animation. The only cons are a few unlikeable characters, and an average story.",1
238,One of the best movies i have ever saw! The dinobots are sexy and the action is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! it is one of the rare movies that can make you get adrenaline,1
239,"In my humble opinion, everyone should read this review. I am a regular guy who is married with kids, educated and normal.  I grew up with Transformers and have seen all the movies.  I went in a bit  negative thinking this was just going to be eye candy and thinking 2 hrs and 45 mins!  Good God that is too long.  I saw a couple trailers, but not much media on it. I really liked the first one and I did enjoy the second one.  The third one was very bland for me.  I am not one of those stupid reviewers who think they need to compare this kind of a movie to say The Godfather.  The Transformer movies are action, cgi, eye candy movies and we only hope the story is decent.  SO the bar is set lower as it should. I highly doubt most professional reviewers even watched more than 10 mins of the film.  Rather than go to enjoy a movie, they are looking to stupid reasons why they can rip into this movie.  Reviewers hate Michael Bay.  We all know this. ""Age of Extinction is just another warmed-over, cynical, ATM machine of a movie. It’s soulless eye candy."" Richard ""useless"" Roeper.  Thanks, Dichard.  Why even to bother to write that.  Just skip it next time. ""Everything about Michael Bay’s fourth Transformers movie is too much. Its 165 minute running time. Its convoluted plot. Its deafening score. Its product placement. Its never-ending action scenes. Its swooping camera work. Its overwhelming stupidity. Well before it finished I was numb from its bludgeoning excess."" David McGinn  Sounds like a jealous, bitter man to me. ""The Bay-man has made the worst and most worthless Transformers movie yet. I know, hard to believe, right? How could any summer blockbuster be as dull, dumb and soul-sucking as the first three Transformers movies? Step right up. "" Peter Travelers  He gave it a zero.  So he just hates Bay and I don't even know why he bothered to write anything as the reader has learned nothing. I doubt he watched the movie at all. Let's ask some important questions.Is this movie way to long?  Yes.  Bay could have cut 30 mins from the film and given us the same effect.Is this movie loud?  Yes.  Why does that matter?  Is war and crashing robots quiet?Is there a bunch of product placements? Yes, but only critics care about this.  Welcome to the world of profit ****Is this just the same old story and nonsense as the first three?  No.  A million times no. The story is a bit complicated and jumbled, but I assure you of this the movie moves along quickly and you will get the story.  You will also be happy of the new storyline if you enjoyed the first movie. From a visual aspect, I have no idea how this only cost $210 million.  There is so much going on visually, I was amazed.  I have seen many more movies that cost nearly that much and have only 1%CGI of what is in this movie.  Honestly, the people who made this movie must be insane.  How can they even think of this and then put it on screen and make it look real.  Let's get real here, the CGI is the main character and it is pure awesome. I really liked the new characters.  I like that one of them was killed off within the first 30 mins. The story has evolved and is original.  Trust me.  The Transformers themselves are not as nice as they used to be and I love that.  Marky Mark is fun and I like his character.  I do not like to give away plot points or break down a movie for you.  I like to tell you if it is worth your money and some sort of a reasonable expectation. If you liked the first Transformers movie, you will like this movie.  All the negative comments by others really don't matter.  If you like action cgi movies, this is a very good one.  I give it a 7.  8 if it would have cut 30 mins from it.  As an action movie, it main job is to excite me.  If it has a decent story it adds points.  Action is a 10.  Story for an action movie is a 7.  Overall, 7.",1
241,"Dont know why everyone criticising this movie,eventhough the story/script is not upto the mark...the action sequences are all outstanding...really i loved this movie...best movie in the series..... no boring at all.... :)",1
242,"It was very entertaining and the fight scenes this time were much better than in the first 3 movies, I also prefer Mark over Shia, I give it an 8/10, it was a very good movie.",1
243,This part is AWESOME of all because I haven't seen that much action in any movie before. Yes little drag but this movie is for REAL fans who follow transformers not for those who are looking for LOGICS :). Also I like new storyline with the role of Wahlberg and entry of all new bots. Good job Mr. Bay,1
244,Forget the critics. Buy a ticket and spend 3 hours at the edge of your seat watching a movie that's originally Michael Bay action only. You will never regret that decision ever.,1
245,what a movie saw it my first time in a imax3d theater.  this was a first movie nation release we where told by the manager that used imax full screen movie. he said the other movie usually the top and bottom are smaller. it was just amazing  me and my friend saw it at the 8am showing. we both like it cannot wait for it to  come out in blue ray. it is about 3 hours long for the movie and the coming attractions. so go easy on the soda i almost had to leave near the end i had to go badly but i made.,1
246,"Great action movie, story was a little better, ILM did an amazing job with visual effects, and no more SHIA! Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammer and the voice actors were great but the other actors and actresses just sucked.",1
247,"Transformers Age of Extinction is by far the best in the series. I'm confused why people are saying this one isn't the best in the series, when clearly it is. First off the acting is tremendously better, a way better lead role by Mark Walberg who's one of my favorite actors, Tj Miller was pretty funny until he died, Nicola Peltz was okay and her boyfriend is the only one I could say was not good. Stanley Tucci was pretty good in his role giving a lot of enthusiasm and humor. The CGI in this Transformers was just as good as in the other ones. I could say the CGI was a tad better in this one because at times I thought the transformers were real and not just CGI. The story was definitely better then the other two and just as good as the first movie. The story really rose up because of how good Mark Walberg did in his role. Honestly everything made sense in the story from the seed that turns anything into a transformers, to lockdown being the first transformers. I do wish that this one would have been the first transformers movie they came out with instead of going with Shia Lebouf for the first three, now the first movie was really good too but the second and third one were just okay. If anything they should of made this one the second in the series and completely erased the second and third one. My brother who thought both two and three were really stupid actually thought this one was really good and entertaining, lets admit these transformers movies are not like a masterpiece like Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather, but in my opinion what makes Transformers Age of Extinction just as good as them, is how much fun I had watching the movie. I had so much more fun watching this transformers movie then I did with other three combined. Overall Mark Walberg did a fantastic job and the Transformers were as Badass as ever, I give Transformers Age of Extinction a 9 out of 10.",1
248,Visuals and Audio are stunning. Dinobots and 3rd act still the show! Mark Walbergh is definitely a step up and Stanley Tucci delivers some of the best humor in the movie.,1
249,"I don't understand why this movie is receiving such negative reviews. Did people even watch the movie? It feels like a lot of these 0-3 point reviews, especially some of the ""professional"" ones that amount to little more than an artsy description of emotions, are little more than jumping on the bandwagon of how the previous Transformers movies were pretty weak. Fortunately, this movie is completely different. I just saw it like literally 30 minutes ago, and it was the best transformers movie yet, in fact, in many ways it was the Transformers movie that we all wanted instead of what we got with ""Nerd meets Fox, oh and btw there are robots 1-3"" with the previous movies. The movie was a chunky, good length, with good exposition and plot, the acting was much better than previous installments, and Whalberg was definitely a good fit to his character. Most of all, the movie focused on the robots being awesome and not some stupid comic book love story. Although there is a little bit of campiness with certain elements like how the humans are turning their backs on the Autobots ...(again) at least as a premise to the story, and some cliche stuff when they focus on the human actors, the movie was really really great. Perfect mix of balance between robots and human actors, with emphasis on robots. (Epic Optimus Prime riding a giant robot trex while flailing a sword around) Great use of special effects, with (surprisingly) appropriate amount of pew pew explosions from Michael Bay Good plot development and character relation, along with a nice long movie run time to let the story properly get fleshed out and play out nice chunky scenes giving great exposition to all the robots kicking but. The cherry on the cake is that the ""cliffhanger"" if you can call it that, or rather the open ended possibility for the next movie (that we all know is coming) was actually really interesting and appropriately engaging, instead of the standard ""see you next time"" message that is lazily given like in the first movies, because they didn't know where the story was going in the next movie. TLDR: Really great Transformers movie, lots of negative reviews are quite frankly ridiculous. Especially the ""professional"" ones. Worth the price of admission. Gave it a 10 because Metacritic is basically the war of extremes now, where people only give 0-3 points if they didn't like a movie, instead of giving it a fair score. I think this movie deserves a solid 8.5",1
250,Easily the best action and sci fi movie so far. Mark Wahlberg and Michael Bay kept the good work they done in pain and gain and delivered a movie with unlimited action and nice jokes and twist in plots.,1
251,"Yes. Perfect. This is what the other movies should have been. Great Acting, Amazing CGI. The Dinobots are amazing, just yes. For those who say this is terrible, you don't terrible. I hated when they killed off the last of the wreckers and Ratchet, But the rest is stunning, Megatron returning as Galvatron, introducing Lockdown, the showing of how the Autobots feel now that humans have turned on them and are creating new transformers using what's known as ""Transformium"", and Bumblebee, just Bumblebee. He freaking hilarious in this movie. I remember one part where they find stinger, which is a human created transformer based off him, but ""Better in every way"", He went BALLISTIC, gave a hefty ""AW HELL NO"", and almost wrecked that **** up! Great Movie. Now, there has been speculation that this will be Micheal Bay's Last TF movie. If it is, then amazing job ending your run at it, and deliver it to someone else who's good at making movies in this Genre, like J.J. Abrams. 10/10 ""I hate cheap knockoffs.""-Bumblebee",1
253,"It is what it is. You know going in what you're going to get. My 8 year old loved it, which is the way it should be since it's a movie based on toys. And it kept me entertained the whole way through...barely. Would've been a lot more enjoyable were it a half hour shorter.",1
255,"I was a little baffled by the end of this Michael Bay movie, Transformers 1-3 were filled with potty humor and glamorizing hot female bodies. Age of Extinction made 1 reference to 'hot teenager' and thats about as far as the high school mentality went in the movie.The first hour of the film dealt heavily on establishing a story that rid it of the 'eck' of Transformers 1-3. Mark Wahlberg brought a breath of new life into the franchise as a calm collected scientist versus a kid that just screamed 'NO NO NO' for 2 straight hours through 3 movies.I would consider this without a doubt the best in the series, though some people will note that it did have less considerable earth damage as compared to the Battle of Chicago in Transformers 3, which I think the battle sequences in that film are the best battle sequences in film history that were not based on real events (don't want to piss of Tora, Tora, Tora or Saving Private Ryan Fans).If you even tolerated T1-3 and thought they could be vastly improved with better acting/actors and something that resembled more of a plot. You will like this.",1
258,"Another step forward in the history of imagination as manifested in cinema. From the first Transformers movie, Spielberg and Bay communicated to me that what they were after.  More than story, more than characters, they were after an abstract ""poetry in motion,"" a kind of abstract action-painting made possible by ILM's handling of characters made of hundreds of separate, moving pieces. This goal was evidenced in the one or two dialog-less action-plus-sound-design sequences in the first film, which succeeded in my mind--and I think in theirs--as ""poetry in motion."" The latest ""Extinction"" movie succeeds as poetry in motion at least as well as earlier episodes. I suggest people stop reviewing Transformer movies as “adult” movies or movies for adults.  They are for eight year old eyes; or, maybe even four and five year old boy eyes.  When you were forming your visual and imaginative vocabulary as a child, can you imagine how this Transformers movie might impress you?  I think very powerfully in a mostly good way, as movies go. That Transformer movies are weak in character and plot does not bother me because they dare to create something much more difficult:  an authentic fairy tale.  In this ""Extinction"" is among the best one or two Transformer-movies-as-fairy-tales.",1
260,"I actually considered the film a step forward compared to installments two and three. Surely, one cannot expect much from this franchise - it is an action packed film with giant robots and giant dinosaur robots without any artistic value or depth whatsoever. Whoever expected more is quite gullible. Now, compared to the earlier installments - I actually thought this one was better than most of them, with the exception of the first one. It doesn't elevate the animation, the story is basically the same with a wonderful variety of holes and WTF moments, but all in all - it does deliver the anticipated and expected adrenaline burst you'd want to get when watching giant robot dinosaurs (finally, Michael, finally - the Dinobots!). The Mark Whalberg-plot is better than the one with Shia, Stanley Tucci is charming as always and the plot itself is pretty much digestible. As far as a major minus goes, the new Autobots are just... what? why? I mean, we've seen three movies and I'm all for bringing in new and original characters (I mean, John Goodman was brilliant!), but with an already developed franchise it looks exceptionally dumb to introduce new characters that haven't been mentioned before... ever. That was my biggest objection to the movie. To sum it up, another shallow action packed adrenaline rush delivered by Michael Bay, but certainly something better than some of the earlier installments. Unlike the others, this is watchable for both fans and those who just like to see things get smashed but with no Hulk around...",1
261,"I have no clue on what the **** the critics here are thinking! The fourth Transformers looks swell and awesome! It looks like an amazing movie to us fans. Critics, go F*** yourself!!!!!",1
262,"Transformers Age Of Extinction is by far, the best Transformers movie i have ever seen! You have to see it right now, i mean it has the Dinobots for Cybertron's sake! Grimlock looks great as well as the rest of our favorite Cybertronians like Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Lockdown. Go see it, it's great!",1
263,"I have never been so excited to see a Transformers movie since the first one. Yeah, last time I missed, but this time it was in digital 3D. I was booked for the best seat in the cinema hall. I prefer watching movie opening day itself because to avoid mix up with others opinion. I watch and I give my stance. Which makes my belief's unchangeable, if the opposite viewpoint to mine start to pour. Seen many 3D movies and this was one of the mind blowing one. I was very much satisfied with the graphics and sound mixing. I just wanted to remind you that I often play the opening 20 seconds of 'Dark of the Moon'. You know why, because I love that awesome metallic sound to hear it in surround speakers. This was the 2 hours and 45 minute long movie, the runtime was never been an issue to me. I would have loved it if another 10 minutes of the stunts were added. Lots of new Autobots were introduced like the one you saw in the trailers, the Dinobots. Even all the stunts and transformation of Autobots from automobiles were shown from far enough distance to enjoy with pleasure. The graphic movie geeks will love whole movie like it made specially for them. It is partially a reboot movie. Someone just won't disappear into the thin air. They did not bother to clarify what happened to the original actors Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox. I think we must assume that they will be back in the next and I don't think it is such a good idea. But still we need a proper explanation. Okay, this movie refreshed the franchise after lots of criticism in the last film. That's fine so the next film should take the responsibility on that matter. This is the only thing that worries the one who followed all the transformers movies. Other than that, there are minor flaws that are not big trouble maker once the entertainment began. I don't know why there was so much hate on Michael Bay. Critics thinks they are the deciders who can change the fortune of a movie throwing it up between flop and success, but they are not. I really feel sorry for the audience who fall for those cheap tricks. Remember, critics are a bunch of sheep who follow one another till everyone fall into a deep hole, they may grab you along so be careful. The critic should change their profession or retire, because in the hundren years of film history, they were the obstacle for the filmmakers. Take advice from movie geeks if you needed one or take chances by yourself. That's what I gonna say you all. Lots of refreshment in this fourth installment. The first one was the cast, I am very happy to bring all new faces here. I mean humans, not Autobots, as we know without or replace of Optimus Prime would not work. But we can see little bit upgrades in everything, including the technical side of the movie making as well as in the story. You are not only brought to the cinema hall to enjoy the giant robot like creature fight  themselves, there were plenty of human side drama, sentiments and all the above the stunts. It's really, really a grand idea to put Mark Wahlberg in the first place to this franchise. I can't praise that he saved this movie series in this part, but his presence made vast differences compared to the earlier three movies. In other side the humours were so good, it did play the part to put the movie on the right course. I still remember those funny lines from the movie and laugh. Especially, there is one I could not get rid off from my mind that follow like this: Swettie, get my alien gun. Hahaha. I know it was intense, but perfectly utilised in the perfect situation. This time the grand finale was not in the US of America or Egypt or Arctic and Antartic, but was in China. Some of stunt sequences shot with the humans were greatly done on the edges of an old apartment building. Watching those in 3D gave me a thrilling experience. I also liked the songs that came when the stunts were in progress. The track was called 'Battle Cry' by Imagine Dragons, an awesome composition. Like everyone categorize each installment with different ratings, I can't do that. I like all the before three movies equally with only the fractions of difference. The first two were so much fancied up and glamorized with the presence of Megan Fox. The third one was what tried to be more honest, but the cast does not look like blend well. That is where this the fourth movie made all the modifications and it worked. If this movie fails, then not because of the bad execution from the cast and crew, though the foul mouth critics to blame. Anyway business wise it will do well all over the globe except the rating which will sink. This story ended with a strong line said by the great leader, Optimus Prime. That created more curious about the fifth movie. Hope the pre production begins very soon. In between that if you have not seen it yet, go for it. It is not a suggestion, but making you realise it was not bad like you have heard. 8.5/10",1
264,"Awesome, must see in Imax 3D!   This is not a Meril Streep movie for critics, this is a living Transformers action movie.  There is a plot and a story, but (thankfully) nothing too deep.  The action is beautiful and fantastic.  These movies take huge liberties with mortality and the capability of the human body, but, so do other movies.  My one gripe would be usage of nearly every profane word at least once, not great for young ears.   Amazing experience, 2 hours and 45 minutes flew by.  There are 2 chatty slowdown parts for your restroom needs.",1
265,"Saw the reviews here and went to see the movie anyway just out of curiosity for why it made a 100 million so quickly at the box office. If you're looking for depth, riveting storyline, and something extraordinarily different from the earlier movies, this movie isn't for you. But if you put that aside, like to see cool CG effects, hot women, and generally have a popcorn flick where you can switch off your brain and watch the spectacle unfold, this movie isn't half bad. Its far from being a great movie, but it is even further from being a terrible or unwatchable one. Give it a go",1
267,"The movie is not as bad as every review is making it out to be. It certainly is not a perfect movie, but if you've enjoyed the previous ones, then don't let anyone dissuade you and just go see it. A lot of the complaints are just people nitpicking because their jobs as ""reviewers"" have warped their mind and keeps them from enjoying anything. However some of the complaints aren't just opinion, but fact. Yes, the movie is 30min to an hour too long and Yes, the third act goes to China just to appeal to Chinese audiences at the expense of the plot. I was tired of the childish humor from the previous movies and this one did away with it and just focused on the robots, which is good. So, go see it or don't, but make sure it is your own decision.",1
268,"I love to see hypocrite people criticizing this movie so hard, and still it rules the box office with $100 Mil. People are idiots, specially critics. They think because they didn't like a movie, is bad. I know, if a high number of people think the same, it has to mean something. But, c'mon, this is a TRANSFORMERS movie, what did they expect? Also, the ""Hey, this movie is pretty good, it's worth the 3 hours runtime! / Hey, this movie is very bad, don't waste 3 hours of your life!"" argument is complete ****",1
269,"Ok I give this movie a solid 6.75 I couldnt put 6.75 but I did not agree with the movie critics because lets face it they really are the bad ones in this. I think this movie did need lots of work still let me talk about the good stuff then the bad. First Voices of the transformers new team loved them love john goodman loved Petter cullen, Ken Watanbe. They were witty and funny. Second, Stanley's character Josh I enjoyed he was funny as well. The music with Imagine Dragons was really cool I loved the dino bot scenes and select of the action sequences. This is where is goes sour, I liked the idea on the story it seemed like the characters plots were cool idea but the characters who played them were really bad the daughter was very boring the boyfriends was a whiner the dad was ehh the better out of the 3 but still needed more personality hes a inventor not a fighter? Does the daughter HAVE too look around the dads age I get he had her when he was 18 I get that but I didnt really like that concept. It was basically giving the actors a eccues to be young a good looking. I think throw that away make a actual legit real characters with matching personality. This movie was WAY too long almost 3 hours of non stop action felt like too much action. I wanted to like this movie through the whole thing. At parts im like ok thats cool ok thats no yea what? I had alot of wtf why moments. I actually liked this movie better than the 3rd one. the 3rd one was really bad and you felt nothing out of no one. This movie actually had a little bit of a spark.",1
270,"In my opinion this movie was great and even maybe one of the best films in the summer, the story line was good, but there were a few sub plots and it could be confusing but in the end these sub plots do make sense, the actors were great and special effects were also good. In the end though this movie was great.",1
274,One of the best movie of 2014.And one of the best movie based on a famous franchise.I love Transformers cartoon and i love Transformers movie.Transformers: Age of Extinction is a great movie,1
276,"Transformers Age of Extinction is overall a very good movie in my opinion.The movie isn't going for an Oscar or anything but still the Visuals and the story line were enough to keep me engaged until the very end.Maybe I just like big explosions,long running time movies and Robots fighting.What can I say,I enjoyed the movie.",1
277,stupid physics.. problem with history... not impressive ost... steve jobs... no meagn fox... but.. rlly.. not bad movie...  ))) i dont know what most people expect... but i'm happy that saw this movie in imax... 8  from 10.,1
279,"This Movie was BOSS!!! Excellent once you get past the character intros that go along with 99% of all movies these days. The Action was Excellent, the CGI was better than the last 3 movies combined, the battle sequences were perfectly played out, and the motivations for the action sequences were well justified. Best movie of the Summer of 2014 Easily!",1
280,I believe this movie was mind blowing it had a lot of action and was just great. It was probably the second best in the franchise when it comes to plot but best in action terms. lockdown is a brilliant villan.,1
281,"Time, and time again the magic of movies have come to surpass the expectations of everyday life. From the events we see on the six o'clock news..to the overabundance of violence we see in cinema..what does this have to do with Michael Bay's new film ""Transformers: Age Of Extinction""? nothing..I just wanted a cool intro.I sit before you baffled, shocked and well.. obliterated as I feel like I have gone to battle and won. It's been quite some time since the little boy in me could ooze with so much excitement, anxiety and cheer. As only Michael Bay can do with his inept style of filmmaking. Which consists of two things 1) Blow stuff up, and 2) Blow more stuff up, while you are at it, why not just blow more stuff up. This approach has done wonders for his past attempts at filmmakings, speaking for itself. The lucrative and blockbuster famine that is ""Transformers"". Speaking for myself as a geeky fan boy who walks around aimlessly with an optimus prime on his wallet (judge me). I distinctly fell in love with everything Transformers back in 2009 when Bay and company changed my whole perspective on movies. Which is very rare to do, I might add. Every since, I have worshiped Optimus Prime and the autobots as the neverending saga to defeat Megatron. There is just something about all the destruction, mayhem and action set pieces. Not to mention who can ever pass up a monologue from Optimus Prime. I mean golly, if he gave me a speech to climb mount everest, or fly to the moon you bet your ass I would die trying. So obviously you could say I am biased, but if you want one fans opinion, I suggest you keep reading. Three hugely successful films later, I guess Bay felt the need to ""reboot"" or ""start a new trilogy"". Well folks, much like the first film back in 2009 ""Transformers: Age Of Extinction"" is presumably as advertised. A big budget spectacle that fits right in the middle of a warm Fourth Of July afternoon. The summer movie going season would be nothing, if we didn't have a Transformer movie to grace it. This time shuddering out former star boy Shia LaBeouf and replacing him with a better, leaner, and perhaps, more relatable Mark Wahlberg. At first glance I was appalled that the original cast was being reprimanded. Then again It could be very well for the best. I digress as usual, the film picks up in the aftermath of ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"" where Chicago is left in ruins, and the government wants blood....and blood in the form of the Transformers. Hence the title ""Age of Extinction"" The hunt is on going for Optimus and his noble band of renegades that are forced into hiding and the CIA has cut a deal with the ruthless decepticons to get the job done. Optimus unlikely crosses path with Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) an inventor of sorts, the next Albert Einstein of his generation. Also a very stern, strict and passionate father to his only daughter Tris (Nicola Peltz). Cade, fixing junk to make ends meet, finds an abandoned rusted truck in an old closed down movie theater. Which turns out to be, you guessed it, Prime in the flesh. Bringing back a dated war the started long ago. As fate would have it, an enemy foe (much like the last three Transformers) is threatening the fate of Humanity. The biggest question is .. does the audience really care?..I mean I don't know about you ... but I love watching Prime swoop in when all hope is lost and reluctantly kick some ass. It's predictable to a pulp..but its a formula that has been developed, and been proven to work. Some of the lines and bits of dialogue are a bit campy and cheesy (as expected). Kelsey Grammer's character at one point yells ""Impossible"" and I couldn't help but laugh, considering what movie he has been condensed in. I mean do you see the robots transforming around you? Running a long, and sometimes brutal, two hours and forty four minutes I can't help but attest this film could be shorter. However, when the action is raging and the autobots are destroying heads like it's no tomorrow. Alas the runtime is a breeze. Fans of the genre (like myself) will be frothing at the mouth at the sight of the Dinobots (yes their entrance is all the more entertaining). The climactic battle is also the best the series has yet to offer, putting final battles like ""The Avengers"" to shame. In addition the visual effects are top notch heavy and it's the same we all come to expect. While some of the characters we literally could care less about. (Including a very funny T.J Miller) Mark Wahlberg as the understandable father Cade Yeager is easy to get along with, and does his absolute best to give us a ground hero worth rooting for, and to a lesser extent. he does. Stanley Tucci also has ideally the best lines in the film..adding some much needed comedic elements to broaden the appeal towards the stunning conclusion. (If you can pay attention, with all the ruckus and mindless explosions taking place in the background) Fans should also notice, while yes, there is humor.. ""Transformers: Age Of Extinction"" is far more darker then one would anticipate. Secondly, there is plenty of a set up for future installments so I highly doubt this is the last will see of these characters. Bumblebee is back in full swing as usual in his stunning yellow fashion. --The only thing that seemed to bother me the most, was how there was hardly any reference towards the past Transformer films. Not once is there a brief mention of Sam Witwicky (you know, Shia LaBeouf's character..you know...the one that founded the transformers and saved the world..three times). I understand that the crew is trying to turn a new leave..but I just find it highly unlikely they all just forgot about the man that made them famous. In the end, don't come to expect nothing new from this film. In fact you should expect bigger and better. Chances are, if you're purchasing a ticket..you already know the ride you're in for. This is a smart technique that has worked wonders for the past installments and now a new bar has been set for the sequels that will grace it. Love, is always a strong word for me to use while discussing a movie. It definitely goes against my better judgement. But I just don't see how it's possible to walk out of this movie, without your heart beating out of your chest (as was mine) all to the tune of the great headliner song ""Battle Cry"" by Imagine Dragons. As this is just one man's humble opinion. I can agree that well, I loved ""Transformers: Age Of Extinction"". A By: Nate Adams Directed By: Michael BayRated: PG13Runtime: 164 MinsRelease Date: June 27th 2014Studio: Paramount Pictures Thanks For Stopping By ®",1
283,"High marks just for the sheer strength of over-the-top amazing SFX. Yes, there were plot holes, discontinuities and implausibilities but the focus is the Transformers and their mission and that's delivered in spades once again.",1
284,This the 2nd best transformers movie. This movie strikes the best balance between human and robot scenes and no annoying Shia. The Autobots considering to murdering humans at one point is a breath of fresh air compared to the obnoxiously saccharine sentimental optimism about humans in the earlier movies.  The new decepticon transformation is crappy though. Dont listen to the sheep and give this movie a try.,1
302,"It's an okay movie, though it's way too effing long or it feels that way, i don't think Mark Wahlberg is as great as he used to be, i love him as an actor i really do, but now he's just put in movies so women want to buy tickets to it that's the only reason, overall movie is meh.",1
304,"I am a movie fanatic, not a typical critic. So I as an audience would rate the movie quite good although I did miss the clear story line of the first part. But when you are watching sequels of a movie series, you need to understand that there will be changes. So rather than comparing it with its previous parts, it is better to view it as a separate movie. Yes! One do need to maintain the connection between all its parts and Age of Extinction does that. It is clear that after Sentinel Prime tried to rebuild Cybertron with his portal, there was outrage, and the hostility against the Transformers are well understood.I guess common movie fanatics like me didn't like it because half of the Autobots were wiped out and Ratchet's encounter was surely painful. I did not miss Sam though. I mean I did miss him but it was mostly because of Bumblebee. But we have evil Lockdown and rebuilding of Galvatron was totally cool. The only disappointing thing for me in this part was merging up of plots. I found it pretty hard to keep up with everything. In the previous series, there was Colonel Lennox, Sam and Transformers but this part seems to have the story all mixed up. First, a robotic engineer finds Optimus, then there is CIA, then there is Lockdown trying to capture Optimus. Oh and not to forget, we have the KSI and its chief running away with the seed. Well, wise people rightly say that too many cooks spoil the broth. That's what happened in Transformers 4, too much story spoiled the movie.",1
307,10 out of 10...MASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTERPIECE,1
309,"This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen and whoever gave it a 10 should have their Metacritic account taken away.  The visuals aren't bad, but at the fourth Transformers movie it's nothing new or exciting so it isn't a selling point.  The movie sabotages anything good it has, TJ Miller is good for the small amount he's in but is underused.  To fully express my dislike for this movie, there's a scene in which the daughter's boyfriend has to explain why it is legal for them to date, and there's a lot of reasons it's creepy.  First, whoever wrote it knows about this law and I don't want to ask why.  Second, Michael Bay wrote a sexy character so young they had to explain why it's legal, but they don't have to explain why it's gross.  Dinobots are in like 10 minutes, humor sucks, directing sucks, writing sucks, acting is good 10% of the time.",0
310,"Transformers : l'âge de l'extinctionUn film de Michael Bay se qui veut dire BOMBE, EXPLOSION .... à GOGO !!!Surement le meilleur Transformeurs qu'on est vu jusqu’ici avec un nouveau casting, une technologie de pointe, l'intégration des Dinobots, une bande sonore maîtrisée et étourdissante, une bonne OST de Steve Jablonsky avec en plus quelque musique du groupe ""Imagine Dragon"" et des scènes étourdissantes à foison.Bref un mixte de bonne chose pour 2H45min de pures rigolades.Je rajouterai une seule chose : Des scènes d'action très diversifier comparer au précédent film.Mais un scénario qui ne tient que sur un post-it mais plus complet que les précédentSi vous aimé tout casser, tout péter, détruire, les tôles froissées, et la beauté visuelle vous ne serrer pas déçus du voyage pour cette explosion de sensation.",1
312,"Transformers: Age of Extinction takes the worst elements of the previous installments in the franchise, then cranks the awful up to 11. A dull, cut-and-paste story with atrocious dialogue and terrible performances make this an absolute slog to sit through. Worst of all, the action actually manages to be pretty boring. It doesn't feel like Michael Bay was having any fun constructing the set pieces this time. Yet, the movie is somehow almost three hours long. As someone who found a fair amount of enjoyment in the first few movies, this was a massive letdown.",0
314,"Literally one of the worst movies of all time. Action is the only thing this movie has going for. If you want characters you empathize with, a decent plot, and correct geographical depictions, this is the movie to avoid. Hong Kong does not just border onto forest. Mark Wahlberg should just stick to comedy as this may be his most unconvincing performance yet. What a waste of my time.",0
316,"I will not take this as a part of transformers. Completely failed in everything, but still better than The Last Knight.",0
317,"I found this film watchable enough despite the Problems it has, like Nicole Peltz, (who sucks like she did in ""The Last Airbender"") but overall, it was a fun time. I liked it.",1
319,"I had created an account just to express my disgust with this trash. The plot is acceptable only by a teenager with especially low standards, both as a whole and separate scenes it just obscenely stupid and incoherent. One-liners are cliche in a way that resembles a parody rather than a blockbuster. It looks like a student project aiming to show CGI skills with worthless characters, so ungodly stupid that you actually wonder if they are not mentally impaired by design. Both main characters and power lust government workers share the same illogical insanity. It is the worst high budget production I have seen in my life, appalling beyond any measure. Even must-have hot girl character is repeatedly under 18 which leads to cringe dialogs. Unbeleviable piece of trash.",0
322,"Terrible, Just Terrible, Worst of the Transformers Movies, and one of the Worst Movies Ever Made, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the Best of the Transformers Movies, But this is Really the worst out of the Bunch, Transformers: The Last Knight is Also Bad.",0
324,"""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" isn't just a really bad movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously, godawful movies like ""Batman and Robin"" and ""The Room"" are painful to watch, but they are at least 1 hour and a half long. This movie was an excruciating 3-hour experience, filled with terrible acting performances, nonsensical plot points, incomprehensible action sequences and VERY SLOW pacing.Michael Bay doesn't have a clue how to direct a movie, much less an action movie. It's sad.If you haven't seen the movie, congratulations. You just skipped three hours of anguish.0/10.",0
326,"Als Kinoliebhaber ist es ein sehr schweres Unterfangen die Filme der ""Transformers""-Reihe zu schauen, da diese eine Handlung aufweisen, welche auf einen Bierdeckel passt und dennoch sich in vielen Punkten widerspricht und/oder keine wirkliche Logik aufweist.Doch fälle ich kein Urteil ohne besagte Filme gesehen zu haben und so kam es, dass ich nun den vierten Teil nachholte.Auch wenn ich versuchte ganz unvoreingenommen an den Film zu gehen machte es einem ""Age of Extinction"" schon in den ersten Minuten fast unmöglich nicht abzuschalten.Die ersten Wortwechsel sind ein Graus und die ""slapstick""-Einlage mit dem Football schmolz meine Synapsen. Nicht das ich per se die Szene nicht lustig finden könnte, doch die fehlende Fähigkeit eine schauspielerische Leistung an den Tag zu legen vernichtete jede Glaubwürdigkeit. Selbst meine ungeborenen Tochter hätte den Ball besser/schlechter werfen können. Was wir als Zuschauer geboten bekommen ist dann ein Mann, welcher einen schlechten Wurf darstellen soll, dennoch zu minderbemittelt ist und somit nur in der Lage ist den Ball sich direkt vor die Füße zu werfen. Solch einen schlechten Wurf würde ich nicht mal einer Person ohne Arme zutrauen.Nun bleibt es aber leider nicht nur bei einer kleinen und unbedeutenden Szene, sondern die Idiotie des Filmes steigert sich ins Undenkbare.Der Film versucht dem Zuschauer ernsthaft zu vermitteln, dass die CIA ohne Wissen und Zustimmung des Präsidenten ein totalitärer Apparat mit eigener Agenda sein kann, welcher sogar ohne rechtliche Absicherung und Erlaubnis handelt und seine Ziele, sowie die Verfolgung einer bestimmten Gruppe durchführt.Noch unzählige Szenen und Dialoge könnten in der Luft zerrissen werden, da diese in ihrer Qualität nicht ein mal mehr im ""Trash""-Genre anzusiedeln wären, doch dies wäre verschenkte Liebesmüh.Dennoch darf man nicht die Arbeit komplett als Schandfleck bezeichnen, da es auch genug Personen gab, welche bei der Umsetzung des Filmes ihr Bestes gegeben haben und nur ihrer Arbeit nachgegangen sind. Kostümdesigner, Animatoren, Ausstatter usw. sollten von der Schande befreit sein, welche der Regisseur (Michael Bay) und der Drehbuchautor (Ehren Kruger) über die Branche der Filmindustrie abermals brachten.Wer auf Explosionen steht wird mit ""Age of Extinction"" bestens bedient sein, da einem schon nach wenigen Minuten das Gehirn implodiert.So kann ich abschließend noch was gutes loswerden:„Danke, ich muss diesen Film nie wieder schauen.""",0
