1,"One of the dullest movies I've ever seen in my life. If only I could take those 122 minutes back. Here are reasons why this movie sucked. 1. First off, the characters are lifeless. 2. The characters sound like they are reading off paper3. Practically remain blank faced throughout most of the movie4. No chemistry between the two main characters5. Is everybody wearing makeup?If you are a Twilight fan, then I feel sorry for you. Please get some help.",0
2,"One of the more foolish movies I've ever seen. It has a poor plot, poor music, poor screenplay and the worst, it ruined the vampire's stories. This movie is really awful. Enjoyable just for teenagers in love. In a way is stupid.",0
3,"Twilight is an extremely pathetic movie. A movie so riped of phoniest it is almost laughable. Not only is it dull, pretentious and boring, it has some very wooden acting and poor dialogue.",0
4," I'm not kidding, its like the worstest movie of the year by far. It is so pale, dull and boring. Nothing exciting ever happens. It is emotionless, and you just can't wait for it to end. And the visual effects, they were awful! But most of all, why would you make a movie adapted from the lamest hit chick flick novel out there. And the story: Booooo.",0
5,"Nothing more than a confused womans wet dream, with legions of idiotic, pubescant 16 year old fan girls streaming in her wake. The poor story is further degraded by immensely wooden acting and dull script writing. A real fangs-bared yawn accompanied by repulsion at the overall story.",0
6,This whole movie is a a 14 year old girls wet dream with terrible acting! I really don't now what else to say other than this movie destroyed Vampires for me as now if I hear the word Vampire I will think of this terrible piece of crap.,0
7," I am a big fan of the book (and hot vampires) but OMG this movie was awful!! The negative reviews I read beforehand weren't nearly harsh enought to prepare me! The opening scene of one of the Vamps hunting a deer showed promise, but the first 20 minutes of ""dialogue"" (was there actually a script or were they just winging it?) forced me out of the theater somewhere around the ""I'll have a garden burger"" moment. I'm not sure if it was really the acting (hello B-list) or the director trying to jam in insignificant book details rather than taking time to build suspence and character depth. Edward's tempted and tortured moment in biology class just looked like a five-year-old that had to pee?! I had to re-watch Harry Potter to remind myself that he really is a decent actor. I vote 2 - in the event that it got better sometime after I gave up.",0
8,"The acting is terrible, the movie's stupid and for me the movie is just targeted for tweens. I'm also tired of this vampire sh**. Kristin Stewart barely has any emotions and she was way better in Adventureland. Every vampire aren't really vampire's! What I mean is that the vampires aren't sucking any blood, they sparkle in the sun and I'm glad there's a movie parodying this crap.",0
9,"Should be called ""The Stalker's Guide to Getting Chicks."" I only gave it a 1 and not a 0 because i laughed during a couple of scenes.  The characters were really stupid and I couldn't believe anything that the actors said. My friends and I watched, wondering what all the popularity  was about. All 9 of us are still wondering.",0
10,Worst dramatic/romantic movie I ever seen in my life. Kristen Stewart can't act for **** and everyone who tries to act is stupid and the concept of vampires being in daylight is dumb. Vampires are supposed to kill people not fall in love with them.,0
11,"This is a very horrendous move. A pretty predicatble plot, and bad acting and a stupid story (do we need more vampire romances in the world?) I just want to punch the direct in the face.",0
12,"The fact that this film was even thought of by Paramount is a mystery to me. The film for me is so offtrack and boring that I can't understand why they accepted another 3 movies. A film about vampires will never be successful, but when they throw romance along side this rubbish and a hint of comedy, it's just a disaster and a waste of money. I feel sorry for the actors whose careers have been ruined by this utter drivel. Dreadful 0/10",0
13,"My wife has made me sit through all of these films. I feel cheated that i will never get those hours of my life back. Don't worry though, I made her sit through the alien films followed by Die Hard 1&2&3&4. that'll teach her!!!",0
14,"This film doesn't even deserve a 1. If you want to see a vampire film, look out for Underworld or Bram Stokers Dracula. Not these teen romances which have stolen everything from every other vampire film or book and made it 'teen friendly' by removing blood. Hello, that's why teens live!",0
15,"It had a few decent moments in it, but overall this movie just bored the hell out of me. The romance wasn't moving at all, that best fight scene mtv awarded battle with edward and that one wolf was 2 minutes of basically epic shoving. why the hell do so many people like this movie? Its like over 2 hours long and it just drags on.......blah blah oh hes a vampire.....blah blah blah of i'm suddenly magically in love with you edward..... i gave it an honest chance, and it made a chuckle here and there, thought it was kinda creative at times but overall im just watching this like, wait a minute? why the **** is this vampire glowing in the sun? Plus Bella should've been hotter. seriously they get a mega pretty boy i guess for the vampire because girls wont shut up about him, but for bella we got an actress whose a 8 of 10 at best. lol.",0
17,"This movie was a total borefest. I had no preconceptions about it since back then I not only hadn't read the books, but hadn't even heard about Twilight. All I knew was that it was ""a movie about vampires"". I watched it with my brother and we both agreed that it sucked. Uninspired acting, terrible dialogues, boring story. It failed to evoke any emotions from me.",0
18,"I gave this movie a chance. I really did. But it just takes my intelligence, crushes it and stuff a cartload of dung into my brain. It felt like a mixture of cinematic rape, utter boredom and cringeworthy acting/sequences that make this the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. Twilight feels like a B-grade, made for TV movie, only that they managed to get a decent camera for the job. About the only half-decent component is the cinematography. Its definitely well shot. As for the main juice of the movie...you'd be wondering why on earth anyone would make this movie apart from milking the cash out of Tweens and their poor boyfriends. Apart from some supporting characters who have passable acting, the main characters lack the skill and aptitude to produce even an a line of dialogue that wont leave you cringing or in some cases, wishing you were dead so the torture would end. Tweens would defend this pile of excrement to their deaths and I say, feel free. The world can judge. And thankfully, most people who have a conscience would stray clear of this horror. Yes, tweens, there are a lot of females out there who hate/aren't give a fck about Twilight than there are those who would. Get that fact right. I am not even going do a review for the other sequels as I WRITE THIS AS A WARNING TO ALL: This is almost as bad as Batman & Robin and is universally claimed by critics who were not bribed by the producers as the worst movie franchise of the 21st century, if not in all of movie history. I literally felt my IQ drop by spades during the movie. Please, save yourself and avoid this. I saw this out of pure curiosity. Dont even try to do what I did. Its not worth it.",0
20," This movie was almost painful to watch. I passion, what passion, and the characters were DULL DULL DULL. There was no chemistry only angst or depression. The only thing decent was the soundtrack that is why I gave it at 1 at least. So disappointing.",0
21, This movie was so boring. I hated it and the acting and the directing was lame. Bella asked the same damn question every three seconds. How did you save me? I will give this film a negative review.,0
22," the movie quite frankly sucked! i wa expecting more... i mean the books r fantastic and then this movie flopped. But some how it is still making millions (which i do not understand) Too many scenes were changed and added. it went to slow and all they did was stare at each other.. no flirting or ""i love you"" moments like in the books. It sucked.",0
23, Worse adaptation i have ever seen. i have read all the cheesy books and i love them but i really really almost cried when i saw this movie. this is by far the biggest literary heartbreak I've had.,0
24, Absolutely terrible. I do not know why this is so popular. I had to leave the theater in the middle of viewing because I couldn't take it anymore.,0
25," Most of you guys are retarded. the first half was decent. her school chums were funny. but as soon as they get into the vampires this movie becomes shockingly cheesy and unintentionally funny. the pacing is way, way off. Too slow at first than way, way 2 fast. the bad guy is introduced way 2 late and the climax is way 2 short. this is one of the worst directed movies ive ever seen and one of the cheesiest.",0
26," I saw this movie and thought it was horrible. Not only was it super gay, the vampires were all glittery and stuff. What the hell?",0
27," Absolutely crap, I don't know why I'm still wasting my time on this kind of american movies, it's so pathetic, it is boring from the beggining until the end, I have wait to see what could be happen but nothing happens. The only thing that worth is in the radiohead song in the final credits. It's defenely the worse movie that I ever seen in a few years, it's worse than ""The Spirit"" also a great piece of sh*t.",0
28," Undoubtedly one of the single worst films ever made. With a thoroughly uninteresting plot and poorly developed characters, this is an insult to what was actually not a bad book. At least that had some good points. You could go and see this, or you could......well there are too many better thing to list.",0
29, My I.Q. dropped from watching this pointless movie. Horrible story line and effects. This movie was no doubt the worst creation ever to curse this planet.,0
30," I like to think of myself asa movie buf so I decided to give this movie a fair go, I read the book and decided it got a 5 out of 10 because it is not written that well and the same thing goes for this movie. They tried to change a classic horror element, Vampires, like what the remake of dawn of the dead did to zombies but while dawn of the ead was good this failed. Poorly made, little to no prodution values and just a ciomplet lack of what makes a movie good.",0
31, The film is crap rob pattinson is a weirdo. I love the books but the movie was sad and boring .,0
32," Hey people, get yourself a movie education! This is not even a movie, it's teenagers' fantasies for a guy who has a sex appeal equalling... 0. I gave it a 1 only because I had a good time laughing at it with my friends during the movie. I've rarely seen a movie so bad; oh wait: I already know one... ""Twilight 2"". There's nothing else to add, my comment is as profound as this movie.",0
33," I went with 9 of my friends to see the movie and none of us liked it. We came knowing it would be different from the book but didn't think it'd be that bad. The acting skills of the actors weren't that good, the music didn't fit the scenes, they mixed scenes from the book together....overall it was a big disappointment.",0
35,"The Twilight Saga was an early 2000s vampire fad that somehow spawned five films. Make no mistake, these series is atrocious. Stephanie Meyer is one of the worst authors out there. Her source material is so scant and bare and empty, that you could honestly combine the five Twilight movies down into two movies.The first film in the franchise, ""Twilight"" is somehow the best and worst of the bunch. The story is cheesy. Poor Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are barely acting. The CGI, soundtrack, and cinematography all make The Room look like Citizen Kane. However, there is so much unintentional comedy in this movie, that you will barely be able to sit through it without laughing your ass off. This goes for you even if you are a Twilight fan!Despite how terrible this movie is, this is the only one in the series that I have rewatched. It's a good bad-movie-night selection. It may also serve one day to help enlighten historians as to what this whole ""emo girl vampire craze"" was about.",0
36,"Bad acting, cheesy moments (super cheesy), lack of chemistry in love scenes and not having the true spirit of a true vampire is all I can say. You would not even classify this as a vampire movie because vampires in this movie are rarely drinking blood and rarely bites people. Overall, the film is boring and bad. They did redeem just a little bit in New Moon and Eclipse (from a score of 3 to 4).",0
37,"One of the worst films ever made. Without a shadow of a doubt. Not only is it dull, pretentious and boring, it has some very wooden acting and poor dialogue. It makes you cringe at the fact that four more installments are on their way...",0
38,"terrible movie, terrible book, this series has officially killed the vampire genre, before this if you said vampire romance, you'd sound crazy, and in my opinion, it still sounds crazy. there 2 different things, vampire, a horror idea, and romance, some lovey dovie move. they don't fit together. another reason i don't like this movie is because it killed the idea of a vampire horror. ever since the original book was made, there has been nothing in the vampire genre besides vampire romances. and any movie that doesn't have them as a part of some relation ship puts them as a small, weak sub enemy. there is no Dracula-like vampires any more. so, in short what im saying is, thanks a lot twilight, i hate you",0
39,"I've seen a lot of poorly written garbage get mainstream attention before but this convoluted wet dream posing as a love story is too popular for me to let be. Okay, to be fair it IS technically a love story, it's just a bad one. The characters not only have close to zero personality to speak of, but the person you're intended to side with is all around, pretty damn sleasy. If I played a drinking game for how many people she manipulates or screws over, I'd be in a coma. Not only that but to my knowledge there are close to no consequences for her actions. A war between freaking vampires and werewolves could be going on, and still all the movies really care about is 'when the hell are they gonna do it'. -_- I will say this though, it's actually not many notches lower than most other romance movies, a lot of them have really odd priorities.",0
40, Well this whole thing sucks pretty hard. I mean how can this be a Vampire book. i mean seriously what kind of vampires glitter in the sun. everyone that reads this thinks they know vampires but they don't. most of them never even heard of interview with the vampire or even underworld. real vampires don;t fall in love they suduce people to get what they want.,0
41,"Never before have I seen a more terrible movie than this. Vampires? Maybe. 2 ""hot"" guys that 10 year olds like. Check! A good movie? Yeah right. I like the first minute or two. Before anyone arrives on screen.",0
42,"This film just makes you realise that the world is full of camp people,men and women.In the older days when men were men and wanted to do manly things with their pals Vampire Horror was quite enjoyable but these days men just follow their partner anywhere and everywhere!Even going as far as copying the lady habit of dropping their own friends for the partner relationship.Only to try and win their mates back after the relationship goes south and crumbles and shatters to pieces!This film is drowned in camp vampires.....omg if the vamps have gone camp then there really is no hope left for mankind!Vampire films used to be classed as horror but with drivel like this its no wonder there's no scares left in the genre.......except for 30 days of Night,if you want an up-to date vampire horror go for that as you wont be dissappointed,oh and it has romance but its so thin you know its there but forget it as the horror is so intense.",0
43,"the glamorous vampires are not badass at all. it was quite sad, never knew they were books until after i saw the movie, just terrible fairy vampires AND **** ACTING!",0
44,"There is essentially nothing good about this film. It is created for a female audience who have read the book, of which similarities between the two can be found. Beyond the characters is the way they both flows, which is quite terribly. In addition, the film alone stands as a crime against cinema. The directing is lackluster at best (the 1 point given is because the cinematography was slightly better than terrible and rarely well done at points), and the acting was atrocious. Kristen Stewart comes off as either high on some substance or simply mentally handicapped throughout the film. She seems to have trouble speaking and for some reason, seems to keep her mouth open constantly. Robert Patinson does slightly better, which is saying essentially nothing. He is still one of the worst actors in Hollywood. He is put on screen because of his physique and nothing else. His acting ability is exactly as his character: dead. But unlike his character, there is no sparkling about his talent, or lack there of. Tweens and teenage girls will flock to this film and enjoy the muscles and romance, though that too is badly created, but for those who understand what makes a film good should place a gun in their mouth and pull the trigger before seeing this pile of garbage.",0
46,"It would be a great mistake to call this picture ""vampire movie"". Vampires here are quite phony since they don't drink blood. I don't know if it is bad acting or whether romance is supposed to be so slow and passionless between vegetarian vampire and gloomy girl, but I can't see a single spark between them even when they're kissing. Characters' actions are full of incoherence. How does Edward, according to some girl's evidence quite desired by most of schoolgirls, fall in love with some girl who seems to have dyslexia? I don't believe that his feelings are based on her smell solely. Why on earth evil blood-drinking vampires are so hostile? Smell again? And let alone poorly made supernatural jumps and combat scene. I practically can see strings attached to their bodies.",0
47,"I hated the book, and the movie was no better than the book. I wish this series never existed at all. A vampire that shines? Seriously? What has the world come to?",0
48,"I've read the entire Twilight series, and I have to say that the movie is terrible. That isn't to say the books are any better, but this is just atrocious. All I can say is: you know something is wrong when your audience is laughing in a gothic vampire romance movie.",0
49,"God, this movie is awful The acting is horrendous, the dialouge is terrible, the characters are underdeveloped, the directing is lazy, and anything I forgot to mention sucks too.",0
50,"The story is interesting, the script is good, but Kristen's performance is very poor and weak. The scenery is beautiful and use of colors is very well done.",1
51,this movie sucks!!! there's nothing good about this movie. i don't know what the **** people like this dumb movie. Only little girls watch stupid movies like twilight,0
53," Nothing actually happens in this travesty of a film. Gothic romance? You wish! Only 15 yr old girls can find some interest in this boring, banal, undercooked crap with bad acting and laughable dialogues. Oh, at least I laughed out loud in certain points.",0
54,"Do you enjoy deeply terrible movies with gaping plot holes, a horribly bland cast, an uninterresting premise and excruciatingly horrible writing? Then look no further than Twilight. Vampires shining has just earned Stephanie Meyer a place in hell. And the romance? Pah! Bella and Edward have as much chemistry as a rapist and his victim.",0
55, I was looking forward to the Twilight movie.The movie is one of the worse movie I ever seen.I am a 16 year girl.I did think Robert Patterson is hot.,0
57,"I have to admit I hate Twilight and what it did to vampires, but the movie was pretty good, if really flawed, I was shocked with how well it turned out, it actually had be looking forward to the next one.",1
59,"I enjoyed it, maybe because I didn't read the book before I watched it. But overall, I can't wait what the sequel will bring... but until then, I enjoy watching ""TWILIGHT"" and listening to the score which CARTER BURWELL did amazing!!!!",1
62,Dumb & silly,0
63," This movie is wrong. This is the most ecruciatingly painful and boring vampire or 'romantic' movie ever... I've never seen a vampire fly like superman...they ceased to be vampires when they started 'glowing like diamonds' in the sun and seeing their reflections? That's just BLAH!. Plus the dude doesn't sleep, even in the daytime (though i'm not sure if that's not part of their nature)... would have been a good movie if the vampire characters were written to be some special creatures other than vampires. This is an insult to all vampire movies of all time, even vampire comedies get more props than this crap. Both lovers could have as well just stared at each other for the whole 2 hours of the movie. This movie made me cry. One of those movies that takes away 2 hours of your time.. I wish I could get back the 1 hour 11 mins and 57 secs I wasted, at least I didn't finish it. PLEASE DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!!",0
64," If you haven't seen this movie already, I would suggest you avoid it at all costs. Honestly, don't even bother downloading it illegally -- it will only waste the precious space on your computer. Acting? I've seen better acting in high school plays, maybe even elementary plays: each and every line was flat, emotionless and the delivery -- let alone the awful, awful dialogue -- left me literally laughing aloud. And special effects? It was like I was watching a satire of the movie rather than the actual movie. Plot? Full of holes and loose ends before it even made the silver screen, one would think that the screen writer would have patched a few of them up. In conclusion: I left the theatre with bruises on my arms and the words, ""Shh, all the pre-teen girls will beat you up if you don't stop laughing"" still ringing in my ears.",0
65, This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen.,0
66,"This was the most boring film ever i sat through. I wonder why they took ""actors"" for this ""vampire-movie"". A non bloodsucking vampire is as much a vampire as a potato. In a film with non bloodsucking potatoes they could have saved on the budget though.",0
68," Bar none, one of the worst films ever made. I understand this is a teen flick, but the script is appalling, the acting is dreadful, the directing is terrible and the whole thing is just physically painful.",0
69,"A really good movie, I read some of the twilight books, but this adaptation is great, the cast is very regular, but the most sorpresive for me is the love of Edward, I love Twilight.",1
70," This movie was HORRID. The layabout acting mixed in with a droll, played-out storyline makes for a completely wasted hour and a half. The only redeeming quality was the fight sequence, which didn't last more than 3 minutes.",0
71," Wow, I am impressed. Not only are the characters SUPER HOT, but there were some very suspenseful moments. This is a good transition for the book to the screen.",1
75,"First of all, vampires aren't real. So everyone who is saying ""they're not real vampires"", well, obviously. It's just a different take on vampires, which again, I should highlight as some people may be confused, are fictional. Anyway, I think this movie is good for teenage girls. It's focusing on the romance involving a girl who is shy and feels nobody really 'gets her'. As for the action, what more could you want? They smash them to pieces and set them on fire! I think each of these movies are getting better and better and I can't wait to see what Breaking Dawn is going to be like.",1
77, The funniest vampire movie you will ever see.,1
78," Pattison and Stewart were the best actors they could've gotton for the movie. Both gorgeous and perfect onscreen (with a few exceptions). For people like me who have read the books, stick to the books. the movie isnt nearly as amazing as stephanie meyers interpretation of it.",1
79," love the books and the movie, even though it was changed so much. a true twilight fan will of course love it.",1
80, There is only one way to watch this movie: as a comedy. It's hilariously bad. Trying to watch it as anything but will give you headaches.,1
81, Most of you people rating this movie haven't even watched it.It was a good movie but I have to admit that the speacial effects were wack!It has a good and unique plot so for that its a perfect ten.,1
82," I read the book many times, and I was the first person in my area to arive at the movies to see Twilight. It was an amazing movie. Although some information was left out, It was still great.",1
83, Stop calling this a TEEN MOVIE It has been a long while since I was a teen and I enjoyed the movie and books. More tickets will be sold if you drop the TEEN title.,1
84, I love twilight you guys are awesome when the movie comes it is like it is real that it really happen. i think you guys are the best out of all the movies but ever one think it is dumb but it is not it feels real to me. i guess people don't get the movie.your friend Alyssa Bye!!,1
85," Went into this movie with extremely low expectations, and came out quite surprised. An excellent movie that is getting unfairly bashed. Book was better by miles (but the book is always better, so no one can use that excuse). Acting was good, excellent visual effects, and great camera shots and angles. This would have gotten a 7 out of 10, but due to the undeserved bashing this film has received, I bumped it to ten. Yeah, I'm a guy, sue me, this was a good movie.",1
86, I love this film but i don't think it does the book justice. I don't think anyone else could play the parts of Bella and Edward any better than Kristen and Rob and the soundtrack is amazing!,1
87," I'm a teenager, so don't think i'm 23 or something. I read all four books, and though i'm not interested in vampires, i've grown really found of Bella and Edward. Kristen stewart was incredible, and so was harry potter's cedric diggory, rob pattison. I think the movie could've been better, but i deeply enjoyed it. I bought it a couple of days ago, and if you're like me... its hard to take your eyes off.",1
88, Great.,1
89," Love, love, love the movie and the book!!! The critics are out of their mind!!!",1
90, Awesome!!! I have read all 4 books and can't wait for the next movies. All the cast was adorable and lovable. Please don't change anyone. I live in Hawaii on the island of maui and all have lot's of fans here just waiting to see the next movies. Everyone has read the books and seen the first movie that i know which is alot of people. Hat's off to all of you and Stehanie Meyers. Awesome job!! The best novel i had ever read in my years. ,1
91," Brilliant film, the romance is so intense. Excellent.",1
92," Twilight rocks!!!!!!! I love Twilight!!! I have read the series 6 times in a row!!!! I adore Rob!!! I am soooooo Team Edward!!!! Who's with me? Reader, YOU SHOULD READ IT!!! The intensity of love between Edward and Bella.....I can't even put it into words!!!",1
93," For all of you that gave 1's and 2's i have to say one thing you guys are totally dumb. This is one of the best romantic movies since Romeo and Juliet. I loved Twilight , cant wait til New Moon hits the big screen.",1
94, The best movie I've ever seen and the most romantic book I've read!!! Who ever gives it a 1 out of 10 is an idiot!,1
95," The film is immense, the books are even better - dont listen to the critics decide for yourself, it is a must see. don't listen to anyone who gives it less than a 7 out of 10 cause they couldn't have been paying attention to the film at all and definetly haven't read the inticing books. watch it and decide for yourself. a straight 10 out of 10! read the books aswell.",1
96,"i think this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,it was a remarkable film and if it has a rating lower than 5 the person who put that score obviously wasn't watching carefully to get into the story line because it is an excellent film and i cannot wait for the next one.",1
97," It is the most amazing movie i have ever seen in my life.I watched the movie thinking it would have been one of those movie where vamopires just suck people blood and then they die,but i was really wrong it was AMAZING.Once i had watched it i was on my mum's case to buy me the books,but before that my mum watched it and then she loved it to death,and then she really wanted to get the books aswell and told me to get our seperate books,but instead she got new moon and eclipse. i told her to get twilght but she didn't listen. I LOVE TWLIGHT!!!",1
98, Twilight rocked. The obsessiion and intensity between Bella and Edward was palpable. Give me more...i'm an addict! the music in the film was so perfect.,1
99,"If you like romantic vampire stories such as classic Coppola's 1992 Bram Stoker Dracula masterpiece movie then you are going to love this contemporary vampire film by all means, every minute of this 120min film will keep you glued to the big screen. To put it simple since Coppola's Bram Stoker Dracula film I have never seen any vampire movie as good as Twilight.",1
100," After watching this movie, I had to sheepishly recommend it to my male forty-plus year old friends. My man points probably took a few hits, but I trust after they see it, they'll give them back. Seriously, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My favorite scene in the whole movie was the baseball scene. It's something I'd never seen on the big screen, or even knew I wanted to see until it was right in front of me. For today teenager's, this is definitely their The Lost Boys. While different in tone and story, it's still cool vampire flick that approaches the whole fang suckers thing from a fresh angle.",1
101, Unexpectedly good.I think the caasting could've been a little better but overall a solid flick for just about anyone.,1
102," Probably just for 15 y.o. girls. Very TV movie-esque with the acting, filming, long thoughtful stares, even the special effects. Hopefully will improve as the movies progress.",1
103," I almost cried watching this movie because i loved seeing the characters come to life. after reading all the books, watching the movie was the next best thing. I loved it. they didn't add all the scenes they shouldv have but it was good anyway. The movie is great.",1
104," ok so this would be a perfect ten but what annoyed me was that the blood typing scene was not in the movie and that i think foreshadows so much that will happen later. The overall movie was well put together and kept me on the edge of my seat. What suprised me the most was the comedy in it. The first time i saw it the audience was laughing in almost every scene. For the actors in this i think that they found the best cast humanly possible. Im sick of people complaining about how thats not the right person playing so-and-so, im meen really, how do you expect to find someone pale, beautiful, scary, but alluring, with a voice like in angel, and glides fluently as they walk? Its not possible! so to sum it all up -2 for keeping a great scene out bringing it to an 8.",1
107," Definitely no longer a teen, but I absolutely loved this movie. One of the only ones I'd consider watching at the movies again, just because I enjoyed it so much! Giving a 9 because I'm completely biased, being a vampire-enamored female :) Also, leave the boyfriend at home... he's not going to enjoy it as much >.>",1
108," I have fallen in love with Stephenie Meyer and all she stands for, i love the whole twilight saga... i have repeated the books over and over again... and love them still. The Twilight movie was a let down, compared to what it could of been, but in my opinion that had nothing to do with the actors at all i thought they were all perfect, especially the leads. I cant wait for the sequel!! Im just glad they have a different director this time and considering the views it got in 2009, i cant imagine how good it will be!!",1
112, Twilight did pretty good for what they had to work with. Filming started during the writing strike so it was rushed and stuff was added. It's not a scary movie/book. Meyer personified the vampires. I think it was pretty neat how she didn't cliche the vampires. Twilight is a love story. Point blank. I think Bella's personality should've shined more. But overall it was enjoyable.,1
113," This was one of the best films i had ever seen . because of good story, great sound track , adequate players and .. and i think it's a pretty good movie.",1
115," I love the books. The movie was close to it. THE DIRECTOR AND MUSIC STUNK! she made it seem like a complete acid trip, the cinematography was all over the place and crude....and there was never a point in which the music ever STOPPED. or matched the actual scene. and there was an actual montage. and a quote form the Lion King. (yes, really) his sparkling was weak. over all, the director had no idea what the hell she was doing.",0
116, Crapy book. Crappy movie. Plot is cliched and boring. Save your money and see something decent.,0
117, Robert pattinson is the perfect edward cullen. I couldn't have asked for a better interpretation of the movie.,1
118," It has way too many little Vampire flaws, but at least it hist its target audience, but to me, I thought that there were so many flaws that I just think I should steady out the reviews because here I go. Twilight is the worst movie Ive ever seen! Sometimes chick-flicks are fun (like Juno), or there just sappy or unrealistically cheesy, This turns out not to be a chick-flick, but everyone seems serious, the romance, the characters. Lame.",0
119," Like most movies made from books it dint follow the whole story line wich was dissapointing- they also really needed a bigger budget to bring the special effects more into play- otherwise I loved it simply because its ""Twilight"" the book moved me emotionally so the movie helped me see more visually- I have great hopes for the next movie to blow our socks off!",1
120," This movie surpassed Stephanie Meyer's vision of the intensive Love and devotion of the two main characters. I was enthralled by directors results in bringing this to life. I LOVED IT, LOVED IT AND LOVED IT AGAIN. From an 63 year old lady who enjoys romance in her life still!!!",1
121,"I did love this movie. At the very beginning I was positive I was going to hate it because it was so different from the book, but once we meet Edward almost everything is great. Edward kind of acted like a creeper in the beginning, the way he scolded Bella for tripping and the way he just walked away after blaming his eye color change on the ""flourescents"".  And the girl who plays Alice is perfect for Alice. Like seriously. You may want to read the book first, because parts were a little confusing to my friend who didn't read the books, but this was a great movie.",1
122," The movie did exactly what Vampires do, suck. The only reason it made as much money as it did is because of their millions of loyal fans who have read the book plus the girls who have swooned over Pattinson since his appearance in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Overall, the film is funny, though unintentional, and has ruined the idea and fear people have had for vampires for many generations of young tween girls.",0
123," Twilight is spectacular .. although it has its downs, and i know every movie adaptation is not hat same as the book .. twilight goes for high!! sure thing, it's in the box office although there are negative reviews .. We love it!!",1
124, Terrible acting... people in the theatre were laughing at the acting.,0
125," The movie will probably satisfy fans, but will not do much to attract those who have not yet read the book.",0
126,"this movie was verry porly made, the acting was not the best, the makeup looked obviously way overdone. it looked like a low budget film. the setting was not belevable. I beleve that the director does not demand more of the actors, because when you have a demanding director you can get the worst actors to look like the best. the story draged on too long, and felt boring, the vampires acted way too depressing, and sure a little depresing is okay but they way over did it. in one ocassin I saw the main character who is not suposed to be in derect sunlight ouside in a cloud free sunny day,their is no way that this group of teenagers could have gone to a normal school without raising some crazy suspicions. alot of girls went to see the  movie, but it was the book that made them go.",0
127,"A lot of build up and a BIG let down!!! I have read all four books and I was really disappointed!!! The acting was terrible, there was no real connection between the two main characters(Edward and Bella). The almost love scene was cheesy and the makeup and special effects were awful. Don't waste the money for a ticket.",0
130," The only things that I felt was good in the movie, was the music and the laughs. Edward, Jasper, Alice, Bella and Jacob all looked.. wrong. The acting was okay at best and the scenes where the vampire used their 'superpowers' were horrible.",0
131, Twilight was amazing!! I saw it six times so far from its first showing. It went along great with the book. Even though there was some add ins that were not in the book but i still loved it!!!,1
132," Twilight, the film that keeps on giving. But the question is whether the audience wants what this film has to offer. The dialogue is poor at best and utterly atrocious if not. The script feels as if it was written by an 8 year old with a vocabulary of around 25 words: Edward: do you like the rain? Bella: no i don't like the rain, i don't like anything cold and wet (worth noting these abysmal actors stutter their way through the lines, straining at an attempt to portray high school love, but frequently missing the mark and just showing themselves to be poor actors) The plot is nonsensical and horrendous, the support cast don't help at all. And did i mention, the dialogue is awful. Gets a three for the scenes which weren't utterly appalling, and for the unintentionally witty lines (see above) and my personal favourite: Edward: hold on spider monkey (aimed at Bella) not spider girl, or spider woman, or even spider lady, no..... spider monkey!",0
134," Well, it sucked. The only thing good about the movie was that it managed to be better than the book. Except, even this triumph was unintentional: the script is so awkward at points I ended up laughing out loud at the most random, inopportune times. If you are a teenaged girl, however, you will love the movie. Shame on you.",0
135," Enjoyed this movie. Story-line was true to the book and edited out the teenage angst, The fight scenes could have been better.",1
136, It's not a perfect movie. But it shows a great love that goes beyond the body. It's a deep and truly feeling of love. And we need that ilusion.We need love letters. The eyes show more than a kiss.,1
138," I saw this movie because why not? I generally like things vampire, so I went to see it. I thought it was pretty good. An interesting spin on the vampire theme. I particularly enjoyed how they spent so much time on the developing relationship; you always want more of that in a movie - but instead they focus too much on the action parts. They did it right with this movie. You must remember that the book is told from the viewpoint of Bella, and a lot of the book is her thoughts. How do you get that on screen? It's difficult, and I believe they made a very decent attempt at it. They couldn't capture everything from the book so they captured the characters ""journey"" fairly accurately. I have since read the book as well as the second book, and I will be reading the third over the next day or so. It's not the most amazing litterature ever but it's fun to read and it's an interesting story. The story isn't only enjoyable to teenagers. I just turned 30 on the 20th and I thought it was good.",1
139," The book was better (isn't it always), but the movie was sooooooo good!",1
140," Twilight really really sucks. I saw a monkey acting better than this...this...well...THIS. The only thing i liked is Clair De Lune song, but only that.",0
141," Possibly the most laughable attempt at either a romance or a vampire film. Aside from the obviously laughable effects(high speed piggy back?) and the combination of awkward acting and a stale script leaves nothing else but some stock footage for the north american tourist board. The actors shuffle and mope their way though this overly long film. I am sure the frothing Twilight fans will just keep bumping this rating, but nothing can excuse this dire epic. Comparing it to Lost Boys is also faintly ridiculous as the humour in Lost Boys was intended, any humour derived from Twilight is sadly unintentional.",0
142," Utter rubbish from start to finish. I guess if you are a 12 year old girl (and wrote this) then you might like it. It sucked (whilst having no teeth, no plot, no worthy dialogue or redeeming values at all) The worst hour and a half of 2008.",0
143," Book much better. Not enough graphics, her acting not very good and he should of kept his accent. They skipped so much that if you didn't read the book you would be lost. Hope movie 2 has better graphics like Harry Potter did.",0
144," The writer obviously didn't think about the affect her writing, let alone her movie, would cause her reader/watchers. Her vampires were so obvious. They didn't try to mix, they stayed as a group. Everyone loves Bella the moment they see her. She has a vampire watching her sleep, which is considered romantic. Her vampires sparkle. The only reason I'm giving it a 1 is because James was a decent vampire.",0
145," This movie was so bad. I laugh all the time. I just don't get what people like about it. the bad acting, the horrible makeup, the emberresing dialog or the monky like moves?",0
146," There's nothing extraordinary about this movie, the fangirls who are in love with E.C. have never experienced romance in their lives.",0
147," This film was really poor, for a vampire film to not use a correct definition of a vampire is a deadly sin; this made the movie as uncompelling to me as possible, there is a difference between innovating and redefining, and twilight crossed the redefining line. A vampire is not a vampire just because it sucks blood; leeches and mosquitos suck blood too. It could of been a lot more appealing with a better cast, Rob said himself in an interview that he wished it had more violence, he's not the right man for the job; someone more sensitive and with a better hold on romance would have been better. I'm finding it hard to find good things to say, but its just too cheesy to comment on, one thing I did like was the small role played by Bella's father(Billy Burke) and Alice(Ashley Greene) but I feel hard to give these value as they are both established actors.",0
148," First off, who do they have rating these movies; for these magazines and newspapers? ""Burn after reading"" got a score of 63, and ""Twilight"" got a score of 56. I watched Burn after reading in the theater, and I put it in my top 10 worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. Conversely, I very much enjoyed Twilight. I liked the music, camera angles, scenery, and the actors/supporting actors performed very well. All in all, I was entertained and left wanting more. For that I give this movie a 8-1/2 out of 10. Oh! did I mention that all the girls in this movie are pretty HOTT!, Mostly Bella, and the 2 Cullen sisters. =]",1
149, This is the best movie i had seeen ! i love this movieee!,1
150, The most epic movie since Titanic! But the acting wasn't all that great.,1
151," I read the book because of how much I loved the movie! The only reason that I gave it an eight is because the film didn't have enough budgeting for better visual effects. I think that it is sad that we live in a world where even our fictional characters are stereotyped. Just because someone a long time ago said that vampires are supposed to brun in sunlight and can only live off human blood then no one else's idea of a vampire is acceptable now? I guess all aliens are supposed to be green with black eyes and big heads too. Well there goes all the alien movies ever made. The point was to be different and not copy everyone else's ideas. You don't have to like the movie, but at least give some respect to the writer for stepping outside the box.",1
152," Absolute urination on all that is vampires, a horrible love story about sparkly emotionless vampires. AVOID.",0
153," The only real value I can see in this movie is if the series is popular enough to spawn a few sequels, so viewers can look back and realize how far the later ones have come. The special effects are barely hidden, as is the value of our female lead. I am tempted to call her a heroine, but aside from rushing into a an obvious trap to trade her life for her family, she never does anything especially heroic. She praises her friend as a strong independent woman while showing little sign of being such herself. Perhaps I just don't see it as a man, but Edward does not seem to be as ""beautiful"" as he is described. The re-imagination of the vampire legends does allow the story to avoid certain classic pitfalls of vampire media, but Meyer seems to be intent on keeping the general convention of women intact. That is to say, if they do not have some supernatural powers, they are pathetic. At least Bella shows some desire to become a vampire toward the end.",0
154," I absolutely adore this movie. I thought they couldn't do any better! If they could do anything better, it would to make the movie longer. Add more parts that are in the book too. Thanks for reading! I love Twilight! I love Robert Pattinson!!!!",1
155, I hate this movie. It's just terrible. I hate when Twilight fangirls/boys think it's so great. They obviously will never be able to unbiasly judge a film.,0
156," Great movie. Ive seen a lot of vampire movies, however, this was one of the best. Characters are well played and the story is intriguing. Looking forward for the next movie.",1
157," OMG!!! Twilight is so amazing, how it shows how two totally different people can fall in love and no matter what the danger is they are in it together!!! I soooooooooooooo love this movie and the book. The book is so much better because you can here bellas thoughts and stuff, but WOW I love it. There is so much love between this human and Vampire, I also love how in the book, they go through so much she gets bit by James and she gets amost bitten by Edwards brother Jasper, and then he leaves her and she is so so sad and then she finds out edward thinks shes dead and trys to kill himself so she faces the Voltrouri and saves him!!!!!! Everything about Twilight makes me want to sceam in happiness lol. ",1
158, I absolutely LOVED the book. and the movie sucked real bad in comparison. Hopefully the next one will be better.,0
159," Very interesting,good movie.I have to say that I'm glad I seen it at the picture show and not at full price.",1
160," Just an awful, awful movie. It's clear that if you don't fall within the 12-16 teen girl range that this movie targets you won't find it at all entertaining or bearable. I had to stop watching half way through.",0
161," This movie is badly directed and has some of the worst acting i have seen in years. There are worst movies yes... Glitter for example but that was in theaters for less than a week before most theaters pulled it. Twilight is a small nudge above that but it's cult like following boosted it's popularity and box office numbers. Any movie that actually has a budget bigger than what's in your bank account is better than this movie. The lack of character development, bad acting, bad special effects and horrible directing and shooting simply makes this one of the worst ""wide-release"" movies ever. Simply put... If the books never existed and this was just another vampire movie... it would have lost money and you wouldn't be reading this right now.",0
162, The books were Great! The Movie was to poorly directed. It should have never made it to a screen to be viewed. In my opinion,0
164, Twilight stayed as close as possible to the book. It could have only gotten better with a bigger budget.,1
165," Ridiculously bad. I mean, sure, people are bound to like this movie, especially the insane Twilight fanatics who are blinded with their own obsession with the books. I think my favorite part of the movie was probably all the special effects. I literally couldn't stop myself from laughing. Not only were the effects disappointing, but the acting as well. You with think with such a cult following, they would attempt to find some decent actors. The girl who plays Bella couldn't be more mediocre, and Edward...well at least he has his looks and white makeup to support him through life. Let's just say I'm not a fan.",0
167," Mainstream crap churned out to please people of ages... well, it wasn't really made for anyone- just people stupid enough to be convinced by a mormon that ""vampires are perfectly normal people"" or that a vampire doesn't drink blood or kill, it just has glitter skin in the sun... If you went to see this film, consider yourself on a warning.",0
168," This was such a good movie. Just about everyone I know saw this movie multiple times. I saw the movie before I read the book, and they did a very good job at staying pretty close to the novel.",1
169," I was surprised. Prior to watching this movie I had heard of the twilight saga, but had never read it. I watched the movie with expectation. Some parts of the movie were exceptional, (needed more scenes that Edward and Bella interact) but the scenes where they did were nice. I do believe they casted the role of Edward right on the money, but the role of Bella needed to be rethought. Edward projected the role of a repressed vampire extremely well, but Bella just seemed off the mark, but over all I enjoyed the movie. After watching the movie I decided to try the books, (as I am a reader I am always looking for new material to read) I absolutely loved the books, wish there were more coming, but after reading twilight the book, I so disappointed in the movie. They needed to include so much more in the movie that was in the book, in verse they should have included the treetop scene in the book, that was a highly romantic scene in the movie, and told alot about how Edward and Bella interacted with one another, more interested in conversation then sex, although sexual tension was there, but wanted to know each other at that point was so much more important to them. Over all my experience was good, but please allow it to follow the book more. Just my two cents, thanks for reading.",1
170," Holy... Well, let's stop on this. I haven't seen a Movie! It was just a set of separate (and often ridiculous) scenes, not linked together at all! It's a complete waste of time, money and nerves! Even visuals more like chinese action-movies with all those ""rope-jumping""! What's this?! I hate it. Really. P.S. Girls, who watched ""this"" with me, wasn't excited too. Who needs movies like this, then?",0
171, By far the worst movie ever made in the history of mankind. Biggest waste of 2 hours ever created.,0
173," The book was great. It may not be a literary jewel but it was an excellent romantic story. I was very disappointed with the movie. Kirsten Stewart can't act to save her life. The movie was not true to the book at all. I for one cannot see the cullens riding in public transportation of any kind, even a school bus. The book had so much potential as a movie that I hope someone does a good remake.",0
175," The moment I saw a preview of this film, I knew it was going to suck, but I was still willing to give it a chance, so I went and saw it. Wow, it sure did suck. The film is atrocious and fails to deliver anything that a romance or vampire film should have. It has boring, 1-dimensional, cardboard characters who have some of the worst acting abilities (Especially the guy who plays Edward) I've ever seen in a film. The dialogue was really bad, thanks to the cliched, hackneyed script. The music soundtrack is horrible, and stands as one of the worst film soundtracks I have ever heard. The CGI effects were utterly appalling, and I've seen better CGI in the 90's. The film also does not meet certain requirements vampire films are supposed to have, such as the fact the vampires sparkle like diamonds in the sunlight. I don't mind if a few things get changed up a bit in a vampire film, but vampires die in sunlight. It's been a requirement for the last few centuries. By the way, whoever says this is the best romance since Romeo and Juliet is an idiot.",0
176," Twilight is, quite frankly, a film in which only 16 year old goths will enjoy. While the film does at times have some decent Cinematography, the plot is over exaggerated, the acting is poor, the writing is uninspired and the film at times looks just plain ugly, making Twilight, in my opinion, one of the worst films of the year thus far.",0
177," Just a dreadful, dreadful movie. Vampires playing baseball, flying? Come on, at least stay close to the confines of conventional vampire lore. The movie started off as if it might actually be going somewhere, but never does (anywhere interesting at least). Rent one of the Underworld movies instead of watching this.",0
178, I've followed the books sighed up onto the website and to tell a lie twilght is my favorite saga and im a guy! to someone who has read all the books and hyped the movie it was less of a thrill but give it justice and hey with Newmoon round the corner who nows.,1
180," This movie is cool, cant really complain, i havent read the book yet.. hahaha... but i will.. is a cool movie.. my girl liked it too.. haha, well, more than me.",1
181," I give it a 2 because at least it had all of the characters and the adaptation was somehwat accurate. I was extremely dissapointed with Twilight. I've read all the books, and this ones the best. But believe me, it is even worse than ""Eragon""! You might think that's a joke, it ain't. This is probably the boringest movie I have ever seen. It felt like poor-quality entertainment all the way through. Like everything is in there, but it would have been nice if they'd try to entertain us, then make a daring epic. Twilight isn't a daring epic!!!!! It's a chick Flick!!! For gods sakes how can they get that wrong?",0
182," I have read all 4 of the books and though i expected this movie to be a huge let dow, because after all, its hard to live up to the book, it did suprisingly well. The acting has some flaws from time to time but the movie overall was amaziing! I think its great because anyone can watch it and fall in love with the story even if they haven't read the book.",1
183,"Overall, it was fairly good.  If you read the book, there were some parts missing others added in, and some things that left you going ""Wait, what?""  If you didn't read the book, it was a good movie.  I find it strange how the vampires don't burn in sunlight, or when they're near a cross.  They can see their reflections too.  The jumping around looked very wired, as it was too straight and incredibly unnatural (we're talking about vampires here).  There was absolutely no reason why this couldn't be PG.  The ""one scene of sensuality"" is where Bella dn Edward kiss on a bed, and the fighting is overall a rather big ""meh"".   The acting was mediocre; no standouts there.  Pretty much a good movie, but there is room for imporvement.",1
184,"I have read the book 3 times, and was very disappointed, most of the actors didn't fit the charaters, the acting was mostly bad, imporant info was left out which I think will make the next movies difficult, worthless things were added...not impressed. They relied to much on teeny-boppers looking for eye candy and not enough on the actual story which could have been an amazing movie if they had stuck to the book. Didn't appear the screen writer had read the other books since items that become very important in the next book were left out, rushed through, or changed dramatically.",0
185," Twilight was excellent. I saw it yesterday and plan to go again. The movie it quite different from the book and as a movie I think it is a must see. However, I don",1
186," This movie was amazing. Although some parts were quite different from the actual film, it kept you watching. It interested you enough to want to keep watching. It was awesome.",1
187,"A High School Play has better acting than this.  Make that a Middle School !  The audience was actually laughing at how stupid this was.  Save your hard earned money to buy a new book.  Let's see a vampire that is out in daylight, doesn't bite his victims, and looks in the mirror.  And to think we all thought that Dracula was the exact opposite.  Live and Learn!",0
188,"I'm a big fan of the books. However, the movie did not satisfy me. Harry Potter was great and the Lord of the Rings amazing. What happened with this movie? Well, some of the supporting actors were stiff, the cinematography was awesome and I loved the music, but the screenplay was the killer. The screenplay did not adequately build the romance nor the suspense and left me wanting so I read the book for a fourth time.",1
189,"I loved this book, but I went into the movie with low expectations because of the previews. Alas, it didn't even live up to those low expectations. This really is the worst movie I have ever seen. Now I haven't seen Plan 9 from Outer Space, so it may not be the worst movie ever made, but it's pretty close.",0
190,"Omg, Twlight was Amazing =] ! Ive never read the books but my sisters have and they said the movie&th e book are very similiar.Twlight was amazing, the guy that plays in Harry Potter he was incridibly HAWT! I was very fascinated with the movie, i plan on going to see the movie again this weekend because it was soo good. A few of my friends saw the movie and they were also very fascinated with the movie. Im telling you the seris of the movies are going to be wonderful and im looking forward to seeing it.",1
191,"Just like the rest of the girls in America, I was sucked into the cult of Stephanie Meyer. I read all the borrowed books and even bought Break Dawn. I fully enjoyed the series for what it was: fluff. The problem with some people's view on the film is that they are going to see it expecting gold, or on the other end of the spectrum, crap. This movie fully lived up to my expectations and actually a little higher. Yes I know many people think that Pattinson was miscast and Stewart was ""too pretty"" for the role of Bella but who cares? Their line delivery was fantastic. Even one of my straight male friends was laughing out loud at points. I will agree however that if you didn't read the book(s) you didn't get the full (for lack of a better word) ""experience"" of the movie. But that doesn't mean it deserves a 2 out of 10 rating. You don't go to Disaster Movie expecting to be floored by their original jokes and Oscar worthy acting do you? Then don't go into Twilight expecting to see Cohen film and you won't be disappointed.",1
192,"Bram Stoker must be turniing in his grave!!!!!!!But I know I'm not the intended audience, I never read t he book, I'm not a tween, I'm a guy and I have a brain, it might as well been brought to us by Disney. All in all just a buch of pretty white kids pretending to act. totally messed up the Vampire genre",0
195, A generally good adaptation of the book. Acting flaws dampen but don't destroy a charming story.,1
196, Definitely a good movie in that it leaves you wanting more of Edward and anticipating its sequel.,1
197," Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting sucked, the girl wasn't pretty, and they were hardly even vampires! Not to mention normally when I think vampire I think action but this movie had none.",0
198," I agree with Joe, People were laughing at the acting from expecting scenes. The movie seemed like it was made by two producers. The first half, i have to say, was really horrible. The acting, music cues, camera shots. It was really horrible. Then the second half everything got much better. The actors were more real, it just got much much better. Making up for the first half.",1
200," 20 billion percent better than the book. I probably just made myself a few (thousand) enemies. I actually really liked this movie. I thought it was well done, and I liked that they made it less boring than the book.",1
201," I went to see it opening day. I thought the acting was quite good on most accounts, but Robert Pattinson's make-up was very disturbingly gothic-like at the beginning. they didn't change much from the book, and I really don't care what the critics said: The crtitcs gave a average score of 91/100 for Wall-E, but I found that movie terribly boring because there was no action or build to a climax. You were just waiting for something to happen, and epic battle or confrontation of some sort, but nothing happened. It was exciting and romantic without being cheesy, and captured my attention from start to finish.",1
202," I thought the film was GREAT. The book is always better but the movie came relatively and surprisingly close. I was more than satisfied with the turn out, especially to have seen the characters come to life on film aside from using your imagination when reading the books was a sheer delight. Imagination and appreciation goes along way when a film comes close to the book. Can't wait for part 2, and I believe it willl just get better with each film. People tend to forget that this is a love STORY which totally brought me back to my days of PUPPY LOVE and anticipation of that first KISS, its also got plenty action. Its not intended to be a TERMINATOR FLICK, it has to keep the element of love aswell. I think it has a great combination of both as an intro to the SAGA and Bella's and Edwards love, I also hope that the element remains and that the action does indeed intensify as the story / saga thickens!!!",1
203, This movie brings out the best parts of the book. There is no way that someone can be disappointed unless they were expecting a word-by-word replay of the books. HELLO PEOPLE!!! A 500 + page book can't be put into 2 hours. This is a MUST SEE!!!,1
204," I loved the book because it was oddly addictive (although the writing was nothing spectacular) but expected the movie to be absolutely terrible, especially after seeing the trailers. The acting was horrendous, and my friend and I were laughing the entire time at their interpretations of the book. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen, Absolutely devoted fans of the book that think this movie is actually good are in denial.",0
205," This movie is dreadful, but almost to a fine art. This movie has definitely destroyed one of the most fearful and sadistic monsters and turned it into a shiny metaphor about not splunking. the ironic thing is depending on the girl you take to this movie; you might be able to get carnal with her.",1
207," Why spend so much on James/Victoria/Laurent when there are so many interesting passages and dialogues that were not shown, or were extensively modified? Either way, Pattinson and Stewart are excelent. Also the kissing scene, the Cullen's entrance in the cafeteria and the ballet studio sequence are worth everything.",1
208," Maybe its because i'm a teenage girl who loves robert pattinson but i loved this movie. i thought it was actually better than the book which in my opinion is a great story but poorly written. The movie strayed from the book for a few parts and for the better. i thought kristen stewart was a fantastic bella, and i dont think anyone wants to read about my complete obsession with robert pattinson so i will abstain from mentioning it. the film made me smile and it was an interesting love story,but i can definitely understand how some people wouldnt like it. my only problems with the movie were some of the corny lines and the ""special effects"" werent exactly state of the art. but i think that will improve in the next film due to the huge success of twilight. overall i think you either loved or hated this movie and i happen to love it. robert pattinson was great, the dialogue(spidermonkey) was not his fault and i thought he did it better than anyone else could have and he was successful in making almost every girl want a vampire boyfriend. his songs in the movie were fantastic, he is an amazing musician. moral of the story: if your a girl who likes love stories and hot guys- you will love it. if not- then go see another movie and stop making fun of it.",1
209," Adaptação fiel de um excelente livro , resultando em um excelente filme . Ganha pontos pela ousadia de quebrar a tradição sobre vampiros e por criar uma espetacular fantasia romântica . Maravilhoso ! ( Faithful adaptation of an excellent book, resulting in an excellent film. Earn points by daring to break the tradition about vampires and to create a spectacular romantic fantasy. Wonderful! )",1
211," This has to be one of the worst teen lip flicks I've ever been forced to watch. I am sorry I let my sister drag me to this. I made the mistake of reading Stephanie Meyer's writing before, and I won't make the mistake of seeing any more of her movies.",0
212,"This movie had no character development, and no passion. It was a complete flop compared to the books. And what was with the stuttering during the hospital scene? Kristen sucks in this movie. She doesn't even capture 1/4 of the essence of Bella. Save your money and read the books again.",0
214," Am I mistaken, or did I just read comparisons to ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Lost Boys."" Are some of you daft or just mentally challenged? OR can you at least admit that you were never able to grasp the world-renown play or cinematic classic and got a ""C"" in your High School literature classes. Holy Hell, how aggravating it is that some of you represent the United States in critical thinking.",0
215," What a waste of my time. Bella is a weak, shallow woman in an imbalanced relationship. Edward (if he wasnt ""hot"" would be seen as a creepy, geriatric pedofile and a stalker. The ""vampires"" are so unvampiric its just sad that Meyers is allowed to even use the term for her creatures. Lots of boring angsty staring and laughable dialog. Give this a miss.",0
216," The fact that this movie is being compared to Romeo and Juliet in any context other than to exemplify everything that is wrong with Twilight is a sign our culture is slowly dying. The series was a horrible, pathetic creation vulgarly posturing as a romance, luring young girls and disillusioned middle-aged women (and men) into its abominable bosom, whispering false promises of eternal love and devotion.",0
217," There's supposed to be chemistry between the two characters, I didn't notice any. And some emotion would've been nice. Maybe some sound/music in the first half would've entertained me and my friend also. Unless you like Robert Pattison I don't think you'll like the film!",0
218," The acting; terrible. The writing; terrible. The cinematography; terrible. The directing; terrible. Though, working off of a misogynistic, glittering, terribly written, encyclopedia slap happy, no character development (Except when Bella's monster baby bursts out of the womb and the only way for her to survive is to be turned into a vampire, which then she becomes automatically perfect and beautiful. That's the only time she changes, which is in the last book) teen pleasure novel, it's gonna be bad either way. And no good director in their right mind would direct such a terrible series. I'd find it funny if a good director like David Lynch or Woody Allen would direct this. Quite humorous, indeed.",0
219," I think Twilight is the best and it is such a thrilling romance!! like a awome new version of Romeo and Juliet....only better, cause it has GOOD vampires!!",1
220," I believe this movie marks the death of the Bramstoker vampire and the nosferatu in general. The chemistry between characters is awkward and plastic, the story line is simple, and judging by the books fan base, one of whom was quoted as saying ""I like the books but these reading things is hard"", it's good the story line is simple otherwise it'd lose them too quickly. A sick twisted affair based on a half hearted book, compared to Romeo and Julliet by what I seriously hope are the worst trolls in the history of the internet.",0
221," I read the book and saw the movie, but it wasn't that great. The book wasn't the best, and had some major flaws, and the movie adaptation was absolutely horrendous. Not only did it have terrible special effects, the actors were disappointing in their performances. Perhaps the second movie will be better, but not by much.",0
222, Ridiculous. Sappy. Like a bad MTV video or after school special. Really geared for teenage girls.,0
225," This movie is so lame and stupid, with hardly any plot at all. It damages the definition of a vampire!!! Vampires are supposed to be evil creatures who suck human blood. And Edward Cullen?! He ""sparkles"", DOESN'T drink human blood, and falls in love with Bella!! Stupid. The only reason some people like this is because of the cheesy romance in it.",0
226, Twilight is a very bad movie. While was watching it I felt so weird because every five seconds you see kirsten stewart and robert pattinson staring at each other awkwardly. Just look at the picture on the top of the page. Although it did keep my interest through out the movie.,0
227, I love robert and twilight actors. i love the movie and books.HAkeem your so mean i understand your opionon but i think they did a really good job lets face it I have a crush on rob and taylor and well you know thyre hot and always will be hot now you were hot like them which your probably not. then f off,1
228, It was just amazing! The romance in this movie was beautiful!,1
229," A beautiful love-story ! Good performance for Kirsten Stewart & Robert Pattinson ... Compliments at Hardwicke, great director !",1
230," I read the book seris and i thought it was good but not excelent, but i really thought this was a good movie. I think it apeals more to girls and people who have read the book, but i do know some guys that saw the movie and said it was really good. So i do recomend.",1
231, Twilight was a very fast paced movie comparing it with the book. The movie should have been longer since fans were hoping for an exact or close to exact replica of the book. If the scenes were longer then it wouldn't seem like a longer version of a preview. What was great about the movie were the actors and how they took they're rolls with perfection. I am a big fan of all things twilight. Thank you.,1
232," It seemed half the audience in the theater had already read the book and had already made up their minds--the rest of us came to mock it. Between the awful score, makeup, special effects, dialogue and (the worst of all) directing, there was no shortage of opportunities to laugh out loud (and everyone did) during what I assume should have been dramatic sequences. Maybe this will appeal to die-hard fans of the book, but certainly not anyone who appreciates any kind of coherent cinematography or character depth. I can say with a high degree of certainty that we won't see another movie this bad for a very long time.",0
235,"People tell either it's the best movie ever made, others say it's one of the worst.  And for those ones who hate it usually tell me they'd rather watch 'Eragaon', (that crappy book adaptation of the excellent bestseller).  I thought that was a joke.  I was laughing up to the point of seeing Twilight Saturday afternoon with my friends.  IT""S AWFUL!  Don't see it!  Don't waste your time or money on it, I am going to regret seeing this for the rest of my life.  yes, it is AMAZINGY OVERRATED!  And so bad, and 2 times worse than Eragon.  Believe me, if you plan on seeing this, if your a fan, plan on walking out in tears, for those who don't care, you will have a grudge against Twilight forever.",0
236,"I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a 33 year old woman who loved the book, but director Catherine Hardwicke  gave the movie an edge I wasn't expecting but found refreshing. It didn't pander to those who wanted something glossy with cgi effects. The story wasn't about the action anyway, it was about the relationship. Loved it.",1
237,"Absolute garbage... It's nearly impossible to relate to ANY of the main characters, they screwed up the entire vampire concept, and the female lead is dumb as a sack of bricks. Not only that, but their relationship did nothing for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm normally a sucker for this kind of thing, but this movie just left me with a feeling of disgust.",0
239,"They did an excellent job capturing the book in this movie. at no point did i find myself wanting to scream at the screen ""no way! that isn't supposed to happen"" like with some of the harry potter movies. i agree they totally suck at the speed effects, having them run fast could have been done (and has been done before) so much better.",1
241,"From around half way through onwards people were laughing.  I wasn't sure if it was a comedy or not.  That's 2 hours of my life I won't get back, unfortunately.  The acting was poor and it was sooo slow.  My wife enjoyed it - mostly because she spent the entire movie drooling over the lead actor.",0
242, Great.,1
243,"Don't think about the book. While the book is amazing, honestly what movie has ever truly stuck chapter to chapter to a book, few and if done many times boring. Yeah I was concerned about the actors, they just didn't seem to fit, but the movie was better than I had expected, you could see contacts lenses in a few scenes and the paleness of everyone was funny, the romantic parts were sweet, and I enjoyed many of parts.",1
244,"First of all, I went into the movie right after reading through the full series, from page one of Twilight right through to the last page of Breaking Dawn (Uninterupted it took me 22 Hours, and I've now been up for 32.) However; I did not go into the movie with any expectations. After sitting through the movie, I can tell you without a doubt that it was totally worth it, and is easily in my top ten movies of all time, however, there were a few problems I had. First of all, the movie seemed to rush through everything. It didn't give you a lot of time to think between major plot pieces, and that bumped the score down a little for me. I don't like to be bombarded with too much information too quickly as you never seem to be able to grasp it all. Secondly, I didn't think that they were true enough to Edward's character, leaving him a bit more nervous than he'd been portrayed in the book. It didn't bother me too much, but since the book was that way, I don't see why the movie couldn't portray him as charismatically unsure as well. Nervous and sketchy was a little off the mark. Lastly, I didn't think that it was long enough. It could have used about twenty minutes or so more of padding, the little scenes, like the whole 'La Push Beach Excursion"" could have been lengthened, as well as making the first woods scene a little more true to the book. Now, that said, I believe that any true Twilight fan will really like this movie, as it's a good representation of the book, save for the small details and slightly rushed plot. This movie gets an 8.5/10 from me, and even as a twenty year old guy, I highly recommend it. (No, really.)",1
245,"I really expected this movie to totally ruin it for me since I've read all the books.  When I watched it, though, I was blown away.  Nothing about it was bad.  Every change they made was for the better.  Every character played their part well.  I was highly impressed.  Can't wait for the sequels, cuz there will be.  Just look on IMDb.",1
247, No movie is ever as good as the book - that being said I think it's a good movie and anyone who has read the books will enjoy seeing the characters come to life on screen.,1
248, @Steve K and those that share his opinion The whole damn point of the movie is that its about teen-ness and FOR teengirls (thats the target audience) It isn't meant to be a vampire movie. Go watch Dracula if you want some real vampire. Or confessions of a teenage vampire or something.,1
249," Hard to follow at first, then once you learn to understand the way the characters act it makes much more sense and becomes a more enjoyable movie.",1
250," Bella(Kristen Stewart) is a vegetarian. At lunch with dad, the pale girl orders a garden burger; with her paler boyfriend, she orders a mushroom omelete. Is Bella an animal rights activist, or does she avoid eating things with faces for health reasons? In other words, how much does she have in common with her vampire beau? Edward(Robert Pattison) is a vegetarian, too, relative to the fact, however, that vampires need blood for their ongoing survival. Like his brood, Edward only eats animals. Since he's immortal, a four- instead of a two-legged diet, in all likelihood, is an ethical stand that he and the Cullen vampires undertook. For sure, the acronym sucks: VETP(Vampires for the Ethical Treatment of People). Regardless of the basis behind Bella's meatless diet, both boy and girl have this in common: discipline. Bella is the steak that all vegetarians crave when they bite down on some soy-based product. Edward will have to eat a lot of beavers(no pun intended) in order to get through those long, cold nights up there in the northwest. In ""Twilight"", although no sex occurs between Edward and Bella, the hunky bloodsucker does sink his choppers into the girl's arm. Bella wants him to go all the way. Thankfully, for her sake, Edward has a level head. He unlocks his jaws before any damage can be done. There will be a time, though, when the gentleman vampire won't be able to abstain from his natural impulse to suck her brains out. Bella might get her wish, after all. She's so sure that her future lies with this post-Goth adonis; he's her first love, seemingly. But if Bella finally becomes immortal like her beloved, how will she feel about Edward in a hundred years? Maybe Edward knows this. The girl he chooses will be inextricably linked to him forever. They need to go on a date. None of this flying above the trees nonsense, like ""Crouching Vampire, Hidden Arizona Girl"". Dinner and a movie, perhaps?",1
251, I loved the movie. The beginning is mot the best but it gets better every second.,1
252," this movie is nothing more than Hollywood cashing in on a book that did nothing more than put some generic teenage girls wet dream on paper. it was thrown together, sloppy, and is getting a score far exceeding what it deserves because there are thousands of 14 year old girls who sat at their computers for days looking for anywhere and everywhere they could squeal about how ""Edward is the only real guy left"" (a notion I shouldn't even have to point out as a contender for the stupidest thing ever said), etc. and have given it 10's even while admitting it was not as good as they had hoped. and so, even if it is a harsher rating than it perhaps deserves, no matter how bad it is, I plant myself as a counter balance against all the brainless, fad crazed votes this movie has received.",0
253, I absolutely love this movie. My favorite was the baseball scene. I don't know why critics think Wall-E is so wonderful when Twilight deserves the attention. Catherine Hardewick SHINES!!!,1
254, I havent read the book but I did enjoy the movie and understood what it was all about. Those who wanted even more perhaos did enjoy movies that made barely 10 million dollars on its first weekend. People who didnt enjoy it are dead and numb.,1
255, Twilight is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I absolutley loved it.,1
256, This was the most awesome movie ever! I was a little worried to watch it because i thought that it would e totally lame but it was so awesome and i just loved it but i did wonder if there was something more going on with belle and edward off cameras!! ala in all it was a great movie that i love!! i could watch it again and again and that is why i give it a ton i would give it a hunderd if possible!!!! I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!,1
257," Great story Line, everything Clicked at The End, Very Enjoyable.",1
258," Bad. Bad. Horrible. I didn't even sit to keep watching like 1/4 the way in. This movie just proves no matter what that anything Twilight is a horrible, abyissmal blight to all that is literature and film. A plot that has less meat on it then a model, unrealistic characters that don't have any substance, and horrible screnewritting/dialoge. The only people who could possibly like it are diehard fans who don't even know what a good book is.",0
259," This movie, along with the book, was not all that great. I found it annoying that there was no background for the characters and that Bella did not do or say things that a normal person would. Also, the so-called vampires in this movie were nothing but people who were strong and people who could fly. What happened to the vampires that suck humans' blood and can't go out in sunlight. Twilight recieves far more praise than it deserves and is one of the worst movies of 2008.",0
260," Of couse, if you're a fan of the book, you are most likely going to enjoy the movie adaptation of what is, in my opinion, one of the worst movies of the year. I decided to watch the movie for a few laughs but in the end, I regretted it. The whole series in general dulls the name of vampires because vampires don't go out in the day and vampires suck humans' blood. The dialouge is poor and the characters have absolutely no background. Bella doesn't even do or say things that a normal person would do. I can't find one good reason why teen fangirls that drool over Edward call this romantic. The romance in the movie is dull and is only normal high school life, something many believe to happen to very few people. It's hard to even watch a movie when the main character is the most annoying character. This piece of garbage recieves far more praise than it deserves and is a sorry excuse for ""an epic romance"".",0
261," This movie had high hopes but failed to meet them. Kristen Stewart, although she is young, did an awful job of acting. She was emotionless throughout almost the whole movie, expect when she received her new truck from Billy Black. Stewart would have been better as a role of a zombie in Zombieland. It would have been nice to see more of that energy consistent in the entire movie. Robert Pattinson, the male lead, was not as awful as his female counterpart but his performance was far from good. He showed glimmers of a strong character at the beginning and end of the film, but it would have been nice for the middle parts to be as strong so he could at least make up for what Stewart was lacking. The special effects were rushed and just plain cheesy. It was not believable at all. Overall the movie did stay true, or at least tried, to Stephanie Meyer's novel.",0
265,"It's movies like this that give Vampires a bad name and plus who gives Meyer the right to rewrite vampire history.... Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. Can't wait until the final film and people can forgot about it.",0
266,"Only the moronic fan-girls would like this **** excuse of a vampire film via ""Twilight."" The only thing they worry about is loving that **** slutty excuse for a woman Bella and continue on sucking on Edward's dick. This should be called **** and the sequels should also called: **** Saga: Failing ever harder then 10,000 BC. At least 10k BC can do a better job then this waste of money.",0
267,"I never see the worst cast. I read books( Twilight). I love that story, but when I see this film, I hate this film a see first 50 min. and I lost 50 min. of my life.",0
269,"I don't want to be mean or give extreme opinion toward a film, but for the twilight series I guess I break the role once. It is all about a chick falls in love with vampire, which doesn't even look as half as handsome as Leonardo Di Caprio, his face is whiter than MJ and yes you see the girl kisses a 500 years old vampire grandpa, but look like an 18 years old. Can anyone tell me what's the big deal in it?",0
270,"My big deal with this movie is that look so cheap, is so amateur... Special mention for the Kristen Stweart and Robert Pattinson, they are very good at  sucking  acting. And overall is so boring... plane",0
273,One of the worst sagas ever made.,0
274,Oh God why? This movie is pathetic from start to finish. It's obvious that there's no artistic value involved in this and it was just made to make money but did it really have to be this bad?,0
278,"The bullsh*t that started 4 more years, and of course, 5 more ""films"" that caused distress and mental pain to many. Twilight is the reason people consistently complain that Hollywood is all Vampires and Zombies.",0
279,"Why all the hate? Yes, it has stupid writing, the acting is mediocre, and the story is dumb but somehow interesting, the music for the movie is great, the atmosphere is terrific and some fight scenes are way too chilling, it is absolutely not a bad movie, but it is most definitely not near great movie.",1
283,"You call it movie, I call it cliche love story for desperate girls who think they have a shot with Taylor Lautner. Nothing good here at all Im disapointed with Taylor and Kristen they did great movies as kids/pre-teens/teens like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and Catch That Kid, then an overly hyped love story between phony vampires who dont act like vampires one bit, the only thing they do is, have pale skin. The effects are lazy,Im sure the book was better I didnt read it but they usually write better books then movies. If you want my advise if you a girl your probably gonna see it no matter what just to see shirtless Taylor or crappy love story, if your a guy your either going to see action (which isnt the best but isnt the worst), your girl dragged you there, you actually like it or you (excuse this but) gay.",0
285,"Let me just start off by saying, I knew this movie wasn't going to good one bit. Which honestly, is no surprise to me. But then again, this story isn't for teenage boys, it's for teenage girls. So if your a girl, you'll end up liking this movie. As far as the storyline goes its iffy, but when you put these characters in these situations, it just plumits into pure crap. Also, the actors can't save movie for crap. Overall, it's a terrible start to a saga from the ""beloved book series.",0
286,"This movie I simply awful.The worst performance I've ever seen. Specially when two of them are talking.If I could I would ask Stephenie Meyer that does she even know what a vampire is?It's a shame...",0

You got Tweens wanting to have a vampire boyfriend because they see this...this was horrible I wanted to put myself out of my misery sitting through this crap...I mean it really ruined vampires for our modern time no one remembers Count Dracula (originated from the real Vlad Dracula Tepes better known as Vlad the impaler 1431-1476 The prince of wallachia)...the person that wrote the stupid books made Romania's darkest icon of the classic vampire into a gushy tween romance crap... I was hoping since the ""actors"" do t deserve to be called actors, the story was a snore, amd envy thing else made me want to puke. Vampire don't sparkle when in the sun they burst into flame and die turning into ashes. They don't show mercy to other humans for their extreme thirst makes them the feared killers that can swallow your soul leaving your corpse a bloodthirsty minion of the count.....I wish the series died when the first film was released this isn't a ""vampire"" film it's a crappy made tween love story that made every girl in my 5th grade class want a vampire lover...I feel very bad for the unfortunate people that were dragged to this distasteful thing",0

The script is good ok thats the only thing good about this movie the vampire battling sequence effects are so terrible and you can tell this was fake or possibly used by a green screen  much as i hate the actors, actresses in this movie this is well ok i guess some of these people were mean't to play these characters . The Novel written by Meyer is weirdly entertaining in a good way, yes i know the girl does know how to write a book. Grade C+",1

310,"The only reason this film exists is to get the girls screaming for more, Twilight is absolute garbage and it baffles me on how big this movie's fan base is.",0
312,"'Twilight' is a tedious, dull and poor excuse for a ""romantic"" film, or just a film for that matter. The film, which is based off the novel written by Stephanie Meyer explores the relationship between a teenage girl, and a non-aging vampire and his reluctance to hurt her. The characters we meet include Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) who is moving to a little town called Forks with her father Charlie (Billy Burke), she starts a new day at a new high school where she becomes friends with a group of fun, outgoing teenagers and they tell her everything she needs to know about the school and the people who attend. She sees a fellow classmate at biology named Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), and there are many scenes of him just awkwardly staring at her just because he is in love... or something to that effect. Bella tries to understand why Edward is so uncomfortable to be around her, and why he is so reserved and withdrawn from everybody else, plus there is the suspicion of him disappearing from time to time without explanation. One day, Edward does something extraordinary and Bella couldn't believe her eyes, she tries to get answers from Edward, but he refuses to, instead he tries to make out that she is crazy, but she researches what she can in order to get a better understanding. One day, Edward does give her an insight to his origins of being a vampire, and they begin to understand each other. Nobody else, apart from Bella, knows about Edward's origins, and it remains that way for now. What makes this film bad is its slow pace, constant build-up to nothing, and the stiff performances, especially from our lead characters. The cinematography (by Elliot Davis) is also the least bit appealing to the eye. The constant pale colors and lack of anything visually appealing make this film dull, and almost lifeless. Nothing of remote interest seems to happen for a long period of time in this film. When something interesting does happen, my attention (and I'm sure many audience's attentions) already wandered off to the point where I just could not care anymore. The film is devoid of interest, the characters are bland, the cinematography is dull, the story is lifeless and the film is uneven and disjointed. The editing (by Nancy Richardson) is also very choppy, there are many scenes at the beginning that feel like they don't add up to anything. The story gets messed to the point of delusion and I found myself to be uninterested in anything that was going on, the film tries to be romantic and sweeping, but what we get instead are many moments where the two lead characters just stare at each other in montages, it just isn't exciting. Tedious, dull and lifeless.",0
313,"Good general idea, but very poor execution.  This movie contains a dire plot, razzie-worthy performances, and lifeless characters, literally.  Another Harry Potter wannabe gone wrong",0

Und die guten Vampire trinken Tierblut, sie töten also keine Menschen, um normal zu sein. Ja gut klingt ziemlich dumm, ist es auch. Die Schauspieltalente Kristen Stewart und Robert Pattinson starren sich die ganze Zeit an, weil das Liebe ausdrückt, aha. Sogar die Menschen in dem Film  sind so blass wie die Vampire, außer Taylor Lautner, denn der ist ein Wolf und auch er liebt Kristen Stewart, somit steht Kristen zwischen den beiden und hat anscheinend Gefühle für beide.(Namen aus dem Film werden nicht genannt, weil man alle Personen vergessen hat weil sie keine Persönlichkeit oder Seelen besitzen.

I will say briefly: Stephenie Meyer - the enemy of mankind , which you want to sue at the Nuremberg trials .",0
319,"the movie is gender biased. why did the director name the girl Bella Watson, the words used in the movie are gender biased. Bella means beautiful. the movie is good but in without the gender stereotypical elements.",0
320,"This is the single reason why the whole movie industry is corrupt. Vampires are no longer menacing human killers, they are girly boys and girly girls. And in love with a human women (Which does not happen in past Vampires). This is basically a preparation for us to accept corruption (Which is featured in any number of movies later on and even in real life) and every time i see this thing in the movie channel (Only my father watches television) i just tell him to switch the channel. Flat on disgusting and shows how liberatedly corrupt our generation is.",0
321,"Twilight is a movie that fails at being romantic and succeeds at being awkward and incredibly forced. This film takes itself so seriously yet it's hard to take seriously, due to unpolished and cheesy camerawork, laughable dialogue and acting, awful CGI, and obvious sped-up moments. Kristen Stewart is so emotionless here, and her character has zero personailty. She doesn't do anything apart from getting saved a couple of times. Robert Pattinson is just plain unwatchable. He plays a boring, unlikeable vampire named Edward Cullen, who Bella falls in love with due to forced storytelling. Every character is poorly developed, and they all feel like they're reading their lines. This movie spends so much time building up to a reveal that we knew was going to happen, and yet it still has to use lazy writing to get there. We get lots of unnecessary flashback-cuts that get obnoxious very quickly. Nothing about this film is convincing. It is very unrealistic but tries so hard to be taken seriously. The result is a boring, lifeless, depressed movie with some unintentionally hilarious moments.The movie does look pretty though, and there is some good use of colours. It compliments the serious tone the film tries to have. Then there is the camerawork: Awful. The push-in's are so cheesy, there is a horrendous shot does spins around the character that is so unnecessary and out-of-place. The camera is usually shaky, and it looks like a documentary at times which doesn't match this type of film.But we can't forget about the amount of times Kristen blinks in this movie. However, we can forget about Twilight and i'm going to give it a 2/10.",0
323,"Terrible movie, awful production values, mopey and depressed teenagers that need to live before being so moody.  Why did I watch this?  Please save your money!",0
324,"The legendary meme known as Twilight is not only bad lore mixed with bad romance, but it's also the lamest movie known to human kind, it's hard to watch for more than 5 minutes.It also tries too hard to please a teenager demographic (probably made up of a bunch of Emos and Goths).If you want something similar that doesn't suck, try to watch Harry Potter VI.",0
325,This film and the sequels had no potential from the start. It is a soap opera vampire film for people who like corny films. Definitely a forgotten franchise as soon as the last one is released onto DVD.,0
326,"This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to) to know what they are like, and I am willing to not talk about them, but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic, something didn't work in this film. Despite this, the film was a box office champion, teenagers eagerly consumed it, the studio rubbed their hands in satisfaction and everyone was happy.The plot is easy to summarize. Isabella Swan is a girl who has just moved in with her father in Forks (curious name), a small town near the Canadian border in Washington state. The city is horrible for a man like me, used to the sun and heat of Southern Europe: almost permanent rain or fog and a humidity capable of growing moss behind my ears. There, she meets friends from the past like Jake, from a native tribe nearby, and meets Edward, a strange schoolmate. Soon it becomes evident that the two feel something strong when they are close and that Edward has something different, visible in his cold skin, eyes that change color, unusual speed and strength ... he is a vampire.The problem with this film is not that it is aimed at a teen audience, but its bland history and lifeless characters. The way the film was made took away all the involvement, and it unfolds without us feeling connected to what we are seeing. This, for me, is difficult to understand if the source material was good and the premises of the story told are excellent: adolescent and passionate love, supernatural creatures, the problems of adolescence, adaptation difficulties ... there was a lot to work with and good chances of developing a deep and engaging story. Quite frankly! We had stories made with much more fragile premises - Harry Potter is an example - but that gave rise to wonderful books and films. It is something that can only be understood by the imbecility of the director, Catherine Hardwicke (who definitely has no way of making this type of films) and the screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg.Personally, I think there were also some casting errors that didn't help the film. Kristen Stewart is a weak actress with no presence, or at least she was here, and the same can be said of a dull Robert Pattinson, who seems to be more dead than his character. Both were poor casting choices. Better than them, Taylor Lautner is more intense and palatable, but he couldn't save the film.For some reason I have only now been able to see this film in its entirety. It was not because I was virtually quarantined at home because of a virus, but simply because I fell asleep deeply in all previous attempts to see it in full. And I'm not even that guy who always falls asleep in front of the TV! It is a boring and dead film, compared to dozens of other teen films that involve the supernatural.",0
330,"Absolutely dreadful, no wonder all the teenagers are brain-dead nowadays. I don't recommend at all.",0
332,"Quando dizem que o livro é bem melhor que o filme, sempre ouçam. O filme não é tão ruim quanto dizem, mas poderia ser melhor se tivesse colocado partes bem mais interessantes que tem no livro, como quando ela descobre o verdadeiro Edward.",1
333,"É tão ruim que fica engraçado.Claro que devemos ter em mente qual o publico que esse filme espera alcançar, e na real... não acredito que o mesmo seja tão exigente. O filme tem péssimas atuações, uma cinematografia preguiçosa, um roteiro que só de fato uma criança com fantasias ""american highschool"" aceitaria. O filme não funciona como um romance, pois ambos personagens aparentam ser mortos. Os diálogos não são nem um pouco reais e as motivações por trás do Edward são completamente injustificáveis e até incompreensíveis. Eu realmente não sei como essa franquia conseguiu ir tão longe.",0
