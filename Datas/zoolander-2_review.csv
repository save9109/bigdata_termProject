0,"'Zoolander No. 2' is many things: its stupid, boring, repetitive, lazy, a cash grab... but it is not funny. Not even Will Ferrel can carry Ben Stiller's disappointing mess of a sequel.",0
4,"I didn't see Zoolander 1 during it's time, and because of that I don't share the love that it gets from most others. And Zoolander 2 features the same overdone performance from Ben Stiller, some occasionally funny and weird stuff with Owen Wilson, a ton of celebrity cameos (some good, some utterly pointless) and some often funny lines. And that's the problem, it's only funny here and there. It never made my laugh out loud and the final act is just terrible. This is probably the worst film of 2016 so far.",0
5,"Being a huge fan of the first Zoolander, I was not only disappointed in the sequel. I was disgusted. Zoolander 2 is not only obnoxiously unfunny on its own, but damages the original. The characters have lost all realism and have become annoying caricatures. Ben Stiller is really, really, ridiculously awful here. As is the actor playing his horribly grating son. The plot is stupid, the writing is completely flat, and it's just not funny at all. I laughed a few times and they were all from Will Ferrell as Mugatu, but even he didn't live up to the potential of his brilliant character in the first film. Penelope Cruz and Kristen Wiig are hardly in it and don't really offer anything other than star power for marketing. It's filled with all-star celebrity cameos, but nothing interesting comes from them. I was thoroughly disappointed with Zoolander 2 as a whole and expected so much more from Stiller and gang.",0
6,"Worst movie I believe I ever saw.  Saw 3 couple walk out until we coundt take it anymore either and did the same. No stories, bad acting and stupid all around.  Dont waste your money.",0
7,"While its filled with absurd cameos from every celebrity you can think of, Zoolander 2 has no plot and lacks the comedy needed for this sequel to succeed.  What this movie comes down to is Stiller and Wilson trying to scrape the bottom of an empty barrel of jokes, and the film falls terribly flat.",0
8,"Remember what I said about Zoolander 2 on my review of Zoolander? ""Hoping Zoolander 2 can be this good as the first one."" Yeah, about that... I was hoping Zoolander 2 would be good and I was planning to give it a good score, but nope. This movie betrayed me and it makes the original look bad. You would want to start watching the original more often.",0
9,"The new Zoolander is nothing like the first one. The film is so boring, and barely funny. As oppose to the first Zoolander, which was so stupid that it was funny, the second one isn't even funny. It's just stupid.",0
11,"You know a movie is bad when the best acting is a cameo by Justin Beaver. Really now, this was a poorly written show. I was so looking forward to it, but was sorely disappointed.",0
12,"Awful, disastrous & messy sum up the words for..... for.... whatever it was that I wasted my life watching. I can't even come to terms to even call it a movie as it doesn't deserve the recognition or come under the bracket of a movie as this will be far too distasteful to those that put the time and effort into making something worth watching.Avoid like this movie like the plague.",0
14,"A lot of talented actors, some cute cameos but the movie is as funny as cancer. I am not saying Zoolander 1 was a great comedy but it had it moments, it was funny at times, unfortunately Zoolander 2 is a complete wast e of time.",0
15,"Admittedly, I can see why a lot of people don't like it-it was stupid, unnecessary and sometimes quite messy-but for the most part, I enjoyed it. The problem with it was that while the first one was more focused on lampooning the fashion industry, the second one spends about half an hour making jokes about how weird modern fashion is, before suddenly becoming a spy movie. That said, it was still funny. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson did great jobs, but as with the first, Will Ferrell stole the show. He was absolutely hilarious. And Justin Bieber's death scene was one of the greatest movie beginnings in the history of cinema (do I have to explain why?). So overall, while not as good as the first one, Zoolander 2 is a mostly satisfying sequel with enough laughs to overcome its flaws.",1
16,First movie I walked out of in a very long time.  The entire cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves for making this movie.  You would have to be a very special person to even remotely enjoy Zoolander 2.,0
17,"Great film. If you liked the first, you'll like this - more of the same, and that's not a bad thing. Some moments are amazing, like Mugatu's exit from the prison. Ultimately I don't think the series could sustain a third film, but this was fantastic. Kind of relies on having seen the first to get a lot of the humour. Well done team!",1
18,"Last week my girlfriend brought me to an art gallery fo a date. This week I chose to bring my girlfriend to see this movie... The film was so bad I thought she was going to break up with me! I was so embaressed that this poorly chosen film would somehow falsely give her insight into my character. Tasteless, cheap, not funny and lacking any smart humor. Ill timed jokes, A plot that seems written in one cafe sitting between Ben and others. Too many cameos, which take away from the film. And, again, really bad jokes.",0
19,"Unfunny as hell,they are trying so hard to land every jokes to us and it's unfunny,predictable and just stupid.The first film is good enough doesn't mean the movie needs a sequel.The film is an unnecessary comedy sequel with annoying **** characters,bad pacing and a terrible **** dialogue.",0
20,"Co jest k…?! Zoolander 2 to film beznadziejny. Jego celem było ukazanie zepsutego i absurdalnego świata mody, a nie beznadziejnych żartów, które wyprowadzają z równowagi aniżeli do śmiechu. Jedyne sceny, które wywołały u mnie śmiech były pod koniec. Reasumując, nienawidzę tego ""filmu"".",0
22,"Well, it can Ben Stiller's laziest and worst  film made. First, a dull and dark beginning, Justin Bieber dying? If you are a fan of Justin Bieber, I recommend you not to watch the film. Well, another bad side of this film is the cameo of Benedict Cumberbatch as a lesbian model and fashion designers like Tommy Hilfiger being cannibals.",0
23,"This was just another pathetic excuse to give a big budget film to a mediocre ,white and unfunny so called actor.The worst film i have ever seen in my life. I left after 30 mins into the film after putting myself through horrible acting, dialogues, etc! The screenplay was just horrid! I'm glad the film was a disaster at the box office.",0
24,"In Zoolander, we had a small commentary on the child labour industry on fashion, but in Zoolander 2, we get a commentary about how fashion has gone from weird to extravagantly bizarre. Just like our sweet and stupid protagonist of it all, Zoolander 2 is intensely hilarious. Sure, I'll admit that the narrative shifts like a stumbling horse, but the encapsulation of madness overwhelms the senses and almost drugs you into laughing. It's thrilling. We get just what made the first one so brilliant and more, some especially excellent cameos. Be warned, those who didn't like the first Zoolander will hate this one even more I fear...Yet for those of us finding the sort of OTT and strange zoolander comedy in the first one, this is really really ridiculously good fun.",1
25,Hilarious!!!! Lol seeing my mentor Anna Wintour and My dear Ariana Grande ... in the same film? lol this is why I'm happy. Give it and chance is good and kinda guffy but that's the spirit of zoolander...,1
27,"An unnecessary follow up! Foolander! Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. Ben Stiller is a good actor, but a fine filmmaker, His directional ventures were awesome, especially after his last film 'Walter Mitty' the expectation was very high on this, but I did not think it'll end like this. It hits the rock bottom, the lowest point in his directional career. His odd film experiment had failed, just for one project and I know he will come back strong. But as an actor, he still got the star value and I'm looking forward for his upcoming project. It has been 15 years since the original film and I don't remember much of it. But before this, I had a very quick re-view, so I'm to get a clean flow for a better understanding. Anyway, the film gave a brief report about the past events in the beginning, but when I saw the first face in the opening scene I knew it will going to suck and it did. Okay, the first, the story was decent, but not the jokes. And the next, there are too many cameos that kind of ruined its pace to keep quiet for sometime and to focus on actual story development. From all those, the best part and where I actually had a brief laugh was to see Neil deGrasse Tyson. The second films are always very crucial, because it is a bridge between the original film and numerous follow-ups to set up a franchise status. So clearly this film stumbled and I don't think there will be any more films in this series. The original 'Zoolander' had its own brand appeal, but with this bad film it got lost. The production was very good and so the performances, but the humours were average. No offense, there are some people who still liked it, but I did not, so I won't recommend it for the 'Zoolander' fans as well as if you're looking for a good comedy. But like I always say who knows you might like it, so think twice in which one is if you're reading this review and the second is analyse it before to decide anything. 3/10",0
28,"A very under appreciated film that was an overly hyped sensation and that inevitably led to it's failure in capturing the audience it was looking for. The movie does some re-treads for nostalgia's sake but manages to keep the ball rolling and not confuse newcomers. The plot, although hard to follow at times is an extremely solid satire of both the modelling industry and overly sensitive people. The movie is all hits as far as comedy goes for anyone except who the film is putting under fire (Another reason why the movie got panned, it offended pansy's and those kind of people lie in the critic and blogging industry). Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell are as amazing as you'd expect in their returning roles. The acting and delivery is what really makes this movie succeed in quality. The celebrity cameos are also  better executed than expected, being really witty and clever. Overall, this movie is hilarious and hits all the right spots.",1
29,"I had very low expectation about this product ...normaly it isn't my kind of comedy....I watched It because It cost about 3 Euros in a cinema promotion.......but I gotta say, I was surprised by how much I laughed.The jokes were satire and often in the background but they do their job.There are a lot of quotes (often mocking) of other movie, good visual, good costumes, a lots of cameos by actors-musicians-stylists that are willing to making fun of themselves (For example Susan Sarandon that auto quote herself from Janet Weiss character) in a good mix.I didn't watch the first one so I can't compare.",1
30,"The worst movie I've ever seen, I mean is so stupid the history and the protagonist is so stupid, is not even funny at all. I expected more for this movie",0
33,What is happening with Ben Stiller ?? What a bad movie !!! Please do not waste time watching this non-sense. Starky and Huthc please don't do that again !,0
35,"Zoolander 2 has more cameos than laughs and recycles too much elements of its predecessor to create an unnecessary, over-the-top, unfunny mess for Ben Stiller and co.",0
39,"Ben Stiller's  track recond of movies it pretty decent for the most part but this movie is something I'm sure even he wish turned out better. Most people look back at the first Zoolander movie and love it, so most people who where hoping this movie to be good are going to be let down. Lots of jokes just fall flat and feel weird. Most of it feels like it should of just been re written. Lots of celebrity cameos just feel forced/pointless and don't really add anything to the film. Story is really bad and I know you don't go to this type of movie for story but this was a let down even for a comedy of this level. Overall I was let down with this film and sadly fans of the original will probably feel the same.",0
40,"I watched this movie recently, my thoughts are if you just watch this it's not so great by itself... but if you watched zoolander  and then this movie you won't hate it as much, I liked the first movie over this one personally, but this movie is good as a sequel...anyway I felt some points of the movie could have been better edited acted and devised to work together more seamlessly, and some acting moments are over the top at times, but It is a sequel movie, so they expect us to know how part of how the world of zoolander works already, overall I felt this movie was not bad, it could be better in some ways, but I've seen worse movie sequels.",1
42,"Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell all return for a sequel that never needed to happen. And oh boy don't they know how to act dumb. The movie is unfunny and idiotic. The first one was average at best. Why make a second one? No wonder why it bombed in the box office.",0
44,When you lose all hope and drug yourself beyond the limits of your entire life and slowly glide towards a nearby black hole; some imagery may flash before your hallucinating eyes. That is exactly the experience you get while watching Zoolander 2. Even if your senses may try to feed a logic by plucking it from the darkest place of your imagination; that it might be a parody of some sort....still the movie embarks it's existence as the parody of the genre of parody itself. Sadly I have nothing more to say as it deserves not even mentioning. A sad excuse in the name of entertainment.,0
46,"We didn't need the first film, and we definitely didn't need a sequel. Empty story, lame jokes and atrocious acting from the entire cast. Stiller & Wilson should be ashamed of themselves...",0
47,"I usually make my reviews marking The good, the bad, and the ugly things in the movie. Let's start: The Good: Justin Bieber gets killed. Apart from that, nothing. The Bad: Poor plot. Horrible acting. Sexual jokes make the movie unsuitable for anyone below 12, but those jokes are so inmature that they make the movie too stupid for anyone over 12, so the movie doesn't have a target age. The plot is poor. But what I consider the worst is the horrible developing of the characters: From nonsense accents used along the movie, passing through nonsense, stupid exaggerations, to clothes choosing. The ugly: Benedict Cumberbatch character. Seriously, What The F*ck is up with that character!? Also the horrible accents and acting exaggerations. Jesus Christ the actors interpreting the bad guys shout everything they say! Verdict: Do yourself a favor: DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE.",0
48,"Zoolander is another example of Hollywood's lack of originality in the past few years so they just polish up some old good movies and make a remake just to make money or pass time. I enjoyed the first one, I really disliked the second one. Bad story, not half as funny as the first one and not even good acting. Some movies are meant not to have sequels and all these movies had sequels in the past few years. Please stop making unwanted sequels and reboots.",0
50,literally a cinematic embarrassment at first i was thinking maybe a sequel for needed for comic relief but it turned out to be the  total opposite,0
51,members only..Zoolander 2Zoolander 2 isn't worth considering a movie let along a funny one and addition to that it comes off more disappointing coming under from Ben Stiller's shed.,0
52,"I really wanted to like this movie, I really did, but it was just bad.  Whoever wrote the script needs to be thrown in a trashcan and then rolled off of a waterfall.  It makes me sad too because I loved Zoolander 1, which was a touching reimagining of the film October Sky about a boy with a stubborn father who decided to not go into the family business of coal mining and instead chased their dreams in making rockets / being a supermodel.",0
