0,"A tense and emotional film with fantastic performances from Teller and Simmons; they are one of music's best chemistry in movie history. The script keeps pace with endless and exhilarating tension. Damien Chazelle instantly has my respect, being this his only second work. It is well driven behind pitch-point direction.",1
1,Simmons and Teller are incredible. Barely 15 minutes into the movie I was hating Simmons character. He was a real SOB to the extreme.Why any student would put up with such an abusive teacher is why many an athlete put up with a tyrannical coach. It's a way to make it into the big leagues or so they are led to believe. This was the most intense movie I've seen in a long time. I was drained when I left the theatre.,1
2,"This film was phenomenal! If J.K. simmons does not win a best support actors oscar for his role in this film it will be an outrage! Acting is perfect! The story is compelling all the way through and the brilliant direction along with the clever dialogue and occasionally humorous moments the film stayed fresh all the way through. The scenes get intense in this film as you watch a young man struggling to become the best jazz drummer in the world. It's an ambition that we can all relate to: to strive to be best at something. This is what makes this story so encapsulating, you want him to become the best! Loved the film in everyway! A must watch! Emotional, frantic, and memorable!",1
3,i don't know much about Damien Chazelle maybe because he don't have a lot of movies actually before i watch this i movie i was thinking that it will be simple and boring movie . I saw the crew i saw the director and told to my self that's not going to be a good movie but i wasn't right the movie turn up side down my opinion it was interesting and fascinating  movie . In some moments of the movie I've want to get out go to the nearest shop and by drumms and start playing.It's was so fascinating that i could'nt take my eyes off the screen .And the actors i was thinking  Miles Teller is young actor he will fail in role like this but i was wrong he just blow my mind he made stunning role J.K. Simmons was stunning too a teacher who push to the highest limits his students no matter what .That was just an Epic production one of the best for the year for me i have to say im really impressed,1
4,"Damien Chazelle's ""Whiplash"" is a harrowing film that explores the complicated relationship between Andrew, a young jazz drummer who aspires to become the best, and Fletcher, a famed conductor who relentlessly pushes his students to their limits in search for his ideal musician. Actors Teller and Simmons, who played the roles of Andrew and Fletcher respectively, have shown quality performances as their strong jazz chemistry really left an impression; Simmons's oscar-winning performance as Fletcher is straight out deserved, as he performs his role with utter power and absolute dominance. The plot is packed with tension and drama as the pace consistently gains momentum until it all explodes with a refreshing bang at the movie's satisfying grand final act. With excellent visuals, superb directing, an engaging story supplied by masterful actors, ""Whiplash"" definitely has its place in my top 5 movies of 2014.",1
5,"The tension has been kept for more than 100 minutes, the cast was exceptional (especially the two main characters) and the story and scenes are so fantastically connected that you are left wanting for much more in the end. Few ever films can have that schizophrenic development without being called exaggerated. In other words, Whiplash is superb.",1
6,"Great film, guy with the saggy face plays a great crazy music teacher and the battle between teacher and pupil is truly engaging. Well worth a watch!!",1
7,"Very well shot, edited, acted and designed; with a fresh take on old ideas. The movie may have a very specific focus and be nothing earth-shattering on the intellectual side, but it's worth several Oscar nominations. The music is fantastic. See it on the big screen. As for the controversy around the abusive teacher, I would say that it's not necessary to feel that the teacher is justified or unjustified, good or evil, effective or hindering, in order to enjoy the movie and find interesting food for thought in it. If a semi-vicious teacher who, in the real world, would overstep the bounds of ethics and even effective technique, is a flaw in the movie, then it's not a damning one.",1
8,"While it is a masterpiece of a film and definitely my pick for the best film of 2014. It really comes down to the power house performance of J.K. Simmons. He owned the role with a passion and it showed through out. He's the reason it was such a pleasure to watch. And props to Miles Teller too, He did a fine job opposite of Simmons.",1
9,"'Whiplash' is the first movie I've seen that has made me seriously think about reconsidering Spike Jonze's 'Her' as the movie I believe to be closest to cinematic perfection. Brutal, uncompromising, exhausting, intense and utterly incredible, 'Whiplash' grabs you by the throat and plunges you face first into the class of Terence Fletcher, an extreme jazz conductor. As much as I want to gush about every aspect of this film, the best way to watch it is to just know that it's good. Oh, and also that Miles Teller is in it, and he's actually not terrible, so go him for once.",1
10,"Absolutely breathtaking. There was something about this film that really resonated with me even as the end credits rolled. Hard-hitting and intense, Miles Teller and JK Simmons give some of their best performances in their respective roles and even as I write, I can't find anything wrong with this movie. I always say a good movie makes you feel something with or without having taught you something. This film accomplished both.",1
11,"I can't explain how good I find this movie. Incredible story, incredible music, incredible everything. I was captivated with this movie in a way I can't even explain with words. Outstanding. I give a 10/10 a movie that deserves a lot more.",1
12,"Absolutely terrific film. One of 2014 best if not the best. Flaw free. Intense, raw, realistic, empowering, perfectly paced and with two of the best performances of the year. Miles Teller is a total revelation to me in this and shows how such a young actor can be an outstanding one already. Amazing performance. A crime that he has not been nominated for best actor at the Oscars. Co-lead actor J. K. Simmons is equally great and will win his Oscar for supporting role no doubt. And the film does this with just two main characters, music and a great screenplay. No more is needed when we are talking about real art. It will be impossible because of politics, but if this film gets the Oscar for best picture it will be the biggest deserved surprise in Oscar history. A must see!",1
13,"Whiplash is definitely on my short list for best movies of 2014. A good story, excellent casting, and fine direction are the reasons why.  Better known for his TV roles, J.K. Simmons makes the most of his opportunity. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a freshman jazz drummer at a top music school.  Terence Fletcher (JK Simmions) teaches the school’s best students, mostly upper classmen, but he is also the teacher everyone fears.  Fletcher’s motto is that good musicians don’t become great musicians unless they are pushed hard to do so, but the techniques used by Fletcher to motivate his students fall somewhere between extreme and brutal. Andrew comes from a nice middle class family in the burbs.  Family dinner conversations have a competitive air in which the small college athletic successes of his siblings dominate.   Andrew is driven to succeed as a jazz drummer, but he is also young and impressionable.  He notices that in addition to being a tough teacher, Fletcher appears to also have a caring and a compassionate side to him.  Andrew buys into Fletcher’s belief system and commits to doing whatever it takes to be the best, including making a decision to terminate a budding relationship with his new girlfriend. The question of whether Fletcher is a good guy or a bad guy will have you on the edge of your seat until the movie’s dramatic conclusion.  You don’t need to like jazz music to like this film.  The terrific music is just a bonus.  Director Damien Chazelle’s pacing is right on target and a couple of minor plot faults near the end of the movie aren’t enough throw this fine film off tempo.",1
15,Whiplash is very enjoyable with a very interesting story. while the characters are not incredibly likeable they don't have to be and that's where the enjoyment comes from. at times it feels like an 80's sports movie like karate kid or rocky only centring around music instead and trying to tell a more real world story. my only complaint is that i felt i would have enjoyed it more if I didn't know it was up for best picture as i felt like i was unable to just sit back and take it in and it felt like i needed to overanalyse it and probably missed some of the best parts of the film but i would still really recommend it,1
16,Whiplash is one of the most stressful and uncomfortable movies of all time. Many times I cringed out of anticipation of what will happen. J.K. Simmons gives a commanding performance as well as Miles Teller. Whiplash is an entertaining and fantastic film that defines the music genre. 10/10 (Masterpiece),1
17,A clinical rebooting outlook over the bestial and swallower ambiance at an highly prestigious music school class under compulsion of J. K. Simmons character far away from being a ''bed of roses'' as we may think at first analysis. Beautifully shot from singular angles the action drives us tense and has us wondering circumspect holding us on our seat and leaves a trail of underlying critics.,1
18,"There is amazing energy and tension in this production. JK Simmons and Miles Teller are bother flawless in their portrayals, though - for me - the score outshines everything in this film. It's up there with Theory of Everything as my movie of the year. From scene one to the last scene, you will not blink...",1
19,"Wow just wow .That's how I left the theatre . Overwhelmed by the amazing performances from JK Simmons and Milles Teller.I was sucked into the story right from the beginning . The story is fantastic .The editing of this movie is just superb . It's easily the best movie of the last decenium.The story is simple but is worked out perfectly . Each detail is right. Sound is in one word just amazing...If you are still reading this review stop right now and go watch it right now you will be overwhelmed at the end of this amazing movie.",1
20,"Terence Fletcher: ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job"". Whiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life. Okay let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven't seen Birdman yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014. J.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in he's career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out, no, I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was real and not fake. I didn't see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher. Now let's talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He has the best lines, when his on screen your locked on and his also like the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say ""You did a good job"", and yes I did use the words ""you did a great job"", n my past reviews but now I'm never going to use it ever again after this movie. Miles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough, and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless. The directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle directed this movie and written it and man did he do it with style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it. This movie also had probably the best finale that I've seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I'm kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like ""You will clap at the end"", but you don't, or ""You will feel inspired after the film"", and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie. For problems: The movie had it slow parts and that's it really. Whiplash is a movie that everybody should see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. So go and see if you have the chance.",1
21,"Like movies? Watch Whiplash. Like the drums?Watch Whiplash. Like Jazz music? Watch Whiplash. This film is great. J.K Simmons and Miles Teller are both fantastic. The film is directed so well by Damien Chazelle. I don't want to speak too soon, but he might be the next Spielberg. Then again, that has been said before (M. Night Shyamalan).",1
22,"Masterpiece. Just a complete masterpiece. Being a drummer, made me totally understand this movie (you will love it even if you are not a musician.) I can not even give a review that properly explains the magic of this movie. You must see for yourself.",1
23,"Whiplash is a rare, true, tour-de-force of a film from director Damian Chazelle. The script is tense and an emotional rollercoaster that perfectly blends elements of drama and thriller. Miles Teller and J.K Simmons put on career-defining performances, the music is incredible, and the shots and color-motiffs are so detailed and enamouring that you will want to watch Whiplash again and again. This is not a film to be missed.",1
24,"One of the greatest films about Ambition, Music, The longing for greatness and Approval and most Importantly Character Driven storytelling. This, along with films like The Social Network, The dark Knight , are changing modern cinema as we know it (if they haven't already). Like the seventies film-makers like Kubrick, Scorsese and Coppola influenced a whole new generation with the possibilities of cinema , The above mentioned films have influenced me and hopefully my generation of moviegoers and I hope will continue to do so. The thing about Whiplash for me is that It feels pure. It has razor sharp focus on it's characters and in what type of film it wants to be. Most films these days always feel bogged down by baggage that diminish the experience whether it be Political and sentimental in nature . Not because they're in the film but they feel extremely heavy handed and half baked. This is the sort of film that really gets to me. Films that feel personal and close to the heart and don't preach to you , cater to you or talk down to you.One of my all time favorites.I have nothing to say about J.K Simmons enigmatic performance, The brilliant Script, Miles Tellers resonant lead because it's already been said , they're all Awesome. In the end this is a film That me and many other people have connected to , even though we don't have jazz in our lives , Even though we didn't have a foul-mouthed teacher pushing us, or even though we may have modest expectations of our lives.  that should tell you all you need to know about the film really 10/10",1
25,"One of the best movies of the decade. This is just a masterpiece and an example of great directing, wonderful performances, great script and nice sound design. This movie is not just about the struggle of music student Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) trying to impress the abusive and intimidating instructor Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons), it's actually a lot more than that and it actually has some great social commentary about topics like education and life goals.The Good:-The directing and cinematography are just brilliant.-The acting is amazing, both leads (Teller and Simmons) do a fantastic job.-The script.-The story is entertaining, intense, exciting and emotional.The Bad:-Nothing really bad worth complaining. Sure there are some plot holes left unexplained but those that really ruin the movie? I don't think so.",1
26,"""Whiplash"" stars J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller in this story of a would be jazz drummer and his over zealous teacher/conductor in an elite and upscale music conservatory. Written and directed by Damien Chazille, this is a film that will appeal to lovers of jazz as it represents some of the best musical renditions ever seen on the movie screen. It is also a film that raises the question as to how far a teacher should go to ""bring out the best"" in his or her student. Messrs. Simmons and Teller are superb in the roles they play as they participate in some of the most intense student/teacher scenes one will ever see. Adding to their credibilty, we find out that in real life Mr. Teller studied drums from age 15 and Mr. Simmons holds degrees in voice, conducting and music from the University of Montana. As a result it’s easy to understand the believability of their respective performances. Having myself played in studio bands under the stewardship of a number of quality professors, the film had a special meaning for me. But, alas, this is what may make this really good film a commercial mishap since it is not for everyone and, by its very subject matter, may exclude a significant part of the viewing public. I give the film a 9.0 because, seen out of context and apart from other films, it stands out as a true work of art. The caveat here, though, is that if intense musicology, training and signficant jazz performances are not the viewer’s ""thing"", then this film will not be appreciated by him or her to the same extent as it was by me.",1
27,"A film about an aspiring drummer at an elite New York music school doesn't sound like the most exciting cinematic prospect, but Whiplash is a film that defies expectations. The battle of wills between Miles Teller's student and JK Simmon's brutal teacher makes for essential viewing with both actors giving career best performances. It's Raging Bull meets Full Metal Jacket for jazz fans. With a pared down running time without a wasted minute, this is one film that could have been longer. It's a dazzling display of filmmaking from a director who will hopefully go on to even greater things",1
28,A near pitch perfect film with fine performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons.  The filmmakers take a story that could have easily been cliche-ridden or just plain boring and found a way to keep the audience engaged all of the way to the end.,1
29,"I will show you that from one movie you can get a wave of words: Awesome! Brutal! Intense! Awe-Inspiring! Raw! Exhilarating! Electric! Vivid! Brilliant! Revolutionary! Exceptional! Majestic! Fast! Classic! Spectacular! Inspirational! Emotional! Dramatic! Heart-Stopping! Historic! PERFECTION! 'Whiplash' is one of the most music-emblematic and best-made films of this decade. And one of the finest motion pictures in the American cinema. This was a joy and an experience to watch!",1
30,"It might be over-the-top, but Whiplash is an amazing, electrifying, movie experience. As a committed musician myself, I can tell you that real conservatories do not run like the cutthroat one in the movie; however, the performances, the cinematography, and the allegory-like screenplay make it intense and almost pitch-perfect. It is just my tempo.",1
31,"Wow. That was so intense, yet so simplistic. Whiplash follows the story of a drum player played by Miles Teller. He's extremely relatable as he wants this as his career, and is working so hard to get there; a situation we've all been in. We also see that he is not handling the pressure that well. He's in debt, he's barely paying the rent and is verging insanity. From this we want him to succeed, as we see that he is a good guy, but his incredibly bad luck is just bringing him down; again another situation we've all been in. The humanisation of this character is so engaging that even if there was no plot or dialogue at all in the movie, it would still keep audiences in their seats. But that's not the case. The plot presented before us may be simple, but it's execution is stellar in every possible respect - from acting to cinematography to music; it simply is a masterpiece. The story comes into play when our main character is at the end of his rope and is a mer millimetre away from giving up. However, he gains hope again when he has the opportunity to study in a class taught by this legendary music teacher played by J.J Simons. He gets in, but gets way more than he bargains for. Simons teaching methods are extremely cruel and some what sadistic, using physical, verbal and psychological torture to motivate his students. In addition to this, Simons's performance is absolutely and utterly impeccable. At every given moment some sort of malice is shown by him, making you actually fear what he might put Teller through next. It's easily the best performance of the year and Simons definitely needs to win an oscar. The film also makes you continuously have conflicting opinions on this character. For example, Simons will often say utterly evil yet hilarious things, that makes you question your own morality by finding it funny. But the best thing about this character is how real he really is. We've all had some sort of intelligent, charismatic yet malevolent boss or teacher that we've hated with every morsel of our beings. However, the greatest part of this film is at the end. After around a month of all of this, Simons deems Teller ready to preform, but also warns him that if he messes this up, he will suffer beyond anything he's ever felt. Mix that with excellent camera work and thematic music, and you have one of the most tension filled scenes in the whole of film history. It takes you through the scene at such a methodical, slow pace that just builds an extreme level of suspense. Without a doubt Whiplash is one of the best, if not the best film of 2014.",1
32,"I salute you Damien Chazelle! What he has created is more than a movie, but a electrifying revelation which renders you from the core. A film about passion, dedication, jazz and a intense viewing experience(greatly due to the magnificent direction) . The performances, I am in aw of. J.K Simmons gives a performance of a life time with Miles teller reaching his own peak. Whiplash will leave you wanting more!!",1
33,"Whiplash is a real crowd pleaser which had the audience I saw it with clapping at the end. It moves at a cracking pace, has some very smart dialogue and boasts a couple of very strong performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons. However, it is almost a film of two halves. The set up, and then the revenge. The first half of the film, whilst good, feels somewhat contrived. Drum playing jazz fanatic Andrew (Teller) goes all out to impress respected but feared teacher Fletcher (Simmons) in the hope of joining the school band he leads. This he sees as his possible route to becoming one of the jazz greats. However, he hasn't bargained on the outrageous teaching methods employed by Fletcher which includes humiliating and even attacking his students. Their fragile interaction puts them on a collision course. Both performances are undoubtedly excellent, but Teller really has the more difficult role and stands tall against Simmons more obvious grandstanding. As the cruel and foul mouthed Fletcher, Simmons shouts, swears and screams a lot, much in the vein of an army drill instructor, but these outbursts sometimes have the effect of appearing phony and calculated, merely there to elicit laughs or rouse an audience. Like wise, Teller's acquisition, and subsequent ditching of a girl friend, and scenes of him pushing himself on the drums to the point that his hands become blistered and bloodied, strike false notes. Again,they feel like plot contrivances which, although demonstrating sacrifices made on route to success, actually feel included just to provide fuel for the film's better second half.The final half hour is very satisfyingly concluded as the two actors dual it out to thrilling and nail biting effect. The film also benefits from a  great jazz score which permeates throughout and the film is briskly and imaginatively edited.",1
34,"Easily the best movie of 2014 so far. It has all the hallmarks of a singular vision that was not messed with by a studio.  19 shooting days produced a marvelous film with two amazing lead actors.  I can't remember a movie since The Hurt Locker that produced anything close to this level of intensity.  In a way, it also reminded me of Jiro Dreams of Sushi in the conductor/teacher/mentor's pursuit of perfection.  These standards and pursuits are rare in society these days - and sure, the introduction of violence is arguably too much  - but in a way, it's an admirable model.",1
35,"Great flick Super intense - my palms have almost never been as sweaty as they were during this Amazing acting and music    .",1
37,"JK Simmons & Miles Teller deliver fantastic, intense performances. I was blown away by this film. If this movie doesn't garner some big awards, it will be a huge injustice to the film and the actors. AAA+++ Just An Incredible Movie, A Must See!!! The drumming is spectacular!!",1
38,"This is one of the best American films ever.  You don't have to be interested in big band jazz (although it helps) to be bowled over by it.  It shows a teaching situation unmatched in its intensity and posing the question in one's mind (not in the dialogue) of how far a teacher can go to inspire a student.  Brilliant script, performances, direction, editing.  A grand slam!",1
39,"“Whiplash” is a winner in every aspect. You know when you want to go up to the screen and punch the bully or wrap the bloody fingers of the one being bullied that some strong acting is going on in the film. The film starts with a drum solo and ends with one while in between you will be mesmerized by J. K. Simmons as musical conductor/teacher Terence Fletcher and a student of his, played by Miles Teller, Andrew Neyman. (By the way if a conductor has the arms that Fletcher has from conducting I am signing up immediately.) Fletcher wants the best from his students in the hope of finding another Charlie Parker and Andrew wants to be a great, if not better, drummer than Buddy Rich and both will do whatever it takes. Fletcher abuses his students verbally and physically calling them names, throwing things at them, screaming in their faces. He is every Marine Drill Instructor who will grind his charges into the ground to get what he wants. There are at least a minimum of 2 scenes that you will forget to breath and at least 1 scene where you will gasp out loud. There is no doubt both men will deserve nominations for all and any awards and right now they deserve to win! I don’t know if Teller did his own drumming but if he did he deserves recognition for superb drumming. The supporting players from Paul Reiser as Andrew’s father to Melissa Benoist who Andrew pursues, and then drops because she interferes with his drumming, along with the other students who play or compete with him are all topnotch . The music from the title song by the late great Hank Levy plus standards like “Caravan” and new music by Justin Hurwitz are all presented as jazz should be. It took me back to the jazz clubs on 52nd street, and in the Village, along with the sets at Birdland that I use to go to in New York City. The direction by Damien Chazelle is spot on and in his writing the screenplay he leaves out a few logical things but enhances the movie with a short 1 hour and 46 minutes. “Whiplash” is a winner all the way.",1
40,An impressively acted and tense film about a warped kind of encouragement and what it means to be great. J.K. Simmons will rightly earn big noms for this role. Miles Teller proves again that he's a young one to watch.,1
41,"How is it that 3 million dollars are converted into Whiplash, and yet it takes 220 to produce Avengers? This film is definitive proof that you don't need big names (although Miles Teller and JK Simmons kind of are) to get big performances - and that it doesn't all come down to production design and CGI and expensive shots to make a good movie. Accompanied by a humble, warmly-lit cinematography, Whiplash has all it takes to be one of the defining music films so far, thanks mainly to the cast and the script. The plot halts on issues of teacher-student relationships and the importance of commitment, but the open ending suggests that might not be enough still - in substance, there is no ""perfection"" ever, but you have to try. It's the inspiring yet abusive JK Simmons, with his somewhat witty insults and tight black T-shirt who makes the cut. Falling from heaven, repentance and redemption are all there. Watch it.",1
42,"A very impressive spectacle of talent in all kinds of different forms is displayed in this expertly acted and intriguing film! Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons easily deliver intense, captivating, and certainly career-best performances, Simmons without a doubt deserving a shot at the best supporting actor Oscar! Teller's drumming skills are also mind-blowing and the story goes in so many unexpected directions and pulls plenty of shocks and surprises throughout leading up to one hell of a grand finale! Overall, easily one of the year's best and most powerful films!",1
43,By far the most incredible and effective display of pure cinematic and musical entertainment ever to hit a theater that had the privilege of playing such an extraordinary work of art.,1
44,It is easy to label this as the best film of 2014. The whole film is riveting and Teller and Simmons give outstanding performances. Like just seriously I can't say anything more about it go see it.,1
45,A story about a man's drive to be the best even when faced with an extraordinary obstacle.  In this case the obstacle is J.K. Simmons who wants to create the next great one.  Simmons deserves  to be Oscar nominated and Whiplash should be nominated in the best picture catergory.  A+,1
46,There is no better movie in 2014 Than whiplash. That pretty much says it all. It's refreshing to see a movie that focuses on a subject like jazz drumming which doesn't get a whole lot of attention and other artistic ventures. Teller it is clearly a star on the rise. And JK Simmons is going to be justly rewarded for a masterful performance.,1
48,"I’m have mixed feelings on this film. The acting is great with J.K. Simmons delivering as always, there is a great motivation story in here, the main character is relatable for a good chunk of the movie, and the film looks and sounds great. All of this makes it so frustrating when the film gets to the third act. The protagonist becomes unrelatable and unlikeable when you see how overly driven he is to succeed and when the film ended I wanted to distance myself from being like him as much as possible. The film also sends a mixed message telling viewers to work hard and succeed but also shows that downsides of overly driving yourself. The third act takes what could’ve been a wonderful film and just makes it pretty good. This is so heartbreaking for me as I was loving this movie for a while and then the third act came and it just made me want to punch the lead in the face. Now as I am writing this I have yet to see the reviews so I do not know if other critics feel the same way about the film but it wouldn’t surprised me if it got tons of acclaim and no one addressed it. In regards to whether or not I’d recommend the film I’d say see it for the first two-thirds but brace yourself after that because you might not like what you see.",1
49,"Mortifyingly intense, intelligently scripted, brilliantly acted and beautifully shot, 'Whiplash' is an immaculate meditation on the virtue of perfection, and a sophisticated character study of a rising star; the person who wants to be 'one of the greats', and know it.",1
50,"Whiplash is the movie I hope wins if Boyhood does not. What a great film this was, showing the passion, drive, and determination to be great and where the line is to achieve that greatness. Simmons is a lock for best supporting here as his role of the hardassed instructor and the ending of this film was a pulse pounding exhausting (in a good way) rush that I'm still feeling a few hours after seeing the film.",1
51,"With a fabulous jazz score, incredible direction from Chazelle, and precision editing from Tom Cross (editing that the film lives and dies with, and oh how it lives), Whiplash is like nothing I have seen before.  The title might refer to one of the songs from the film, but as the closing credits roll, it isn't surprising I grabbed the back of my neck and wondered what hit me.",1
52,"Miles Teller plays a student jazz drummer whose ambition drives him to extremes, while he endures the abusive tactics of a teacher/band leader (J.K. Simmons). Much like director Damien Chazelle's extensive use of close-ups, this film focuses intensely on the personal dramatic conflict. Fortunately, Teller and Simmons create potent characters. The pace never lags, but the grueling encounters (and Simmons' character) sometimes push beyond reality. Still, it's a compelling character study.",1
53,"Whiplash is the epitome of blood, sweat & tears - on account of two incredible performances from J.K. Simmons & Miles Tiller, along with Damien Chazelle at the helm. Chazelle writes a thought-provoking and insightful look into ambition and addiction.",1
54,"don't dig too deep. just let yourself be carried away by the performances, the music, and the editing. once the film was over, i laughed at the idea of someone crawling out from a car wreck to get to a stage to play, even if the person was running on pure adrenaline. unless the person was anton chigur. and a teacher can be extremely tough without humiliating and physically punishing students.  the first scenes where the band looked like very scared children, not daring to breathe seemed ludicrous. no reputable school would allow a fletcher. the lawsuits! but, it's a movie, it's not real, it's a great metaphor, and it is so true that that the worst two words you can say to a competitor is ""good job"".",1
55,"Many of today's top box office movies involve animated landscapes and whimsical creatures, CGI space aliens and spaceship tales. Whiplash is an emotional and personality driven clash of personalities. The performances are exemplary by the two leading men. If you are a music lover in general, this movie is totally absorbing. If you're a jazz fan (like me) it's off the charts!",1
56,"The script runs in perfect tempo, relentlessly delivering every beat with tactful ferocity, yet It feels incredibly authentic. This masterpiece slaps you around, then elevates you to the greatest cinematic catharsis in years! A true musical thriller. THRILLER!",1
57,"It's quite an intense movie. I played and performed jazz for a decade or so, but certainly not at this level. The music and the performers are quite credible; I had expected to learn later that Miles Teller knew nothing about drums and was just a really good faker as in most music films, but it turns out he is a drummer and did take intense training for this movie, and that authenticity strengthens the film. The point of the movie though, is asking whether a high-stress teaching approach is a good thing or a bad thing. The director's behavior gets intense, and I do struggle to imagine that someone could get away with the things he does in the twenty-first century. It is, however, a provocative issue nonetheless. The way I read into the film, it's up to you to decide the answer to its thesis question: is this aggression and confrontation and abuse necessary to achieve at the highest level, or is it unnecessary? What's not in question is the pain, the question is whether it's worth it. The trailers present the film as a twist on the schmaltzy teacher and student films we've been cursed with. If you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, if you're waiting for this film to abandon its central question and go back to the safe, boring narrative of an omniscient unflappable teacher and a student who just needs to get over himself and put his personal issues aside and then becomes instantly perfect, this movie never reverts back to that. I'd say that's a good thing.",1
58,"It's a fairly simple film with some unexpected turns. While the story seems like one you've heard before, ""Whiplash"" is a masterful telling. With stellar performances and a tight edit, the whole is elevated well beyond the sum of its parts.",1
59,"“Whiplash” is initially a captivating study about what it takes to be great and what is needed to become great, and it ends as a captivating study about what it is to be great. Miles Teller (playing Andrew Neiman) and J.K. Simmons (playing Terence Fletcher) are both absolutely fantastic in their respective roles and their performances are on par with those I loved witnessing in “Birdman” and they fit perfectly, as “Birdman”’s cast did with that films respective themes, with what “Whiplash” is all about.Greatness, as I mentioned earlier, is what “Whiplash” is all about. Teller’s and Simmons’ drive reflect this, and it comes through in their characters. Andrew wants to be “one of the greats” and Fletcher wants to be the man to coach one of them. Yet this is certainly the absolute minimum of what I gathered about this film before I saw it. This kind of drive is in motion about halfway through the film, and “Whiplash” has several twists and turns in it before it finishes. Teller and Simmons develop extremely complex characters and what you come to realise is that what makes them complex is their drive. Andrew for example is an initially very easy character to understand and in some ways, to relate to. We’ve all wanted to be better and get great at something. But what takes “Whiplash” in a different direction from the one where we see Andrew asking the girl behind the counter at the cinema out is Fletcher. He pushes Andrew beyond “what is expected of him”. Watching Teller develop Andrew as a character is a fun ride although Fletcher swearing, slapping and throwing cymbals at him is not so much, but it’s all for a reason.But is it necessary? Fletcher believes so, calling it “an absolute necessity” in a scene where he seems to reveal himself as the grand villain, right beneath our noses this whole time. “Whiplash” asks these questions and it’s almost as if the film sprouted from them, not that they came up and were developed as the film continued to shoot. Andrew and Fletcher’s relationship is an attempt at answering them, leaving it up to you whether the answers “Whiplash” puts forward are right or wrong. Are Fletchers methods the way forward? Could Andrew harness his talent and be great without Fletcher? Did Andrew have the talent to do such a thing? Is talent even a realistic construct? “Whiplash” asks all of these questions, and puts forward its answers here.Of course Teller and Simmons are fantastic too and deserve the nominations they are getting. Simmons character is particularly well developed (and funny too) and again it is a joy to witness Teller’s development. Neither character can be described really. Simmons seems describable but there seems to be something beneath him that I couldn’t figure out and in one scene we see that he isn’t quite as tough as he seems to be. What surprises me though is how Simmons keeps winning awards and Teller does not. For me they are both brilliant and one does not outdo the other because in “Whiplash” you come to think of them as entirely separate individuals, and their relationship is instead an eternal one in regards to how it can be applied to several examples and asked whether it is one required for greatness.What’s also worth mentioning is the films score. It’s brilliant. It really is just a complete appraisal of Jazz.  Drums of course predominantly feature and although the score is not as good as “Birdman”s, again heavily featuring drums, the reason it is not is because the score in “Whiplash” is external and in “Birdman”, it’s internal, inside the cast’s heads. It has meaning and something to do with the film whereas in “Whiplash” it’s almost as if Jazz music and the drums in this case are being used as a way by which we can see Andrew become great. It’s another eternal concept of sorts.“Whiplash” is definitely worth seeing and although I wouldn’t quite call it the film of the year, it certainly puts forward a good performance in several categories and has done well considering it was shot in 19 days and adapted from a short film. Most should come out saying “Whiplash” was a good film. It’s tense and has some good performances in it and asks questions, and talks about, greatness. It’s visually tense as well, helped along by slow-motion shots of sweat bouncing up and down off cymbals and blood dripping from a hand. Because of this, it was an utter relief, and felt hard-earned in some respects, to see the films ending.",1
60,"Riveting and inspiring. Makes you a little less tolerable of the mediocrity that prevails in day to day life. The fact that the movie was created on a miniscule budget of $3.3M makes it even better. It is a raw and gritty depiction of the struggle and sacrifice required to be great! Great script, acting and camera work.",1
61,"I read some of the negative reviews below.  I can understand their points. While there were some unbelievable parts, the screenplay was designed to take the viewer into the life of a young talented musician who wants to be trained to be better at a prestigious music school. Part of growing up and becoming a professional is self-recognition of your own skills and drive to be the best. In life, whether you are as a student, intern or staff employee everyone has their insecurities, this movie attempts to play upon the audience's insecurities through the eyes of the students and instructor in the film.  To a large extent, I thought the writers and actors accomplished their goal.",1

63,"There are some compelling performances here, although the movie does not live up to it. The movie lacks credibility. However, it is well paced with good editing.",1
64,"If you like to watch emotional humiliation, by nasty people to both nice & nasty people, this is the movie for you.  Having seen the high metascore, I restrained myself from walking out in the first 15 minutes.  I had formerly enjoyed J. k. Simmons for his pleasant smile & disposition.  That smile was still there, as he used words to mutilate the spirits and confidence of young men.  Thinking the movie had to get better, I waited until about 2/3 through when a cliched plot feature was  inserted. It is crazy that irrational yelling & screaming is viewed as a story.  Pointless.  For me, it was simply painful to watch.  BTW - I've only walked out of one other movie in my life.",0
65,"Another disappointing Oscar ""best film"" nomination. Music is about joy, and there is very little joy portrayed in this tale; it is replaced by the same arrogance exhibited in ""American Sniper"". The mindless drive for an imagined perfection belonged more on the American football field than in a music school.",0
67,"Often I've pondered weather a film (as a visual telling of peculiar a set of events) has to contain a metaphorically significant and deep story to be considered truly good, or to be simply beautifully represented, in all the ways cinema can offer, is enough. In time, I began to realize that it depends on a series of factors, which in turn depend on another series of factors... and ultimately - the answer was no. But from this night onward, if I ever find myself in doubt again, I will certainly reach out to ""Whiplash"" to remind me that the answer is indeed no.Not often does fate grant me the privilege of experiencing a movie that I want to watch again immediately after I've watched it the first time. Such was the case with ""Whiplash"".The biggest surprise to me in this movie is the work done by Damien Chazelle (who has a rather unexceptional track record up until now), a name I even wrote down to remember, in hopes that he can maintain producing such wonderful works. Other than directing, cinematography has been superbly executed to it's fullest. Hence - my introduction; ""Whiplash"" does not offer a particularly deep or meaningful story, but it is a story very well told, very firmly blended with the craft of film making. This is the main reason ""Whiplash"" instantly became one of my all-time favorite movies - it is beautiful in it's simplicity of story, without sacrificing narrative.Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons show off astounding acting and chemistry. Never have I though that a movie with a concept such as this can be so breathtaking and intense (often enough at the same time).Everything about Whiplash beyond this point cannot be expressed by words. If the concept of ""A Boy Is Learning To Play Hardcore Drums"" is not intriguing to you, still you must give this a chance, because it's about that, but it manages to be so much more (as a film) within that. It establishes it's borders and finds freedom within. And that freedom is beautiful.This is 2014's best flick and I recommend it to everyone and anyone interested in good, quality cinema and acting.",1
68,"A riveting tale of obsession and the search for perfection, with a career performance by J.K. Simmons and a breakthrough portrayal by Miles Teller. Terrific writing and superb film editing make this captivating chess match between student and teacher an engaging film, even if it's not everyone's cup of tea.",1
69,"I absolutely hated this film. It was completely contrived and over-acted. The music was wonderful but was obscured by the yelling and attempts at intensity. Simply, it was forced and had me rolling my eyes from the get go.",0
70,"I've never felt so out of step on a movie as this. To me it was simply awful. Homophobic rants, ritual verbal humiliation and physical violence and I'm still expected to feel some kind of sympathy for the protagonist and still meant to believe he'd be allowed to be a teacher in a top music school. Okay, in truth I wasn't bored...the performances are great and there are some fairly good moments but it's ultimately  a cliched 'overcoming-the-odds' sort of thing that I've seen far too often in the past.",0
71,A dreadful movie.  The story line went from preposterous to idiotic over the course of the movie in true Hollywood fashion.  The sociopathic instructor would not be teaching at any reputable university and would likely be in jail for assault or hate speech.  Spoiler alert - the hero not only survives a t bone collision with a big truck that flips his car but goes on to give the performance of his life while dripping blood.  Seriously ?,0
72,"The movie glosses over reality on so many occasions that it's hard to take it seriously. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons give great performances but they're both oversimplified characters. Simmons just plays a comic book villain. How no one filed a complaint against him in his time at chauffeur is beyond me. Moreover how did he get a job as the conductor of a pro band despite the fact that he's been accused of emotionally torturing a boy to the point where he committed suicide? Shouldn't Fletcher be in jail? How is he walking free. Moreover some of his actions don't even make sense. He expels a student from the band who is in tune because he didn't know whether he was off tune but doesn't even take action against the one who's out of tune, even though he's completely oblivious to that fact as well? I'm sorry is it just me or is that a contradiction. Car accidents don't seem to bother our protagonist too much. That's the least of his problems. He just couldn't afford any scars at that time so he didn't get any. ""There's no to words more harmful than Good Job""? Really? That's not dark, that's not bleak, that's just stupid and simplistic. Whiplash is a film about the pain that accompanies passion, and the blood that's shed on the road to perfection. But sadly, it doesn't execute well. The movie has some tense scenes but the overall result is contrived and unsatisfying. It has a few twists but ultimately it's the same conventional story about the tough love shared by the arrogant apprentice and the abusive master.",0
74,"I was quite disturbed to see that the reviewer's rated this film so highly. It explores the topic of how to inspire students to greatness. I felt like I was watching a time warp from the 1950s when some male coaches and teachers could physically and verbally abuse students with homophobic and sexist rage, shame, and almost unimaginable humiliation. Further imagine a teacher who uses your deepest and darkest secrets such as the abandonment from your own mother to repeatedly scream at you ""That she left you and your father because you are worthless pieces of s**t"". Chazelle seriously subjects the audience to his belief that this deeply scarring rage and abuse is required to create a great musician. This movie is more of a deeply disturbing example of why many men will never begin to heal from the layers of shame, depression, and rage. I 'd hate to see this movie nominated for anything and suggest it's creator pick up a book about what really motivates people and recent research into shame, humiliation and the real material of greatness.",0
76,"About 15 minutes in, the sadistic, autocratic jazz (?!) instructor played by J.K. Simmons screams, berates and belittles a trombone player for being out of tune, kicks him out of the class, then confesses that the student wasn't really out of tune. That's when I walked out. My time is too precious for unrealistic crap like this. My first thought was how could such an individual get into a position of authority without students, parents, and co-workers all filing harassment complaints against him! It's just not believable. And then there's the fact that he's teaching jazz -- one of the most un-strict musical genres out there -- the whole point of jazz is spontaneity, improvisation, a willingness to BE imperfect -- I could believe an authoritarian conductor in classical music, but not in jazz.",0

79,"Heart pounding, pure, vibrant energy expelled from this movie like sweat on a drummers forehead. Whiplash is without a doubt, the best movie of 2014. Incredible, there is no focus on any side romance to the point of physical annoyance, there is just a boy, his teacher of high torment and comedy, and a dream that doesn't come easy.",1
80,"Trite.  The renowned Jonathan Schwartz says ""Jazz is the sound of surprise.""  That sound is missing here.  Predictable, cliched, and dull, and no doubt some kind of cathartic outlet for seniors (the majority of current moviegoers) where J.K. Simmons represents the overly demanding/never satisfied parent and Paul Rieser the unconditional love/support icon.  Neither suffer any consequence for their actions, it's Miles Teller's character that is the reagent to their catalyst - a mushy dollop of clay for them to shape - and the audience is left with no clear moral consequences for any of their actions.",0
81,"Intense, gripping and phenomenal at the very least.  ""Whiplash"" tells the story of the complicated relationship between Andrew Neyman, an ambitious jazz drummer who dreams of rising to the top of his elite music conservatory, and Terrance Fletcher, a famed and albeit, ruthless conductor who carves out his perfect musician by pushing his students to the edge physically, emotionally and mentally. Acting is perfect, with Teller and Simmons giving extraordinary performances with Simmons getting a well deserved Academy Award Nomination for his efforts. The plot itself is intense and packed with drama from start to finish that doesn't let up until the final act when it comes to an explosive and satisfying conclusion. Loved the movie almost instantly, a definite must watch and well deserving of its many award nominations and wins.",1
82,This is not a film about Jazz. It is about a sadist who realizes he can prey on relatively innocent students successfully. It is difficult to watch bullying at this level.,1
84,"In so little movies do you see such passion and intensity in a movie not just about music but about how far someone is willing to go to be who they want to be and do what they want to do. Teller and JK Simmons reminds me of the quote in The Dark Knight 'This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object' Teller is shown to sacrifice nearly everything for a chance at the top, his family, his girlfriend and will go through hell if there is a slice of heaven. JK Simmons plays not only the tough guy but the guy that will push 99 percent of his students to breaking point. His acts even with honourable intentions can't even be justified but that is what makes his character such a stand out. He believes that what he does no matter how bad of a person he seems to be is not for him but to find the one percent that don't break from his hurling insults but rises. Whiplash is easily one of 2014 great films and will stand the test of time for not only music movies but movies as a whole.",1
85,"One of the worst and most offensive films I have ever seen. I see where they're going with the direction, and I can see that they tried, but the gay-bashing words, the ridiculousness of the plot, and one of the most overrated actors of our time (Miles Teller) delivering a terrible performance makes this one of the worst movies I've seen in recent times.",0
86,"An extravagant mentor with a lot of style who pushes the young pupils to the edge and pupils playing the mentor's game... I've seen that in House, Devil Wears Prada, even in Hell's Kitchen... and now in Whiplash. This movie is nothing but an old plot with a new costume, one that adds a hip/cult aspect to it and will extract good comments from posers who want to look hip and cult. Very superficial though and get bored when you watch a movie that does exactly what thousands of movies have done before, don't bother watching. One point to Simmons and one point to the music though.",0

92,"J.K. Simmons delivered the scene that made me cry as Ellen Page's dad in ""Juno,"" so I was interested to see what the veteran actor would bring to this Oscar-winning role. He doesn't disappoint. As the mean music teacher, he brings perfect control and nuanced nastiness, not to mention showcasing his (who knew?!) extensive musical background. So, worth seeing for all this. The plot itself is extremely unrealistic, however. He could be Coltrane, Monk and Gershwin rolled into one, but never would this kind of sadistic severity be tolerated at any school in the country. Also, two exhausting words: ""Drum solos.""",1
93,"Pros: score, cinematography. Cons: plot line wobbled on credibility, (surprisingly) performance of Simmons as the domineering band instructor. I was in the mood for a test-your-dream story set in the music world, and Whiplash delivered. The basic story arc of an ambitious musician finding what he's made of in the New York performing arts world is delivered in workmanlike fashion. Ultimately, however, I did not fear Simmons as the instructor, and thought too much of his dialogue was re-worked from the drill instructor in ""Full Metal Jacket."" Here, I may have been the victim of high expectations, given the Academy Awards. The drumming performances were quite compelling, at least to a non-expert such as myself, and drew me in to the history of jazz, with Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker key icons of the shared values of the main characters. I thought the final act was a little contrived to arrive at a Hollywood climax, resulting in the pacing of the story becoming more uneven. Ultimately, if this movie rates universal acclaim, then ""The Paper Chase"" would as well, and I don't think most critics would put the latter in cinema's top echelon.",1
94,"Whiplash, as the name suggests, packs a serious punch. There hasn’t been a musical movie, or any movie for that matter, that gives such intense human relationship. The film brings a rich drama performed by engaging actors, it is crude in its nature but also possesses classy rhythm. Its mix of true to live cinematography and brilliantly pace musical score is edited so well, audience can’t help to be drawn to its excellent tension. Andrew Nieman (Milles Teller) is a drummer and student in one of the best music schools. He’s recruited by Terrence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), a well-known teacher who’s searching for a new musician to join his band. Nieman is a very dedicated young man, he strives to win Fletcher’s approval but little did he know that Fletcher’s method of teaching is rather unorthodox. The way Fletcher motivates his students is with a lot of profanities, overly honest assessment and borderline abusive behavior. Lots of stick with barely any carrot. The two are embroiled in an odd relationship, and both leads perform magnificently. Milles Teller represents the youthful ambitious character with hidden aggressive poise. Whereas Simmons as Fletcher is brilliantly antagonistic, he’s a mentor but often time he resembles a manipulative enemy. From his body language and yell Simmons is too convincing, it could be unnerving at times, in the best possible way. If he had the opportunity like this in old Spider-Man movies as he portrayed the pushy editor, they would have been truly amazing. Camerawork captures the flow meticulously and mostly in close-up, it often pans back or slowly approaches the scene, allowing the audience to have a sense of the setting. However, when the music hits, it goes into high gears. Switching back and forth between the plowing of the drum, characters’ subtle expressions or winces, down to the blood and sweat. The film’s editing is wonderfully fitting, each frame is also accompanied by a spirited explosion of instruments. It’s powerful, inevitably engrossingly. Whiplash is a monster of a movie, never skipping a beat. Rude, brash but stylishly captivating.",1
96,"Few might expect an indie drama about a dysfunctional mentor-student relationship about jazz-drum can be such a thrilling adrenaline drive, WHIPLASH, which not only proudly joins the elite top 8 in the upcoming Oscar BEST PICTURE nominees, but is also counted as a major contender in for a harvest (with J.K. Simmons undisputedly has BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR in his bag). It is also hard to imagine this is only young director Damien Chazelle’s second feature, after his less-seen debut GUY AND MADELINE ON A PARK BENCH (2009), WHIPLASH is such a full-grown piece of gem, with the slithering camera movement, a plethora of intensive close-ups and snappy editing, a buzzy audio surrounding and the irresistible jazzy soundtrack, it engages us with a daunting study of the pursuit of being the greatest and a spellbinding and unblemished mental orgasm in its fierce solo-drum finale. keep reading my review on my blog, google: cinema omnivore, thanks",1
97,"I had been recommended Whiplash about 4 years ago now, for some odd reason I thought it was a movie about women's roller derby, so it was quite a surprise when I showed my girlfriend the trailer to decide what to watch for the night. Nonetheless, the trailer looked intense, but most of all I loved that it centered around jazz drums. I'm not much of a musician, but as a failed musician I can fully respect how difficult jazz drums are and fully appreciate the craft.This movie is intense. There were times I was on the edge of my seat, gripping my seat, and so drawn into the movie afraid of where it may or may not go. The acting is absolutely phenomenal on all fronts, Miles Teller (Andrew) and J.K. Simmons (Fletcher) *really* sell the intensity, emotion, and drama that fills the movie. This is not a ""come home to relax"" movie, this is a movie that demands your attention through and through.As the movie focuses on jazz drumming, and a rigorous pace at which the teacher (J.K. Simmons) demands of his students, music is crucial to the enjoyment of this film. I couldn't help but sit and watch this movie in absolute awe through the drumming sequences and seeing the band come together in totality. The music and acting are S-tier in my opinion.Now the bad. There are two story points that really felt underdeveloped. The ""love"" portion felt rushed. There are four scenes that bring it to life. The first is when we first see Andrew interact with Nicole in the movies, there's a slight flirtatious tension. The second scene is Andrew asking her out and her accepting. The third is Andrew breaking up with her at some unspecified time down the road to pursue his drumming. It's assumed that it's been at least some time because she's clearly distraught, but the time-frame is unknown and it's hard to feel invested or that it was quite an important decision due to this. Then there's the last part where he's quit drumming and tries to call her back, which we never revisit. Everything about the romance arc is rushed and abandoned. The movie is 1 hour and 45 minutes, they could have given another 5 minutes to make us feel the weight of his decision more thoroughly.My other issue with the story is the sort of Stockholm syndrome that Andrew feels towards Fletcher. No matter how hard Fletcher pushes Andrew he still follows along sort of like a wounded puppy. Nevermind the glossed over detail that Fletcher's method of teaching pushed a kid to killing himself. They explain this, of course, through a dialog that is harped on that Fletcher felt he needed to push people past their limits to *truly* become great. I get it, but it felt a bit shallow.With that said, I truly loved this movie despite the two issues I have with it. This was an exhilarating movie and one I won't forget for some time.",1
98,"This film is one of the most intense I have maybe ever seen. Tauter than most horror movies, this is a truly harrowing film. I have never had such a physical and mental reaction to a movie as I did with this one; my body was tightly wound, and I experienced true anxiety throughout. The performances are brilliant, and the music is incredible. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough, I found it to be one of the best movies of the last decade (at least!)",1
99,A truly amazing movie. It really packs a punch. J.K. Simmons deserves all the accolades that he has received for this film. Damien Chazelle has directed a masterpiece.,1
100,"Damn is this one intense. Throughout, this one makes you feel as though you are the one being screamed at and belittled. Wow. Stellar direction from Damien Chazelle, insane to think that this is his directorial debut. The sky is the limit for this wonderful talent. The writing is strong and wherever it stalls or the story stalls, the direction is strong enough to make up for it. Though, what really makes this film is the acting. Miles  Teller and JK Simmons are MARVELOUS. I really wish the studio was able to campaign for both of them, because Teller deserved recognition for this role as well, though I am glad that Simmons rightfully received numerous accolades. Teller has a bright future ahead of him if this and The Spectacular Now are any indication, as he was brilliant. I never expected a film about orchestra to be as harrowing and intense as this, but man oh man does Whiplash ever keep you on the edge of your seat. The interactions between Teller and Simmons rival that of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs, that is how intense and well done they are, as that is my favorite film of all-time. What prevents me from giving this one a higher rating, however, is that you can tell this was a short film stretched out to feature length. While stuff added certainly adds to the overall film, the odd romantic element served little-to-no purpose and any development could have been achieved elsewhere. In addition, even his relationship with his father felt like filler to add to the run time. This film is about a kid who plays drums who wants to be great and his overly intense teacher. If the film had stayed a bit more focused in that regard, I would have given it a higher rating. As it stands though, Whiplash is a terrific film that displays the talents of both Miles Teller and JK Simmons, while also establishing Damien Chazelle as a director to keep an eye on.",1
101,"Only few films can inspire and move you, Whiplash is one of these few examples. Continual tension throughout the well paced emotional film, will keep you induced until the very last beat.",1
102,"Amazing movie, amazing performances, beautifully crafted script and great jaz music.I felt like I am living the story while watching it. Miles Teller should've been nominated for an oscar.",1
103,"I liked  J.K. Simmons's performance, otherwise in my opinion the movie is overrated: the story is predictable, the main character is not charismatic and not interesting as a character. I'd say the movie is similar to Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"", though the latter is more moody and intense.",1
104,"I never imagined that a drumming movie could be so intense and suspenseful. Teller puts in an amazing, somewhat more subtle performance that was somewhat overshadowed by the extremes of Simmons' character. The directing is masterful.",1
105,"Riveting from start to finish. You invest in Tellar's desire to be the next great drummer and he must go through J.K Simmons' class, which is no easy feat. And what transpires is an exhilarating and tense ride full of eye opening confrontations anchored by incredible acting, especially from Simmons. This is one of 2014's very best for sure.",1
106,"Intense and emotionally-charged, with incredible performances from both Simmons (oh my God, Simmons...) and Teller, and an absolutely beautiful picture and direction from Damien Chazelle, ""Whiplash"" kept me on the edge of my seat despite its minimalist feel and story.",1
107,"Wow. I just got my ass whooped. Only a few films have kept me as rapt, on edge, moved, and as terrified as this one has. ""Whiplash"" truly is one of the most visceral, absorbing, and powerful films I've seen in years. Thank you sir, may I have another.",1
108,"Whiplash is a tense, orchestrated, beautiful movie, with a dense story that has a lot to offer, with great music and a greatly crafted script. The movie's highest points are the actings, the story, the unparalleled cinematography and great script, even if it's not a masterpiece per se, it is astounding and powerful in almost every way. The plot presents itself very short and simple at first, as it unravels patiently to the rise of Neyman(Mile Teller) as a drummer. It seems very simple - but it definetly isn't, Andrew is a complex character in a tense environment, and Miles represents him very well. But even better, J.K. Simmons plays an excellent part, bringing not only the most tense movie's parts, but also many great comic reliefs and moments of reflexion. Every character in play brings an emotional tone that works very well with Neyman's saga. Besides the great casting, there is an intense line of work behind the scripts and cinematography. Every other scene can be noticed a colour play or camera angles that contribute to the develop of the story. One such example is the varying of Andrew's clothes, or the great representation of the blood coming out of his hand when he puts it in the water jar. It is all so greatly represented with perfectly timed camera movements and unique representative takes that show a very thoughtful job. Alongside this impressive line of work comes to great elements:the story and the soundtrack. The story itself is very good, with great script around it, and shows very little mistakes along the way, and builds up a excellent climax - something that few people would expect from such movies - it's attention to the the way of storytelling make up for most of the empty little holes it leaves behind. And to complete it all, the soundtrack is right on spot with the jazz mood, bringing many classics up to the table and giving their place on the spotlight. In overall, the movie is probably not one of the world's best to date, but it definitely is one of the year's top 3, with unique composture, patient pace and astounding technichal work. It is one of the best musical thrillers made up to date 9.4/10",1

110,"Wow.  What an incredible movie is Whiplash.  It's just so engrossing, so well written, so intense, so good on every level.  It's also one of the best shot movies I've ever seen.  J.K. Simmons is absolutely amazing, and I can see why he swept all the supporting actor awards.  Miles Teller is also very, very good.  You're put right into his spot the entire movie, not literally, but through the direction and writing, you can feel every ounce of his character's anger and ambition. Out of all the best picture nominees from last year, I think this was the best.  See it as soon as possible.",1
111,"As a student in Bulgaria's national music academy, i can honestly say that this movie is one of the most inspiring movies i've ever seen! Superb story!",1
112,"Since ""La La Land"" is out in theaters, I thought I would take a look back at Damien Chazelle's big hit of 2014. And man oh man is this something. ""Whiplash"" is an intensely electrifying drama that never lets up. Everything about this movie is spectacular thanks to unique editing, a great script, and performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons that really elevate the movie to a whole new level. Without their chemistry, the movie would not be even close to what it became. It is a movie that questions how far you are willing to go to achieve your dreams. The movie presents its ideas in such an unflinching way that it draws you in with its intensity. There were moments in this movie that legitimately made my heart race. Most action thrillers now of days don't come anywhere close to giving me that same effect. Now that is saying something. From beginning to end it continuously builds and builds to a remarkable climax that was so satisfying to witness. It's the kind of underdog ending that was just so well deserved. Overall, Damien Chazelle has a made one of the best movies not only of the decade but of all time. I give ""Whiplash"" an A+!",1
114,"I loved this movie. A tight script with two, nasty, dueling main characters. The teacher/student relationship has been explored many times before, but in this movie the twist is that both are unpleasant in their own way. Both Teller (as Andrew the student) and Simmons (as Fletcher the teacher) were very good and Simmons definitely deserved the Oscar. For once, I loved that I did not need to pick a side but I could just enjoy the ride and see how these two ambitious, arrogant and toxic personalities were going to hurt (or help?) each other. Also, I do not usually like open endings, but in this case I found it very appropriate. The music is great, as it was expected. The photography is also good and the story does not drag along for a single minute, as it happens far too often nowadays. Highly recommended.",1
115,"This movie likes to whip my heart to ashes. It's that good. This movie is freaking incredible! There's like nothing out there that's not even close to Whiplash. It's one movie of its kind with incredible characters and real chemistry between them! I mean just look at J.K Simmons in Spiderman and imagine him with much less patience and a much more scarier attitude; thats exactly what he's Whiplash. He's freaking incredible, scary and really an outstanding performance! That Oscar really is well deserved! The dialogs are just as awesome, and all the main characters are really relatable. Andrew is in the first 30 minutes like this shy boy, but really develops into something greater. This movie really found a place in my heart, not from a romance-perspective but more in a relatable one, because holy **** I can definitely relate to Andrew's hard fight to accomplish success, to fight and not to give up. He gets frustrated, depressed and tries harder and harder, but doesn't give up. That's almost like life in a nutshell. It's a really great movie that truly surpassed my expectations. It's not boring for me, but might be for someone else. But you can't ignore the excellent cinematography, it's superb! I'm literary standing up, clapping to Whiplash to its cool, flawless, unique and characteristic aspects.Well done! 8/10",1
116,"Don't you watcher wait for action, great adventures or things of genre. You can just appreciate an interesting, emotional and tense story, reinforced for dark color palette.",1
117,"Great movie that at last gives a simple, but clear message: If you truly and deeply love something, you have to fight for it; so is music, so is the world.",1
118,"This is a very well acted movie about personal motivation and human frailty. However, it is not a Scorsese  movie. It is not a war movie. It is not a crime movie. It is not a Showtime or HBO movie either.  By this I allude to the excessive use of the F word.The F word does not a movie make and often detracts from an otherwise great movie.  Such is the case with Whiplash.  Perhaps scriptwriters no not have an overwhelming vocabulary to express themselves appropriately? Nonetheless, Whiplash is a movie worth watching",1
119,"Whiplash es una película que resulta atronadoramente letal y colosalmente intensa en toda su atmósfera. Esta película logra ejercerse como un film intrépido y extremadamente potente, que no deja su constante y gran ritmo que contiene desde que empieza hasta que termina, y quien toca a fondo es nada más y nada menos que J.K Simons que ofrece una interpretación inquietante y explosiva, dejando que este largometraje es abrumador, consecutivo, atrapante y rítmico que consigue exitosamente encontrar un grandioso y magnífico sonido de batería.",1
120,"Very nice movie, the actors deserve an oscar, I can watch this movie 10 times over and over, one of bes movies I saw ever . There are like maybe only 23 movies I can watch multiple times .",1
121,Wow!! what an intense movie. Simmons killed it with his oscar-winning performance. The music is amazing and the story is gripping. A superb movie that describes an intense yet respectful relationship between a music teacher and his student. Recommed,1
122,"Bummed to see that Whiplash didn't get the Oscar. Thought it was slightly superior to ""Birdman"", not that that movie wasn't great -- it was really good -- but I found this one to be more inspiring and ambitious, with Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons providing all-star performances, an intense script filled with quotable dialogue, and relentlessly smooth pacing. Excellent film, that avoids musical clichés and has a nice sound of drum added to it. Final Score: 9/10",1
123,"Absolutely wonderful film. Honestly the best thing I have seen in years, if not ever. Wonderful, supurb, exciting, exhilarating, captivating, inspiring, damn good. Go see. Done.",1
125,"I enjoy watching movies that slowly becomes better as the plot furthers. Whiplash is one of those movies. Originally a 8 during the first act, then a 9 during the second and third act and a perfect 10 in the final 10 minutes of the movie before the credits starts rolling. I am unfamiliar with classical music but I like how this movie does not isolate the audience who have no idea about the genre. In fact, I have learned a little bit more about classical music thanks to this movie. I like movies that make me learn and open-minded about certain things. Whiplash has some of the greatest performances. We all know that J.K. Simmons is talented as hell. He became a different person in this movie, not as an actor in a movie. He isn’t some guy who voiced Tenzin in The Legend of Korra. In this movie, he is a psychopathic selfish scary douchebag and he owned that role like he was born to play him! Miles Teller is also a great actor in this movie. He manages to pull off the emotions and thoughts of his character very well that he is invested to his own character and ended up being the character in the movie and not some actor in a movie. That goes the same with J.K. Simmons. Both of them are brilliant actors! Whiplash’s plot pace is slow but not dragging at all. Mainly because there is almost no subplot. This movie is straightforward with its main plot. Sure, you can consider the romance between Miles Teller’s character and the love interest played by Melissa Benoist (another great actress) a subplot. That’s why I said almost earlier in this paragraph. In the technical work in this movie, it’s brilliantly perfect. The screenplay is of course excellent. The camerawork was on cue without any hint of error. The editing elevates the camerawork brilliantly. The cinematography is excellent and of course, the directing is perfect. Whiplash is a brilliant psychological drama thanks to its brilliant performances from J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller, on point plot and on time pace and excellent production values. Does this movie deserve an Oscar nomination? Yes absolutely.",1
126,"Whiplash definitely earned its best picture nomination this year! I've never seen a music movie that was so intense. There are really only two actors in this film that matter and they are Miles Teller and JK Simmons. Miles Teller is a young man who will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come (especially with his involvement in the reboot of the Fantastic Four). Teller can act, and he could have been nominated for an Oscar for this role. Teller is a veteran drummer so this story was something that he was certainly passionate about and that passion is apparent throughout the film. I'm glad they didn't stick a rookie behind the kit. JK Simmons, who has already won a Golden Globe for this performance, was so amazing. This guy came out of no where. The biggest role Simmons had was playing J Jonah Jameson in the original Spiderman trilogy and he played him beautifully, but Whiplash will be the film he is remembered for. He is up for an Oscar for this film and I think the odds are likely in his favor considering the competition. I think that anyone can enjoy Whiplash because of its intensity.",1
127,"This may be one of the best movies that I have ever seen. That's really all I have to say on the matter The only reason it isn't a 10/10 is because it did'n't quite have everything I would like in a movie, but it is phenomenal none the less.. If you have a free hour and forty minutes and want to spend it in the best way humanly possible (comfort of your living room wise, this doesn't quite beat doing blow off of the small of Woody Harrelson's back while skydiving, but damn is it close) then this movie is a must see. It's all about a 19 year old (Miles Teller) wanting to be one of the greats at the drums, so he turns to a teacher (J.K. Simmons) with less than orthodox teaching style that does get its results. This movie perfected suspense for me, I was alert the whole time, I could barely take my eyes off the screen each time I've watched it, I was to busy waiting for the next scene to happen. Its been a while since a movie has drawn me in so much, I became invested in the main characters journey and in the acting of J.K. Simmons. Whiplash is all about being pushed beyond what is expected of normal people, to reach the extraordinary results, just from one viewing of this inspirational film even the most useless of procrastinators would get up off their ass to try something. I know I had that feeling. Alright, I've probably said to much already, this is great, go watch it, and that's that. If you watch this and don't agree, we can either settle this with a long winded internet argument, or like men in the streets with bars of soap in soccer socks. Yeah, I'm that serious about this movie. But whats not to like, some good ol' intense acting, a very colorful pallet of swears (this movie is a learning experience in the field of vulgarity, and some incredible music numbers, specifically the drums, it is amazing.",1
128,"Gripping, intense and emotional, the harrowing Whiplash finds stars J.K. Simmons & Miles Teller in top form and Damien Chazelle dazzling in his full feature film debut.",1
130,"A great and intense character study of two overly ambitious musicians. Damien Chazelle wrote the characters in an amazing way that makes you understand every aspect of them. The only issue i had was that the secondary characters were underdeveloped and were a little unnecessary to the elements of the story. But apart from that amazing movie! I can recommend this one to everyone, is a movie for all audiences!",1
131,"A little awkward in the beginning and focuses a little too much of the forcing kind of motivational experience, which didn't actually appeal to me, nor I understand it. Also this kind of teaching technique was not actually justified even in this movie. Apart from this, the movie wasn't half bad and is easy to watch and the drumming parts did a good job as an additional entertainment. There is some blood in it, and it depends if you take this too seriously or with a pinch of salt. I was from the latter type. Overall: it is recommendable, but probably not to every audience.",1
132,"It's tense, it's emotional and it never lets go. We follow the journey of a passionate individual in search of greatness. See him rise and fall, rise and fall again and again until it is clear... greatness isn't",1
133,"One of the most intense movies I've ever watched in my life. The psychological battle between a great Miles Teller and a mesmerizing J.K. Simmons had me on edge throughout the entire run time. Beautifully filmed and masterfully edited, Whiplash will hold your attention to the end and features one of my favorite movie endings of all time.",1
135,"Whiplash is a beautiful, well acted, well edited film with some great jazz music and career altering performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. This is a film not only for jazz enthusiasts, but for film lovers in general.",1
136,"This is a teriffic movie, with very talented Miles and fantastic Simmons. Beautiful story about hard work and success, with artistic directing. I can just say I was impressed. Especially while watching this on 5.1 DTS, sound is abou 60% of this movie.",1
137,"When you read the plot of Whiplash, you don’t really get too excited about it. Just a movie about a drummer who wants to be really good, and does whatever he can to do that. But then, you go to see the movie, and it’s definitively not what you were expecting. It’s a lot more. This movie is exciting, intense and dramatic. The story, being a little unoriginal, is excellently told making it very interesting and you are always going to want to know what’s next. It’s about music, but you really don’t need to be a musician to understand what’s going on, and that’s something I really liked.Also, Whiplash would not be Whiplash if it wasn’t for the actors. The movie focus extremely well on its characters, and that’s well rewarded with J.K. Simmons giving one of the best performances of the entire 2014. He is just excellent. And Miles Teller, he is also absolutely terrific, making you actually feel with him what happens. They both connect incredibly well, and there’s truly a psychological fight between them that can easily be noted.The only thing that I disliked was the fact that there were certain moments in which you think the movie is not going anywhere. Even when those things are solved by the ending.This is an excellent film, and you really don’t want to miss it.Real score: 9.7",1
138,"Exhilarating and dramatic, Whiplash is an expertly crafted film detailing the incessant drive for perfection and greatness while allowing the viewer to answer the questions raised themselves on perfectionism and how far one should be pushed to reach their full potential. Anxiousness is shared with the students of Fletcher as he berates them, the intensity of J.K Simmons practically leaps out of the screen at you. Ultimately the films two leads carry the films emotional weight with incredible conviction through literal blood, sweat and tears. And, needless to say, the soundtrack is superb, anything less wouldn't cut it.",1
139,"This film is **** beautiful. If your into music and jazz go watch this movie now, the film is an amazing peice of art with great performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. I will not go into everything about this film but i will talk about the ending scene not what happens in it but how stunning and how good it is, the ending was probably one of the best endings to a film of 2014, Interstellar's was great but i have to give this one to Whiplash. The solo at the end made me get so pumped for the end and made me feel so happy. If your into music go watch this movie instantly. Its a must watch with amazing acting as well as brilliant preformances.",1
140,"Intense and riveting, had me glued to the screen the whole movie.  I heard a lot of gasps from the audience, along with some ohhh's, and ahh's, one thing that is for sure you will hate Simmon's so much that you will love him!  I had to go see what all the buzz was about as I have loved Simmons in other roles.  I can say this is one of those movies that does live up to all the hype.  Go see it for yourself.",1
141,"Whiplash is a film about honing in on your destiny and having the determination and drive to carry it out, no matter the cost. Tremendously acted and extremely relatable to anyone with a dream, Whiplash was a refreshing, tense, and engaging drama. Set in the New York City, the city of talent and dreams Teller gives a riveting spellbinding, Oscar-worthy performance. Laugh out loud hilarious, this is the best I have seen Simmons in years. Like jazz, the tempo of the movie was constantly changing adding to the exhilarating climax and denouement.  You will love it. A classic.",1
142,stupendous effort! emotional and worthy. The music was best. Simmons performance was very nice. He showed an intense teaching and his retribution was very natural.,1
143,"This film is the best I've seen in a lot of time. It has such intense scenes that I even started clenching my teeth unintentionally at some points. JK Simmons acting is so good that it really makes you want to punch him in the face almost through the entire movie; Miles Teller does a good job also, if you are a musician you probably will feel some kind of connection with his character. All in all this movie has great acting, good storyline, and a perfect soundtrack.",1
144,"Incredibly excellent: the tension, the trials and tribulations, the exhiliration in witnessing what hard work and effort look like (rarely portrayed in picture-perfect hollywood), and the questions you are forced to answer while watching this film. Those who gave it anything less than a stellar rating didn't quite understand what the film was about. One of the best movies of 2014 by far.",1
145,Intense and breathtaking! It's like a horror movie set to music. JK Simmons is a monster - perfectly portrayed. Great twists and turns. Definitely worth seeing.,1
146,"An amazing film with great performances, great direction and a great finale. Watching J.K Simmons shouting at Miles Teller and then seeing Miles Teller rise up is the most tension filled combination of 2014.",1
148,"One of the best of the year, JK Simmons is amazing. Finally he got his well-deserved shot and it paid off. Every single detail on camera was handled perfectly, great sound, i felt like if i actually was listening to the band play live.",1
150,It was intense and it left me anxious throughout the whole film. Biting my nail and sweaty. The perfect film that i been waiting for years. The best movie I have ever seen,1
151,Whiplash movie was very good.  The story was excellent as well as the acting.  The only drawback that I feel that there was in the movie there was an excessive amount of foul language being used.,1
152,"Con un guión brillante, unas actuaciones poderosas y una fotografía deslumbrante, Chazelle crea una historia sobre las pasión por lo que sueñas ser en el mundo y lo que estás dispuesto a hacer para lograrlo.",1
153,Teller and Simmons showed their best act in their life. I hope can see a 18minute short film that Chazalle made it. It was my best movie in 2014 with Boyhood and Birdman.,1
154,"A very intense speed ride with gruesome emotion, its a lightning bolt clashing against lightning bolt and the crackling of the drum its a gut wrenching exhilarating thriller not to be missed, and a triumphal breakthrough for TV veteran JK Simmons and teen Hollywood newcomer Miles Teller!",1
156,"Whiplash is a fantastic and darkly comic drama about a drummer who wants to be ""one of the greats."" The only thing in his way is his extremely strict and overly mean music instructor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). J. Jonah. Jameson pales in comparison when it comes to mean-ness. Throughout the whole movie I was entertained, yet disturbed because of how incredibly mean this music instructor is, but that doesn't stop the young drummer, Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) from exceeding everyone's expectations. Whiplash is a thrill ride from start to finish. 9/10",1
157,Fantastic. JK Simmons makes the f-word look like a clean word. Miles Teller did very well in his drumming and his pushing away family and girlfriend for the teacher. Great character study. Music students should watch this movie as well as anyone who wants to achieve greatness.,1
158,"Whiplash is awesome. I am saying this. Awesome! When I first saw the trailer, I was like - ""OK this is gonna be fun, I think I should see it"". Then I went to the theatre and came out  and I'm like "" Holy s***. Whiplash is such an awesome drama movie."" I never thought that a drama could be that kick-ass. Whiplash is my favourite movie of 2014 for sure.",1
159,"Let me just start by saying the best part by far for the movie was the drum playing by Miles Teller. Man, that guy can play extremely well, and he can also act extremely well. In my opinion however, the true star was J.K. Simmons, as if the movie were without him, I felt like the movie would not have the power and the emotion that it had gave.",1
160,"Whiplash is a brutal movie about a young man obsessed with becoming as good a drummer as physically possible and an instructor who pushes him as far as he can go with no mercy. You might think it looks boring, but it's actually quite entertaining. I can see why some think it's a true masterpiece but I wouldn't go as far as to say that. It's a very good movie that makes people wonder what will happen next as the drummer's insanity (not literal insanity) increases and the instructor keeps pushing him further and further. He takes the abuse, though, as he seems to think it helps him. Anyways, watch the movie (not to sound demanding). Trust me, it's worth your time.",1
161,"""The Road to Greatness Can Take You to the Edge.""  Without a doubt Whiplash takes you to the edge of a musicians desperation for greatness.  All greatness requires sacrifice... but what if you want to be THE greatest?  Would you let go of everything precious to you (including yourself) just so that strangers will remember your name?  I wouldn't, but it makes for an intense and powerful movie.",1
162,"Mesmerizing. The deep, challenging relation between a master and his pupil, played at the pace of a jazz jam session, and the movie never misses a beat. J.F. Simmons in the best role of his career delivers a stunning performance, while it's a true epiphany for Miles Teller: who would ever have expected that the shy kid of Rabbit Hole could have turned into such a powerful tiger?",1
163,"This film reaches what others can't do: the anxiety, the final colapse, the drums constantly dragging.There are only two words to describe it: absolute masterpiece or like they say in the film: good job!!Best film of the year!!",1
164,"One of the greatest movies I have ever seen, Being a drummer myself, I was glued to the screen. I enjoyed everything about this movie. Especially the legendary actor, J.K. Simmons",1
167,"Whiplash is one of the best films to premiere at Sundance and is one of the best films I've seen in a while. Everything in this movie is perfect. The writing, the directing, the story. The thing that sells this movie is the acting. This film is easily J.K. Simmons's best acting role.",1
168,"This is the kind of movie that will keep you engaged from beginning to end. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons both give knock-out performances and are able to create characters that seem effortlessly raw and vulnerable. Being a high-level musician myself and having experienced band rehearsal and wacky music teachers, I was thoroughly impressed by the realness of the characters and the dialogue. There is a specific atmosphere that Damien Chazelle creates that is persistent throughout the film and ever so intriguing. From the script to the plot to the acting, Whiplash is hands-down one of the best movies of 2014.",1
169,"Nerve-cracking film! A great performance for both J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller which added to the film's emotional mood. The editing is very great (all those sweat and blood in the drumset) and the sound editing is majestic. Of course, Damien Chazelle just nailed this movie despite the lack of experience in directing, he must've been nominated for the Oscar in directing. Indeed, a whiplash!",1
170,"Whiplash was an extremely emotional film in every way, and the statements of Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons were the best, the story is full of great and furious moments, and leads to a reflection about fulfilling our dreams and overcoming difficulties, an extremely powerful movie.",1
171,"This is classified as a drama movie, but I'm a music student. This is a horror movie. Still a great movie if you don't mind a little emotional abuse. Okay, a lot of emotional abuse.",1
172,"I reviewed “Whiplash” cooperatively with some coworkers. We just stood around saying “Whiplash” to one another with ever-increasing excitement. Allow me to better articulate… It’s about damn time J.K. Simmons had a real role. That one kid from that thing is pretty damn fantastic too, all drumming aside. For a very small film there is a dark intensity that bristles through both leads as well as the photography and sound design that feels like big league production and career-defining performance. Unique, well-crafted, but above all: gripping. You really can’t look away and when the curtain falls it’s hard not to just sit there and wonder if you can or should watch it again. It is one of those rare glimpses into the damage it takes to create true art. That broken quality is usually a kind of unexamined trade-off, accepted posthumously as the price of genius in biopics and documentaries. You never get to see it play a live set. You never get to see two broken people make a great and terrifying whole in a way that feels as magnetic as it does disturbing. Watch “Whiplash”. Argue with people about how much it is okay to sacrifice for art, or pride, or the chance to create something only you can create. Argue and fight. It likes it when you fight.",1
173,"Directed by Damien Chazelle, ""Whiplash"" is an American drama film based on the film director´s experiences in the Princeton High School Studio Band. This stunning film which is starred by Miles Teller as Andrew who is the main character, J. K. Simmons as his teacher, Paul Reiser as Andrew´s father and Melissa Benoist as Andrew´s lover, is about the relationship between an ambitious jazz student and an extremely strict teacher,The story begins when Andrew Neiman,a first-year jazz student  at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory, is discovered by the most respected teacher at that conservatory while playing the drums in a music room late one night. Eventually, he invites him to his band and puts him through a series of tests not only of his drumming but also of his resilience. Will Andrew be able to live up to the challenge or will he give up?The movie is filled with tension as Fletcher demands more and more of his talented student pushing him to the limit. The flick raises some questions as to how far teachers should go in order to achieve excellence. Both Miles Teller and  J. K. Simmons give convincing performances as the film goes on which is accompanied by the top New York jazz music. Simmons won an Oscar for his part and he truly deserves it.I thoroughly recommend ""Whiplash"". This highly-entertaining must-see will keep the audience at the edge of their seats. Do not miss this thought-provoking masterpiece! You won´t regret it!",1

The term ""Whiplash backlash"" has been used to describe the reaction to the film by those who disliked it.",1
180,"This movie really does give you whiplash by the end.  This is probably the most intense movie I've ever seen in my life. If you've ever been in a band, or had a teacher who was somewhat like this, it can easily hit close to home.",1
181,"Martin Scorsese used to say something along the lines that ""Raging Bull"" was a great film in spite of being about boxing, which only serves as a ""black box"" to contain the drama and shots.Even though the black box in this film is jazz, mainly it's about ABUSE. WHIPLASH also deserves the category of great and original films, and is really an anachronism, like the jazz age of old, to the world and mainstream films of today. The surrealism here , along with other notables like ""Black Swan"" that also has unconventional montage sequences, underscores the horrible abuse by Fletcher's character; obviously present in the real musical world, but makes it into hyperbole. I've had music teachers and mentors in my life that have been emotionally abusive, although the physical abuse in this film seems a bit far fetched and a bit removed from reality. Needless to say, it's all very bad in that abuse is abuse, and planned public humiliation is abuse. JK Simmons is truly and after this feat, one of the most gifted character actors of our day, and his passive aggressive maniacal performance will be remembered for years to come. Also,the bipolar nature of this character is more TRUE to actual drill sergeants I encountered years ago in the Air Force, in that they did yell and berate you, etc. and try to mess with your mind by giving you compliments or letting you relax right before they chewed you a new one! This is Machiavellian and more psychologically intense than the full on physical assault of Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket. There are more nuances here. I'll finalize this by saying to those of you out there who've been humiliated or suffered emotional abuse in the music field, you are not alone. But please also, take a Xanax or Valium and don't chug coffee before the film, or you might find yourself wanting to punch someone before you leave the theater. Yes, the film is THAT INTENSE, adrenaline charged, and deserving of many awards!!!",1
182,Holy wow this is next level movie! It could have been a bit shorter (some downtime I noticed) but really well made!  I am surprised with this movie but not surprised that this was Oscar nominated.,1
183,"this film isnt just great, its amazing. whiplash=Amazing the two leads Jk Simmons in particular really show the talent and hard work required in this explosive film about pushing yourself to the absolute limit great movie.",1
184,"This is one of those movies where you put on the best audio equipment you have, and simply sit back and enjoy the show.  The story is wonderful and the music is amazing.  Definitely worth your time.",1
185,"Whiplash is an absolutely fantastic movie that I did not expect to love as much as I did. It has great writing and character development, great casting and performances (J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller), and catchy music. I appreciate the decision to give the film an R rating allowing for more intense scenes involving J.K. Simmons character (they were great!).",1
186,"This movie is superb. It is tense, emotionally challenging and stressful throughout, with fantastic performances from its leading cast. Every aspect of this film is geared towards heightening the anxiety levels, from its cinematography, rapid drum playing scenes and teaching methods. There is abuse and pain, suffering and depth. A truly wonderful film that takes viewers on an emotional thrill ride and leaves them with an extremely memorable closing score.",1
187,"A new meaning for music drama with development plenty of rhythm, supported by despicable but provocative performance of J.K. Simmons. The score composed of tempo is compelling and electrifying. Fortunate debut of director Demian Chazelle.",1
188,Esta para mi fue la mejor película del año 2014  y con una gran actuación por parte de JK Simmons y ademas la cuenta con un gran mensaje de persistir por tus metas.,1
189,"A tour de force debut by Damien Chazelle, the movie is at its best when it narrows its focus to the brilliantly edited practice and performance scenes, which allow JK Simmons to deservedly take that spotlight.  Melissa Benoist makes the most of her role as well.  The film shows the capabilities of a young filmmaker who can confidently and thoughtfully tell a thrilling story about any subject matter.",1
190,"This movie is excellently crafted, from the writing to the directing to the acting and then to the editing. The editing and cinematography work together very well in many of the fast sequences in the movie, and they make the movie a very entertaining watch.",1
191,"2014 #1 movie of the year, made a star out of JK Simmons (who won an oscar for this performance), the reincarnation R Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket, and put Miles Teller on the map.  Damian Chazelle went on to make Lala Land, which I did not care for even though I love Emma Stone (primarily for Birdman, a one shot piece of brilliance) and Ryan Gosling (primarily for his stoic performance in Drive, which was an excellent dilution of Walter Hill's masterpiece The Driver of 1978.",1
192,"A truly beautiful film with challenging characters, incredibleperformances and an extremely effective soundscape and score. Tellerdelivers one of the best performances I've ever had the pleasure ofexperiencing in a film. I have nothing bad to say about Whiplash, amarvellously engaging film.",1
193,"Whiplash is one of the most intense and electrifying, but also- to me- one of the most uplifting and triumphant films. Following Andrew (Miles Teller) a talented, but antisocial and rather underdog drummer at a prestigious conservatory, as he is tutored, abused emotionally and physically and pushed to his limits by Fletcher (a brilliant JK Simmons), a brutal jazz instructor determined to bring the best out of everyone- even if that costs their health and sane mind. Very intense and quick, I literally could hardly breath during this threatening but fantastic movie, which proves Damien Chazelle's brilliance yet again (along with a much different, but equally good La La Land). Teller was great, Simmons was fantastic, and earned a well-deserved Oscar for his performance. In spite of the ""frightening"" plot, this movie is not depressing and leaves you thrilled, uplifted and will be imprinted in your memory forever. Also great was the beautifully poetic last scene and the rythmic drum score that you felt was taking over your heartbeat. Fantastic!",1
194,"An unknown title, by an unknown director, starring an unknown lead, what does that form? Only one of the best damn dramas of this century to date. Inspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused drama is an incredibly complex character study that has newcomer Miles Teller and veteran J.K. Simmons at the top of their game in this brilliant effort, 'Whiplash' is arguably the most riveting and sensational drama from 2014.J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal portrayal. From his profanity-clad embodiment of evil to the ever-hopeful light at the end of the film, we go through stages of loving, hating and even fearing him, a character who despite his occasional moments of sympathy, cares solely about the outcome of his orchestra, and shuns away anyone who tries to destroy that. Simmons's performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement, and one of the most Oscar-deserving performances of recent years.The gold and black colour palette, fast-paced editing, fluent and claustrophobic cinematography - every single component adds a fresh face to 21st century cinema and independent films as a whole, further supporting my conclusion that indie films have overtaken blockbusters for the provision of unique visions and entertainment. Chazelle's effort pays off as he creates not only one of the greatest villains of the 21st century in the form of Fletcher, but also one of the greatest movies of the 21st century, if not of all time, through which he rekindled the dying flame that is jazz.The fusion of emotions throughout make this a film that thrusts the audience into a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation, thus ensuing a tale of inspiration, a man and his dreams of becoming a ""somebody"", and to conclude, let's just note that final drum solo and sense of rebellion Andrew feels, it is utter gold, truly perfect. This movie is powerful, it is intense, it is unique, it is a stunning masterpiece!",1
195,"One of the best films I've seen. The characters, I've never seen unlikable characters been handled this well, in most movies where the characters are unlikable they're usually poorly written but here it's here to progress the story which is awesome. The third act is one of the best third acts in any film I've seen and it's honestly incredible. There's a lot more amazing stuff in this film but I recommend you watch it yourself. Now the bad things, the music doesn't always sink up which kind of annoyed me but it doesn't make me hate the film.",1
196,"There is a very interesting disparity between the two main characters who in some way expresses two erroneous sides of something good.It is truthful and right what Fletcher does, to push his students to the maximum, obviously his methods are completely wrong, but achieving the highest level in your profession should always be a goal. How you get to it is the real issue.And that is the point that involves Andrew, who sacrificed everything he could in order to achieve perfection, even risked his own life in order to fulfill his commitments.And I think that is Andrew's mistake because all he let us see was how he lost his enjoyment, his fun and his passion to play in order to achieve perfection in an abusive way.But surprisingly in that final part is where the two converge.As it should have been, the teacher and the student find themselves in what the two of them aspired and they both get it.Now if you wonder if Andrew got to that point because of the abuse he endured, it is certainly a valid question.",1
197,Amazing script and story with crazy twists and turns.  Outstanding performances from Miles Teller and JK Simmons.  Simmons won an Oscar for supporting actor for this film.  A+,1
198,First masterpiece from Damien Chazelle. Love this fantastic movie so much as others,1
199,"I remember when I first watched this film, at the start thinking, this could be a good film. As it went on I absolutely fell in love with it and will remain one of my favorite films of all time. I remember actually beginning to feel nervous for the character as he goes on to perform, something I almost never feel in films or tv.",1
200,"Whiplash is an intense movie. From the first minute, you feel the tension. Simmons gives a great performance as a driven musicteacher, that crosses the line multiple times. Simmons gives this character a soft spot, an emotional side that was very unexpected. Teller gives one of his best performances yet. Great movie",1
201,"This is a really bleeping great movie. Normally, I bleeping hate the whiny face teenager actor (can't remember his name) but he's really great in this movie. J. K. Simmons is amazing in this movie, giving a really demanding, violent, energetic performance. The plot is consistently entertaining and the twist ending is amazing. I highly recommend this movie.",1
202,"good job..WhiplashIt is a breathtaking experience to watch this movie. J.K. Simmons is clearly the winner here, his constant on and off screen impact in this movie shows how amazing his acting skills are and how well this character was written. It speaks more on the character's point of view rather than the script which holds the movie till the end.",1
203,"Really one of the best movies in this century. Great performance by J.K. Simmons, deservedly won Oscar.",1
204,"Whiplash left me satisfied with the ending, frustrated with the ending, and utterly impressed in almost every other way. Tremendous performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, fantastic music, and an enthralling story that doesn't have much fat to it. I can't believe I waited so long to watch this one.",1
205,"Damien Chazelle has become a notable rising star in film direction in the past decade; his 2016 musical, La La Land was the subject of the infamous Best Picture mess-up at the 89th Oscars. Despite this, after a Best Director win, Chazelle has been tipped as a great and one of his films that demonstrates this perfectly is his 2014 breakthrough, Whiplash, the story of an ambitious young student under the tutorage of an abusive music instructor. Chazelle has crafted an exhilarating and detailed film, owing less to a La La Land-esque musical but rather to sports movies, like Rocky. Miles Teller stars as Andrew, a young and hugely ambitious drum protégé desperate to impress his notorious instructor, Terence Fletcher. J.K Simmons stars as Fletcher and is certainly the star of the film; his muscular physique and sharp tongue create a monster, yet one who remains human enough to remain terrifyingly believable. Slowly, we see the film turn into a game of cat and mouse as Andrew is relentless in his pursuit to impress Fletcher, who argues that tough love is the only way to breed musicians that make history. Whiplash is brutal when it needs to be, Tom Cross’ editing adding a sharp execution (often cutting to the central drum kit) to Chazelle’s attentive direction. The film is unforgiving in its pace, managing to turn even the most permissive drum solos into gripping dramatic set pieces. Even as the film descends into melodrama, plot-wise (literal car crashes begin to overtake the metaphorical), Whiplash never loses that golden forcefulness and intensity that makes it work so well. For a film about music, Justin Hurwitz provides a fitting score, his striking, bouncy music immersed within the jazz standards. The score feels like the film itself; brassy and pacy, yet somehow relaxed and perfectly measured at the same time.Whiplash is a fine film; Chazelle’s aptitude for detailed and thoughtful direction is clear and, even when the story trails into the unbelievable, you can’t bring your eyes away. Simmons is stellar in his performance, his delicious brutality making him well deserving of his Oscar. Whilst La La Land shows Chazelle paying homage to the bygone movie musical, its predecessor is a very different film; nail-biting and uncompromising, Whiplash is a very accomplished piece of filmmaking.",1
206,I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the only movie about Jazz Drumming you actually have to watch.,1
207,"Damien Chazelle as both the writer and the director of this movie, adds a lot to the cinema history by this movie. Truth be told, ""Whiplash"" is one of the best movies that I've ever seen. This movie is not a musical. It's a psychological drama. J.K. Simmons made me angry, too. As time passed, I understood the characters more and more, and I got sucked into this movie. If sth bad happened to Teller, I would feel like it happenned to me throughout the movie. That's all because I understood his characters. This movie is an intense drama that made me wanna face Simmons and punch him in his face. His performance is Oscar worthy, and seemingly, he has been rewarded so many times for his performance as Mr. Fletcher.   Teller is so intense. The performances are all like these charactera are real. If there was a weird thing going on in this movie, I would understand it, because this movie is so goddamb real. Bravo, Damien Chazelle... you satisfied me with this masterpiece. Thank you. You made me have a big smile after this movie finished with that perfect ending. Again, thank you.",1
208,"One of my biggest issues with some of these reviews are the misinterpretations. It's ok not to like a film, but you must have valid points. The film helps us as an audience see how to overcome our beasts. The swearing is one of the most special things about the film, as it evokes such harsh nature. J.K Simmons brings an absolutely incredible performance, along with Miles Teller who gives his greatest performance also. Whiplash is not only a threatening film, but one which helps me realise that films don't have to be fun. They just need to have quality. So, in conclusion, if you hate this film, that's fine. But don't hate it for no reason whatsoever. I know this review might polarise some of you, but before disliking, please take a good read :)",1
209,One of the films that best describes the relationship between perserevance and success,1
210,Makes us feel we are playing the part!performences are extraoridinary!Brilliant ending makes us feel relief at last when flectcher smiles!,1
211,A sub-textual battle between two people with poignant questions on artists and limits.,1
212,"Although the story didn't really live up to my expectations, ""Whiplash"" is truly a wonderful film. The jazz music, film editing, and the acting are the elements to a modern day masterpiece.",1
