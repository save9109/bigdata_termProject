0,"I was super hyped about this movie, but started doubted if it was going to be good from seeing the critics hate on it. But boy were they wrong this movie is AMAZING! Not as good as the Dark Knight movies but still a hundred times better than Superman Returns. Also this movie has superb action (you finally get to see Superman kick some ass!) and emotion, and a great villain, and they don't shove all the love stuff with Lois Lane down your throat, it's natural. Overall best Superman movie, and best origin story (for a superhero, but Batman Begins is still amazing)",1
1,"I just saw Man of Steel at the IMAX 3D. It was the best rendition of superman I have ever seen. The acting, storyline, and graphics was epic! I can't wait to see it again! My favorite movie this far! I recommend everyone see this film.",1
2,Finally a good Superman movie that is grounded in the real world while still being about a God like Alien. Also nice to see Zod having a legitimate reason for what he is doing and making Superman have some hard choices. Bring on the next one.,1
3,"First things first, I loved this movie!  It has it's flaws but still a great film to watch.  I was actually very impressed with Henry Cavill.  He did an amazing job as superman.  Overall the acting was superb, though maybe not the best script ever.  The action was epic in scale but it didn't have the same weight as The Avengers' action did, it felt a bit generic and bland.  Overall this film has much of everything, emotion, action and some humor.  Great film",1
4,Haters gonna like. I have to admit that I don't like Superman but Man of steel was an extraordinary action packed film with extraordinary visual effects and music. Tries to reach The Avengers though it doesn't achieve it. The appearance of Christopher Nolan is something that can be easily seen with all that dark stuff on that movie. Michael Shannon was the best enemy that Superman could have. Amy Adams was always as if she was crying through the whole movie. I will watch the sequel (if they make one). I enjoyed it and it is certainly a film for the cinema and not for the DVD. i liked that it also showed past and now at the same time. Thumbs up!,1
5,"It's not a masterpiece that will go on to win the Oscars next year. But it's the biggest, loudest, action packed movie that Superman deserved. It definitely has the Snyder touch, and you can see Nolan's influence in it too.The pacing is good (not great though) and it keeps some balance at least for the first half of the movie. Then we get to see some good old school Superman action, with enemies that can fight toe to toe with him.The supporting cast is good, the story flows, sometimes a little forced, but overall it's a great movie.",1
6,Absolutely brilliant with awesome acting and awesome effects this film is the best film of 2013 and that's is not arguable at all. I don't see why the critics are saying sores like 53 out of 100 as that's wrong and they should change their scores to 90 at least.,1
7,"So many don't like it. I loved it. This is what I call the Prometheus syndrome. Many hate it, but many loved it, and I loved Man of Steel, even though I am aware of some of it's problems- the same with Prometheus, but I don't think it brings down the film as much as it has been made out to be. This was my most anticipated movie of the year, and to be honest I had been hesitant from the start, as I had never been fully keen on Zack Snyder's work, I always found that they were good, but never great, with films such as Watchmen and the Owls movie- or they were just plain awful... Sucker Punch. This is, by far, Snyder's best work, and although many haven't liked the action- it flew by for me- the whole film whizzed past actually, while for most it seemed to drag. This film made me feel like a kid, as at one point I was sitting with my mouth wide open at the scale of the thing, and I literally jumped out of my seat when Superman himself, or Kal-El I should say, started throwing down in the air, against Zod. Another concern I had did come to fruition, with many saying David S. Goyer will bring greatness to the project, but actually he has written some awful movies, and when people said 'He wrote The Dark knight Rises'- this is incorrect, he did the story for it. Films that he has written recently would be 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance', 'Jumper' and 'The Unborn'. Three awful films, that although the script isn't as bad as I am making it out to be, there are a few weird lines that pulled me out of the scene. I liked the structure Goyer gave, although it did lack some depth, I felt like I got enough to become emotionally connected to the characters. The two strongest parts of the film would probably be the performances, and also the effects. I normally would criticize a film for one of it's strongest parts being the effects. But this is probably some of the best effects work I have ever seen. In this kind of scale anyway. As this film is big, and there is a hell of a lot of carnage. Sure when you think about it. A lot of people died. But hey. Superman. it's all that's needed to be said. Bad argument, I know. But... Superman. As part of the effects work, this also some of the best action I have personally ever witnessed, in scale and execution. It's crazy. I have heard that many simply turned off and got numbed by it, but I was the guy who wanted more. As I said earlier, I honestly felt like a kid watching my favorite comic books moments coming to life. Properly. Here's a rundown of the performances: Henry Caville- He plays a great Superman, and although the character was lacking in the script department, I definitely connected with him. And he WAS Superman. Michael Shannon- He worked for me, and I preferred his reasons to go to Earth. There is an established reason for what he is doing, and he believes what he is doing is for the better. It is not I'm a bad guy. Blah. Although anyone could have really played the character, it wasn't a stand out role, but served a purpose. Russell Crowe- Awesome. Krypton scenes- some of the best of the film. Amazing stuff there. And he is perfect. Amy Adams- Good Lois Lane. She is given some weird lines though that doesn't suit the tone of the film, e.g. 'What if I need to tinkle?' Also the Superman-Lane relationship is a little rushed, and could have been left to a later film. Kevin Costner- Again, great, although almost a bit underused. But he is almost the underlying hero of the film. Diane Lane- Also good etc. In other words. Go see it. Here, The Prometheus Syndrome, comes into effect. And today we see the creation of The Man of Steel Syndrome.",1
8,"Watched again yesterday. And still giving it a 10. Just amazing movie. And a first movie I go to see twice in the theatre. Just great, really opened up more with the 2nd viewing. Zod is a great villain!",1
9,"I went into this movie with high expectations. And wow was I pleased. The work done on this movie was phenomenal.People have issues with the casting for a few characters, but I will say that it was perfect. The movie nailed it. And I can not wait to see a new one. My only problem was that it was short, and if the movie was longer, then there would have been more character development. Other than that I had no issue. I love new and dark approach to the heroes of the DC Universe, and I pray that the rest of the heroes and heroine have the same feeling. This movie has the story, the characters, the acting and the action. 10/10",1
10,"Words can't even begin to describe how awesome this movie is!Heartbreaking performances,outstanding fights scenes and CGI.Man of Steel reaches perfection.EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!",1
11,"Instead of telling all obvious good things about this movie, I will just say that i will watch it again tomorrow. I have NEVER done this with any movie. And this is coming from a person who was never a big fan of Superman.",1
12,"A cinematic blockbuster with action scenes that will just AMAZE you! Yes, this is a different take on the most iconic Superhero that was ever created but, in my opinion, it is better for it. This is a updated and modern Superman for this generation of movie-goers, as it is for those of us who didn't grew up with the original Superman movies back in the late 1970's and 1980's  Many fans have already said to ignore critics as most of their reviews are very harsh. I agree with the fans. Many of the critics compare this movie to the original superman movies as they said that those movies had more heart and humor. To me, this is very unfair and biased as they can't accept the fact that this is a reboot and thus a different Superman from the one that they remember from the original films. This new Superman is grounded, and more serious",1
13,"One of the most enjoyable movies this summer so far. Critics have no idea what they're talking about. The soundtrack was a little overpowering at times, but that's all I have to say about this movie in a bad way. This movie is action-packed, has really good acting, and pretty good presentation. I think that some people don't really like the way Zod is defeated in battle, when Supes cracks his neck, and I understand that. But he really didn't want to. He had to save that innocent family from dying. I would've done the same thing if I was him. It takes a little while to get some where, but you will not regret going to see this movie, I promise.",1
14,"Man of Steel takes from Superman lore the aspects that fans of the original films have been dreaming about for over 3 decades. Superman II is the film that really grabbed my imagination from the original motion pictures during my youth. It excited me like nothing else had before. It was the baddie film. Superbeings fighting and throwing each other through Coke signs! Despite the Lester/Donnar pollution, the film is iconic. Not least for Terrance Stamps role as General Zod and the über-sexy Sarah Douglas as Ursa. This retelling of the franchise, grounded in the Zod story arc is just an incredible proposition for fans like me. To open on the visualisation of the birth of the Man of Steel is brilliant story telling. The old story is fresh and new straight away. The film gives us enough on screen, and, coupled with 'the good jist', the story romps along without treading to closely on old worn ground and risk growing stale whilst stumbling over a back-story most of the audience will know. All grown up and Superman who is known, excellently, as Kal-El throughout the film, is unsure of himself, new, or initially without, good knowledge of his past he appears a vulnerable lost soul. His powers are unrealised and he simply uses his moral compass (and some good hear-say)to direct him to an answer, if there is one...and there is *thumbs up* Then gets real. Michael Shannon's portrayal of General Zod is nothing short of sensational. His character is not the 'Bad' guy in the usual sense of the word. He is a creation of a society who's morals are questionable 'even' by our human standards and he is driven in his beliefs and is all the more dangerous for it. Henry 'Kal-El' Cavill is brilliant. The character is written so well you can identify with this vision of Superman like never before. With Cavill you feel that we are all along for the same ride and we like where it is going. Amy Adams is perfectly cast as Lois Lane. She is a remarkable actress and this role seems naturally made for her. The relationship between Lois and Superman is fresh and uncertain. I enjoyed the story arc but missed a little chemistry between the two and the last kiss didn't impact on me and, looking back, I thought it should have. Teed up nicely for the sequel though I have no doubt. I did have a couple of winces and the biggie for me was the 'Jesus Christ' shot of Kal-El departing the spacecraft following a final farewell to his father, Jor-El. I am not a massive follower of every Superman comic in print. I have a collection but would not consider myself an expert. So I cannot say whether this imagery is integral for the die hard comic fans'. For me, it is not needed, the symbolism of religious connotation is obvious if you 'want' look for it, without it being rammed down our throats so crassly. Another stab came from the military subordinates' question regarding terraforming. In order to better explain the situation (spoonfeed the audience) a soldier/officer pipes up and asks ""What's Terraforming"". I truly believe that the majority of fans and people in general will have heard of the word terraforming and have a grasp on, essentially, what it is. A better put 'explain please' question would have been, in response to ""They're terraforming"" would be ""How are they doing it""? Good eyes also, on intrepid reporter Lois Lane, to spot a shadowy figure on her digital camera preview screen!?! Influentially I think that Christopher Nolan was on the bus but Zach Snyder and David Goyer were definitely in the driving seat. The pace of the film is relentless, I thought that the 3rd act needed to take breath before the final showdown to prepare the audience a little more for the upcoming clash. And... What a battle. What a fight. Nothing was spared, those buildings were empty by then, smash 'em up and ..oh and *He breaks his freakin' neck* Evolution or extinction? Right there the Superman character took a massive evolutionary leap forward. Man of Steel is visually stunning with an incredible soundtrack. The 3D aspect is good. I thought that the effect worked best during close up shots especially between Jor-El and his wife Lara before launching the capsule. I am not a fan of the art at all so I would have preferred a 2D viewing (not possible at our local cinema) So I look forward to that fresh viewing on a beautiful Steel-book Blu-Ray with a flawless transfer...I hope. Leaving the cinema, I immediately wanted turn round, sit down and watch it again (Very rare since I was probably 16) and took with me the message that I got from the film and that was; We can be better. We all, really can be 'Superman' if we choose to be. And that's not bad. I don't often dole out top marks. Many people believe that a 10/10 or 5 Stars is not the done thing? 'No such thing as a perfect film'! But when a film comes along that has so much riding on it and is much more than the sum of it's parts and is really bloody good then really; Fair Play, Sold! Suffice it to say that Man of Steel is a benchmark Summer Blockbuster classic.",1
15,"Very, very well made movie. Despite the last forty minutes being one straight up action scene, the first one hundred are excellent insights into Clark Kent's troubled character. Not to mention a climax that will leave you agape.",1
16,"Upon hearing general zod as the main villain....I was a bit dissapointed.....but well, after seing the trailer....I guessed MoS still have hope to be decent movie....but after seeing this movie....THIS IS THE BEST SUPERMAN MOVIE YETTTTT!!!!!!! Pure Action..... I never like Superman stories being told with stupid drama and romance like Superman Returns....I don't care about those critics too",1
17,"I went into this film with the taste of the ABYSMAL ""superman returns"" in my mind like a lingering cringe worthy memory from my teen years that I would never shake, what I got to my surprise was a movie that had NO BAD ACTING. Let me reiterate, NO... BAD...ACTING... even the criminally underused actors didn't in any point in time under or over act their roles, and this is a movie with more than enough respectable names in supporting roles. I think the best way of describing it as, would be a ""sci-fi"" superman as opposed to a ""comic book superman"" this isn't the avengers, where a city is invaded and little to no casualties occur, this is people being killed and ""the boy scout"" having to step up and make a choice between the people he longs to connect with, or humanity whom he's afraid to try to connect with. The very magnitude and serious handling of these drives make for the first recent origin movie of one of the biggest DC superheroes to be worthy of being just that, while everyone can of course respect the old romps that were the christopher reeve films, this transcends those early camp beginnings and offers up something that is truly special. The irony is that those that seem to be scoring this movie low, seem to be of the kind that would prefer another hackneyed love story with a silly bit of action a la superman returns. This is not a romantic drama fan-fic esque terribad film with cheesy acting and campy villains however.. this film is a real bona fide epic.",1
18,"MILD SPOILERS ALERT. First of all this movie was amazing. I'll keep this review short. This movie has a lot of action in it and I guess it does have too much in it but they are cool scenes. All of the acting are great. This movie has a lot of emotional depth to it, one is because of a scene involving Jonathan Kent, the other at the end of the fight with Superman and Zod. All in all great movie, one of the best movie of the year along with star trek and I am looking forward to Justice League!!",1
19,"So I finally saw this movie today and I must admit that it was really everything that I wanted in a Superman movie.  Henry Cavill was Superman, even though I really liked Brandon Routh, he just wasnt given the right medium to really fully embody the character that Cavill played in this film. Amy Adams was a very good Lois Lane, with her larger than life reporter.  She was given little time to grow as a character but I am sure if there is a sequel then that will give her more time to shine. The actor who played Zod was very good.  I mean I will always have a place in my heart of Terrence Stamp, but this new Zod was very good. Russel Crowe as Jor-El was very well played and not over acted at all. Overall this was a very interesting and refreshing new take on Superman, and I hope there is something more coming down the pipeline on this one",1
20,"Finally a superhero movie with superhero worthy action scenes. I felt like it was taken straight from a comic book.  The special effects are perfect and there's a great cast. I would have liked more development of superman;s character, but that is a small complaint compared to the epic fight scenes and solid storytelling. 9/10",1
21,"Gets better each time you watch it. I understand the critics' and their need to see more character development, but with the powers that the characters possess, they needed it to be realistic, i.e., globally impacted. The sequel will redeem Zack and Henry.",1
22,"This movie isnt perfect but it definitely is a good start for where they want to head with this. I am happy to say that it is in the right direction. The ACTING was superb by everyone, just the actors on Krypton had be engaged. I like how they world builded Krypton instead of it being a boring white planet like the past movies... The ACTION was great but I dont understand the hate for the too much when it was Zod vs Superman; I'm sorry but if you have two or more Kryptonians fight, the environment around them id bound to get immensely destroyed. The STORY was a great origin story, but I can understand some people not on board with the whole flashback way but for me it workds. The way it was intertwined with present events worked well imo. My only complaint will have to be some of the pacing, it wasnt awful but it could be improved, there were just some parts when you are waiting for things to happen but it wasnt that bad. The pacing was just fine. I think the critics are wrong for comparing this to Donner bc1) Its a reboot,2)Donner didnt make Superman.You should definitely walk in with an open mind forgetting Donner and instead expect a movie that goes by the comics instead of the Donner films for once.",1
23,Just pure beauty....coming from a marvel man myself. I loved how Snyder captures the connection between Clark and his earth dad...and how its over ins tornado accident...as he watched his dad needlessly die even though he could help his dad risked his life for clarks safety PURE BEAUTY,1
24,"Do not listen to the critics.. this is by far the best superman movie till date!!The action is phenomenal and Henry Cavill has done an amazing job, he is Superman! I wasn't not a huge Superman fan to be honest but after watching this movie I am now!",1
25,"I had my doubts about Man Of Steel but after watching Superman come alive and kick some serious ass, I was happily proved wrong. The film captures the humanity of Superman's search to be human even after finding out who he really is. David S. Goyer's screenplay perfectly reflects Kal-El's struggles and challenges growing up in today's world. Zack Snyder has managed to do the impossible, he has successfully made the Man Of Steel relevant and above all human. With a strong cast including Russel Crowe as Jor-El, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, and of course Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El. Michael Shannon makes a truly menacing General Zod that you actually respect for his notions but understand his questionable motives. Overall, Man Of Steel is a pleasant surprise filled with plenty of little Easter eggs for DC fans to look out for. This is one summer blockbuster you won't want to miss, Zack Snyder has created another epic superhero masterpiece.",1
26,"Man of Steel (2013) is a modern day take on the Superman lore, it introduces the viewers to Superman's past and his birth on Planet Krypton. The movie wastes no time and plunges the viewer into great action set pieces, while building the foundation for the movies lore. The characters are believable and their performances are very solid for this type of movie. The so called critics who slam the movie for not having enough humor or for over the top action or for whatever unprofessional reason are completely unfounded in their ""arguments"" and just prove how arrogant non objective they are, this is not 1970's, hero movies must retain a serious tone to be relevant nowadays. For the type of movie this is, it is a 8/10 any day of the week! It is by far the most ambitious take on a Superman movie, and it whole heartily succeeds. Go see this movie if you are a action/science fiction/superhero fan. You won't be disappointed.",1
27,"Acting: 7Story Line: 10Picture: 9.5Action: 8.2Average: 9 (round off)Movie is worth watching. Do not listen to the critics. It is great and powerful; just how superhero movies should be made. If this turns into a full on justice league movie you will be proud to say that you followed the story from its epic beginnings.",1
28,"An awesome use of special effects to create the best superman movie to date. Along with the almost never ending action the fight scenes in the film are the best I have ever seen in our cinema to date. 9 out of 10",1
29,"Finally a good Superman movie. Yes, it was serious, but DC's New 52 and all the Warner Premiere movies are serious. DC is serious, deal with it.Also, some people complained that there was too much unbelievable action. Superman CAN punch the moon out of orbit. Even if we know that is not possible, who cares. If you want ""realistic"" watch a documentary. Superman fans want to see the Man of Steel get punched through a mountain.This movie catered to the real DC fan. It is what a Superman movie should be.So in brief, if you want weak, funny characters, they make Marvel movies for that.And if you think this movie was worse that Superman Returns, they make a pill for that.",1
30,"This was the perfect Superman movie! I loved how Snyder captured the essence of Krypton and told the full story of how Kal-El's home planet was destroyed. I thought Russell Crowe played a perfect Zor-El as he brought substance to Kal in the times that he needed it the most. Amy Adams was a perfect Lois Lane as she embodied everything that the character needed to have including heart, a go-get am attitude and the wit to know when not to write a story about an alien living on Earth. Henry Cavill played a wonderful Superman and I would say that he brought the character to life more than Christopher Reeve did with the 1978 movie. Overall, people will complain about the serious tone that this movie had along with the special effects. However, I argue that this is a new telling of the Superman story and it should be taken serious. Think Batman Begins. As far as the special effects, that was one of the big reasons why I did not love the Avengers. However, this is Superman after all and he does fly so the special effects are a given. But the movie could have used less destruction of Metropolis, but I believe it made up for itself by the stellar acting of the entire crew. Overall, I would rank this movie as the 3rd best Superhero movie of all time. My top 5 are as follows: 1) The Dark Knight2) The Dark Knight Rises3) Man of Steel4) X-Men: First Class5) X-Men",1
31,"Finally Superman was given a just reboot! Henry Cavill plays the role well and is perfectly fit for the it. The screenplay was well-written, decent. Visual effects were fantastic while sound and editing were well done. The cast delivered beyond satisfactory. A motion picture-of-the-year material. Man of Steel is this decade's The Dark Knight (2008). movienotesbook.blogspot.com",1
32,"After watching this movie and finally watching Superman kick some ass, I have three words to describe how I feel: f*** the critics. This movie portrayed Superman as the full fledged badass he is in the comics(you know, the one that destroyed an entire solar system just by sneezing). This movie did the best job yet of showing the actual scale of Superman's strength, unlike the god awful Christopher Reeves Series and even worse, Returns. This movie deserves at LEAST a 9/10.",1
33,"It's a shame people are so eager to hate in today's society. This move was a great retelling of a classic hero. Period. Haters keep on hating. I think some critics would simply prefer all movies be reality based romantic dramas, sorry for your lack of imagination.",1
34,"Nolan and Synder set out to do something with this film that most fans of Superman have longed for, create a Superman that is relevant.  Man of Steel delivers on almost every level.  The vision is epic, the delivery is epic and there is action.  Tons of SUPER action.  I saw the movie in 3D...honestly, didn't improve the movie over a 2D I am quite sure.  The movie sticks to a pleasant pace with one notable scene being somewhat of a tear jerker towards the middle of the movie.  The movie delivers what most wished the previous 3 movies could have been.  Solid action, great story and visually stunning.",1
35,"A WORD OF ADVICE: Don't mind what critics have said about this movie!  MAN OF STEEL is a masterpiece!  Go watch it for yourselves.  The film is worth every dollar you'll spend on movie-going.  Don't miss watching this on the big screen especially in 3D to enjoy it in its fullest glory.  Even if you have a big flat screen 3D TV, don't wait for the DVD or BluRay format in stores cuz you'll miss a great deal from the actual big screen experience.  Of course, we gotta buy our own when its out on the market cuz were going to definitely see & enjoy it again and again.  I have seen this 3 times already and, every time, it got better and better to a point of concluding that Zach Snyder is indeed a true directorial genius and the David Goyer-Christopher Nolan storytelling team-up equally outstanding in retelling the Superman canon!  Retrofitting in today's advances, the filmmakers succeeded beyond our expectations of rebooting this most loved superhero of all-time.  Without the red brief (why is it outside by the way?), Superman looks current and does not look at all like 75 years old.  We call this film ""Superman Reborn"" and aptly so.  Fresh as a morning dew, MAN OF STEEL literally saves the day and ultimately takes back his rightful place which is at the top of the heap of all superheroes.  All the actors were perfectly cast.  A very determined Henry Cavill was not ""humorless"" as he took on a more serious (not Dark Knight dark) version of the Man of Steel. The-not-too-feminine-blond-more-than-brunette Amy Adams was perfect as Lois Lane to Cavill's Clark.  She had enough held-back spunk & flirt in her reminiscent of all the other Lois-es like Margot Kidder & Teri Hatcher who truly owned the role.  It was smart of them to make this version of Lois Lane not that dumb to recognize through Superman's disguise (glasses, really?) and it was great that the filmmakers did not explore the romance between these 2 characters (there's just too much to take in) reserving it for the sequel as they focus more on Kal-El's search of being (To critics: this is the reason why Cavill's humor is held at bay. Try checking out MAN OF STEEL's commercial on Carl's Jr and Hardee's. You'll know this actor is far from being ""humorless"").  Michael Shannon exudes shades of Willem Dafoe/Joaquin Phoenix in his performance as a more likable Zod here---meaning, he is nothing short of brilliant as an actor.  His chilling delivery of ""YOU ARE NOT ALONE"" ominous message gave us goosebumps galore.  It has a spooky feel to it reminiscent of ""The Ring"".   The scene-stealer of the house was Antje Traue as Faora.  Man, that woman kicks serious ass!  And you'd think Michael Shannon's Zod's badass-ness was to the rafters---Hers skyrocketed and blew the top off!  She's undeniably the Eve to Zod's Adam, in other words, the whole thingy can't be told without her.  And then there's the 2 Robin Hoods, Russell Crowe & Kevin Costner.  It was such a treat to see these 2 great thespians in one film.  One word to describe their presence---EPIC!  Both of them brought a whole new meaning to that word.  While Russell Crowe re-introduced us the Gladiator we all loved in the introductory part of the movie, Kevin Costner gave us Field of Dreams all over again bringing (a tug in the) heart, soul and balance throughout the film.  Laurence Fishburne as Perry White was a superb choice.  He was great as a leader-of-the-pack Morpheus in the Matrix films and he was equally chief to head the Daily Planet in this one.  He truly embodied the sharp boss of Amy's Lois Lane   Unfaithful's Diane Lane is no stranger to take on the role of a mother to a child gifted with superpowers.  Remember she was the mother to Hayden Christensen in JUMPER so it's but naturally fitting for her to be cast as the ""hot version"" of Martha Kent (You know, hot dude--hot mom, makes sense right?).  Lucky Henry Cavill gets to have not just one but two hot mamas here.  Although Ayelet Zurer's appearance as Lara Lor-Van El (the real mother of Kal-El) was only brief, her steely heartbreaking performance was searing enough to last.  To sum it up, MAN OF STEEL have enough ingredient for every movie-goer to enjoy.  The action is fully packed especially in the climax part of the film.  Watching the sequences is like being in the final series of loops of a roller coaster leaving you wanting more at the end of the ride.  And what better soundtrack than Hans Zimmer's brilliant otherwordly drum-rolling score to keep the excitement going.  If John Williams made us believe a man can fly in the Donner films, Hans Zimmer made us believe Superman can soar & battle again for superhero supremacy at 75 in this Snyder extravaganza.  On my first viewing of the movie, I thought there were small lapses in the editing but concluded later on in my second and third viewing that it was artfully & thoughtfully done---more cohesive than I have originally thought.  Go watch MAN OF STEEL and see for yourselves then watch it again!",1
36,"MoS got a long round of applause after it was finished in the theater I was at and it deserved it!  This reboot gave us everything we wanted and delivered on nearly every level and in the very few areas where it didn't, I'm sure will be corrected in the 2nd installment.",1
37,"Don't know how or why so many mixed reviews by critics I guess they were expecting the campy, cheesy 70's Superman? great updated story of the Man of Steel, he's young just embracing who he is and so he makes mistakes, makes some bad choices that a seasoned Superman probably doesnt make, but that to me doesnt take away from the movie it add's layers to him, I thought they had some great emotional scenes, and great action as well, I really only had one gripe but I understand it. But loved this movie right up there with The Dark Knight and Iron man 1! go see it!",1
38,I don't know why this movie is getting such mixed critic reviews. It was amazing. Definitely the best Superman movie. It takes itself seriously. The action was awesome and the emotion the movie conveys is beautifully done. Crowe does a great job as Jor-El and so does Henry Cavill as Superman. This movie really got me pumped up for a Justice League movie and sets up for a hopefully great Superman saga.,1
39,"Just came back from the movie! Just one word Amazing. Watched it in IMAX 3D it's not just the end that﻿ has action scenes. From start to end it's a bang for the Buck. It has a great story, some moments even bring tears into your eye and as for the Action is concerned it was EPIC. It was amazing to see superman in the air flying and fighting especially in IMAX 3D. Go for it. I would rate it 10/10.",1
40,"Ok here goes: I loved this movie. This is the kind of Superman movie that has, for whatever reason, been absent from existence for far too long. You can get a Superman movie like this but you have to look in the DC Comics animated universe. You know, the ones that go straight to Blu-ray Disc. I can't believe it has taken 75 years for Superman to be seen on the big screen in this fashion. It has literally everything the giddy nerd in all of us wants to see from Superman. Intense action, glorious set-pieces, a plot that puts more than one hemisphere in danger and through it all an actor playing Superman who nails every moment he is on screen. I loved Superman Returns but this movie is such a big  you to the emo baby mama  of that movie. Gone are the days when Lois Lane is just a pretty face and villains exist to have a villain. No. This is the one we've all been waiting for. It's finally here. As an origin story, the plot is such a solid take on the sci-fi elements of the comics regarding Krypton that I had a  grin on my face basically the entire first 20 minutes. I was hoping the helpful grey levitating droid was going to be named Brainiac but it had a different name. Oh well. Not a big deal. The fact that Zod is given a heartbeat in this movie is one of the best decisions Goyer and Nolan made when writing this thing. There is a perfect logic behind everything Zod does and you see his point of view with each word from his mouth. He is trying to save the race of people he swore to protect from extinction. A noble cause that a society would expect from all their Generals. The balance that is struck between Kal's dual heritages and morality is basically the theme of the entire film. Jor-El is all about destiny and being a leader for a lesser people, while Jonathan just wants to protect his child and preaches restraint above all else. The ""first contact with an alien"" aspect is touched upon but not as much as I thought it was going to be. I guess that's my fault for reading so many interviews with creators and producers. All the actors nail it. Literally every one of them. I can't think of a weak spot as far as casting. Faora is ****ing BAD ASS. She kicks so much butt in this movie I'm creaming my pants right now remembering her scenes. Look for her to give you that wow factor as far as action scenes. The Kents serve their purpose with such grace, it makes me sad to say they were barely on screen. Jor-El on the other hand has a good 20-30 minutes of dialogue spread throughout the film. Add him to the bad-ass list, by the way. Scientists get combat training on Krypton, believe that. Michael ****ing Shannon. That is all. That SHOULD be all for anyone who doubts him. Amy Adams and Henry Cavill probably needed more screen time together to get a good chemistry going but this movie is not about them. This is an origin story, not the love story that I'm sure will be more fleshed out in a potential sequel. Hans Zimmer's score isn't as memorable as Williams' but it's about ten times more powerful and visceral. Tonally, it goes perfectly with everything that is going on on screen. It seems like the last third of the film being nonstop action and ultimately an entire city block of Metropolis being turned into ashes is being used as a scapegoat for critics. There more collateral damage in this movie than I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Some may find it off-putting for a Superman movie but I didn't find it jarring at all. You have to believe a city battle between Kryptonians is going to destroy a few buildings. It's either that or have a castrated final battle between Zod and Superman. No thanks. Give me MORE explosions and MORE destruction if the world is at stake. One final thought on Henry Cavill as Superman. As an actor, playing the role of Superman should be relatively easy on paper, but when you get down to the nitty gritty, the character is relatively complex. He has to know what to do without knowing who he is. He has to know what to say without knowing how to feel. There is a boy scout stigma attached to the character that the script lets Superman break free of, but would have been utterly pointless with the wrong person at the helm. Henry Cavill is not only the right actor for the job, he's the right face and aura. The right voice tone, the right rhythm to his speech, even the way he looks at General Swanwick at the end of the movie after he downs a drone and tells the Army basically ""I know you're spying on me, stop it"". The look is one of quiet dignity and utter confidence in what he's saying while still conveying the strength and leadership only Superman can. This is the leader of the Justice League. Routh, for all his similarity to Reeve could NEVER lead a League of superheroes. After seeing the film, the only thing I could think was ""I can't ****ing WAIT for MOS 2 and Justice League."" That's a feeling most Superman fans have been waiting for for a long time.",1
41,"MARVELOUS OUTSTANDINGBrilliant movie overall just don't expect Nolan's wit. The movie is just made better by the great music by Hans ZimmerLucky to watch it first day n first showGo watch it now",1
42,"The movie is simply AMAZING, I will never understand why critics are treating it so brutally. Since the very moment the movie begins you are caught by the depth of the characters, the way the story is told, the story itself; the acting is superb and every single actor adds something special to their portrayals. For the first time after Christopher Reeves we have a lovable and believable Clark Kent/Superman. The action scenes in this movie are something you have never seen before in any other superhero movie. And for the first time in 75 years the infamous question of why Lois Lane does not realise that Superman is Clark Kent wearing glasses IS SOLVED: Lois Lane is not ""stupid"" anymore!! Again, do not pay attention to the critics. I really do not know if it is about trying to badmouth of every Zack Snyder project or just haters gonna hate.",1
43,"Man Of Steel totally blew my mind. Everything i expected and a lot more. Finally, Superman in action like we always prayed to see materialize on the big screen. The wait was worth every bit. The King-Daddy of Superheroes is in the house!",1
44,"I'll start by saying i don't know what's wrong with the critics, they obviously don't know what a good superhero movie is, just look at the difference between critic scores and user scores... user scores got it right, i loved this movie from start to finish, i'm happy they took some risks with the story and did things differently so it's not like another reboot where u know everything, it was done in a fresh way where even if u know the superman story from front to back u could still feel this was a fresh unfamiliar take on the story, as a big superman fan i've been waiting over thirty years to see superman punch someone in a movie, the action was second to none... if ur a superman fan u owe it to yourself to see this marvel.",1
45,"Loved Man of Steel this  movie way better than Superman Returns. Most Critic are wraped up in a 1978 version of superman over 35 years age. Nevertheless, this is this generation Superman. Most Critic are over 45 years old and don't get it. The overall movie is better than any Iron Man moovie or the Averger.  I not giving any thing away but, its a must see on the big screen don't wait for Red Box for this one!",1
46,"Freaking Amazing! Proper superhero fighting scene, haven't had this much fun watching people beat each other up since Dragon Ball Z. The story was intriguing and for the first time ever, they showed Krypton and it's people. The Action in this movie deserves a 15/10.",1
47,Top 5 superhero movie of all time. I really dont understand why every critic is being this harsh. Its like they are scrutinizing the movie more than usual just cause Snyder has a part it in it. I actually really enjoyed the movie.,1
48,"As a fan of action hero movies in general  having seen and enjoyed all of the latest superhero films from DC and Marvel  (Dark Knight  Thor,  The Avengers)   the thing that i have to say about Man of Steel  is that it is the best action superhero movie to date  It is the perfect origin story  just like Batman Begins  It has great acting  especially Henry Cavill who is portraying a perfectly troubled Superman.  The action sequences are the best action sequences to date from any action movie i have ever seen  There is an ultimately chilling ending  and yes in the theater i saw it  the people applauded in the end  something i have never seen before  For me it shows the way all action hero movies should be done  I am tired of comic book movies adaptations that with all this humor become comedies in the end  Superheroes often suffer in the comic books and this gives them the characterization of drama  not comedies  Most of the times i read critic reviews and many times i agreed with them  But not in this one  Its the first time i have serious doubts in the integrity of the reviewing system  (critics)   If we compare this movie with the Avengers for example  its definitely a more serious  ,more action packed,  more intense movie.  I dont say the Avengers is not a good superhero movie  It is  But this is even better   I would recommend to anyone to see this movie  Its everything that you would expect from a summer blockbuster and even more.",1
49,"This is the Superman movie both Superman fans and comic books fans have been waiting for. Without going into plot details everything from human (and alien) drama, romance, action and hope are presented in this film. Henry Cavill is Superman.  From Henry all the way down the actors chosen were perfect. This is a visually stunning and emotional movie. From the first scene to the last you will believe a man can stand for hope and find his way as we all try and do in this world. Go see Man of Steel.",1
50,"Man of Steel is the perfect Superhero film. Do you come to watch a (SUPERHERO FILM) for Romance or drama? No, you come to see it for action and seeing your favorite Superhero fight super villains. Man of steel gives you just that and does it in epic fashion. It's not to say this movie doesn't have drama or a little bit of romance because it does, It just doesn't dwell on it. The movie gives you a little bit of everything, it shows you krypton, which we have never seen before. Don't listen to all the people that talk bad about it, mostly its critics. Its the best Superhero film I have seen as well as the best Superman anything that has ever been created. Superman has always had it hard when it comes to media other than comics, like video games and movies. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie, you won't regret it.",1
51,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. Of course there are some elements that could be perfected, such as the performance of the main actor which in the end, you realize they didn't tell you so much about him and the way he reacts to things.Besides that, the movie is just awesome, super fast paced, an incredible story. I just want to say that: justice has been done to the most awesome superhero of all. You get to watch him in all his glory, there are no doubts about his strength and capabilities.The best movie (superhero movie, at least) that I have EVER seen.",1
52,"Very skeptical..just like I was with Batman Begins...Finally Superman done right! this one has hit the mark dead on! I was so sick of the cheesy, lovesick movies of the past. This is a great representation of the comic book Superman, well done!",1
53,I always have respect for the critics on this sight.  But they must have been smoking something to only give this movie a 55.  I saw the movie in 3D at the Midnight showing.  IT IS AMAZING!!!  The story line.  The graphics.  The special effects.  Best movie I have seen this year.,1
54,There are little things that bothered me but not enough to complain about this movie was amazing. The story line was great the characters were spot on henry cavill is a perfect superman. The action scenes were great. The visuals were by far one of the best I've seen in a while.,1
55,"The fans have spoken. This is how to make a superman movie. This is how u showcase his superpowers, his awesome strength and abilities. By giving u scenes you havent seen in any superhero movie yet. By making you pick up your jaw from the floor by the movies end. Maybe character isnt really supermans strong point unlike batman but it never really was even in the comics. Superman is all about taking things to a whole superhuman level and this film delivers in spades.",1
56,"Love this movie, it's perfect  it's definitly the best way to made a cinecomic, simply amazing, made me forget the orrible Iron Trashman 3, You'll believe a man can fly.",1
57,"How wrong can the critics be, seriously? What did they actually watch!? I expected Man of Steel to be akin to the slew of superhero movie remakes and fall into the Green Lantern trap of dull sci-fi escapism, especially when I read a few plot overviews ahead of seeing it. Instead, it hit every note perfectly  a spectacular re-imagining of the Superman franchise, providing back story, vulnerability and presence to the character. Amy Adams is well cast as Lois Lane, whist Lawrence Fishburne provides a good, surprisingly level-headed Perry White, a stark contrast to the 80s movie offering. All in all, really entertaining, does exactly what it meant to do and sets up the franchise for exciting times ahead. For this one, the Metacritic users are definitely right, the critics need to reassess.",1
58,"Man Of Steel is emotionally griping, the action scenes are brutal and overall a powerful story, this is not the next dark knight but this film makes it look like marvel is its ",1
59,You'll believe a man can fly: this is the greatest cinecomic I've ever seen. Perfect in every aspect. Cavill is the real heir to the mighty Christopher Reeve.,1
60,"I don't know how the critics could compare this movie to the likes of Michael bay. Zack Snyder did a splendid job of portraying superman as realistic as possible, something which the previous movie lacked. The emotional depth of the man behind the cape is presented in such a way, that the audience can connect with the hero and actually relate with him. The actors were perfect, with Henry Cavill shining in the superman outfit. The script was perfect, penned by goyer and nolan, presenting the story of superman's origins and his difficulties, and at the same time having enough feel of 'realism' to it just like the dark knight trilogy. The action sequences were just plain awesome, providing enough special effects to compare with the avengers. This movie was just what the once-popular hero needed, an emotional origin story with some butt-kicking action. Man of Steel provides everything one hoped for, it delivers just everything one expected in the movie. Hopefully, Superman should collect enough revenue for at least a trilogy.",1
61,"I was quite sceptical because of the previous Superman movies, which were mostly flops. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the plot, the intense action, and the character development in the movie. The Man of Steel did feel like he had that 'superhuman' factor, and the way little snippets of his past are revealed to us made him feel much more complicated, and we are able to empathize with him. I also liked how General Zod came across almost as half a good person, because his motivations behind his actions were understandable, and I found myself wondering if I would have done the same as he did if my planet was in trouble. I'm talking about Earth, that is. As for the special effects, they were spectacular and simply struck something in you. I particularly loved the portrayal of the love between Clark and his foster father. The scenes weren't very cheesy but managed to pull off a sense of deep love between the two. Overall, everything came together to create one hell of a masterpiece. I agree with the Captain too. Henry was a huge chunk of eye-candy. But of course, that's only a tiny part of what's spurring me on to catch another bite of that wholesome goodness.",1
62,"Don't listen to the critics, from a fan of the comics and a fan of film, Man of Steel delivers. Led by a solid cast, with exceptional performances from Russell Crowe as Jor-El,  Michael Shannon as Zod, and Henry Cavil as Superman himself they propel the film forwards. Everyone gets their fair share of time, I did want to see more of Kevin Costner that said. After the spectacular opening on Krypton, the film loses steam and I questioned it's pacing, but was quickly relived by how the story is told is the often non-linear style used by Nolan and Goyer Zach Snyder's direction fits the film perfectly, there's a bit of lens flair saturation but every sequence is filmed beautifully. And the action, just incredible, the flying is violent, you feel the environment shift. You get to enjoy the film more and more as it progresses, i wish they'd taken more time to delve further into the story but clocking in at around 2 and 1/2 hours, there's a solid amount of content and a good story. Though there are some pacing issues and more can be desired, Man of Steel is a superb movie that I can't wait to see again.",1
63,"Don't listen to the critics. I'm not sure if it's an elitist agenda against Snyder as a film maker or just nostalgic cinema fans who can't let go of the ""charming boy scout"" that set precedent over 20 years ago in Donner's camp-filled classic... but whatever the reason- Man of Steel is undeserving of the lackluster critical response it's receiving.Man of Steel IS the Superman movie we've been waiting for. And it really is epic.No, this isn't your parent's Superman.. This is not golden or silver age Superman- THIS is for every kid that watched Bruce Tim's ""Adventures of Superman"" and ""Justice League"" or the DC animated films like ""Doomsday"" or ""Crisis on two earths"" and said ""why can't we see THIS Superman live action?!"" This is for anyone who watched Matrix and said ""now... why can't we have a Superman that does this?"" (no.. i'm not saying it's like the matrix- at all)Now, i'm not a crier- especially at movies... but, this one had me a FEW times. There's a strong emotional thread that runs through the picture. As you follow this character who can't quite find his place, doesn't quite fit in- yet has a heart for people... a true good Samaritan, who even in the face of mockers risks his own life (to his knowledge) to save them... protect them.. you empathize with him.The critics have it wrong- Clark's not dour in this movie, he's humble. He's patient and compassionate. It's not apathy he's displaying... it's a disciplined reserve. He's a man who's learned that his power and how he chooses to use it will define who he will become. The truth is, we're seeing Clark WHILE he's still discovering himself- still finding out what the consequences are when he uses his abilities and also when he chooses not to use his abilities.This is someone who's never been able to have a real relationship with anyone.(outside of his mom and dad) and throughout the course of the movie he learns to trust people- exemplified in one person that sees who he truly is, and is not only not afraid, but honors that trust. The small moments are emotional and tender (and despite what you may have read- sometimes humorous. The audience in my theater laughed at least 2 or 3 times, out loud), the big ones are exhilarating and bombastic. The battles are TRULY epic- with much at stake... This is OUR Superman...Snyder has successfully shaken the campy ""gee whiz"" and ""Crime doesn't pay, evil doer"" caricature and given us the Superman we grew up hoping that someday... someday someone would be able to deliver and they did- and it's here- Man of Steel. P.S. the entire audience loved the film, complete with applause at the end.",1
64,"Awesome beautiful film, I almost cried throughout it, interesting thought provoking original script, my only criticism is there was too much juvenile cgi action towards the end. this is the fault of the studios trying to appeal to wider younger audiences instead of niche adult audiences. exactly the same problem as inception and batman.",1
65,"From its lusciously rich score, its tear-inducincly powerful performances, its brilliantly vast set pieces, its offbeat yet thrillingly structured story, or its commandingly auteurist direction, ""Man Of Steel"" is not only the greatest and most relatable Superman film, but it is easily one of the most entertaining superhero films I have ever seen.",1
66,"Couldn't be better, this is what we pay for, an awesome sci fi  epic superhero movie, blowing everything before it and creating great expectations for what is to come next, Marvel, watch out!  not even all your movies together can match this level of destruction, including the (not so awesome anymore) Avengers!",1
67,"I'm just going to repeat what my other fellow film fans said: don't listen to the critics.  I am not sure why they gave this film a low score.  Two words: move on. I love the Donner version as much as they do. Heck..I might have watched it at least a hundred times..but going back to that particular tone will not work on today's audiences.  What you have here is a deconstruction of the Superman's character for the 21st century: an alien immigrant who is a social outcast, who must choose between his adopted world and his true 'race'.  It has brilliant supporting casts, notably Costner's amazing performance as Jonathan Kent. Cavill also delivers as a more 'grounded' Superman. The action sequences are reminiscent of 'Japanese Anime', hence the critics 'resistance' to that particular palate: supersonic fights, buildings demolished to smithereens. It made recent set pieces looked anemic in comparison.  I watched it with a little boy beside me with his mom.  He had that same look that I used to have when I watched the original Superman many years ago: a look of awe and wonder and a belief that a man can really fly. Welcome back Superman.....",1
68,"MOVIE OF THE YEAR! Critics are HIGH, this was the best movie I've seen all year. Aside from the gripping story, fantastic score and acting, we also have some of the most EPIC DBZ-Style Fight Sequences ever put to film.  And I'm really happy with the way Superman took out Zod. (No one will ever call Superman Boring or a wimp after that final fight scene) :D Loved this Movie, can't wait for the sequel! 10/10",1
69,"After reading the critics reviews i had my doubts, but after having viewed the movie for myself i can honestly say that i believe the critics are just spiting snyder. There is no way this movie is average, a fantastically produced movie, acted superbly on most accounts, i loved it. This is on youll just have to ignore the critics on guys, trust me. Watch the user reviews and see for yourself how good it is. Fantastic. Made up for superman returns in every way. Its fallen  victim to the hobbit treatment. Fantastic movie but only the general public can see why. Just go see it.",1
70,"It was an awesome movie, with alot of action and beutiful special effects. The only thing i don't like much is the performance of the main actor, doesn't show alot of emotion. Can't wait to see the sequel and Justice Leage!",1
71,"MOVIE OF THE YEAR and the best comic book movie of ALL TIME !!! Perfect in every aspect. Cavill is Superman. Can't wait to see the sequel and Justice Leage ! 10/10",1
72,"The critics truly got this one wrong. Possibly a false sense of righteousness that critics must despise something good? I will never understand... On to the movie:A true spectacle to behold. Brilliant story. Breathless action.Unrelenting, superb, awe-inspiring, the list goes on...Rivals The Dark Knight. One of the greatest superhero movies ever made.Everyone and their grandmother should watch this film.You'll be missing out if you do not.",1
75,"Man of Steel is much more of a special effects fiasco than it is a Superman movie. Such liberties are taken with the characters, his background, his world and the people in it that this movie is almost indistinguishable from the Superman of comics and Reeves/Reeves/Roth. The movie itself is much more of an action movie with explosions and collateral damage, so much so that it is more similar to a Michael Bay movie than something with an interesting or good story. If I had never heard of Superman before, and they didn't call this Superman, I would say it's not for me.  Since it IS a Superman movie, it falls even shorter.",0
76,The final battle is Too long and the result is the leveling of major portions of Metropolis.  The Superman I remember would have done anything to minimize the destruction (including surrender).  I’m weary of these bloodless post 9/11 comic book city destruction scenes and they really wrecked the movie for me.  Film makers please watch a few minutes of the post Boston Marathon coverage and stop trivializing this kind of violence.  If the destruction depicted in this film were “real” we’d be talking casualties in the tens of thousands.,0
77,"Superman? More like superboy. An after spending the first 20 min establishing an irrelevant relationship with his father and nemesis, an early scene shows what this version is really made of. Our hero is confronted by an ignorant truck driver and humiliated. Superboy's solution is to walk away without saying a word. Very shortly we find out that he walked out and committed an obviously adolescent act by destroying the truck of the driver. The rest of the movie is built around justifications for superman behaving like a boy while all the women and men in uniform treat him like the second coming of christ. At one point he is even juxtaposed with the image of jesus as if the messiah message was to subtle. Visually satisfying at some moments is the best i can say about this movie. Wait for netflix.",0
78,"The positive reception from the users on this site just goes to show how easily entertained people are.  This movie is completely souless.  Every character feels like a cardboard cut out, which is unforgivable when you cast the likes of Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, and Diane Lane.  Man of Steel tries to be dark, and at times it is, but the movie is a little too corny to be taken seriously.  It's basically a slightly better version of a Michael Bay film, and that is obviously not meant as a compliment.  I can't remember the last time I was more dissapointed in a movie, but I suppose that's my own fault for getting excited for a Superman movie.",0
79,Crappy screenplay overblown piece of junk. Highly disappointed. Could have been so much better. Superman looks like wonder women with short hair. A disaster to DC and anyone who was apart of this movie,0
80,"It started off well enough in Krypton but then it stalled shorty after shifting to Earth and then completely went off the rails in the last hour  The flashbacks kept dialing back to his struggles when I got it the first time.  He's an adult when he is first shows on screen.  He has been struggling since he was a kid.  He went through 20+ years including all of his adult life without making much progress.  At this point, Clarke is no longer confused, he has a learning disability.   Parts of the dialogue were weak esp. where the military is shown to be caricatures incapable of telling friend from foe.  The scene in Church was ridiculous.  And Jor-El designs space craft but he couldn't think of disabling an outside key from overrding his.  BUT Zod who, from birth was only programmed to defend Krypton and has presumably no designing talent outwitted him. I mean, the list goes om.  I expect ridiculous from Trasformers but I expect much smarter from Superman..  The destructo-rama in the last act needed Michael Bay's help to direct traffic.  No way this gets a passing mark.",0
81,"There is no story-telling!Last 45 minutes of time is only action.Overloaded with actions, and of course very less humanity! Zack has preferred the 'Transformers-Dark of the moon' style for his superman reboot!!The romance between Lois and Clark was something very special, but in this movie their relationship is a 007 romance.Spectacular but no any fun nor humor",0
82,"""Man of Steel"" is by far one of the most contrived movies I've ever seen. The pacing is awful, the characters are unrelatable (Lois goes so far as to be downright annoying), and the plot is one contrived scenario after another. The logic is wishy-washy at best, preferring to just ignore facts than to take the time to explain them, and Superman's motivations are never truly clear, which makes the entire character feel fake. Beyond that, though, Superman's role in the plot is almost nonexistent: one could take him out of the movie and have the exact same plot with better pacing. Don't waste your money on this one: it's not worth it.",0
83,"Well, I will try to keep this short. I love super hero movies, love the D.C. universe in particular, and yes I have read the comics, seen previous movies and cartoons. This movie is by far the worse Superman movie and one of my top worse movies EVER! I did not mind the creative liberties that were taken with the story line, that is to be expected when someone adds their ""spin"" on an established story. The pacing was horrid! The tone was so monotone. The movie was going for the over the top serious feel. For me, it came off as corny and at times I found myself rolling my eyes at all of the dramatic screams. By the end of the movie I was thankful it was over. In short #disappointed It's too bad, I really want a Justice League or A World's Finest Movie but if either were to be based on Man of Steel I would not hold high hopes of it being any good.",0
84,It was a great movie. It was greatly directed and the visules were stunning. I never thought any super hero movie would top the dark knight... and even if man of steel might not have to some people it sure came close,1
85,"Severely underrated by the critics.  This is by far the best action film I've seen in a long time. The acting was superb and the screenplay was excellent.  The IMAX 3D version was spectacular.  A critic called this soulless, and I couldn't disagree more.  Man of Steel is an epic action movie with heart, soul, and depth.",1
86,"I found this film great, I think the acting was superb, the pacing of the film was good enough to keep you engaged all the time but at the same time learn allot about the characters and the action sequences were amazing. I don't think I have ever been to the cinema and enjoyed a film as much as this.",1
87,"And Snyder has divided the audience once again. The movie is definitely flawed but seriously doesn't deserve the backlash. We shouldn't have expected to see the same Superman, especially not when the times have changed and even when the Superman in the comics is no longer what he was. All I can say is that I had a great time and Micheal Shannon was definitely a compelling villain (which most Marvel movies lack).",1
88,"Disappointing but a good movie overall. Zack Snyder make the same mistake which he made in 300, the same thing over and over again in a fight scene. But that's at the end so it's alright. Overall Man of Steel is a good film even if it did not live up to my expectations.",1
89,"A truly exciting reboot to an iconic pre-established icon. Henry Cavil is a great Superman, Michael Shannon is a stoic yet entertaining zod, and the Snyder provides us with a adrenaline fueled look of a Kryptonians powers. Even though there may be one too many many action scenes, Amy Adams is a flat Lois Lane, and the lack of reaction from Superman witnessing 1000's being killed is not very 'Man of Steel'. It was still a very enjoyable popcorn flick.",1
90,"This Movie is F'ing awesome. This is what I want to see in a Superman movie. I felt exhilarated and into the movie. Now in saying that make no mistake that this not the Donner Superman movie, as this is not based on the silver age comic book Superman, Think John Byrne's Man of Steel comic book series or post crisis. This is a God with God like powers living in card board world. The pace wasn't a problem for me as I didn't expect Superman to be Superman yet, which is why they don't say that word alot in the film. Its not Lois and Clark with a bigger budget so don't expect a love story, expect a super powered being with real problems and a kick ass last 45 minutes and I promise you'll love it just as much as I did. marvel movies is boring for me i feel like they are for kids, dc knows how to make an good movvie",1
91,"Loved Man of Steel, it was exciting and captivating and the acting was flawless. Special effects were great and the portayel of the characters was amazing. Wasn't crazy on who they chose to play Lois Lane but other then that it was by far on of the best super hero movies I saw and I can't wait for the sequel.",1
92,"Note:8.2Man Of Steel is undoubtedly the most realistic movie about heroes based on comics, it shows more or less how it would be if a Super Human existed, the dialogues and flashbacks are of crying so beautiful that it is, it portrays well the HQ The Last Days Of Krypton and the fights are sensational,but two problems that bothered me was Lois Lane (SHE IS EVERYWHERE IN THE MOVIE) and some problems with the script during the fight against Zod, because Superman destroyed the whole city without thinking about the people, and in the end he wants to save they ... but that does not detract from the film's brilliance.Man Of Steel is a great movie with thoughtful thoughts around the film.",1
93,More of the way over the top special effects attempting to make up for lack of story and characterization.  Not surprised given that Zack Snyder directed.  Only plus: ability to fast-forward through the interminably stupid fight scenes since I rented it from Red Box.,0
94,"""Man Of Steel"" was a great effort at bringing life back to the Superman franchise but fell short of that goal. The actors & actresses in the film all did a stellar job giving their characters what they needed to bring them to life but without a compelling story, even they couldn't save this film. ""Man Of Steel"" ultimately is an entertaining film but is easily one of the weaker super hero films to be released.",0
95,"The Nolanites and Hack Snyder fan boys are in self-denial that this was a horrible film.  It makes them want to cry when every reputable critic has pointed out the glaring flaws with this mess.  Blatant ripping off every other summer blockbuster that came from it including Independence Day, Avatar, and Transformers while trying desperately to be all serious like The Dark Knight.  Superman is a fantasy film and not a dark grim ripoff of Batman which it also tries but fails badly.  Worst movie of 2013 and any followup or sequel to this tripe will be worse.",0
96,"I hated it. The violence was unnecessary, the story was dragged out, and I'm pretty sure Superman killed more people than he actually saved, with all those buildings he destroyed and streets he laid waste to.",0

This movie hit me like a harpoon.",1
101,"Superman has finally been given the justice he deserves in film. The action is phenomenal, the origin story feels fresh, and General Zod is as threatening as ever. Seeing Cavil in the Superman costume for the first time is an inspiring moment. The complaints I've heard about this movie seem ridiculous at times. It's time to let go of Reeves' dated Superman movies. Perhaps they were good for their time, but it's time Superman step properly into the present day.",1
102,"Before I watched this movie I didn't like superman I thought him as lame and a boyscout but this movie changed my view on superman it showed me that he wasn't overpowered or anything else I thought he was I think that this movie told the story of Superman's origin well showing his moral and integrity that with great power comes great responsibility its been said many times before and will be said many times again and for good reason man of steel shows that reason with flying colors something else i loked was that it showed when supermans integrity was being challenged you could we that he wanted to hurt the people taunting him and insuIting him i thought that was something cool to see because its something relatable with all of us theres always somewhere out there doing something to purposely hurt us but we try to show self restraint and as for the action the action in this movie was flawless very smooth and didn't have a bunch of CGI except when necessary (superspeed, laser vision etc) the thing a lot of people say about this movie was to much action I say yes and no he was fighting off an alien invasion after all but I think there was also to much action because the the final battle didn't have that give you goosebumps feeling and it didn't have the suspense I think a final battle should have but what I did like was how it showed off what could happen when two kryptonians go at it but after this review I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10",1

It was a refreshingly dark take on the Superman tale, and is jam-packed with huge scale action sequences. If I wasn't a massive Superman fanboy, I might be giving this a lower score. But since I am, I just simply can't give this anything less than a 7/10.  However, I hoped for a stronger startup to the DCU, and as a result, I do not think this film should be the catalyst for the DCU.  I just can't imagine a Justice League movie being as dark as this.",1

A time when women didn't have the right to vote, and everything was black or white (commie or not).

111,"When it comes to superhero movies, everyone has an opinion of which iterations was better.  At least for me, Man of Steel brought credibility to Superman who I felt had never been given a real shot at box office success.  If we're lucky, Man of Steel will be the first of multiple movies that give Clark Kent and his super-self a chance at showing why Superman is the most powerful superhero of all time.  However, as with other Superman-based movies, it's easy to see how this promising new-beginning could all come crashing down.  Mr. Zack Snyder: tread carefully.",1
112,"A refreshing new take on the Man of Steel. What I liked about this interpretation of Superman is their original take on Krypton and their Kryptonian technology and history. I like the idea of the genetically engineered Kryptonian society. The eugenics explains why Zod and his army are so ""evil"" and how they are able to adapt to the new environment so easily. Zod and Faora simply kicks ass, and the action sequences are amazing. (Although I think it's a bit too much) This is not exactly a traditional Superman story that we are all used to, so a lot of people might not enjoy it as a 'Superman' movie.The problem with Superman is that he is so powerful that he becomes unrelatable. What this film did was, they focus on the fact that Kal-El is an alien trying to fit in. By doing so, they made him seem human. He's not an outsider like Zod and his army; he's a guy who grew up in Kansas, who just happens to have these abilities, and has to deal with it. They also got rid of a lot of the Superman mythos that can be quite ridiculous and unrealistic.(such as Kryptonite, the red underwear, etc.)What I really enjoy about this movie is how they explain everything in a scientific manner. (Kal-El's abilities, Zod adaptability to his new abilities, Zod's motivations, etc.) This really grounds the story (as science-fiction instead of fantasy), and it allows me to accept the story easier. Also, they made the Kryptonians seem like a real civilisation with their own history, culture, and technology. I like how much attention they have on developing their culture. (such as the chest symbols of the different houses)The way they approach the story just makes them seem realistic and believable. What I didn't like about the movie is the pacing; it's just too fast. There's too much action/information, and not enough character development. Some of the fight scene just seem unnecessary and feels like information/sensory overload.I felt that the relationship between Lois and Clark is going too fast, and they didn't have much chemistry together. They shared a kiss that seemed unnecessary/premature. The relationship is just not well developed. I mean, sure, they had many scenes together, and they seem to get along well; however, they didn't seem like lovers, just good friends. There's also some ridiculous dialogues (i.e. ""evolution always wins"") and some religious undertones/allusions to Superman being Christ. It doesn't really bother me all that much, but they shouldn't do it too much. I liked the new theme, it's not like John William's iconic march, but it's still a good theme for Superman. In conclusion, it has it's strengths and it's flaws; there's room for improvement and can be quite disappointing (might not reach expectations), but it's still pretty good.Keep in mind that this is just the first movie in a new universe of movies; there is just too many things to set up. I'm looking forward to the next installment in the series. (Even more so now that it's announced that it's going to be Batman vs. Superman)",1
113,"Not the best Superman movie however the animation, story and progression are spot on. This is pretty much a reboot of the old famous super man movie from the 1990s. The casting roles in the characters were surprising and great choices. The movie is not as polished as the Dark Knight Trilogy but better than the last Super man movie that came before it.",1
114,"Man of Steel is probably Christopher Nolan's weakest film he has been apart of, but that takes nothing away from the shear beauty of the film. Even with moments that drag, Man of Steel soars on all other levels.",1
115,"""Man of Steel"" has some terrific and intense 3-D action but needs more humor and emotion. There are some excellent and beautiful visual effects, but the fact that Henry Cavill who plays Superman, is not very emotional, disappointed me.",1
116,"This movie is very entertaining, and definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of Superman or superheroes in general, but it has some significant flaws that keep it from being a great movie. First of all, it is fairly slow getting started: we don't see Clarke becoming Superman until like a third of the way through the movie, which is kind of a big deal for a Superman movie. Also, the last third or more of the movie is almost entirely Superman fighting the bad guys, which is fun to watch, but lacks substance--and even gets a bit boring. Finally, the movie hurts itself some by leaving some plot holes/character inconsistencies open. I don't want to give away anything, but it takes you out of the movie a bit when you see Superman being overly concerned with protecting life one moment, but then casually endangering it the next. All in all, still a good movie, but it really relies on the strength of its action scenes, not the introspective stuff it tries to pull off.",1
118,"Best Super man I have watched! It took me a long time before watching this, cause I dislike most superman movies with the same tired story. I finally watched it, and was surprised how good it was.",1
119,"After watching all those comic heroes on the big screen, I always wondered how ordinary people, not the ones from the main cast, managed to survive in their entirety. With buildings exploding and guns blaring, no one seemed to get hurt, let alone lose their lives. Of course I'm referring to The Avengers, Transformers, Spiderman and the many others (Nolan's Batman does not count for it is in a league of its own). In this regard at least, Man of Steel has been original in that not only a lot of deaths were hinted at, some of them were shown right on screen without any qualms. Call that creative if you will, or whatever, for better or for worse the invincible man himself could not keep every single human being on the planet safe from death. Henry Cavill is cast as Superman. He is charismatic, charming and good-looking, and perhaps the best cast for the role. Amy Adams plays Lois Lane, the much older love interest. Diane Lane is cast as Kent's mother on Earth. Russell Crowe portrays Superman's biological father, and is seen throughout the movie at key moments. Michael Shannon is General Zod, the villain who equals Superman in strength and skill, essentially rendering the former's physical superiority redundant, for he has followers too which brings the odds of numbers into play the same way any human encounters and confrontations would have. Nolan's involvement is palpable. A sense of realism was attempted to be incorporated. For example, the name Superman is not uttered until three quarters into the second hour. The buildings collapse as the larger than life opponents battle it out. Cars are crushed and fires break out. It's safe to say that people die in great numbers. The first hour is mainly about Superman's origins. We get to see Krypton, the alien home-world, for the first time. Unlike the other instalments in the franchise, Kent is nearing middle age before he decides (or is forced by circumstances) to take an active part in saving people openly. Before that, he roams around incognito and changes jobs and identities if he is forced by his good nature to save someone's skin. Some of his childhood on Earth is also explored. It is around the one and a half hour mark when the larger chunk of the budget for the movie begins to show, and it depletes quickly as the action sequences follow one another in succession until the very end. The film was an interesting take on the superhero concept. A degree of realism was certainly there. The lead was a good choice. And the whole idea of beings of superhuman strength getting it on with each other in the middle of civilization and spreading carnage indiscriminately was something that would have been virtually impossible to depict on screen before the advent of visual effects. But still something was missing. An ingredient which would have perhaps brought it to a final, perfect conclusion. I can't fault it for it for I could not say what they could have done differently. But I had a good time, if not stellar, so I will rate it accordingly.",1
120,"I'm not sure that any director or writing team could fit enough Superman lore into one movie and it being enough. Superman's story is just far to long and complex. With that being said I am utterly surprised just how good this movie was. I was expecting it to be a major letdown. But for what it is Zack Snyder delivered this generation's Superman and showed it as much love and attention as the screen time allowed. However I do have a few gripes:1) First time I have ever complain that there is too much action. The movie is an exciting roller coaster, and like a roller coaster rider to much for too long can leave you a little nauseated. A few pauses, perhaps with some rich narrative, between battle would have been nice.2) While I get this is a reimagining, I'm a little bummed about there being no Kryptonite, at least not in the  traditional sense. But at the very least it wasn't ruled out, so it is still possible to it in future movies.3) While Zod gives a great performance, Faora seriously steals the show every scene she's in. She is more what I expect Zod to be. Zod's OK but I found him to sympathetic. Overall:Grievances aside, I had a blast watching this movie. While it my have been the action movie equivalent of a sugar rush, it was a great rush and I look forward to future installments.",1
121,"This movie was so good although it has it's own flaws, this is possibly the most realistic take on Superman. The critics seem to like to look at Superman movies differently compare to the fans or audiences because Superman Returns got good critic reviews although majority of the fans HATED it and then Man of Steel got 55 rating but the user review have over 1,500 positive? Some do complain about the destruction of the battle but obviously something like that would take place if u had 2 overpowered kryptonians in our world....although there was alot of destrution, Superman did save the entire world from the World Engine.",1
125,Actually i can't understand critic's bad scores for this movie! I do think it's too fantastic and could've been A LOT better but frankly' i enjoyed it a lot! Highly recommended,1
127,"Never being a superman fan, I came into Man of Steel with no expectations and left feeling pretty awesome. The action scenes were great, the music was fitting the story was good too. All the actors; the Kryptonians, the army dudes, everyone, were really strong. However, the whole Superman and Lois Lane thing didn't work very well, and I felt like they were only hooking up because they were supposed to. Also, the action scenes, while impressive, got a bit out of hand towards the end, with the same superhumans braining each other against buildings for about five minutes straight, which surprisingly DOES get tiring after a while. But I felt the ending was very powerful and the whole washed-out atmosphere of the film worked really well. Any action film fan should see this.",1
128,"A truely amazing film. Finally what the fans have been waiting for a truely amazing Superman movie. I highly reccomend it to everyone. Just some random text to fill the void.",1
129,"One of the better reboots. Well the movie isn't perfect, but its really good. The just two problems with it. 1: it feels to much like chrisopher nolan batman trilogy. 2: They needed to focus more on louis and superman relationship. Like in nolans, Clark is bruding and moping around the earth and having a serious of flash backs of his life. Sounds similar right? And the relationship between Clark and Louis needs work because to be honest you won't care about it. Overall it has good acting, story,plot, and GCI. Its worth the buy.",1
130,"makes all the other supermans look average, plenty of action and destroying stuff. Like the spaceships but found the bit parts for supermans dad and daily planet chief to be boring and out of place.",1
131,"My biggest issue with this movie is that the fight scenes went on way too long. Other than that, best Superman movie I’ve seen. It is what a Superman movie should be. Plenty action, great story, introduced Krypton nicely and flashbacks were really cool. Compared to Superman Returns, Man Of Steel is far superior. It's such a good elseworld movie, this is not the Superman of the comics, people die in this movie.",1
133,"Despite its slightly unbalanced script, this superhero flick still hits its mark with plenty of grandiose special effects, intense action, and engaging performances, making for a highly entertaining Superman reboot.",1
134,"""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders"" Zack Snyder brings us the movie that we have been waiting for Man of steel is story about a young boy that discovers he has super power and is not from earth. This is the most fun iv'e had at the movies this year so far sorry Star Trek. Despite what the critics say about this movie I loved it. I just got out of the theater less then 20 minutes ago and let me say this is the best superman yet. I am a fan of Donners Superman movies 1&2 and I felt this just took it to the next level. This is the superman movie we have been waiting for i know everyone has their own opinion but seriously this the best one yet so glad that they nailed this movies because if they didn't i don't know how long it was going to be before they even tried to reboot the franchise. I was a little worried about the early reviews for this movie. I as sat through the movie I was waiting for the plot to go dull or the acting to become robotic or for the dialogue to die out but that moment never came. The action was never over the top and i didn't think that it was too heavy i'm not sure how the critics thought that this movie was just turned blockbuster blunder. The story was told perfect this is all you can think while watching it is "" I have so many questions"" and in way or from throughout the movie it get's told buy. The story was fluid and thought that the flash back never felt lost me nor ever did i feel confused as some of the critics have said about it. I also like how they triggered the flash backs they didn't just throw then in there like some movies have done. Lets get onto the action, oh man was the action so awesome there was so much destruction. Iv'e read the comics and Iv'e seen the animated movies and that is in those but this was just insane. For me this is the best comic book movie action yes the avengers had it's grand scale but this was another level so many great moments buildings falling all over the place, ships being blown out of the sky seeing krypton being blown up. At no point when i was watching it was i like ok let's tone back some of the action and get back into some story but no i that felt like it was too much that's just me though. I have been waiting for this movie since 08 and having to wait those five years to finally see it im so glad that it's everything I thought it would be. An amazing action film with hart and soul another thing that the critics thought that this movie didn't have. The cast overall did great and I can't complain about anyone. Henry Cavill (Clark Kent / Kal-El) was perfect he killed it as Kal-El he looks the role, he's likable, he is relatable as a person you can still tell he has moral fiber he wants to be good person and he acts like it he is what i wanted superman to be. Amy Adams did a great Lois Lane, Kevin Costner did an amazing Jonathan Kent really glad they did great with character a lot of the heart felt moments were with him. Michael Shannon as General Zod was great though I was hoping for him to steal the show and take control of his role making it seem like he was the only one that could have done Zod. He doesn't do that but that doesn't take away from him big a super kickass villain. The visuals in this movie were amazing and it only dawned on me who was behind the special effects till the end of the movie of course it's Weta Digital. They have been seriously stepping up with each movie they been a part of the last couple years. Every time i watch a movie with amazing special effects i look to see who did it and most the time it's them. They have done the special effects for every comic book since X-Men: First Class and i don't need to tell you how great that movie looked not to mention they do all the Peter Jackson films so that's petty much tells how great these guys are. I guess i should mention that they also did James Cameron's Avatar. I know some people don't like Zack Snyder's but i like the guy his movies are great all but one that is. I also know that some people don't like Watchmen but for me that was one of the best comic book movies iv'e watched and now this one is maybe even going to beat watchmen for my most liked film by him. And really I know some people were maybe expecting a little more Christopher Nolan feel to it but no this is a Zack Snyder film for sure. Some of the shots that are in this movies are just really get the close up of the pencils, the close up on the butterfly on the swing those are some great shots especially the butterfly one that one was beautiful. Also another amazing thing about this film was the score it was breathtaking really some of Hans Zimmer's best work at least for me. I actually pre ordered the deluxe edition online i'm so glad I did that also thought it was better then any of the Dark Knight Trilogy scores. 8.0",1
135,"A generally excellent film. Superman's new look really works with the modern superhero image. The script was weak at times, with a few cheap, unnecessary cliche lines toward the end of the movie. Go figure. Getting a look back on Superman's past was a nice touch to the movie. After all, this is a prequel. There was almost never a boring moment.",1
136,"I have a Love/Hate relationship with this film, i really did like it because it has Superman+Action, but i didn't think the destruction was all that necessary. Not to mention it suffers for having really unforgettable characters including Clark Kent himself. Solid film overall worth a watch to judge for yourself.",1
137,"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. I loved the direction it took; it was very similar to the dark knight series (sans the extensive visual effects) Also like the dark knight series, it was loaded with great actors and sub stories. Hands down to a movie. I consider superior to Iron Man 3.",1
140,"Destroyed New York, ruined millions, (so much damage even mankind itself could not have caused, even starting a world war.) So how many exist olzhen world (I admit that Superman is immortal, will work tirelessly) to wreak damage, do not say more about the benefits of mankind. The film is not bad, but the story would be better.",1
145,This film beats the Avengers by miles. It shows the inside struggle of the Man of Steel. The effects are incredible. The villain isn't typical at all like all other movies have tried.,1
146,"Man of Steel tells the story of how Clark Kent became Superman. It shows the hard times Clark had like bullying, his dad's death and trying to keep his super powers a secret. The main villain of this movie is General Zod, who killed Clark's original dad in the beginning of the movie. The movie has some really epic action scenes like the fights between Superman and Zod, which lasted for quite some time but they were still epic. When I first saw Clark Kent as an adult, I wondered why Tom Welling did not reprise his role as Clark Kent for the movie, but Henry Cavill still did a great job with it. The only problems I had with the movie was the lack of character development and the one scene where the actor for General Zod was kinda overacting but overall it was a great movie and I don't know why critics do not like the movie, it is really good movie.",1
147,"Couple problems here and there. Main problems I had with it were the shaky cam, and there's a good 5 - 10 minutes where Jor-El recounts the first 15 minutes of the film, WHICH WE SAW. Also, Lois Lane being asked to board Zod's ship, and then they just sort of... forgot about her. Really, they take her on the ship, then put her into a cell, and just forget about her. No explanation as to why she was needed.That said, it's still an enjoyable film. Well worth seeing.",1
148,"This movie was one of my most anticipated movie of last summer and it didn't disappoint. I loved it and I am not even a big superman fan. Action scenes were awesome and there were so many of them which kept me into it the whole time. There were times where there wasn't much action happening and a lot of dialogue which is why the run time was so long, but these scenes to me were needed in the movie and belonged there. A great dialogue with stand out performances all made this movie great.",1
149,I dont get the hate on this movie... i think its really good. A bit dark and a bit to over the top with the action. But the story is great and Cavil is great as superman,1
150,"Critics say it is too dark, it has too much action.. yeah ok it is darker than every other superman incarnation and at some points the action could have been cut down a little bit but overally the film was great! You just have to accept that it is a bit different take on Superman. It shows the begining of the hero and it does it perfectly. The action is very good because it depicts superman's powers Perfectly. Henry Cavill is great as Kal-El. Amy Adams as lois lane.. uh I don't know.. Lois' character is not relly developed in this movie, but it wasn't supposed to be. It is just an introduction. And for the Superman causing to much chaos and destruction .. it was just great! It can kickstart the next movie, by showing people doubt Superman for the damage he caused. And for killing Zod.. even better! The perfect origin for Superman's no killing rule! You saw how he screamed in pain right? In the end the movie is not just enjoyable but cleverly written and directed. Good acting and great effects make this the best Superman movie to date. Imperfect but great!",1
151,"Man of Steel was a good film and it was entertaining i had my doubts at first but it turned out pretty well. The one thing that I didn't really like about the film, they didn't show enough of his powers like super speed or his breath (I'm just being picky). But overall a good film.",1
152,"I don't think a superhero movie has divided opinion as much as Man Of Steel. I loved it. As a superman fan I was really happy with it. I have seen it about 5 times. I really like DC's approach to superhero movies a darker, more realistic grounded tone. While there were faultsLois was a little underdeveloped and I thought Amy Adams was a little miscast.The Destruction of Metropolis at the end seemed a little much and by the time Zod and Clark faced off you felt a little exhausted of the amount of destruction. But the good points Henry Cavill was BrilliantZod and Faora were great villiansKryptionians felt powerfulFight scenes were great if not a little too longLiked the flashbacks to Clark's childhoodFelt like a realistic reaction to alien life The film left me wanting more and i can't wait to see what they do with batman vs superman in 2016",1
153,"I knew that Zack Snyder should have done that, but I don't blame him. This reboot made it that close, but it failed, it was the critics that ruined this movie which makes me frustrated! I deeply enjoy this movie, Henry Cavill is a gorgeous yet a muscular character, and General Zod is more cruel than he ever was. It really has  some epic fight scenes but there might be a slight problem, too many destruction across the city of Metropolis and Superman's committed killing Zod and failed to save some citizens which is predictable.",1
154,"This movie is great, I don't care what anyone says. No one appreciates this movie because they say it's full of ""destruction porn."" While I have to agree that the violence is a bit excessive, it is excessive for a reason. This is because this movie is showing an inexperienced and young Superman unlike the experienced and wise Superman played by Christopher Reeve. The Superman in Man of Steel has way more human qualities and has a hard time controlling his powers, which is much more realistic. I also appreciated when Superman killed General Zod in this movie because he was making the very bold and difficult choice of killing the only other and last Kryptonian. You can see he was upset because of his crying after this scene. He had no choice! All of the realism in this movie combined with the awesome effects and solid acting makes Man of Steel get a 9/10 (Awesome).",1
155,"Man of Steel is the Superman movie that I've been waiting for! From the beginning to the end Superman never slows down. Even at the beginning of the movie the destruction of Krypton is more complicated than in the comic books but it adds to the story. I had my concerns at first when Henry Cavill was cast as Clark Kent/Superman. He proved he can play Superman but we didn't get to see the Clark Kent nerdy reporter side but for the most part I'm sold on him as Superman. Seeing Superman fly at high speeds and fight the other kryptonians was amazing! Critics did not give this movie a fair shake its one of the best superhero movies I've seen. Finally I'm happy to say Man of Steel is superb,amazing, and Super! 9 out of 10",1
156,"When I first watched Man of Steel I was completely against it. After actually watching it as a movie and not an anti-superman fan, I really enjoyed the movie. I had a really hard time finding a flaw outside the movie, that is besides the main flaw: Lois Lane. Now my reasoning is this: She comes in on a dig site to be in the right place at the right time, wants to find the mysterious man she met, does basic research and I do mean basic, asks a couple questions and find Clark. She also stated that he has spent a lifetime hiding.  When Zod comes and demands Clark/Cal they specifically ask for her even though she has no bearing at all besides the comic book relation. Forced into more of the story by being on a Military aircraft during a bombing, and needs saving on more than one occasion. Zack Snyder forced Lois to be the love interest to fill the comic fans of the golden age. As for the rest of the movie, it was great. The fights showed how Superman is truly Superman who is struggling with his full potential. Great origin and cast. All of the movie besides the forcing of Lois Lane to be the love interest was amazing.",1
158,"The first time I watched ""Man of Steel"", I thought it was OK. However, after watching it again and again, I realized it was better than just OK. The characterization is poor and even tough the narrative is great sometimes, it can also be very strange. However, the action is spectacular, even if it's taken a little too far. Newer Superman fans will definitely enjoy this take on the iconic superhero, but I doubt longtime fans will effectively relate to the overall story and characters.",1
160,"I think this film is a suited film for people who already know what Superman is about and kinda know the basic story. Man of Steel doesn't feel like it gives a full understanding of what Superman is. I think it's more of a interpretive sequel to the current understanding of Superman in people's mind. This is why I think it's lost some people, but I think this is a great movie. I don't think it stands on it's own two feet as a movie in itself but as an addition and reinvention without completely explaining everything that Superman is that we already know.",1
161,"This is a film that is ridden with flaws, but the breathtaking spectacle and innovative approach Zack Snyder takes with the classic superhero narrative is undeniably brilliant.",1
162,"Man of steel is by no means a Fantastic film but I feel the film has some great moments with real raw emotion also henry cavil is a very awesome superman and Clark Kent not to mention the jaw droppingly awesome action and visual effects my only problems with Man Of Steel lie with the underdeveloped supporting characters, superman's carelessness for human life when he destroys buildings while fighting Zod and the Christ or saviour metaphors that run throughout the film, in the end I really enjoyed it and I never got why Man Of Steel received mixed reviews but the lackluster Superman Returns a relatively positive reception7.5/10",1
163,"""Man of Steel"" breaks with past ""Superman"" films. Visually, this is an impressive film. The action sequences are pretty epic and certainly the smart selection of scenes and abundance of this action make this two-plus-hour ride go rather quickly. This is a new and smart version of Superman.",1
164,Cavill and Synder did a pretty solid job and bringing superman back on the screen. The best Superman in my opinion in terms of film and casting. I can't wait to see where the DC cinematic universe goes from here,1
165,"It is a very good movie, but in history there are many plot holes in the origin of the famous hero, which is ""Superman"".The effects are spectacular, Krypton design, the design of armor and ships. I remembered a lot to ""Pandora"" of ""Avatar"".Sups when fly is spectacular, and its AMAZING blowsThe performances are good, Henry Cavill is a good Superman, with an origin but messy well done and a great villain who is Michael Shannon as Zod SPECTACULAR8/10",1
166,I heard it was awesome and I went to go see it and I agree what people say. I loved the flashbacks especially and the action scenes that's actual action unlike other movies that have a cheap action sequence. though I don't know why he couldn't just fly away with him instead in snapping his neck but it was a epic neck snap.,1
167,"Despite the romance being bland, Man of Steel is an exciting, action packed movie that will thrill fans, but disappoint critics. Even though Man of Steel is filled with a surprising amount of action sequences (which were the best parts of the movie), the movie does an excellent job in telling the tale of Clark Kent and his rise as Superman.",1
168,"Very comic book accurate and gave us a taste of Superman's true power that we see all the time in animated series and movies not to mention the comics. Superman also has always been a bit hot headed and jumps into a fight initially before thinking. To say what I just said is not true means you are not aware of the comic Superman history or you are just hating on the movie for personal reasons. And by no means am I saying you have to like the movie or any Superman movie but to say that any of the previous Superman movies were better is comical....pun intended. Man of Steel was amazingly written. The best set up for a villain in a comic book movie ever as the first 15 to 20 minutes was used to set up Zod. Zod's motivation was very clear and in a weird way you sympathized with Zod's point of view of saving his race; it was only his method of accomplishing his goal of saving his race that most disagreed with. Man of Steel also was a movie about a son and his two fathers laying the ground work for Superman. Both fathers wanted to protect their son while knowing that one day he would be great and they were right as his very first task was not saving a plane from crashing but saving the human race from extinction. Visually this movie showed you exactly what you see in the comics as it relates to Supermans true power which is god like.",1
169,"WHAT I LIKED: The first half of this movie is actually ok, Snyder taking some time to peg some characters well, and establish a tone fairly nicely with the use of flashbacksWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Having said that, it does take along while to get going, and when it does it's pretty awful. If you thought elements of the first half were far-fetched and ridiculous, you haven't seen anything yet. From here on, the film is a mess of CGI, aliens and bizzare rubbish that will stop you caring even an ounce. A lack of emotion, grittiness and any sort of sense, the whole last hour and a quater of this film is on such a huge scale, but with no real gravitas and just makes you feel kind of empty and bored.VERDICT: A good film for the first bit, then prety terrible after that. 'Man of Steel' establishes characters well, but does little else in terms of plot, emotion, or... anything much at all.",0
170,"More like DecentmanMan Of Steel’s trailers looked f*cking incredible, But the final product is disappointing in that aspect, But that’s not a bad thing at all because Man Of Steel has glimmers of brilliance here and there, BEAUTIFUL visual effects, great acting from Cavill, Adams, Crowe, Costner, and Shannon, and an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING score from Hans Zimmer.",1
171,"Henry Cavill does an outstanding job as the Superman Icon. Out of all of Zack Snyder's movies, Man of Steel is the greatest.",1
172,"SPOILERS AHEAD.Amazing how things change over the years. When I was a young boy, I saw a squeaky clean Christoper Reeve in his neon blue outfit and it left a lasting impression. Long after the movie, we would still run around on our farm with red swimming towels flapping in the wind behind our backs. In those moments, the lines between fantasy and reality blurred and I became the super hero I adored.But the way we perceived this person, this alien, had to change. This story had to be told from a different angle. We had to see it from a realistic and emotional point of view.His personal struggle is beautifully told and succeeds in creating a deep sense of empathy. A man who had to let his farther die because he believed it when his farther told him that the world was not ready for him. A man who had to hide his identity ending up drifting around from one place to the other.This is his journey. He brings goodness to us, but also evil and he knows he is accountable.In the end, he becomes a being of hope, bridging the divide between a distant extinct planet and earth.  He becomes a link between them and us who ends up saving us and fulfilling his father's vision.In conclusion. The way Superman was portrayed in the 80ties, was through the eyes of children. In this movie, Kal-El is presented to us through the eyes of the adults we have become. Not only does he bridge the gap between his planet and ours, and the gap between hope and despair. In a sense, he bridges the gap between us and our child like perception of him.",1
173,"The movie was awesome lots of action, a little bit of humor not much though and had some very emotion parts.The visual were spectacular and hans zimmer did ah wonderful good on the soundtrack. Henry cavil was an very good superman i still liked reeves more. Overall it was very good and my favorite movie of  the summer so far",1
174,"MOS (Zack Snyder) is the latest comic-book based reboot of the Superman story where first contact is the main epilogue for the film. Where Superman Returns (2006) paid homage to the Donner-Reeve films, Man of Steel gives this boy scout a well needed injection of sun light in a back-story heavy extravaganza. The film uses a variety of source materials for inspiration (Sullivans, Whitney) as well as setting up a possible JL movie  Whilst many question the ending, you have to say to yourself  surely the way we expected him to be comes from somewhere?",1
175,"There is no way to explain the critics' panning of this other than pure Zack Snyder bias. It was exhilarating from start to finish. There was enough absurdity to pay homage to the printed canon as well as enough emotional performances and painstaking attention to visual detail to suspend disbelief even in the most unbelievable moments. It's not tongue-in-cheek Marvelesque, it's definitely somewhat dark and in the same vein as Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. My only complaint is the ""he's kinda hot"" line. You'll know it when you hear it. I was luke-warm on 300, hated Sucker Punch, and kinda liked Watchmen, but this film made me a big ZS fan and I can't wait for what comes next. His reverence for the source material is apparent in every frame and his visual brilliance with the medium is breathtaking. Almost makes me think a Justice League film could work.",1
176,"First off be warned that this version is a completely different take any Superman you will have ever known or seen.  This is why we get people complaining.. But if Snyder and Goyer followed the story traditionally, then you'd have people complain that it brought nothing new to the table.  How can they win?  Well they win by successfully presenting a fresh and updated take.  It's moving with the times.  It's very good so give it a chance.  There are hardly any boring moments and the action is great. Cavill makes a sombre and amateurish Superman in his early days believable.  Amy Adams is good in just about anything she appears in and in Lois Lane she has given us the best version, be it comic book or film.  Which leads me on to state that this movie is just as much about Lois Lane as Superman.  Never would I have ever imagined that a Lois Lane movie would work and it has here.I'll finish off on why this movie didn't get a perfect 10.  Well it is long at over 140 minutes. But here's the thing, it didn't feel like it at all and the time flew by. A good sign, though that's where MOS falters a little.  The film has a lot crammed in and could have done with more character and story development. Let'd hope the director's cut sorts this out. Lastly I have no idea why the critics have have been so harsh. But it just seems like it's their current M.O.  Just to hate.   Heed my warnings/tips and watch it for yourself.  I didn't regret it.",1
177,"8/10 for a super hero movie  9/10 for a Superman movie.  Great origin movie  and easily the best Superman movie to date.  Visual effects and fighting is amazing  story is a bit simple, but it has it's moments.  Highly recommend seeing in 3D AVX or some other kind of Digital Projector.",1
178,"This movie is hands down one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen.  It captures Superman perfectly, showing off just about all of his powers, and giving a very good retelling of his origin story.  I think this movie is better than any of the Superman movies that came before it, because those movies were all about crazy fun, and no seriousness whatsoever.  However, this movie is almost totally serious, and is more like a modern day superhero movie.  The retelling of Superman's origin story is done flawlessly, and is relatively easy to follow.  It was very nice seeing how Clark Kent turned from an outcast at school into the world's greatest superhero.  It had a pretty cool villain too.  The special effects of this movie are phenomenal, making the entire movie look great.  All of the explosions and punches sounded very good, and the CGI is flawless.  The movie really is a sight to behold and listen to.  However, the best thing about this movie in my opinion is the soundtrack.  Hans Zimmer did a fantastic job with this movie's score, and I think that it is the best soundtrack that he has ever composed.  In case you are wondering why, well not only does it sound amazing but he achieved the impossible: making a soundtrack that could top John William's Superman soundtrack.  Yes, I think that this movie's soundtrack does indeed top John William's soundtrack.  The reasoning behind this is that despite John William's fantastic job with the original Superman score, it only seemed to capture Superman's heroic side, and not enough of his emotional side.  Hans Zimmer manages to capture both sides with his incredible soundtrack, which in my opinion, makes his soundtrack better than John Williams' in this case.  The movie is also very well written and acted.  The writers wrote the lines perfectly for this movie, and the casting and acting were also done very well.  Overall, I believe that this is a truly fantastic movie, and the critics are rating it far lower than they should.  This movie has not only more than earned my vote for movie of the year, but it is also a perfect movie that brings back one of the world's most iconic characters in history.",1
179,"Wow.  This is the Superman movie I've been waiting over 20 years to see.  I was 6 years old when I first saw Superman the movie, of course I already knew of him from Superfriends.  Christopher Reeve made Superman come alive was real for me, and yes, I truly did believe a man could fly.  However, time has made such vast improvements on film technology, the older films really don't hold up as well as they once did.  Not to mention that resolving the first movie by reversing time was one of the sloppiest laziest ideas ever. This new movie evolves the story of Superman's origin, but in new and interesting ways.  I watched most of this movie with my mouth in an open smile, seeing Superman so alive and real, it was like I was a kid again. The acting is all top notch, and Henry Cavill looks and feels every bit the hero we want him to be.  Zod is incredible and menacing, and Superman is battling for the fate of humanity, not against some billionaire with a real estate scheme, so the gravitas of this film is palpable.  Kevin Costner is amazing as Superman's Earth father,  and continues the long tradition of making me tear up for Jonathan Kent. Special effects are so life like, and Snyder is a master of action, so fight scenes are creative, and the action is grand in scale yet shown in a way that makes it easy to follow.  I was blown away when a Kryptonian took out a squad of solders at super speed, it was so cool looking!  Superman's battles are amazingly choreographed with the fight scenes covering miles and twisting through the air and flying through exploding buildings.  (Our group did feel somewhat disturbed by the amount of civilian casualties, both seen and unseen, couldn't Superman have fought them in a desert or something?  We forgive him because it's his first battle though). Man of Steel was an amazing experience, and despite what some say, I found it had just enough lighthearted and endearing moments to break the tension, and an ending that left he whole theater with smiles on their faces.  I think I may go see it again in IMAX, just so I can see it even larger than life.   I don't really understand the critics panning this movie so harshly.  Then again, they were wrong about the Hobbit too, IMO. Man of Steel leaves the door wide open for it's sequel, and I think we can expect to see more of the Clark  Superman dynamic, as well as a better love story forming with Lois Lane (who I loved in this flick, even if she is a little underused).  9/10, a near perfect movie, and the best Superman movie of all.",1
180,this movie has it al amezing action and some cry moments and amezing acting with russel crowe and the amezing other people in this movie its so good with a lilte sci fie elements and extreme music from hans zimmer its just so good do not lissen to the critics this movie is just sooo amezing so gat of your lasy as and go f.... see this movie,1
181,"To put it simply, Man Of Steel does for Superman what Batman Begins did for Batman.We're given our hero at the early stages of his career and we see grow and shape into what we believe the character to currently be. The film handles Superman's upbringing very well, but also at the same time setting up the final conflict of Earth's invasion. Also, the special effects are spectacular. It captures the essence of any Superman comic from my childhood! It just felt great to see two of my favorite characters face off in such a grandiose fashion. To sum it up, Man Of Steel is the perfect start to a new line of promising Superman films. I hope we see something even better come next.",1
182,"Man of steel is truly amazing. We get to see the emotion that superman has to the world hes different from the rest of the world as he has a hard time keep his secret. Because he is always saving people.The movie is really good as i recommend anybody to watch it A superman fan or not when i went to the cinema with a friend who hates superheroes and he absolutely loved the movie so is this movie good no its not  its mind blowing. Get out and watch this flick its a really good movie.",1
183,"Man Of Steel is like a mash up of the two early Superman films, but that's not a bad thing.  I'm not going to compare this film to the earlier ones other than to say that this one is more serious in tone, but I liked that.  There is nothing wrong with some humor in a film, but when there is an apocalyptic event going on, like in this film and Avengers for example, I don't think humor fits in too well.  With billions of dollars in damage and people surely dieing, I don't know why Iron Man would be cracking jokes, but anyway.The story starts out on Krypton of course and this is a vision that is brand new.  It was very nicely done and I wish this part of the story was actually longer, but it was still good the way it was.  Fast forwarding to Earth, Clark's childhood is told in the form of flashbacks.  I didn't mind this aspect either.  One thing that did bother me somewhat was when he actually becomes Superman(with the suit and all), this part feels rushed.  Unlike on Krypton which I felt could've used more build up, but was ok, this part of the film was quick and to the point.  Could've used more development.  The Characterization that is being mentioned in other reviews is very well done for Kal-El/Clark.  This comes at the expense of some of the other characters just because of the screen time taken up, but I don't think it really takes away from the movie.  The sequel can be used for more character build up for the supporting cast.  The special effects are very well done and FINALLY do we as fans, get a Superman movie with TONS of action. The final act has a scene or two that some people may or may not like.  I didn't mind them and thought they brought a bit more depth to the movie overall. This was a great action movie, an even greater Superman movie and a great comic book movie.  I look forward to the sequel and maybe if this does well, which does deserve the support of fans and non-fans alike, we can see a Justice League movie or a World's Finest Batman/Superman team up in the future. 8/10 overall.",1
184,"First of all, I'm in no way a fan of Superman. I haven't watched the previous movies, nor have I read the comics. In fact, I find the character pretty dull an outdated  he's way too overpowered, too allmighty. But this movie is a different case. As for the plot, it's still pretty average, not always logical and somewhat too serious, BUT the action here is stellar. From the astonishing opening sequence to the epic in all means final battle the action here is the best I've seen in a long while. Seriously, no one, not the Transformers, and not even the Avengers have destroyed half a city in such a spectacular way. Superman and his foes exchange devastating blows, throw trains at each other and punch through buildings, and that really gives the chills. Another chill-giving aspect is the soundtrack  Hans Zimmer just couldn't fail in this department, the score is purely epic. To sum up, Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David Goyer (director, producer and screenwriter, just in case), considering a pretty weak and bland character they were using as a base, performed admirably, making one of the best blockbuster movies I've seen in a while. Just don't expect a cult classic like the Dark Knight.",1
185,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Man of Steel, what with Zack Snyder behind the camera and David S. Goyer writing the screenplay. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. Man of Steel retells the origin story of Kal El and follows the story of him as an alien trying to find his place in the world. The film benefits from a smart, fresh take on Superman and strong performances from the cast, with Henry Cavill owning the role of Superman. While very different from the older Superman movies, yet somehow similar, Man of Steel delivers on what Superman Returns failed to give moviegoers back in 2006. High octane intense action sequences, and consistently strong writing. Overall, a fantastic, yet imperfect superhero film, with something for hardcore fans and newcomers alike.",1
186,"I will start this off by saying before this film I really did not care about Superman in anyway and did not think a modern movie could really make me care. I went to this only to appease my boyfriend and out of curiosity. This was a truly great film. It might not be oscar caliber but honestly it doesn't need to be to be great. Most hero origin movies are the ""boring movies"" in the trilogy and are handled very chronologically. You always have to deal with the hero having that awkward phase where they are trying to find themselves. It's a fine premise but most of the time it consumes way too much of the movie. The origin story in this movie is handled very well with the flashbacks of the past at appropriate times that last as long as they need to to get the point across while the main story in the present progresses. This film does have flaws that would take a long time for me to explain but flaws and all I enjoyed this film. It never bored me or made me hope it was gonna wrap up. I understand not every hero movie should take the Dark Knight formula of realism but it had a good balance of fantasy and realism. I dare say.... no I'm gonna say it I enjoyed this movie WAY more than Dark Knight Rises and think it's a superior movie (raise your pitchforks at me if you must).",1
187,"First off, I read all the bad reviews, that lowered my expectations a lot, then I had a Superman marathon watching all the old ones and then I went to see Man of Steel, and the only thing I can say after seeing it is; Superman really needed a good solid reboot and I think this is the best Superman movie ever!",1
188,"This is a movie about Truth, Justice, Honor, Tradition, and Culture. Everything that made America great in the past. This is why the Liberal Movie Critics are trashing it. Politics aside, the movie is great!",1
189,"One of the best superhero movies ever made, the look of the film is amazing and destroys Henry Cavill as Superman (Clark Kent and how), and the action scenes are of the highest possible quality, is like the fight scenes transformers but only you know what is happening and of course the action scenes are better filmed, and the story of the film is excellent and has some references to comics, anyway Man of Steel is a movie which is indispensable to REALLY superman fan.",1
190,"I've loved the movie. It's a nice well dine reboot of superman with many details improved from previous versions. I liked it more than many of the Avenger's films (teamed or solo) even more than Spider-Man.It lacks the twists of Dark Knight but still effective entertainment.Some times the special effects are way too cluttered near the end but let's salute the quality of them.",1
191,"Man of Steel: Best movie of the freakin' year! This movie is incredible! Finally, a great Superman movie! There has never been an actual good live-action Superman movie until now. If you liked those old Christopher Reeve movies or Superman Returns, then I'm sorry, but you know nothing about Superman. In all the Comics and cartoon, Superman always had very Sci-Fi stuff involved with a lot taking place on other planets with different technology and had a lot of action and destruction. None of this awesomeness happened in those older movies. Instead, a bunch of stupid crap happened, like Superman flying around the world to turn back time and him sleeping with Lois, which he would never do. The series should've been rebooted a long time ago, and finally it has been. This movie is just as good of a reboot as, if not better than, Batman Begins, The Incredible Hulk, and The Amazing Spider-Man. This is the first time I actually felt like Superman in a live-action movie was actually super and awesome and actually had a threat that was worthy of him. And this movie had one of the most exciting and shockingly fantastic climaxes to a movie ever. I don't know how people could not love this film.",1
192,"So I’ve been gunning for this reboot ever since Zach ‘my films are what they use to break people in Gitmo’ Snyder was announced as the director. Which is why it’s so hard to admit that the latest chapter in the DC cannon is actually quite good. However, it is some small consolation that this appears to be the direct result of Batman saviours Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer keeping Snyder’s most garish excesses in check. Instead, they’ve crafted an origin story that is both familiar and new, from an overlong opener on a dying Krypton to a childhood in Kansas told in flashback to the rise of a superhero pitted against the only surviving members of his race as warmongering zealot General Zod tracks him down. Without doubt, Man of Steel is weakest when Snyder’s hyperkinetic style is unleashed. The jittery camerawork and occasionally half-baked effects detract from the otherwise bone-crunching hurly burly as near immortals throw each other across small towns and bustling Metropoli as DC seem determined to outdo their Marvel rivals in terms of onscreen destruction. It’s no surprise that Michael Shannon wears the cloak of relentlessly genocidal psychopath like a glove in yet another role that he seems to have been born to play. Like Shannon, Russell Crowe sidelines memories of his predecessor as noble Jor-El. Acquitting himself with equal aplomb despite even greater scrutiny is Henry Cavill as the titular Man of Steel. Unlike the  let’s face it, terminally dull  goody two shoes Supermen of previous incarnations, Cavill’s Superman is good to his core thanks to his upbringing, but also unmistakably human to boot. Not for him endless martyrdom and humble forgiveness  this Supes has a temper. The rest of the cast (largely quality character actors plucked from primetime TV) put their backs into necessarily one dimensional characters. Oddly, only the usually likeable Amy Adams fails to light up the screen, leaving Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane the as yet unsurpassed benchmark. Some will miss the underpants (that’s right, they’ve been banished, at least from the outside), Jimmy Olsen, and other much-loved tropes, not least John Williams’ iconic theme music. But, nostalgic as I am for the Superman of old, it’s hard to deny that Hans Zimmer’s effort are at least as stirring. It’s clear from the grounded look of the film (only the heat vision jars) that Nolan’s Batman will not form part of the much vaunted Justice League movie. This isn’t just a Superman reboot  the fate of the entire DC multiverse rests on Man of Steel’s box office. And so it is  grudgingly  that this sceptic must confess to being very keen to see more.",1
193,"Superhero movies do not get better than this. Can you believe the cast of supporting characters? Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Amy Adams, Lawrence Fishburne, and on and on. Everyone had great performances with solid material to work from.  I am a passionate sci-fi and fantasy fan who has never really been into Superman, but this movie just changed it all. Great work, highly recommend. Can't believe the critical reception.",1
194,"Critics are conflicted but I felt ""Man of Steel"" was the best movie I had seen in a long while. It's not big on plot development (let's face it, pretty much everyone watching it knows how Superman started) and some liberties are taken with characters (not too noticeable though), but it was a masterful synthesis of action, screenplay, and meaning that will take you away if you let yourself become immersed in it. I'm just glad it didn't go down the old dreaded path of ""Superman is invincible until exposed to a magical sample of glowing moon-rock"", which has been the bane of practically everything Superman to date.",1
195,"Extremely entertaining. A very interesting look at the world of Superman. Very much enjoyed the action sequences and the film's cinematography. Lost me a few times with it's cheesy moments, but that's expected from a summer blockbuster. Looking forward to seeing it again.",1
196,"I REALLY enjoyed this movie.  I didn't find it too ""serious"" or lacking humor the way film critics did, as I felt that fit the story.  I think my few gripes and why I didn't give it a 10 are simply with the direction of storytelling following the transition to Earth.  I feel like the flashback approach felt way too choppy and unnecessary.  I feel it could have all been settled with even one simple flashback upon him in the water that lead to coming back out after, minus the end scenes with his father that could have then been brought about in a ""finalizing"" flashback after.  Also, him finding the ship, due to the choppiness, felt extremely rushed and out of place.  I'm hoping for and extended cut that gives slightly more story there and transition.  Also, while it was necessary for the current story, Lois Lang's story felt arbitrary overall, with her almost put into scenes and events by the ""hand of God"".  She didn't get time to really be her OWN character, instead more there ONLY to develop Clark.  Those minor gripes aside, the rest of the story-telling was, especially everything related to Krypton, Zod, and the interaction and plot there-in was stellar!",1
197,"As a huge Superman fan i went into this movie with astronomical expectations. So high, that i really thought there was no way they could be met. Im happy to say that this movie blew them away. Superman was handled so perfectly in this film. He's not the big blue boyscout, but is actually a conflicted man that's tired of always having to hide who he really is. I loved the characters in this movie. Jor El was great, The Kents were great, and Zod and Faora were mazing! I loved the new backstory for Kal, it was a very interesting take on a story we've all heard before. Now, where this movie really wowed me was the action. Never before have we seen a Superman movie like this. Heck, in the previous films he hardly punched anything. So to have about an hour of super good epic actiony goodness was amazing. The effects were great, the fight was epic, and the fallout from the battle is incredible. I really don't know where they can go from here, because this movie really pulled out everything. The movie, however is not without it's issues. The Lois Lane relationship feels a bit forced and the final ending sequence has some things that i would have changed to more properly follow the tone set up but the conclusion of the epic battle. Overall though, i really think this movie will make a believer out of anyone and i hope more people can finally enjoy my favorite hero of all time, Superman.",1
198,"I had high expectations going into this movie, then got a little skeptical when seeing all the critic reviews. But after seeing it all I can say it wow. The movie from the start keeps your heart going and you engaged. The story was brilliant and more scientific then the older superman movies. The action was a lot more than I expected but it was good because it all made sense. The special effects were magnificent. The actors that they casted were just great. Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, and Kevin costner did just spectacular jobs. The music is perfectly done by Hanz Zimmer and fits this movie really nicely. Go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.",1
199,"The best film of the year! The best superhero movie since The Dark Knight! We finally have an epic superman movie with great visual effects, action, actors, and villain! When you compare this to other films: Its way better than the stupid Superman Returns; Iron Man 3 was ok which shouldn't had a lot of money; Avengers was very good but tired of watching it (never with Man of Steel); But it is close to The Dark Knight! The Dark Knight is still the best superhero movie of all time! This is one of my favorite films of all time! It has humor but little because of the serious tone brought by Christopher Nolan who is a badass! But the humor was good enough! General Zod played by Michael Shannon, is the best villain since The Joker! I am still trying know what the critics were watching because the ones such as Richard Roeper, and others, dont understand of how a DC movie should look like rather than thinking this movie should be like Marvel movies! Screw Marvel! Dont listen to the critics and have your own opinion about this movie! Go see it! We need this movie to kick Iroman 3's ass in the boxoffice to prove that Man of Steel is the biggest movie of the year!",1
200,"I did want to give it 10/10 for making Superman cool again. But film has it's issues. And I get it why critics don't like it. This is a movie with such satisfying action scenes, such great score and feel associated with it. Yes, there could have been more character development, and there is a point where action can get a bit boring. But this is a great foundation for a franchise. Zack Snyder made his best movie to date. And, man, I'm telling you, action sequences in this movie are incredible. Among that there is a great origin story that you can believe in and there are great characters in the movie. This is a diamond like no other, just you wait for the next entry in the series. We might get Superman on a Dark Knight level. And I truly believe that this one delivered too.",1
201,"Probably one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. Henry Cavill was great as Superman and Michael Shannon played a convincing General Zod. The entire story was believable and every aspect of the movie more than delivered its fair share for me. I will be seeing this movie maybe two or three more times. GO SEE IT!",1
202,"This is a very mature and serious take on the icon that is Superman.  It definitely departs from the Donner film, and it has an almost somber tone... which is reflective of the standard set by Goyer and Nolan in the Batman films.  I do like the twist on the Lois and Superman (note... not Lois and Clark) such that it eliminates the ruse that is ""Clark has glasses, and is completely unrecognizable as Superman"" trick. Cavill fits the role nicely, and is convincing and grounded as Superman.  Plus, I really wanted to see Superman as action hero, and boy does it deliver on this front.  Almost TOO much punching, but I can forgive this sin, as the previous Supes films seemed to shy away from the fact that this is the most powerful dude on the planet.  I knew this film was working when I was actively rooting for Superman to win the day, even though he almost ALWAYS wins the day. I also can see how this film will set up a sequel nicely, in that Lex Luthor could come in and point to the wreckage that is Metropolis, and blame Superman.  This was a great reboot to the DC comic line.  Now time for Wonderwoman!",1
203,"Superb movie. Nothing like I expected in the sequencing of the storytelling, but a very refreshing change up from the normal superhero ""origin"" movie. Henry Cavill was tremendous in showing a vulnerability that no one has seen before in Superman. Well done Snyder and Nolan!",1
204,"The movie is great! I felt like I'd seen quite a bit going into the theatre and, I was correct! From watching all the trailers you get the sense that you see alot before going to the big screen but, believe me, the movie was worth it! Great action, awesome soundtrack, and the acting is right on par from each character. For some reason though, there were another of characters from Battle Star Galactica... LOL! Anyway, go see it!",1
205,"Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew.Nolan and Synder set out to do something with this film that most fans of Superman have longed for, create a Superman that is relevant. Man of Steel delivers on almost every level. The vision is epic, the delivery is epic and there is action. Tons of SUPER action. I saw the movie in 3D...honestly, didn't improve the movie over a 2D I am quite sure.",1
206,"P.s do not trust the critics review here it  is complete bull. Obviously the user reviews here are far more reliable than the critics. It doesn't matter what the critics think, it matters more what the people thinks. Again this movie is amazing, do not let a couple of bad user reviews and critics review stop from watching man of steel.",1
207,"Didn't think too much of Superman Returns so I didn't have high hopes for this, but wow I was pleasantly surprised  It was a great movie with plenty to keep you interested! A nice selection of actors who were spot on with their roles, and a great revamp of the Superman tale that has been told many times before. I'm keen to get onto titles like Smallville now because I enjoyed this so much! The final few scenes in particular really stand out but overall a great film highly recommend it!",1
208,"This movie was an incredible experience, hands down. The action was amazing, the story was intriguing and all the parts were well acted and engaging. Criticism's of ""too much action""? Ok, fine, but it's all top notch, they didn't get lazy or rely on cliches or action tropes for a second of it.",1
209,Best superman movie period. The people who rate this movie as the worst movie ever are trolls and all their comments are childish and offensive to other reviewers. This only lead me to think all the haters are really just nuts and childish people.,1
210,"Bottom line, if you've always hoped for a more epic, action-packed Superman movie, then you have to give Man of Steel a try. But, if you really liked the character-driven Superman Returns (the previous Superman movie), then this movie may not be for you. Personally, I was really disappointed with Superman Returns. I thought it was way too slow, and quite frankly, boring. No one wants to see a heartless Superman who solely exists to fight bad guys and save the world, but I think the reason so many people feel in love with Superman, in the comics, was because of his abilities (and his ""rescues""). And this movie, unlike Superman Returns, thrived on showing them off. Yet, with that said, it did not fail to provide like-able characters. They may not have had much depth, but when they came on-screen, they succeeded in fulfilling their roles. As a result, in my opinion, Man of Steel perfectly blended the action and plot needed to achieve an epic film within a 2 hour time-frame. Superman spent plenty of time saving people in this film, but you never had those cheesy moments in between that were simply unnecessary. There was very little Clark Kent, the reporter. And I liked that. Ultimately, this was exactly the kind of Superman film I wanted. Action-wise, it captured Superman in a way he's never been seen before, the script provided a down-to-earth Superman that was very believable, and the score, provided by Hans Zimmer, perfectly set the tone for the movie. It's early but I loved this film, and I think it may be one of my favorites.",1
211,"As a lifelong Superman fan and reader of the comics, I enjoyed the new approach which also kept the essence of the cannon.  This film finally saw Superman let loose against a global threat in a scale worthy of the comic books.  Henry Cavill looked and acted the part extremely well.  There is an argument for more story in the second half but it would have sacrificed the action which many fans have been waiting to see for a long time.",1
212,"Saw the movie 3 times and I could go and see it again and I still will be amazed of the special effects,the story...basically everything.The acting wasnt bad.I liked the enterpretation of Rusel Crowe as Jor-El and the one of Henry Cavill.He was the real Super-Man.But Ayelet July Zurer as his mother,imo she was terrible but I still liked the acting.The thing that I mostly liked about this movie was its originality,how the story was telled.This is definetely the best SuperMan of all time.",1
213,"I'm a die hard fan of Superman so I might be a little, although it might also make me more critical like I was for Dark Knight Rises, but this was more than i could've hoped for a Superman movie and it kept every major theme I love about him. You need to see this movie not only is this movie amazing, also this is the movie that the whole potential franchise will be based off of, so anyway you look at it this is a Must Go!",1
214,"I believe critics try so hard to be the utmost movie minds that cynicism sometimes gets the best of them.  Throw a Zack Snyder directed piece in there and cynicism ALWAYS gets the best of them.  I've watched this movie several times and am a harsh Superman critic and there is a nothing seriously wrong with this movie.  The acting was good and Henry Cavill is the perfect Superman.  All the haters need to get over the fact that DC makes movies for adults, smart adults at that.  If you want poking fun at how unrealistic itself is and not engaging on a simultaneous mental emotional level go watch a Disney movie.  I myself would take a mature, realistic piece over the latter.  This is one point of view of the character in one medium.  Save the camp for the golden age!",1
215,THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!   Its a must see in IMAX 3D!  I LOVE everything about the movie. It was amazingly entertaining...so much so that I am going to see it again on the forth of july with my entire family!,1
216,"As it seems superman is not a character loved by the world, but the world has to love this onecause it is entirely a different theme now. For people complaining about ""the same story"" wellit cannot change  would you change the story of Mahatma Gandhi......No of course not because it will make it a fake.For those who speak of too much demolition have you ever questioned the hulk?it is Superman we are talking about what would expect from him, plucking flowers and throwing them atgeneral Zod.well if anyone can tell a better story go ahead forge a real man of steel is all I would say.....",1
217,"Just what we needed...a good Superman movie. About freak'n time! I was so tired of the drab homespun variety. Although modern times brings fresh images that were impossible to imagine back in the day. Even if 'the day' was only ten years ago. New advances in special effects real help make these CGI hero movies so fun to watch. Okay, let's lay out what I liked and what I didn't... Special effects were...awesome!  We are so spoiled especially children of last Century. They can cut and paste right out of the comics and put it in the movies. There are several scenes that I can't tell about for fear of spoiling it for someone. Let's just say when Superman hits someone it's a real bash. A good bad guy was well established early and doted on often. Most movies fail on this one little hitch. The bad guy needs to be well written. This one was and it really makes the whole movie a cool slide to the final encounter. Acting was first rate. They spared no expense and it pays off in spades. There was no weak link. ""Children of Men"" moment.  You will know it when you see it. It works almost as well here. The very end. Finally, smartly written realism in a comic movie. You will know it when you see it. Superman portrayal. It was perfect. Just exactly what I would envision. A stranger in a strange land.  Actions limited to the guidance of elders. Maybe not so good... Female protagonist was a little over the top.  I liked that she was there I just thought her look was over done. Even so I was happy with that fight scene. Lois was well done but it would have been nice to have had her character developed further. Adams is a scene stealer and more couldn't have hurt. I thought the reality of the world finding out about Superman could have been developed better. They did harp on the idea but they didn't do a good job of the reaction. Imagine the Markets reaction for example. Overall looking forward to more. From what I'm hearing two more are in the works. All that sounds good to me.",1
218,"Man of Steel is now my favorite superhero movie.  They make Superman very relatable and inspiring.  Clark Kent is such an honest, genuine and caring man.  Henry Cavill portrayed the character of Clark very well, he was perfect for the role.  Amy Adams played a fantastic Lois Lane, portraying her in a humorous way at times.  All the characters were chosen very well, and the dialogue was fantastic, the graphics and special effects were amazing.  Everyone who worked on this movie should be extremely proud.  This movie has inspired me to be a better person by helping people,  I obviously can't get superpowers but I will use the power of kindness.  Please just give this movie a chance, it's a very well made film and was has potential to be an amazing series.",1
219,"Why does this have a 55 out of 100?! This movie is EXCELLENT! There is no other way to describe it. Henry Cavil, Amy Adams, Russel Crowe and Michael Shannon.....Michael ""M*****F******"" Shannon were AMAZING! Story was rich, acting was superb and lets not even get started with the special effects. Some of the best I've seen to date! Personally, this beats the Dark Knight, Iron Man and pretty much any superhero movie ever made. Do yourself a favor and go buy yourself a ticket to go see this movie. You'll want to watch it over and over and over again!",1
220,"Zack Snyder's dark take in Man of Steel, a la Christopher Nolan's Gotham, really worked in my opinion. I've always felt that Superman had one of the more tragic of backgrounds and the more uplifting and happier stories never felt genuine. Richard Roeper's criticism that ""There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story"" or Rafer Guzman's criticism that ""this reboot skimps on fun and romance"" shows just how many critics missed the point. This isn't a kid's story, period! Leave all of those childish and whimsical expectations at home. In my opinion, this grittier version really hit home and took the drama and intensity to whole new levels. While it failed to deliver on the level of the some of the Avengers: Phase One films and definitely wasn't on the level with any of the movies from the Dark Knight Trilogy, it was still a great movie. The acting was really good, especially from Amy Adams in her supporting role. She managed to turn a character without a lot of development into one with a surprising amount of depth and believability. And Henry Cavill was great as Superman/Kal-El, probably my favorite yet. The supporting roles by Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and so on were all also fantastic. I don't think I can remember a movie where all of the supporting roles were played by people more famous than the protagonist but that was the case here and it worked because of Cavill's performance and how the movie was laid out. The action sequences were great, as was to be expected, and the way the plot developed was not annoying as most critics claimed. Many felt like the constant back-and-forth hurt the film's progression but I actually quite liked it. It kept the two and a half hour movie from dragging and felt fresh. The one flaw that I felt actually took a bit away from the movie, however, was the shaky-camera cinematic effect. I'm sorry but this isn't a world where the audience is going to feel the ""we're there"" and in the actual scene itself. All that did was make you wish it wasn't there. Overall though, this was a great movie and while I've never been a big fan of the Superman lore, if you can remove bias and suspend quite a bit of disbelief I think most would really enjoy it.",1
221,"OH YA!!!  This one is way better than I thought.... (just another superman movie... more  & an over used DC franchise)...  I have to say that for two and a half hours I was frequently & pleasantly surprised... Superb acting, very good story line and just plain fun to watch... This DVD is going to  purchased for my 3D TV...",1
222,this producer is making art with hero movies  i really love what hes doing with this is a way better because he changes what you thought u knew and makes it more magical with hes work.,1
223,overall the movie movie was good but it had its problems. for starters the film does not feel like a superman film more an alien invasion type movie i don't recall anyone even calling him superman beyond a soldier towards the end of the film. The movie is a serious film which is not a problem for me. I liked seeing Clark background story from earth it helped make his seem more human and gave him a reason to defend earth. the main villain in the film general Zod is under used. most of the fight scenes in the film are done by his troops until the very end of the film where at the end of his relatively short fight Clark just breaks his neck and its over in a second it was a bit underwhelming after all that he just snaps his neck. The acting all round is good Henry Cavill is a great superman Michael Shannon while not being as good as Benedict Cumberbatch in star trek is still one of the best villeins this year. All in all this is a good film not that strong a superman film but good none the less,1
224,"There is a saying that could summarize this film and ""no haste makes perfect"", but this film has many attributes to reconsider whether, first the bad points, the script may have been written well, but the film is too rushed in the beginning as it bombards the audience with action and lots of information (for some it may be necessary to see the movie twice to Understand all) and very slow at the end (perhaps a ncessidade to face with the Avengers), but that's it, good points, the direction of Snyder was one of the best things with their cameras capturing different angles average everywhere this technique extremely good, the cast too, with performances by weight as Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner, but it's good to know that Henry Cavil did their role well (though sometimes it may seem too optimistic) and rest also does their role well.",1
225,"Fact: This movie is 100 times better than any previous Superman effort. NON SPOILER REVIEW: Superman does NOT give the world a roofie like in the Donner films.Superman does MORE than just lift stuff like in Brian Singer's 'Superman Returns' in which Supes lifted a plane, a car, a woman, a boat, another plane and a giant rock (in that order).Superman DOES make some difficult choices and uses his strength to great effect in some awesome action scenes. SPOILER TERRITORY: Favorite bits:~ They show us Krypton. The wildlife and technology. It isn't just lip service. You actually get to spend a good deal of time on Krypton in its final moments.~ The Terrence Malick like vignettes of young Clark's childhood are beautiful. If ""Tree of Life"" suddenly had a plot and amazing action scenes, you'd have Man of Steel.~ Faora. The way she moves, her brutality. It is awesome to watch on screen.~ Jor-El. Crows part in this movie is much bigger than I was expecting and I really dig his ghostly mentoring of his son.~ Supes: Henry Cavill must have devoured like 7 Hugh Jackmans to bulk up for this role (I hear Chris Nolan had a truckload of extra Jackman's lying around after 'The Prestige').  Cavill is huge. He has hair on his chest. He is a manly guy. An all American farm boy. It's awesome.~ Destruction: The devastation of Metroplis is massive. The ""terraform engine"" ravages much of the city and when Zod and Superman finally fight, it is amidst the hollow ash covered ruins of massive buildings.~ When Ma Kent's house is destroyed, and her sons future is uncertain, and the whole world is going to hell because of alien invaders, she is found looking through what remains of her home for her photo albums. Amidst all the chaos, those memories of her son were important to her. The director didn't point it out or make a big deal of it, but I found it touching.~ The final Costner vignette got me in the feelers. Maybe because I'm raising two boys, one of which is constantly wearing a read cape, but it got me. CONCLUSION: The critics are high as a kite. But not as high as Man of Steel because this movie kicks ass. It is on par with Batman Begins as a setup movie and with a good story and great casting of Luthor or some other Supes villian, there is no reason the next one can't be every bit as good as The Dark Knight. Cheers. Go see it. Enjoy. Superman is back.",1
226,"The movie was perfect. The music fit the action and themes in every scene, I didn't find any of the dialogue to be cheesy and over the top and the action was believable and what you would expect from a superman movie. It was like one of the DC animated movies brought to live action. The visuals were honestly flawless because even though the action was fast paced the camera kept you in it with pinpoint accuracy. The Plot was perfect for an introductory type film. You know what I mean like Batman Begins, Green Lantern, Thor etc. they had to introduce the character in a way that would appeal to a broad audience and they did it perfectly. The action was absolute SUPERMAN! I mean the only movie  I could compare the ""action"" to is the Hulk and it outpaced that by leaps and bounds, watching this you truly felt like you were witnessing a battle between gods! This is the modern up to date remake we were all waiting for. Go out and support the movie because we need more DC movies on the big screen and that's where it starts.",1
227,"For all those comparing this to Iron Man 3 and saying it 'sucks' compared to it, please take the next train to a standard centre of learning and keep yourself there till you can properly review a film. I'm old enough to have seen the original TV series that had Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher, all the Superman films and the spin off Smallville. I'm telling you, this blows them all out of the water. The acting is top notch, the music even more so, the special effects so well done that you wouldn't be able to spot in a fault in a single bloody pixel. I loved it, and everyone I saw it with loved it too. As far as i'm concerned as this was a story in a movie, which would be no mean feat to achieve, and made the whole production that much better.",1
228,"Could this be the Superman movie that we've always wanted? Man of steel is one of the most anticipated movies this year, so it has a lot of hype to live up to. Finally, a Superman movie that kicks ass, Superman knows how to take down a baddy and we did not see this kind of Superman from Superman Returns, which is one of the reasons on why it was a huge disappointment to the fans. The action scenes in this movie were fantastic, buildings crumbling down, airplanes exploding, the scenes were mind blowing, expecially the final fight scene. The film has a lot of good actors, like Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, Russel Crowe, Diane Lane, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon and of course the man with the cape, Henry Cavill, they all did a terrific job with their characters. There were characters from the movie that had short development, which was a problem because if they don't develop throughout the whole movie, then we might not care about these characters, like Perry White and Faora. Sometimes the action scenes could get a bit dull, which would make these scenes a bit dragging, but the visuals from those scenes looked great. The chemistry had nothing special in it, it was rushed and forced at certain parts of the flick, like the scene were Superman and Lois holds hands for the first time, that scene just made no sense. Man of Steel was still a good movie and for me, it deserves a sequel. I am going to give Man of Steel a 9/10.",1
229,"It seems that this movie is incredibly polarizing. There was really only a few scenes that kept this movie from being ""Dark Knight"" caliber. Cavill is perfect for this role. Although this is not the traditional vision of Superman, It still makes for a compelling story. I feel that this whole series is going to be incredible when it is viewed as a whole trilogy.",1
230,"The true Superman movie for a new generation. This is not a love letter to Reeves tenure as the Man of Steel for which ""Superman Returns"" was, this is the start of a series that will seemingly ground Superman more realistically and reignite the passion for this hero once more. This movie in short was PHENOMENAL! An incredible spectacle from start to finish, the film sets up an enriching mythology of Kryptonian society, provides kinetic action sequences for which superhero movies have not been realized to this degree thus far and an emotional depth to these beloved characters which was lacking from previous theatrical incarnations. The actors portraying their roles bring about a gravitas that isn't cheesy and actually makes the audience feel for them in a heart moving way. Cavill perfectly plays his role that has undoubtedly brought dimensions of characterization unrealized to the masses who believe the last son of Krypton is a boy scout or indestructible...he is nothing of the kind! This Clark Kent is a highly conflicted individual who bears the burden of being an alien of two worlds, Cavill's solemn performance is much reminiscent of Christian Bale's take on Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy. With Zack Snyders signature stylistic shooting, David Goyer and Christopher Nolan's writing, the film provides a breathtaking experience of Superman's capabilities fully realized with a threat to match. The action was outstanding, far surpassing any I have seen in this genre, the destruction as ridiculous as it seems IS warranted within the story and finally provides a devastation with lasting consequences (which some superhero films tend to shy away from). Hans Zimmer score compliments the film brilliantly and really made (for me anyways) a memorable modern score up there with the likes of Spider-man (First trilogy) and The Dark Knight trilogy. Doing away with the constant barrage of one liners and comedy overloads, this film was a rather refreshing take on Superheroes, as much as it is in that genre the movie is also strongly based on high sci-fi concepts that will wet the appetite of lovers of that variety. The depth of story will leave people mesmerized, which is impressive in that it did not take/need several movies to build to a tale of this magnitude. I have seen this movie twice already and if you have yet to see it well...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! If this is Superman's never ending battle debut for the rumored ""DC Comics Cinematic Universe"", I seriously cannot wait to see what the future holds for ""Sector 2814"" and the rest of the galaxy. This movie really resonated with me on many levels and I hope you feel for it as I did (not like the unforgiving critics who refuse the present and are too conflicted with the past notions of the Man of Steel to enjoy the film for what it is). A new take on the never ending battle begins here...Superman has really returned to the forefront!",1
231,I loved Man of Steel. It lived up to my expectations. It gave me that same feeling I had watching Justice League on Cartoon Network. Felt real and was not made mostly for little kids in mind. I hope it continues with this tone.,1
232,"I was hesitant to go see this, as I was so very disappointed in the last effort to reboot the Superman story. But, I decided to just give it a chance and glad that I did. I took my two daughters (18 and 22) and we ladies enjoyed what most probably think is a ""guy"" movie. Aside from what I felt was an overly long fight between Zod and Kal-El, Man of Steel is well done. Acting, cinematography, music (score), and costumes are top-notch. Great entertainment!",1
233,Man of steel features a darker and more realistic version of Superman. The story also tells full version of Superman and successfully answer all it's questions. Even it's  excessive using of flashback may make some of the viewers uncomfortable and bored in watching this film.,1
234,"I'll just make it simple and mention good and bad aspects of the movie, in my opinion.GOOD THINGS: The story is great, you won't be bored; The visual effects are amazing; There are tons of epicness; The characters are very good, not only Superman will catch your attention; The happenings are well explained; There's lots of action; The movie is very well-balanced between innovation and those Superman clichés we all like; The climax is amazing.BAD THINGS: the movie is 100 minutes of begining and goes too quickly to 40 minutes of climax and ending; There are no big turnovers, which some people would expect from a movie Christopher Nolan is part of; The characters are good but none is fascinating.  That's just the opinion of a fan. If you value epicness and action, it will be an amazing movie. If you want a suspenseful story, you'll rate it 'just regular'.",1
235,"This movie was absolutely awesome.  Some say it was to ""dark"" for a superman movie, I disagree.  It was realistic.  Lots of destruction, (even a building going down, which in post 9/11 is ballsy, glad they did it though) but what do you think would happen if two super being fought in an urban landscape?  One thing I had a bit of an issue with, Superman does something superman would never do, but I'm ok with that.  Henry Cavill was the best superman yet (He WAS SUPERMAN!!), wouldn't say he was the best clark kent  I think Chistopher Reeve did the best playing clark, and was an awesome superman as well), but Caville was just a beast.  nice to see a superman movie without the same old premise, by that I mean no kryptonite the entire movie!!  I liked the last superman made, superman returns I believe, and thought the story line was good with him having a son, didn't like the ending in that one.  This one obviously has no ties to that movie.  This movie was slam, bam, destruction and action most of the movie.  This superman reminded me somewhat of  just all the destruction, he wasn't boozed up or anything like that.  Anyway go see it if you haven't already!!!",1
236,"After seeing the trailer, i have prepared my self for a movie full of only drama, I've never been so wrong, and I've never been at the edge of my seat, the way i was in the theater. From start to end, Man of Steel was action packed, and still succeeded in telling the story of how the Man of Steel became the super hero icon that we know and love. Having said that, the action scenes tends to get a bit too much, to the point where i felt that i lost focus on some of the fight scenes. This movie is nothing short from epic, and i would recommend any one who is a fan of comic book heroes to watch it ASAP.",1
237,"El hombre de acero no muestra un mundo Krypton diferente a un Jor-El que lucha y que tenia ideología diferente a la de su planeta algo nuevo nos han traído al cine  un hombre de acero diferentes a las otras como se desarrolla el trama y como involucran a los personajes hacen de esta película una de las mejores del 2013 me encanto la verdad  Esperamos mucho tiempo para poder ver un superman diferente que muestre como en verdad  es ,por eso le doy 10 a esta obra maestra...",1
238,"Just had to vote this up. It seems all the bad reviews come from people who don't read comics and therefore do not understand the significance this movie holds to future comic based movies. Sure most of the marvel movies were fun to watch, but to a comic reader they are just watered down hollywood products. Man of Steel on the other hand has the pacing and feel of a Superman comic. I'm not a huge fan of the invincible goody superhero in a blue pyjamamyself, but I must admit that he is the most iconic and one of the most important comic characters ever and the movie does right by him. The movie itself is not perfect, there are a lot of issues (like too sudden cuts, missing information and too much bla bla), but the tone of the movie and the characters itself are exactly what I expect from a true to the comics superman movie. I definitely want to see more of that in the future. A superhero movie taking itself seriously is what the genre needed. Now gimme Lex Luther in the second one and I'm happy!",1
239,"I never was a huge comic book fan throughout my years, and this is the first time I have ever been exposed to Superman on any medium. Let me say first like every other user review on her that the critic score does not do this movie justice. The acting in this movie was extremely well done. Everyone had great performances, especially Micheal Shannon. The scale of this movie is literally nothing you have ever experienced before. The amount of carnage and building destruction is unbelievable but at the same time you believe it, which brings me to the visual FX because this has to be the most visually stunning movie ever made and for a superhero movie, it works. Zach Snyder is the king and ever since the watchmen (10 out of 10 as well) hes proven that he along with Nolan is the best a bringing these extraordinary characters to life. This movie is a must see and a must buy when it is released, because I see people watching it over and over again.",1
240,"Man of Steel is what a Superman movie should be. It has solid acting and a great retelling of Kal-el's origin story that fits this generation. the thing i found most impressive was that it showed a ""realistic"" effect a character like Superman would impact our world and way of life.This is the first time we've seen Superman's powers portrayed as they should be, how someone who is almost omnipotent can change the world and not always for the better. some minor plot discrepancies aside this is in my humble opinion the movie of the summer and the best Superman movie to date.",1
241,"(Note: There are spoilers at the bottom of this review, but the top half is a simple, non-revealing review) Man of Steel. What can I say about my favorite superhero and his first action-packed genesis story? Simply amazing. Before I get hit with accusations from the purists, let me make one thing clear: it was fantastic for what it was meant to be (a super-powered exhibition). Director Zack Snyder is catching a lot of heat for the creative decisions he made for the film, but I thought they were smart choices (and no, I am not a die-hard Snyder fan). In short, the film was, in my opinion, the best Superman movie of our time. Yes, the technology that is now available to filmmakers plays a huge role in my critique; but Superman is a powerhouse of a hero that has deserved this type of platform for quite some time. I feel that any technical missteps in plot, structure, character or conception are HEAVILY trounced by cinematography, pacing, sound, setting, lightning, effects, and great execution by both the cast and the crew. Henry Cavill did a super job as our hero, and quite honestly, I don't think his performance could be criticized in any way. In short, go see this movie if you want to be thoroughly entertained by our modern day Man of Steel. HERE COME THE SPOILERS!!!!! The good: The film starts off in a way unique to the Superman franchise  on Krypton, birthplace of our hero. The planet has been depicted in many ways over the years, often as a highly advanced aristocratic metropolis. In this film however, the technological advancements were there, but there was also a primal feel to the setting. We even see Jor-El riding a giant winged beast! They chose to skip over the scenes where the Kents find Kal-El in the field, as well as a lot of the back-story that we often see where he's growing up. Instead, the important moments in his life (like discovering powers, early moral decisions, or losing his adopted father) are displayed via flashbacks. This was a nice change of pace because the scenes were wisely positioned throughout the film and were only revealed when directly related to the issues he was facing in the present. The bad: As a huge fan of this production, there was very little I didn't like. However, there were some things that struck me as odd, and they mostly revolved around Lois Lane. Let me start off by saying that I think Amy Adams is a fine actress. There was nothing wrong with her performance, but it didn't feel 'right'. Perhaps I was distracted by the fact that she was not a brunette? I'm not sure how much that factored into my perception of the character, but it was definitely something I took note of. Despite this however, I thought Adams did a really good job, and the remaining issues I have with Lois are strictly not her fault. A big issue for me was how close she and Kal seemed to get throughout the course of the story, which was in actuality, a mere couple of days in length. The big romance and deep connection they seemed to have, simply did not make sense to me. I also am not a fan of how the two meet, which is in the ""fortress of solitude"". As a side note, I did not like the reimagined fortress, but I understand why it was presented to us that way. There is a Kryptonian droid of sorts guarding the fortress that strikes and hurts Kal, but when Lois is attacked by it, she manages to survive. She is injured by it, but it seems that if something can make the Man of Steel wince, it should probably straight up kill a human. Finally, if the ship is Kryptonian and operational, wouldn't the ship's atmosphere be calibrated to that of Krypton, like Zod's ship? Therefore knocking Kal unconscious? Again, I did not have huge problems with these things, I just felt like I should point them out. The REALLY good! Henry Cavill as Superman was not the right choice, it was the ONLY choice. Honestly, he killed it as Superman, there was no one else that could have done it better. The scenes that followed him in flight were gorgeous, and really made you feel like you were right up there with him. The costume was absolutely amazing, and the cape brought all the iconic glory that Superman has deserved all these years. The fight scenes between Superman and lieutenant Faora-Ul and the other Kryptonian were epic. The sheer power of the brawl was outstanding and it made me feel that if that fight was real, that's exactly how it would look. Another very cool plot point was the whole terraforming thing. The way the machine worked in the film brought a real desperation to the ""end of the world"" theme and it just made you root for Superman even harder. Other stuff: People are upset about Kal killing Zod, but I liked it. Snyder's explanation was that since this is an origin story, there was not enough time to properly explain why he would normally choose to not kill Zod. Since we don't have that time, Superman NEEDS to save the people. I fully get it, and it makes sense. In summation: GO SEE THIS! AGAIN",1
242,"I was disappointed by  Superman movies expect the first one. He was always a whimp in those movies  He never had a great fight scene. He was not badass as he should have. Those dreams have come true. This is the ultimate Superman movie. It is epic. the cast is great. the effects are amazing. Everything falls into place. Paceing is not very good, and maybe there are lot of stuff going on but you see epic moments. There is a couple of problems. First it  needed to be longer in order to have General Zod in it because it to good of a enemy to be used in the first film. He needed to be included in the second film when Superman is already known and is the guardian on Earth. But this is not the reason to not see the movie. I loved it and I think it i the best Superman movie ever.",1
243,"Finally, Superman pitched in epic battle doing things we have only imagined from still images in comics or animated films.  While I hope to see more of the backstory develop over the course of the trilogy, this is definitely a movie not to be missed and evidence once again that the critics have no idea what the audience wants in an action packed film.  Best film of the summer!",1
244,"The movie was awesome and is in my opinion the best in the franchise. Well done Zack Snyder, cast, crew and everyone else involved, you have done a great job, I highly recommend it ",1
245,"The content in this movie is incredible. The horrid pacing... isn't enough to detract from my overall enjoyment of this film. I know it's making everyone think the movie is just Michael Bay-esque explosions, but it's not. Get past the pacing, and you'll find an intelligent, well made sci fi that pays respect to my most beloved superhero. Points of Controversy I'd Like to Counter: -The destruction caused by Kal. I have watched the final fight between Kal and Zod dozens of times on Youtube. Kal ALWAYS takes the fight to the side of the building or in places where people wouldn't readily get hurt. It is in fact General Zod who takes Kal and throws him into buildings. The only problem I have with the destruction is the pacing of it and the fact that there is one building that falls which would most likely be responsible for a lot of deaths that Kal doesn't really do anything about (again, he isn't the cause for it, it's General Zod's heat vision that takes the building down, it's just he doesn't really try to save the people under it). -Lois Lane being brought aboard Zod's ship. People seem to think that she was brought on board the ship as nothing but an exposition device and that General Zod had no purpose for her. In actuality, Lois' name was broadcast on national television by another news reporter as having a connection to Kal. Given that she is the only other person who seems to have a special relationship with the Kryptonian, Zod decides to bring her on board and contain the situation entirely. There is another thematic reason Lois is brought on board, and I will detail that in the next point. -Perry White's character arc, and various other ""unnecessary"" plot threads. These ""unnecessary"" plot threads are actually enforcing a thematic value of the story- that everyone can be a hero. Jor-El himself says ""Everyone can be a force for good."" These ""unnecessary"" plot threads are actually bolstering his claim. They give everyone their chance to be the hero, from a small scale, such as Perry letting Jenny know that there was still someone who cared in the midst of the end of the world, or the scientist figuring out how the Command Key works, to a large scale, such as the Colonel sacrificing himself to kill Faora or Kal's antics himself. Lois' involvement on Zod's ship also gives her a chance to be the hero, showing that she wasn't brought in just as an exposition device, but as a thematic expression too. -Various references to Jesus. I don't know about you, but regardless of what it's referencing, I prefer there to be allegories to renowned texts, be it religious or not. Biblical allusions are not a negative (and this is coming from a Muslim). -Above all, the ending decision. Many people have decided to base their entire opinion on Kal's final decision in the movie and have written the movie off as a pile of garbage simply due to this being ""out of Superman's character."" Have you recognized that throughout this review/counter argument, I have only referred to the protagonist as Kal, and not as Superman? This is because Kal-El, for the most part in this movie, is not Superman. He is Kal-El. One of the main themes in this movie is that of choice. From the beginning this is explored, with Krypton's selective ""bloodline"" system that removes freedom of choice, to Jonathan Kent's talks about his son (and his death). Not once in his life had Kal acted on impulse (aside from the school bus scene, which he was later scolded for). He always played it safe. Never tried to act on his own feelings but based on what everyone else was telling him was right. He had never explored the other area of choice- the ones his instincts were compelling him to make. In that final, climactic scene, General Zod threatens to kill a family. After Kal beats him outright, and he realizes his ""you die or I do"" mentality wouldn't work in a normal battle due to Kal's morality, he shifts his focus to killing as many people as he could before forcing Kal's hand (""Stop!""- ""Never.""). Kal finally decides to act on impulse. He snaps Zod's neck. Realizing what he has just done, he drops to his knees and screams. This scene is not only respectful of Superman's character, but easily one of the most powerful advancements of it I have ever seen. Kal finally explores the ""other"" area. He acts on impulse and stops Zod, but he realizes after that the price he paid (taking someone else's life) was far too great to pay. Just as in Superman: Executioner (where he similarly executes Zod) he decides from then on to stop killing. From that moment on, he truly becomes Superman, and not Kal. He realizes that he isn't supposed to give into the constraints of choice. When there are two options, he creates a third (he even tells General Swanwick that he will help only ""on his own terms"" shortly after). That is what Superman is. And through that final scene, that is what this origin story has helped Kal El become.",1
246,"A must-see of the year!  Don't wait for the DVD or BluRay to come out.  The big screen experience especially the IMAX 3D is total different.  Undeniably, the best Superman movie ever!  I've seen IRON MAN 3 three times while MAN OF STEEL I've seen five times  (and counting) already.  It's absolutely a joyride to watch! I say it's a cut above the rest of superhero movies. Dunno how Snyder & other superhero filmmakers will top this one. It makes THE AVENGERS look like child's play (though I still love that movie). Faora makes the Black Widow look like Dora, the Explorer. This movie answers back Iron Man's joke on Thor, ""Doth mother knows you're wearing her drapes?"" in which Martha Kent compliments Clark as Superman with, ""Nice suit, son!""  If THE AVENGERS has a Tesseract, MAN OF STEEL has a Codex. Tom Hiddleston's Loki has nothing on Michael Shannon's Zod here. Even The Hulk will have to kneel before him & will just have to settle on a fight with Nam-Ek.  MAN OF STEEL dominates, totally smashing & demolishing all competition in its wake!  Can't wait how Zack Snyder will top this one out on MAN OF STEEL 2...",1
247,"CONTAINS SPOILERS.I love Man of Steel like a bunny loves jelly beans.  This movie takes a poo on Iron Man 3.  Don't listen to those one sided bias liberal s.o.p.r.w. critics.  They suck the life out of life.  I don't know what their motives are but they are not from God.  The special effects in this movie are only third to District 9 and Avatar.  The emotional intensity in this movie grips me like a hand grips a bird, not to hard but not to soft.  This story is almost as well threaded as Gladiator.  I think what it comes down to is the critics don't like the part where Superman has a conversation with the priest in front of the stain glass window of Jesus.  They talk about what it is to give up your life for the world.    So, let's talk about Superman's impressive physique.  He was so much manlier than Christopher Reeves or Brandon Routh.   Not only could he probably bench press more but his voice was deeper and he would look better in a mustache.   Russel Crowe is the actor who plays Superman's dad in Man of Steel.  His performance was picturesque.   Michael Shannon was the perfect villain as he is in many of his movies.   The development of Kripton was extremley well done.  The film makers show a world full of alien animal life on Krypton and a diverse unique culture and society of Kriptonians.  Overall, the superman movie ""Man of Steel"" is super good and you should definitely see it!",1
248,"(To cut to the chase, I copy and pasted a conversation I had with a friend on another site so it may sound like a one sided talk) I've seen it twice already and while the third act is action intensive, they keep it unique because they make Superman as powerful as he should be rather than toning him down, so you never lose interest because the fight scenes are unlike anything you've ever seen. The story/character building is flawless imo, or at least as good as you can get. Everyone cheered after the showdown between Zod and Superman and after the movie was over, several people gave it a standing ovation, with everyone else giving a rousing round of applause. It was unique, emotionally engaging, and had easily the best superhero action you will ever see. They truly capture Superman in both his power and his struggles. There was definitely some overt religious parallels, the obvious examples being when Jor-El sends him to earth and says ""he will be a god to them,"" but also in that he is a miracle birth, being the only naturally born Kryptonian in centuries. There is also an obvious juxtaposition with Christ in a stained glass window (especially in that Jesus is wearing a red cloak in the image) when he asks a priest for advice. He is also 33 when he reveals himself to the world and fights for humanity, as Jesus was 33 when he made his sacrifice. Think of it as him sacrificing his anonymity, the only thing that's really allowed him to live a semi-normal life up to that point, for the greater good of his people; they even touch on his having a bit of a crisis of faith, not in God necessarily but humanity as a whole, when he tells the priest ""Zod can't be trusted, but I'm not sure humanity can either."" The movie handles the messianic archetype well--it's not obvious and in your face, and neither does it insult the concept. Nature v. Nurture can be argued to be one of the center themes of the story. You have the Kents and humanity as a whole pulling Superman in one direction, and Zod and the Kryptonians pulling him in another. And Zod himself isn't just all ""for the evulz,"" he actually makes a lot of sense; he really DOES care for his people and is willing to destroy humanity for them, just as Superman is willing to defend humanity under any cost. Neither side is technically more right than the other since one side winning means the other side doesn't exist anymore, meaning SOMEONE is basically committing genocide be it them or humanity. And they put Superman in some really troubling positions as well. There are times where people threaten him and he barely controls his anger lest he lash out and turn them to dust. And I won't spoil it, but the ending puts Supes in a position I don't think we've seen him in too often, if ever. The movie is obviously a most serious big screen depiction of Superman, but it isn't without its humor. The only time they actually call him Superman--and they do refer to him as such only once--is great. We're not talking The Avengers styled humor, but there are several times where the whole audience was laughing. And I think the seriousness of the movie serves to that effect better; it allows the fewer laughs to have more of an impact. Forgive me but I am going to spoil one small scene to make a larger point, but when they call him Superman it's in the last act of the movie and I had a noticeable ""oh yeah!"" moment because I had stopped thinking of him as Superman and more as Kal-El, or Clark. So when they do call him Superman, it serves as a reminder of who this guy is or maybe more importantly what he'll become. He isn't Superman yet, he's just Kal-El, Superman is a title he's yet to earn. So when the guy drops the name ""Superman"" everyone pauses and says ""Superman?"" in a disbelieving tone. ""Yeah, sir, the alien, that's...that's what they're calling him."" As if the name is completely ridiculous. It's great self-referential humor, but I think it serves to show that the icon of Superman has not come into his own yet. They call him Kal or Clark in this movie, or the alien, but Superman is an idea, ""an ideal to strive towards."" And I'm pretty sure that is what the second Man of Steel will touch on. I'd say his acting is perfect for this role, but not for the 1970's version. The Reeves version was much more light hearted than this one, some might even say campy. In a good way I suppose, and Reeves was definitely THE Superman, but if Reeves was THE Superman, then I think it's fair to say that Cavill is THE Kal-El. He's much more grounded and subtle, but not without his charm and friendliness. To be sure this isn't Batman with Superman's powers, it's very much still Superman, but a Superman with a more realistic psychology, more believable and in that Cavill does a great job. I don't think it's fair to compare him to Reeves in part because Reeves gave an iconic performance 40 years ago, and in part that his version was much more kid-friendly. This is a Superman for adults.",1
249,"This movie was everything I'd hoped it would be and more. I've been waiting my whole life for a Superman movie like this one. I thought the back story was great. I've read other reviews that COMPLAINING that there is too much action and its too loud and you'll leave the theater blind and deaf (these are clearly over aged movie critics who are judging this like its Cannes film festival). IT'S SUPERMAN, IT'S AN ACTION MOVIE. It's supposed to have explosions and intense scene. Ranting aside, Henry Cavill delivered a great Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman. With seriousness, a dash of humor and the best Superman physique ever delivered by an actor in this franchise, you can count on this movie being appealing to you if you're a Superman fan or even just a movie fan. This movie caters to people who may not even like comics because it was an entertaining action/drama for all audiences. People keep getting on Snyder about too much CGI. TOO MUCH CGI? IT'S SUPERMAN AND ZOD FIGHTING! I suppose we should have had a casting call for real aliens who look like humans and had them have a realistic fight scene so CGI wouldn't have to be used. I've heard people saying we didn't have enough time to get into a character to be able to really care about them. well if you're a fan of Superman then you already know all these characters. Do we really need to develop Perry White? No. This movie is everything it needed to be. The pretentious prick who gave this movie a score of zero is an idiot. Not even a point for the acting? Really? Get a life dude Great movie. Go see it. I'll see it at least two more times in theater and then I'll buy the blu ray. So good, you won't be disappointed.",1
250,"This film was two and a half hours of relentless HOLY F**K. It was “you sure you really want Superman? Well here’s your god damned Superman. Hope you’re happy now.” There were a few parts of the script that didn’t make sense, and they didn’t really bother having a lot of character relationship building. But that was besides the point. This movie was all about: if a superhuman alien really grew up in our world, what would that look like? As a raw visual portrayal of that awesome power, the film just blows you away. Definitely a film worth going the IMAX 3D route. It has decent casting for the side characters, and they are treated respectfully, but they exist only in service to the perspective of Superman himself and the story of his emergence onto the world stage. And there are some clever nods to past Superman stories as well as other movies and tropes  there is in particular a lot of similarities with Prometheus both in themes and aesthetics. But if you are looking for a really cohesive story, or a compelling drama beyond the core theme of the burden, responsibility, and joy of having super powers, you won’t find it here. The film just isn’t about anything more than that. But if you want a realistic visceral experience of being super, you’ll get more than you could ever hope for. In short: this film does some things poorly, but the things it does well, it does so astonishingly ground-breakingly well, that it is well worth picking out the few grains of sand to experience the tour de force within.",1
251,"Want to get pumped up for Man of Steel? Do yourself a favor and watch Superman Returns right before watching Man of Steel. I watched Superman Returns when it came out in 2006 and thought it was boring. Never understood why it was highly rated by critics. I watched it again yesterday to compare it with Man of Steel today. Holy crap, Man of Steel was awesome. Action was amazing and story was well thought out. Things weren't perfect and a common complaint was lack of character development, but I honestly think they probably left some of the developing to an inevitable sequel. The tone of the movie was serious, but not emo and super sad like the critics say. I think critics are just way too used to the somewhat lightheartedness of Marvel movies, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. If you're one of the many that were disappointed with Iron Man 3 because there was too much Tony Stark being a detective or whatever and not enough Iron Man, then you'll love and appreciate Man of Steel. Ending of the movie was a bit shocking to me, but I definitely didn't hate it. All in all, the BEST movie of the summer for me. The critics' ratings for this movie pretty much solidifies my theory that they generally can't be trusted except for maybe comedies and Oscar type movies. I think critics liked Superman Returns because it reminded them of Superman I and II and they liked Iron Man 3 because they like them some Robert Downey Jr. If you want to look at ratings for summer blockbusters, then go look at the user scores. Currently 8.7 for Man of Steel and 6.6 for Iron Man 3. Enough said. P.S. If you can, then watch the movie in IMAX like I did. NOT IMAX 3D or regular 3D. Always thought 3D was pointless and just not good, realistic enough. IMAX does somewhat enhance the overall clarity of watching an action movie and the sound is better.",1
252,"Man of Steel- one of the best superhero movies ever! It's all we have been waiting for. The new take of Superman and Clark is convincing. Henry Cavill IS the Superman of our generation. He and the rest of crews did a great job! As for the action and the music, EPIC!!!!!! I've already watched it twice since Wednesday. I love it so much!!",1
253,"As a lifelong fan of Superman I had been waiting for a movie which captured the character I saw in my head when reading a Superman comic.  The Donner films were great, don't get me wrong, but that was silver age Superman.  Where was the post-crisis, Byrne Superman.  Thanks to Zack Snyder, Henry Cavill and company I now have my Superman.  The cast was spot on in their interpretation and despite what some ""professional"" critics claim the character development was was engaging.  I absolutely can't wait to see where the story goes from here.  Congratulations to all involved, to you I tip my hat and offer a very gracious Thank You.",1
254,"This movie was truly fantastic.  The common grievances regarding too many stories packed into one film are legitimate which is what holds this review back.  But truth be told, the movie was a fantastic re-imagining of the series.  The DC universe is being made darker and people should be prepared for that going into the movie.  If you, like many critics, are going in expecting charming ""save my cat, mister"" or Christopher Reeve-era Superman then you are looking for a different movie and should readjust your expectations.  This is an impressive film that explores a truly ""human"" alien and his evolution into a new version of the shining light we all know and love.  It's a new Superman for a new age.  Bring on the sequel, Snyder and Goyer!",1
255,Superman has been redeemed.... It explained the story of superman origin so well and the action scenes were so well done! If you haven't seem it already I recommend you do so as soon as possible!! Well done Snyder well done...,1
256,"Re-boot in every way imaginable. I found it quite enjoyable although slow in some parts. The action sequences were particularly entertaining. The story of Superman being a MAN and his relationship with both sets of parents was done very well. Although traditional Superman fans may disagree with changes to Kal/Clarks story and other characters, I believe it made this version better and fresh.",1
257,"A very good movie. Yes it has a lot of action near the end, however the same can be said about The Avengers.  CGI is used a lot, but that is because it is to support the fact that these are aliens that are fighting, not real people. These were clearly shown in the trailer. If you loved the trailers, then you would know that there is a lot of action scenes and CGI used. Character development is really focused on Superman, Jonathan Kent and Jor El. Superb acting from Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner, Russel Crowe and surprisingly, Amy Adams. I had my doubts about her, but she did an amazing job as Lois. This is not a throwback to the old Superman movies. You must accept it like Batman Begins, an origin story that is much different than what you are used to. The only problem comes from the fact that we didn't really understand Clark's struggle as an adult like we did with Bruce in Batman Begins. They could have explored it further. The story was great for what it was. I think that now that we have characters set up, we can expect an even better sequel. It might not have lived to the hype for some, but there is no argument that this was a great movie. Especially when compared to Superman 3,4, and Returns. I think it is on the same level as Superman 2. Some could argue that it is better. Just watch the movie and prepare to be amazed.",1
258,"You can't hate a movie for the hype you build up for it. I do believe the critics here are a little harsh for this film. Origin stories are always hard for superheroes, but this has to be the perfect one for Superman.  In this day and age we live in a world where superhero films are relatively darker than those made ten or twenty years ago. This film definitley captures the essence of that darkness. Its a darker, smarter, and brilliant Superman and superhero film. Zack Snyder wouldnt have be my first choice for this film, but took what he had and used it well. I think what really offputs critics and viewers was the use of Nolans (The director of The Dark Knight franchise) name in the film. I think alot expected to see a brilliant witty and twisty dark film, but were instead given a brilliant Superman film. Superman is not Batman, and never will be. In my view, this is just a start in what will be an amazing new imagining of the Man of Steel.",1
259,Christopher Nolan and Zack need to do more films together. With Nolan dealing with the writing and Zack dealing with the directing they could go really far. This was a superman movie with no generic kryptonite weaknesses or corny lines but one that was actually serious ,1
260,"Man of Steel was not what I expected it to be. Snyder and Nolan took a huge risk but I think it may have been well worth it. Many people complain and compare these superhero films to their comic book counterparts (which I never do). It is nearly a known fact that text sources are substantially greater than anything a film studio could ever compile. As a film, Man of Steel has a well developed plot which isn't too complicated along with what many may call ""excess"" action. Cavill and Adams have good chemistry as Clark and Lois which I hope may develop more in the following films. Overall, the film was great but there is some room for improvement for the next films.",1
261,"Superman has got to be the lamest hero. Honestly, the character is comparable to a hot dog from the old tale about the casings being stuffed with whatever the butcher swept off his floor  Superman has got everything. A man that was dreamt of being forged in empyrean; an essential god simply created to out-do whatever other heroes had been envisioned at the time; a simple product of testosterone fueled imaginations. At least that’s how it seems to me, and yet, that very individual is the champion of what could very well be one of my favorite movies of the past few years, Man of Steel. Sure, call it high praise, but I’m serious; it’s at least managed to claim the title of “Favorite Superhero Movie,” quite easily. Before I get into it, let me talk about the biggest issue and then clarify it for you: this isn’t Christopher Nolan’s movie. I lost track of how many times, when talking about Man of Steel, people have claimed, “Well it’s gotta be good, Nolan did it.” No, he didn’t. He is one of five or so executive producers, and had a finger or two  not even a hand in its entirety  in the story (though, arguably he is the one that had this project green lit, so cheers to that). Similarly, many reviews suggest that Director Zack Snyder attempted to “Nolan-ize” Superman, but assuming that causes expectations to never be fulfilled  this is not The Dark Knight with Superman. So let’s give commendation to those who may have gone unnoticed under Nolan’s shadow: Snyder and Writer David Goyer. Read more    http://www.recomedia.net/filmtv/man-of-steel-review/",1
262,"BEST SUPERMAN IN YEARS....!!! GREAT ACTION, NEW FEATURES, GREAT HISTORY GREAT BATLES AND A CONTROVERSIAL ENDING... WHY 55/100 SO NOW YOU ARE SAYING THAT SUPERMAN RESTURNS IS BETTER THAN MAN OF STEEL... DUDES READ COMICS",1
263,"Great movie. I never liked Superman, thought he was cheesy and the costume was ridiculous and the curled front hair was just plain stupid. I could not see how they could bring Superman to the screen without making it just horrible. I was blown away... what a fantastic movie. I love how the story is segmented and the cinematography was great. The fighting scenes blew me away... I felt every punch. Everything had power, power and more power. The female baddy was just awesome... Fantastic how they described the origin of Superman, and how they explain the most cheesy aspects of Superman in a non-cheese way. The ""S"" is not an ""S"". Thank god! I'm glad they did that. I wish they'd explain the cape though... and when they flash back to when he was a kid wearing a cape... where was his inspiration? Was there a superhero he emulated? Makes you wonder... otherwise without Superman, the cape wouldn't really exist and in the movie he'd be a weird kid wearing a cape for no known reason. The only part I hated was Lois Lane. She's a ballsy reported and I just didn't get that. Poor acting on her behalf. And then, all of the sudden, this reporter is involved in all these military actions. Please! Also, Superman is fighting in space, through buildings in the city, and Lois and the side characters just always happen to be near. I was dissapointed in the end with Clark Kent.  I was hoping they'd not have that in the movie. Everything that seemed ridiculous about Superman they addressed... but just putting on glasses to hide your identity. He's the most talked about person in that world, and nobody thinks that might be him. Oye! Love how Man of Steel had that science fiction feel to it. Bravo!",1
264,"I loved the movie; the action sequences were certainly fantastic, but watching Clark/Kal grapple with his Kryptonian legacy and his love of earth and step into the role of Superman was amazing. The *lack* of levity and cheese really made this movie; the critics seem to hate this taking on the role of a serious sci-fi movie, but that’s what made it for me. I’m certain that the sequel will have more levity in it, now that Superman has really arrived. The acting was fantastic, the visuals were spectacular, and I found it to be quite moving. Yes, the Christ-imagery is overplayed, but he *is* a modern savior figure. I had low expectations after Superman Returns, but I loved this film. Also, Russell Crowe nearly stole the show. I’d watch a prequel, “Krypton,” starring him as Jor-El. The opening sequence on Krypton was really, really good!",1
265,"First off, do not believe what the critics are saying because this Superman movie is better than all the other versions combined. Because it is a Zack Snyder movie, I just knew it was going to be as visually appealing as some of his other stuff like ""Watchmen"" or ""300"" (and I was not let down). Now this ""retelling"" of the story is a little more sci-fi than what you would have read in the comics, but that is okay because this is 2013 (not 1933). I am tempted to write more but have decided that what I have already written should be sufficient. Enjoy! See it on the big screen!",1
266,"I don't  know what think the professional criticism with this film, but I really enjoy it. Blessed effort Trio: Snyder  Goyer  Nolan, because they managed to shoot a powerful superhero movie and I'm not surprised that I liked, because principal or not, Mr. Nolan does not disappoint me. Neither Snyder, because somehow manages to entertain us with his movies and this has made him do.The new Superman is, for better and for worse, a grand ENTERTAINMENT. The downside may be that the story of Kal-El is well known, the same way you came to the earth and all that, but had the ability Goyer innovarla aesthetic treatment plot, but can lead to messes.From the technical standpoint, The Man of Steel is an outstanding film.In between, light, fire and much destruction, perhaps too much, I think why not cheer Snyder in his movies. Here nothing but more blood lacks.Nostalgia should not prevent us from recognizing the work of the composer bestial header Nolan, Hans Zimmer I mean, always very well shot and seasoned with his music.Good deal, good technology and music bill but what Nolan and Goyer have done with Superman? For they have gone beyond the mere update and have given the hero and his entire mythology a more realistic, but more mature severoy. With that, and especially with everything else, The Man of Steel is, not without doubts a thirtysomething as the undersigned will arouses nostalgia gravitational force exerted by the Richard Donner-tape the best Superman to the date in my opinion. Man of Steel is excessive, in its form and in its duration, overloaded, noisy and with a vocation of seriousness and solemnity that kills that eternal innocence endearing character that Christopher Reeve did. That loses but wins more.I think I speak for many when I say that at least this movie is better than the last, Superman Returns, that bore more than entertain.But when a verdict, we must not forget that this has only just begun. Still hope to see more.My Score: 9.3",1
267,"The critics who have rated this down strike me as some what shortsighted.  There are some valid complaints in their reviews that I think did detract from the movie (the shaking camera is my biggest pet peeve), but as far as the core of the movie is concerned, this is a Superman movie.  No critic can convince me otherwise.What the critics who say it fails to live up to the Superman brand do not realize is that this is a new Superman.  This is a reboot of the franchise after the abysmal ""dead-beat dad"" story of ""Superman Returns"".  Very similar to the Dark Knight reboot of Batman, this is a different Superman.  He has different issues and a different history, he is not ripped from the comic books or garnered from the Christopher Reeves movies.  He is a unique and completely different Man of Steel.  That is not to say that he does not share similarities with the previous Superman, of course he does.  At his core he is Superman, the Man of Steel, a Kryptonian sent to Earth by his parents to escape a dying world. In fact my only big complaint is the shaky camera.  There are moments when the footage looks as if it is being shot by a guy holding a camcorder and it steals from the theatrical overture as well as making the scene itself nauseating to watch.  This only happens maybe a half dozen times in the movie, but every time it happens it is annoying and unwarranted.  My only other complaint is minor and that is with some of the story elements regarding Zodd's banishment and his return as well as the so called ""Kryptonian Empire"".  These are minor as I am aware this is a different Superman, but these elements seemed to have been written in too hastily and not thought through properly.Aside from that this is an Epic movie and I look forward to the sequel.  Also eagle eyed viewers will catch a few easter eggs in the movie hinting at some great future possibilites, most notably was the LexCorp and Wayne Enterprises logos cleverly shown during some of the fighting.",1
268,"Man of Steel was a great re-imagining of the Superman origin story and gave a fresh taste combined with tons of action to make a true entertaining popcorn movie of the summer. Zack Snyder is a loyal comic book fan and those of you that did not like Watchmen did not read the comics.  He was hired for one real purpose, to breathe action and special effects into Superman, something he excels at. Moviegoers, and I call them that to separate them from fans which have a different take on Superman, had spoken at the close of Superman Returns.  They said things from, ""too much like Christopher Reeve"" to ""not enough action"" to ""Superman is stale, let him let loose"".  Warner Brothers listened and they gave you the opposite of a Christopher Reeve Superman.  In Man of Steel, Superman did all of those things, he let loose his rage and fought an army of people with the same abilities.  No Lex Luthor, no mind games, all action.   We got a mythology rich in science fiction story not to mention we got Russell Crowe as daddy Superman Jor-El who got lots of screen time to show us what the house of El can do! The casting was terific!  Henry Cavill's Superman is bold, fresh and lets face it, he looks like Superman.   Amy Adams is much more level headed and has a great deal more of common sense then Kate Bosworth did as Lois Lane.  She is believable in the role.  I loved Brandon Routh and thought he was a great Superman, but he was Christopher Reeve, so if we are going to move beyond Christopher Reeve then Cavill makes a nice contrast.   Laurence Fishburn as Perry White!  Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents.  It all made for rich storytelling and well acted roles.  The only thing better was imagining who was going to be in the next movie and what bad guy was going to get screen time! If you were hoping for another Superman Returns, then this is not your picture.  This is a rollercoaster moving at mach speeds with enough action to give you PTSD by the end of the movie.  It's not Shakespeare but it is an iconic comic book character come to life in true comic book fashion.  I highly recommend seeing this movie in a movie theater and if possible, spend the extra 10 bucks for iMax.",1
269,"Let's face it folks, there has not been a great Superman movie since Christopher Reeves soared the screens in 1978. With a new reboot of the Man of Steel, we can anticipate it as either being very good or really bad. The big critics seem to agree with such a notion. They either liked it or hated it. There is no middle ground. For me, the revived super hero film is something to admire again with a fresh slate. Many of the strengths of this new Superman is its imaginative creativity on how it focuses on both the hero's struggles and his origin. The opening sequence of Krypton is simply a stunning visual feast that puts the compacted ice cave from the past Superman films to shame. Here, Zack Snyder and the VFX team has given us a world with spaceships, monsters, people, battles, and ultimately life and destruction. In other words, the beginning sets the tone in plot and action, like any good superhero flick should. The rest of the film is dedicated to how the protagonist learns of his past and how he evolves from an outcast with special abilities to something more. While this is sounds familiar, writer David S. Goyer gives us more back story, filling factors that were never really explored in other movies of the franchise. One such example is rather than jumping ahead with the famed Lex Luther villain, this movie's plot introduces an antagonist that has seemed to slip into oblivion...General Zod from the home world of Krypton. Like with the League of Shadows for Batman, this establishes hero's first and most important villain that has come to haunt him...a blast from the past so to speak. Zack Snyder as director has an eye for stunning visual effects and knowing how to form a wide scope of imagination (just watch 300 and Watchmen). He also knows how to create action sequences worth remembering. Believe me, they are abundant in this movie, but they are not overbearing like in a Michael Bay film. There is a reason to them for the plot. The one thing that I seem to enjoy about the most of this movie is Hans Zimmer's musical composition. While it is unfair to say that it is better than what John Williams did in 1978, he makes something memorable and uplifting. Though doubtful, it would be appropriate for him to receive some accolades for it. The cast in this movie is full of big names and stars. They range from the popular Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and Amy Adams to the small players like Christopher Meloni, Michael Shannon, and Laurence Fishburne. Each appear to fit their parts well, but some are greater than others. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane turn in some subtle and believable performances as Superman's human parents. Whereas Russell Crowe seems to be playing himself more or less as Jor-el and Michael Shannon as General Zod has the overgrowing tendency of swelling up with anger like a child who's toy has been taken from him. Amy Adams is a little old than what I imagine for Lois Lane, but she is still lovely and plausible. Henry Cavill as Superman is the man who carries the film. He is gentle in his role and plays the outcast side of the Man of Steel well. As a superhero, he appears a bit emotionless. Then again, Superman was not known for showing much emotion. Though I kind of have mixed feelings about the casts' performances, I am bothered the most by the style of storytelling. In comparison to the linear story method used in the 1978 film, this movie jumps around from different scenes in the first hour that seem not to relate or make sense. The accompanied flashbacks thrown in of Superman's childhood on earth makes it even more perplexing. Fortunately, the second half of the film makes up for the confusion that the first act and a half make. All things considering, ""Man of Steel"" has started a potentially promising new restart for Superman.",1
270,Man of steel is so great those critics realy  nothing  I mean the story was great the cast was good and henry vavill was perfect as superman for someone who just stepped on the scene okay he aint no christian bale or robert Downey jr but he is on the right way love this movie thanks to this my love for superman grew even stronger,1
271,"If you enjoyed The Avengers & Iron Man 3, then you haven't seen MAN OF STEEL yet.  This movie up the ante for the superheroes genre. The action alone leaves all others in the dustbin.  While all other superheroes in recent past were all patterned after Donner's Superman films (except for Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy), this one is not.  You won't find Robert Downey Jr.'s humor here.  Henry Cavill's elusive ""brooding"" take of the comic character is far different from Christopher Reeve's charismatic friendly turn because Snyder's darkly-serious MAN OF STEEL is not Donner's straight-from-the-comic-book colorful SUPERMAN.  Despite the stark contrast, Cavill was able to capture the magic back that was long-missing since Chris Reeve hang up his bright red cape.  Cavill on film, you would swear, on several scenes and at certain angles, looking like the late great Reeve.  He has the same convincing intensity onscreen as the late actor.  You wouldn't wince but nod in familiar recognition that this actor is indeed the Superman we all missed all these years despite of many others' attempt to measure up with Reeve's indelible iconic take.  We remember the media were all hailing Brandon Routh's close resemblance to Chris Reeve but after getting picked & cast for this reason in 2006's SUPERMAN RETURNS, it turned out he didn't look the part & came across unconvincing.  Indeed, good things come to those who are willing to wait & the wait paid off for Henry Cavill and for this reboot.  It's everything we ever wanted from a Superman film minus the cheesiness.  With today's technical advances, Snyder & company were able to re-imagine for us what our favorite hero could be without limits.  Forget about what critics are saying about MAN OF STEEL.  They did not get a pay cut from the film's promoters that's why.  Instead, listen to the movie-going public who were right to give it an A- rating in Cinemascore.  In Rotten Tomatoes, SUPERMAN RETURNS got a 75% rating from the critics while MAN OF STEEL gets only 56%? Go figure...",1
272,"This is by far the best depiction of the Superman origin story ever put on screen. The critics are dead wrong about this movie, I simply cannot understand what is going on in their heads. This isn't a Donner/Lester sequel, this isn't Superman Returns, it's a brand new Superman origin story. Just watch it, you won't regret it. It also deserves at least two viewings to get at all the nuances of the epic SF scope the movie sets up, which is also my only gripe with Man of Steel  it crams maybe a little bit too much into one movie, which makes the dialogue feel ""stiff"". However, on the second viewing you notice that almost every spoken sentence makes sense and carries weight, adding meaning and detail to a very thought through story. Excellent reboot.",1
273,"Welcome to the Planet"" VERY happy to report that Man of Steel was a VERY satisfying movie. 9/10 for sure. Really wish I could have seen it on opening day instead of reading reviews, listening to feedback that almost put another image of the movie in my mind. But taking away 1 point only because there was an action sequence that could have been removed and the pacing was just a bit off. But all in all, really happy as a Superman fan to see so much of his sci-fi mythos incorporated. For people's reactions to his existence being similar to that shown in the earliest depictions of him, late 1930s, early 1940s. And for some witty one liners. If you are still hung up on the variant of the character you saw in either the 1950s TV series or the first two Christopher Reeve movies, you will be disappointed. I want to see the movie again. Indeed I do ",1
274,"first, english is not my mother tongue so forgive me my mistakes. and lets start with the critic of superman, the well as it seems, most discussed and most dividing comic book adapting movie so far. which is basiclly zacks snyders doing. cause like not a lot of other directors, he provokes people into making a stand for their opinion, no matter if its postiv or negativ on his behalf. its simple and easy: you love or you hate a zack snyder movie, there is no inbetween. no ""thx, it was nice but left no impression whatsoever"" movie, like we have a lot going on nowadays.the story was solid, logical and easy to follow for people who never heard of superman before, and even for fans of the comics, it wasn't boring thx to the non linear story telling of supermans childhood. the glimpses of the past give the viewer a good look into the brooding and drifting beeing, that superman is at the beginning of the story. and helps understand why he is living this vagabond live and not already is the great superhero you would expect.the cast was perfect and everyone showed his best in portraing his/her character. the action was epic, but, and there the movie lost the one point to the perfect 10 with me, it was a little to much. means 10 minutes lesser action and 10 minutes more character moments would have made the movie perfect. the music was, like always with hans zimmer, brilliant. it set the right tone to every scene.and no, it was not a colourful or witty movie, like the old ones with christopher reeves. it was serious and dark. but this is what made the movie so enjoyable. cause we are not lving in colourful and witty times. and no one wants to see a bing bang comic book hero anymore. there not believable and they are not human.the outstanding part of the movie was done by henry cavill. he made the main character, an alien, human and relatable. not with grand gestures, not with wits or charms. but by showing, under the hardest circumstances that he has not only the looks to play superman but also the acting skills,espacialy with his small but honest facetts ins his face. playing with a cast where several members were oscar nominated more than once and even win the oscar more than once in some cases is already huge. but having more than the half of the movie green and blue screen time, more than his share of physical action and the weight of one of the most iconic characters in comic book and movie history on his shoulders, given all that, he realy did a super human beeing job. cause his superman is more human than some of the humans surrounding him. and he's believable. and the bright honest smile he gives at the end of the movie, when he finaly turns into clark kent (no, not into superman, into his alter ego), gives us hope to see more of this in a sequel that may come. it gives us a glimps of the charm, the witts and the humanity we're to expect.so this movie and his main character did their best, to bring a new superman on screen. one that is relatable to the 21 centuries. and to all the critics out there, you realy should watch it a second time and you should watch closely....cause for me, you haven't understood the movie at all. which is bad, considering your line of work.",1
275,"incredible movie,incredible soundtrack,incredible action!Best superman movie ever seen.Henry cavill is ideal,Russell crowe is amazing and the action?Ohh is unstoppable!",1
276,"Awesome movie!!!  Left us wanting for more.  Can't wait for MAN OF STEEL 2.  We wanna see more of the Clark & Lois romance in the sequel since there's less of it in this one.  The action was just over the top!  We came in famish for a good movie & came out fat-bellied with satisfaction, gluttons at best, wanting more of that cinematic buffet greatness.  MAN OF STEEL is the beast of all superhero action movies we kid you not!  We love this movie so much that we clamor for the next installment to be as great if not greater.  We want perhaps a Brainiac-controlled billionaire Lex Luthor versus billionaire Bruce Wayne in the mix as well as the introduction of Wonder Woman's character to pave the way for THE JUSTICE LEAGUE.  How will Zack Snyder-David Goyer do it?  DC & WB trusted them on the first installment, they couldn't go wrong to leave it up to this team-up for the next ones. Hope Chris Nolan is still on board cuz he does make a difference even for just consultation.",1
277,"This was not an easy 10 but it just fits, after thinking about the movie it has a lot more positive things than negative, because if you saw the last superman movie this is a complete revolution, from the hand of masters of  science fiction like Snyder, Goyer and Nolan this films looks awesome and  for being a superhero has not a predictable screenplay, because they did what Superman was missing, weakness, humanity that proves he is really affected by being part of the humans, that can be either a disadvantage  or an advantage for him. Apart from the story, also the characters are believable and truly well performed, specially for Michael Shanon and Henry Cavill. The action as well as the scenery are at the height of the movie, and if you are not a superman comic book fan, the history of his origins is gratefully told. In average this movie really stands out for its production, story and actors, and the only real disadvantages are that for the comic book fans this will not be the ideal movie that sticks perfectly with the origins of superman and also that in some parts Mrs Lane makes the movie a little silly returning to the predictable stuff of a superhero.",1
278,"When I have first time heard about new superman, i thought it's a crap. But film is awesome, really I don't like superman franchise but this film is really good",1
279,"Man of Steel was an excellent movie, both emotionally gripping, suspenseful, and entertaining! I've seen this Movie twice and looking forward to owning it on DVD. I love the Modern version of superman. His Humility, kindness and moral was moving. I cried a few times thru out the film! I love superman but this by far has got to be my favorite version!",1
280,"Blew my mind. Over the top Zack Snyder action, good story telling to accompany it. Went into it with high expectations and it still knocked my socks off. It's not perfect, but for a Superman movie it's as close as it gets.",1
281,I think a lot of movie critics are being too harsh with this one. I like the darker tone of thos movie and a found the characters very interesting. I do agree the fight sceenes were over done. Overall I really enjoyed this movie.,1
282,"Wow,  I was really concerned about the ""critic"" review of this film. I mean it's Superman,  how can it be bad? I went and saw it it with my wife,  and we left the theaters with smiles on our face. Great movie. I take issues with the effects and animation of characters, but I enjoyed the clear crisp picture otherwise. Henry Cavil will be a great Superman, and the villain was great. There were some questionable scenes in the movie like when Louis Lane showed up at the fight scene near the end at Grand Central Station so fast or how they recklessly fight everywhere. But these are just minor things. Nothing like how the critics made it sound it's terrible. It'snot  They are terrible at having an opinion. Best Superman yet.",1
283,"All the mythical universe is here, updated and with all respect the character deserves. Good cast, great direction and even emotional moments made this the best movie of 2013 so far.",1
284,"Very excited for a very long time to see what Snyder and Nolan could do. Love 300 and the Batman trilogy so I figured this would be a sure fire hit. While it was good and Henry Cavill is an excellent casting of Superman, the movie did get very long. There were so many climaxes that it became exhausting. Seeing this in 3d was probably not necessary and maybe even detracted from the film due to the intentionally unstable camera work. This is definitely a film to see in the theater, but only worthy of a matinee. Obvious as it is, this is still a great launching point for a sequel(s).",1
285,"The director manage to deliver a fresh and new story about his past and his present, but it does devolve a bit into repeated action and demolishing cities. In general the movie leaves a good taste of what we can expect in the future.",1
286,"Minutes before going to Man of Steel I checked Metacritic to get an idea what I was in store for. After reading all the negative reviews I got nervous. Now, 2 hours later I ask: What movie were those critics watching? Man of Steel was great! It's a compelling story about one of the most icon figures in the DC universe and it is ACTION PACKED. Furthermore, what's this nonsense about poor acting? The acting was fine (in fact, beyond just ""fine"") and I, not known to cry ever, teared up on multiple occasions. Beyond on that, a beautiful and chilling score accompanies this fine movie making it the blockbuster we've been hoping for from the Superman franchise. Go see this movie and forget what the critics are saying.",1
287,"I don't know if it's because I've never been a huge fan of Superman. I've never read the comics and I've watched the other movies once or twice, but I really liked this film. Even if it's a reboot, it tries to tell Superman's story from a more 'feet-to-ground' level, giving justifications to Superman's motivations and goals. I really liked that. The action scenes where very good and it even gave space for a good measure of character development --lots of film with a higher Metacritic score can't say half of that. I understand die-hard fans of Superman may expected something else, something more 'faithful' to what the comic may be, and that's why some were disappointed. But I hope you get to this film without expectations, just with the desire to watch something fun and good, then you may enjoy this very, very good film. Waiting for the blu-ray release.",1
288,"Simply put, best Superman movie ever made, period.Finally some action, we all know the back story, this movie gives it a good twist. Seen it twice, worth every cent.",1
289,"nice surprise. not just a remake but new take on a old story. this is not your grandparents Superman, and that is good.A movie about a Super Man that shows the Humans as much as the Hero. Thank you Colonel Nathan Hardy and Jonathan Kent.",1
290,Never in my life have I seen something so amazing and epic like this on the big screen! This was just monumental when it comes to how grand of a spectacle it was. Not to mention the best comic book movie ever filmed.... Thanks again Zack Snyder!,1
291,"Here's the problem, most people want a fun, light-hearted, Superman can do anything movie like Christopher Reeve did. That was Superman Returns, and that was horrible. This movie strives for a new direction,  in tone, style, and audience. This is jot for the 5 year old with a towel hanging like a cape over their back. This movie serves to satisfy the teenager or older audience. Superman doesn't just become super, there are learning pains. There are reasons now for things that have always been taken for granted. Even the slightly altered origin story is an acceptable change, as it adds complexity and new story elements without completely destroying the character in the process. Overall this was a good movie, if you were a fan of the comic books or are just looking for a movie that tries to actually ground itself in some sort of ""reality"" (lacking in ""comic book reality)  instead of just being a popcorn movie used to sell toys to kids.",1
292,"This movie surprised me a lot. I think this is the best adaptation of Superman. Great actors, specially Antje Traue and Henry Cavill, amazing action and visual effects, great story and the MOST SPECTACULAR SOUNDTRACK EVER MADE. I really loved this movie and I have great expectations for the second one.",1
293,"If this is what SUPER man has become then we might as well pack it up and wait to die. Maybe the next species can do a better job of existing. On the other hand the movie does have some really neato CGI , very emotional music attached to forced drama, and a lot of other crap that fools the dumb popcorn eating masses into thinking it is good.",0
294,"Man of Steel delivers the beginning of something greater, I couldn't ask for anything more from a origin story. The building blocks are in place for the DC Universe to expand upon. Stunning, Amazing, Beautiful, Exhilarating! MASTERPIECE",1
295,"I've now watched the film 3 times... After the initial trailers hit the screen I couldn't wait to see it  but  I have to admit after the first viewing I felt a little disappointed and a bit cheated    However, on viewing it a second time... What can I say... The sound track was the first thing I noticed and it frankly blew me away   finally we can move on from Mr Williams wee tune.  My thoughts regarding the film are probably best summed up in the following review  http://screenrant.com/man-of-steel-reviews-2013-superman/",1
296,"It wasn't prefect but I liked the way they tried to reinvent the canon. The acting was well done in my opinion, even though the story was nothing new. Some of the action sequences were a bit drawn out but other than that I enjoyed this installment of the Superman franchise.",1
297,"Went into this expecting to be disappointed, honestly. With all the super hero movies coming out I didn't expect much. Man of Steel was shockingly good though. Lots of early buildup, an amazing soundtrack, and the last half hour of the movie was raw action. I don't know how in the world any critics rate this lower than a 65 or 70...",1
298,This was not only the best superhero movie to date but also the most thrilling summer movie in memory. Fans of Superman will be very pleased by his treatment in this film and hopefully chase any lingering angst from the previous debacle .This is also a movie for anime fans as this is the Dragonball movie they deserve. I can not give a higher recomendation. See this movie!,1
299,"I do not agree with the critics, a film based on a super heroes like batman or superman this check for an audience that child lived with these heroes to siferencia of lasanteriores marvel movies where this child together very public with current  this film gives us a nice moment of entertainment and pays the debt he had with us in the previous movie superman",1
300,"Overall ""Man of Steel"" is very entertaining and does a good job encompassing the ""Superman"" we all know today. However I did have my qualms detailed below (in no particular order).Cons: 1. The beginning of the movie was very non-linear with flashbacks and present time, making it mildly difficult to draw connections from Clark Kent's past to his present day situations. 2. Understanding the meaning of a sacrifice from Jonathon Kent to protect Clark's secret was extremely clear, however it was tactfully done to save a dog? I would have been much more satisfied to see the man that bestowed all of his values and ideals to superman die trying to save a human being. 3. When Clark first boarded Zod's ship with Lois, he underwent some type of reaction to the atmosphere in the ship, later referred to as Krypton's atmosphere. Zod goes on to explain to Clark that it is an adverse reaction since Clark has become so acclimated to Earth's atmosphere he cannot sustain his strength in Krypton's. This makes perfect sense, but since Zod made it clear that it was Clark's acclimatization to Earth's atmosphere that was causing his weakness, then why is Clark able to sustain life in space without any problems when space clearly is not composed of the same atmosphere as Earth? 4. Way to much destruction and explosion. Was this a Michael Bay film or a Zack Snyder film. Metropolis, which was not established early enough as the city being pictured, is now completely destroyed. Clark Kent, the ultra-moral and ethical Superman, seemed to have no hesitation or apprehension in destroying anything in his path to fighting Zod. i.e. when Zod threatens Martha Kent, instead of fighting Zod in the open acreage of a farm, Clark sees it fit to carry Zod into urban territory, through a party store, gas station, and into an oil tanker causing tons of destruction and probably multiple injuries or deaths. The Superman I usually picture in my head would most likely deal with his enemies in the least destructive way, with minimal casualties and damage to surrounding structures. 5. Cheesy Dialogue, “Sorry Sir, but I just think he’s kinda hot”  Was that really necessary? Everyone watching the movie has eyes and can see for themselves that Henry Cavill is a good looking guy. There were multiple lines like this including Lawrence Fishburne telling his Co-worker to stay while she is pinned under hundreds of pounds of concrete rubble. It was also somewhat off-putting that the Kryptonians  had identical dialects/dialogues to humans. These seemingly extremely advanced race from 100,000 years ago talks the exact same way that humans do in the 21st century? 6. At the end of the movie when it flashes back to Clark as a child and his father watching him play with his dog, it is probably confirming the foreshadowing of Clark’s father’s repetitive notion towards the prophetic  idea that Clark is destined for great things. But why is he playing with a red towel attached to his back like a cape? Who the hell is he imitating? I assume it’s little red riding hood, because I know when I did that same thing when I was a kid, I was imitating Superman. 7.  Zod’s character progressively develops into an evil Superman like nemesis that sports the same powers as Superman and yet Superman cannot be killed and Zod is killed? If I snap Clark Kent’s neck her should die? Pros: 1.	Very entertaining and a lot of back story information for those not exceptionally versed in DC comics like myself. 2.	Great ending with Clark Kent killing Zod, effectively illustrating his biological father’s dream for him come true. The bridging of two people. Clark exercised his gift of free choice in killing Zod given to him by his father, and reaped to moral consequences on his conscience after doing it, the result of a human upbringing on earth. Jor-El’s vision of Kal-el being the bridge of two people becomes literal as he is ultimately a bridge of two people in Kal-El and Clark Kent.  As well as in his system of beliefs and biological makeup, housing the DNA of a billion Kryptonic people.",1
301,Is a new generation for Superman.Realism does not mean pessimism.Man of Steel is under the sign of Hope.Clark finally discovered who he is and why he is here.He now knows his real name Kal-El. Film that the world needs these days.A unifying symbol for America and for all peoples 10/10,1
302,"This ain't yo daddy's Superman. Badass. Now to address the hate. This film is being torn down by people saying it's both technically terrible, and a disservice to the character. I've got news for ya: f**k Sam Raimi. Y'all want Spiderman with bright colours and comic panels come to life. If you want that, there's Superman Returns, and it was awful. Like every Superman movie except the first one, and even that has aged horribly. Go watch the Marvel movies. DC have gotten the two filmmakers who redefined the tonal spectrum of the superhero working TOGETHER. I'm sick of live action cartoons  this is a film.",1
303,"Los flashbacks que muestran a Crark son mis partes favoritas, el es un alien PERO (es mas humano que algunas personas que existen en el mundo que no tienen corazón, aquí su vida es trágica) Los momentos de Kevin Costner padre e hijo muy emotivos (la escena del tornado es la mas tristona, y muy importante a pesar de que algunos crean que fue una muerte tonta) se te salen las lagrimas. Luego la película me parece un poco larga, pudieron cortar algunas escenas de explosiones como la de ‘terraformar’ (que es algo pesada)…Las batallas entre Kryptonianos son BRUTALES (Zack Snyder of course), nunca lo habíamos visto repartir y recibir golpes de esa forma en el cine live-action, ese ”CRACK!” cuando le rompe el cuello a Zod es supremo! (luego se nota su arrepentimiento, es un momento épico, algo como: “No use mis poderes y deje morir a mi padre, ya es suficiente, ahora el mundo se puede ir a la mierda si no los uso”)  La escena final pudieron hacerla mejor, pudieron recortar algunas explosiones casi innecesarias y así darle unos minutos mas (es fugas) ademas la cinta prueba que la serie de tv Smallville es innecesaria ya que en Man of Steel se cuenta la historia de Clark muy claramente y de manera mas emotiva… sales muy satisfecho del cine. 9/10",1
304,"Anyone who went to see ""Man of Steel"" expecting a  Dances with wolves"" or  Black Swan"" class of film will be sorely dissapointed. Superhero movies are not meant to winn best movie at the oscars; In the best of cases they are meant to be entertaining.That said its pleasing to see that this film does rise above the average superhero movie, Zack Snyder presents a fresh new version of the Superman storyline with a hero that had roots on a much darker corrupted Krypton. The film makes an attempt at staining our beloved boyscout with tryials both moral and philosophical, in this they succeed at least in part. The end result is a more believable human, Superman, one that doesnt just fight for good simply because he does; there is now reason and emotion behind his way of thinking, leaving the audience to ponder how close it all came for him to turn into someone like Zod.",1
305,"To first put my perspective of Superman in check would be to inform you of what I've seen before. There are of course the first two Christopher Reeve movies (I skipped out on III and IV simply because I've heard nothing but terrible things) from which I moved onto Bryan Singer's 2006 Superman Returns. I enjoyed the romanticism and meditation of that film despite it now being panned by pretty much any fan boy you talk to. I've never seen an episode of ""Smallville"" and sans for a couple of animated features my knowledge of the DC mainstay is somewhat limited. Thus it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to a new vision, a re-booted film interpretation in line with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy that has defined the space that films based on DC comics characters will occupy in this Marvel world. Personally, and as much as I enjoy the Marvel movies, I was more intrigued and engaged by the bleak and more serious moods that hung over the Nolan films as they were appropriate to the central characters tone. Though I was slightly concerned with this same tone not applying to the guy commonly referred to as the ultimate boy scout it seems that persona was not always true and director Zack Snyder along with Nolan as a producer and David Goyer (who also penned the screenplay for Batman Begins) have adapted the Superman story to not only exist in a similar universe with Nolan's Batman films, but within his own, more realistic world that doesn't simply pit the classic superhero against a bad guy in order to champion truth, justice and the American way. What they have done here and what makes me appreciate the film all the more is that while keeping in step with the kind of movies Nolan has made DC could attempt a Justice League movie in the future with this as a good place to start, but it also doesn't limit itself to that same completely realistic world of what we know because Superman is an alien and with that they ask the question of what would happen in a real world setting if Superman were to show up. It is that basic set-up that guides the film throughout and, despite a few flaws, had me gushing with excitement for what may come next. read the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",1
306,"Honestly, people argue that there wasn't enough emotion or light-heartened acting, but there was. I do think that there was a bit too much action at parts but the way that Snyder captures Superman is just incredible. He is definitely and Alien and deserves more credit at a critical stance (talking about Superman)",1
307,"This was one of the best remakes ever made. Man of Steel kept a distance between 78's Superman. Zack did a very good job as a director, and the writers did a great job with the story. The fighting sequences were awesome. This movie felt like a modern reimagination of Superman with new technology. The movie is definetely a summer blockbuster and will hit the billion mark.I give Man of Steel a 10/10...",1
308,Man of steel brings the superman mythos into the 21st and firmly places him back on top. From the performances to the action directions Zack Snyder brought to the table. A brilliant telling of the first and greatest superhero to ever grace the big screen and comics. nuff said,1
309,"If there's any movie that shows just how out of touch movie critics are with movie fans, this is it. Zack Snyder   had a tough job pulling this one off and I'm not exactly a fan of his, but this was a grand slam home run if there's ever been one. This is a must see.",1
310,"Man of Steel is beyond super; it's superb. Man of Steel soars, it's imagery is breathtaking. At times, I certainly couldn't believe my eyes. It's definitely the first movie of the summer to live up to it's hype. An absolute must see. I went in with the highest expectations, usually no movie can ever smash your expectations but Man of Steel certainly does that. From the moment on Krypton to one of the final moments in Metropolis. It leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat through and through. It's perfect.",1
311,"This movie is amazing, seriously is the best Superman Movie ever made, great acting, great characters developed, great villain, and so incredible action scenes, the best movie of Mr. Snyder, the Man of Steel is the move fans were waiting to see all their life.",1
312,"This is one of my candidates for all time greatest movie experiences.  Wow. Amazing. Great acting, story and effects.  Of course they must fight for 45 minutes, it's four super men fighting it out, they don't die easy, and the city being destroyed was realistic and exciting.  Too bad critics just look for negatives, being a critic does not mean be critical.",1
313,"In a time when Comic-book characters showing their prime in celluloid, Superman, I believe, is bit outdated; out of the league. One of the first superhero of this genre, Superman gradually became an American icon and a symbol of hope and courage. But in recent times nobody really seemed to care about Superman  a man in shining blue-red suit. Young generation now hardly relate with Superman when they have more realistic gadget oriented Batman or Iron man. This was the most important part for Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David Goyer  How to present Superman in current time? Okay, lets show him not as a Superman rather show him as an outcast, struggling between two worlds. An alien who still searches his roots. There Snyder, Nolan and Goyer wins the race. Richard Donner showed the world that we're going to believe a man can fly. But for what price? Donner made a Superman which is still now a confusing piece of work as far Superman is concerned. He never tried to show struggles of Superman; he just went with the flow and tried hard to give goosebumps to audience showing some 'there he is' type moments. That is why in 1978 Superman was a hit and in modern times it mostly criticised by modern audiences. Nolan knew one thing  ""we cannot afford to show the same origin story again and again'. So with Snyder and Goyer he comes up with a brilliant idea. Snyder shows that this is Kal-El and he's no Superman. He has powers but he cannot show them. This is hard time, Govt. officials are looking for alien specimens, so showing off powers and then moving on as Clark Kent sounds extremely stupid. They made Kal-El more human material, more grounded. His powers are not a matter of pride, those are his biggest problems of his life. Man of Steel is a story about an alien who lives among the humans and struggles with his powers. Man of Steel just showed what can happen when alien powers collide. Ripping off White House's head is not what they do. Complete destruction is what happens. The fight between Kal-El and Faora & her partner showed that this is what Donner was missing out. Extreme level action. Who cares about the surroundings? Donner did! Everything made absolute sense. Why Zod, why Kal, why Krypton exploded  i mean everything. No half chances in this movie. Henry Cavill is the most suitable Superman I have ever seen. He is 1000 times better than any Superman  be it Christopher Reeve, Brandon Routh (that's not Superman), George Reeve, etc. Cavill is the best. He has that expression of agony being an outcast alien. Others were just happy to be a Superman! Duh! Overall this is the best rendition of Superman in big screen. Go for it!",1
314,"Great movie, and great origin story.  the movie didn't feel like 2.5 hours long.  the pacing was great, and I loved Henry Cavill as Superman.  This movie had everything, good story telling, serious tone and hints of humor.",1
315,"Man of Steel may have the greatest action in a movie, ever and has a pretty good story to go with it. The film starts with great action with a huge battle on krypton and finishes with a huge battle on earth. The actors did there part and were able to engage the audience most of the time. Towards the begging of the film there was forced chemistry between some characters but towards the end they greatly improved. Superman's origin was greatly told through flashbacks. The special effects were amazing and always kept me entertained.",1
316,"Reviewers need to calm down and stop comparing this to the reeve films, why cant they understand that this is different.People saying its a ""Special effects fiasco"" are idiots its a Superman movie he flies, shoots lasers out of his eyes, and lifts cars, and fights robots i didn't think the special effects are a great addition in the movie",1
317,"Completely MIND-BLOWING action scenes mixed with very choppy and sometimes bad character development. The main fault of the movie is Superman himself. While he can be shown struggling at a young age, and gives you a sense of where he's coming from and what he's been dealing with, he's never shown as being a fun, humorous character, which is something I personally disliked, but might be completely the opposite for other viewers. Michael Shannon does an ok job as Zod, but feels like a missed opportunity. Antje Traue, who plays Faora, is amazingly good. Some characters are in the movie with practically no purpose at all, but the action scenes can be so good, and keep your mind off of the huge missteps the movie took. All in all, a great ""action"" movie, but falls in certain areas.",1
318,"Don't let the negative critics ruin your mood to watch this movie. It's awesome! Man of Steel provides amazing visuals and fight scenes worthy of a modern Superman movie. Although some of the scenes and dialogue can be a little shifty towards the Hollywood stereotype, there aren't any major problems with the overall aspect of the film. It's beautiful, exhilarating, and overall, fun.",1
319,"Love the movie, this was the Superman, I've been waiting for better than the old ones no disrespect to Reeves, they did a awesome job, effects, action, seen the movie on the 14, and going back again to watch it on 3d, was worth every penny!!! Really don't care about what the critics had to say. Can't wait for blue-ray to come out pre-ordering at Wal-mart!! Whoever did not watch man of steel, go watch it do not listen to rotten tomatoes and all them critics, they have no idea what they talking about!",1
320,These critics are an absolute joke! This movie was awesome!! Only things I wasn't crazy about was the beginning scene on Krypton (avatar/star wars vibe) & the female beatin the hell out of Superman with absolute ease. People cryin about Superman killin Zod at the end are a bunch of hippie nerds. Naaa he should have just let Zod kill hundreds of thousands more ppl lol. Anyways if your any kind of fan of Superman or super hero movies go see this movie asap!,1
321,"Lets be honest its better than Superman Returns just kidding. Man Of Steel is a fresh, darker reboot of the superman franchise and its done really well with the film lasting 3 hours everything is explained from him being sent to earth but more importantly, why? A factor that a lot of past superman films left out. you don't need to be a massive superman fan to go see this i took my girlfriend and she loved it and i did to. General Zod is a fantastic bad guy and Russell crow is a fabulous Jur-al. The film has some amazing fighting scenes and a lot of flashbacks to a young Clark Kent to explain the hardships of him growing up this is certainly the superman film i was waiting for and its the one i got.",1
322,"Expectations are everything with movies.  Before I saw Avengers I heard critics gushing about it and when I went to see it myself I was totally underwhelmed.  Still not sure why everyone thought it was so great.  I had just the opposite experience with Man of Steel.  After hearing critics trash it I was expecting the worst.  But I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are all top notch.  Cavill plays Superman very well.  He's big and brawny but has a soft side.  Amy Adams was a very good Lois Lane.  Not a damsel in distress at all, but an active part of the story.  And it was smart to ditch the silly part of the Superman canon that Lois Lane is a top reporter but can't see through Clark's disguise.  Zod was villainous, but not in a cartoony way.  He's ruthless, but has his reasons.  Faora is fantastic as well. The story does suffer a little bit from all of the flashbacks, they can be jarring.   But they make sense in that they all tie back to the present.  I liked the fact that they show him as a hero during all stages of his life.  The pacing was excellent.  After starting on Krypton, they jump to the present and he dons the suit and cape relatively early on. The action is off the charts.  I know some critics have complained that it was too much CGI, but what did they expect?   The had to show the epic scale of Superman's powers, so of course there would be a lot of special effects.  Fun, fun stuff.  It will leave you breathless.  The final fight between Superman and Zod is brutal and more violent than seen in previous Superman films. The end set up a sequel perfectly. Can't wait for another film plus Justice League.  The only problem with that is that given how powerful Superman is in this universe, i can't imagine what kind of threat they would have to come up with that he would need help with. Good movie, not great like Dark Knight, but fun and enjoyable.",1
323,"Man of Steel was what a realistic superhero movie should be like!  It truly showed the inner turmoil of a young Clark trying to balance saving lives with keeping his secret.  Kevin Costner (Jon Kent) and Russell Crowe (Jor-El) contributed heavily to why Clark became Superman.  Do you really think the military would not be interested in a super powered being and not be wary?  The action sequences were heads above anything Marvel has ever done.  The new twists on Krypton and how the Earths atmosphere affects Kryptonians was refreshing.  Seen the movie three times!  Don't listen to the critics...too many people as collateral damage, Superman doesn't kill, or any of that carp!  Superman does kill..remember Superman II?  Didn't remorse one bit when he killed Zod and the other two Kryptonians yet people think that's ok.  I am a huge Superman fan and therefore really studied this movie and if it stunk, I would say say.  We fans are usually the harshest critics!  Can't wait for the sequel and Justice League!  Henry Cavill is the man...Superman!",1
324,"To watch my video review for this film click this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flmJFT_Gx6g The film is about whether Superman will be accepted for what he is on earth. The conflict in the film derives from the survival of either earth or Superman’s own species. General Zod is determined to save his own race from extinction even if that means destroying the human race. Despite the bullying and the secrecy that he has had to endure, Superman ultimately chooses the place he has grown up over his own race.You may recognise Michael Shannon from the Boardwalk Empire and I was surprised to see him fill such a big role in this film as General Zod. His character once again was one with strong beliefs and I think he carried out his role fairly well. Henry Cavel feels and looks right as Superman. However, it’s the performances of Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe that really stand out for me. I’m not usually a massive fan of flashbacks throughout a film but in this case they really work and they illustrate well the relationship between Superman and his father on Earth played by Kevin Costner. Crowe delivered dramatic lines such as,  how, he will be a god to them” perfectly and seeing Coster as Superman’s adopted father sacrifice himself to keep Superman’s secret was one of the most heartfelt moments in a film that I have seen in a while and was certainly a highlight. This is where I think the film really delivers, in the relationships between Superman and those around him, from his biological father to his lover Louis Lane.For me, the action in the film was a bit repetitive and consisted mainly of Superman and the bad guys flying into one another and into buildings. I couldn’t help but think what’s the point in them endlessly hitting each other and flying into one another if it clearly does no damage.  However, I realise that you should probably expect that in a Superman film and it did mean that they could show off some lovely special effects. Another small  gripe I have with the film is that there were plenty of opportunities in this film for those slick and funny one liners but unfortunately for the most part they failed to grasp them. Lines such as “where did you learn to fight, on a farm?”, didn’t really pack the punch they needed to.  There was certainly more room for humour such as at the end when the woman giggles and says, “well it’s just that he’s kinda hot”. But the script didn’t give Henry Cavel the opportunity to show a witty side of Superman and was therefore portrayed as being very serious.Overall though I think that the film was great and a successful reboot of the franchise. Director Zack Snyder brought through the emotions of the film brilliantly and it delivered everything that you expect from a superhero film. My sister loved it and she’s not usually a massive fan of these types of films which I think illustrates its appeal. I have a pretty strict scale when it comes to rating films. Rotten Tomatoes gave this film 56% and IGN gave it a pretty impressive 9/10 but I’m going to go in between the two and give this a 7.8/10.",1
325,Man of steel is a phenomenal composition. The critics are bitter and always appreciate drama and nothing more. Zack Snyder had a phenomenal vision. He did his very best to create a new superman  for the up and coming generation. It was perfect to see Superman in a different suit and more clean looking.,1
326,"What a great movie!!! Henry Cavill plays the best Superman ever, he has the look, the demeanor, the right attitude and emotion.  He conveys the emotional turmoil of Superman's actions with stunning effect.  The action is beyond top-shelf and care was taken to provide a ""realistic"" portrayal of Kryptonian strength.  When Superman punches an enemy, he does not just fall down, or get knocked into a car and leave a dented door.  He is sent through three buildings and a concrete parking garage.  If Superman falls into a mountain, he doesn't just make a small crater, he takes the mountaintop off.  The true strength and power of Superman is finally done justice and portrayed as it always should have been. The character is re-imagined and remade to bear more relevance to today than 1940.  Superman is feared by the military, just like a real-life alien would be.  Krypton is not portrayed as a lifeless chunk of ice, but as a living, breathing world meeting its end. Special effects are dazzling.  You can feel every impact, even almost experience the sensation of flight (seen in the NYC IMAX theater with a screen 8 stories tall).  Like his strength, his speed is portrayed accurately and effectively.  You can tell Superman can fly at nearly the speed of light by just observing the convincing special effects. Some may say the ending is controversial, but anyone that really knows Superman will know that it is not.  His actions at the end are consistent with his comic book history and even actions he had taken in prior films. Not only one of the best super hero movies ever made (only the Dark Knight trilogy ranks on par), but one of the best movies ever made. Period.",1
327,"Finally a fantastic superman movie. Good story, great actors, crazy visual fx and action scenes. I knew that Snyder plus Nolan people could not go bad. They really know how to make the things deal together. Can't wait for the number 2.",1
328,"Man of Steel is the Superman movie we've been waiting for! As someone that has seen the past Superman films, this film is for the new generation! But, as some told me. ""This is not grandfather's Superman!"" This movie the beginning of the DC cinematic universe, and it has a great plot and has humor! What I have at the cinema's is that all generations are embracing this just like they did with Batman in 2005 with Batman Begins! Now it's time for Superman to get his moment in the sun! Go see this movie!",1
329,"Best movie that I paid to see since Avatar. Some of the scenes even remind me of Avatar. The action was intense, the actors were very good, some of the scenes were very touching, I really love the Krypton scenes and how David wrote it as being a planet like Pandora and also some Star Wars mixed in. Paid a lot of homage in my opinion to Smallville the TV series. I think I will go see it again.",1
330,Everything wrong with Superman Returns has been righted with Man of Steel. We get to see Supe punch the hell out of Zod and his cronies and we get a more interesting back story. Character development is as good as you can expect for a comicbook adaptation but overall the action sequences steal the show. Triumphant return for Superman. Just wish Zod had asked him to kneel.,1
331,"Despite what most 'reviews' are saying this is easily one of the best science-fiction/superhero movie ever made. Finally a superman movie that was done right, as close as it can get to the origin story and portrayed the way it should be. Yes, it may not be perfect (nothing is) but this one movie has set the wheel in motion for all the good things to come and I cannot wait what Snyder, Goyer has up their sleeves in the next installment and as far as Justice League is concerned. Yes, it may have gone the full drama route to develop the characters further, and in doing so that would leave the movie little time to dish out all the crazy good battle scenes. I felt Snyder and co did a great job balancing between narration and action sequence quite well. It is well paced for a 2 hours 30 minutes movie. I do not think I would have this movie in any other way, I know I will be going back to see this a couple of more times before my thirst for the epic reincarnation of the daddy of all superhero is quenched. This is the Superman movie we needed, for this time, for this and the generations to come. Similar to the way Reeves did for most of us old timers back in the eighties.",1
332,"Loved it! I'm not usually a supes fan but this had me the whole film. I wasn't bored for a single second and I honestly couldn't see a single negative about the film that seems to have divided most critics. I actually felt far more emotionally involved with this film than any of the new Marvel films.Specifically I was worried about the religious undertones in this film and that it would have classic Zak Snider empty characterisation, but I think Nolan has had a really positive effect on Zak, This is by far the most interesting Superman and Zod is just pure cool.Loved it all and was definitely one of those ""I could go straight back into the cinema and watch it again"" movies.",1
333,"Man of Steel was amazing! The way the past was worked into the movie was perfect. I enjoyed seeing the struggles Clark had growing up and how they shaped him becoming the man he was and ultimately the final fight scene so emotional. I enjoyed Henry Cavill's performance as Superman and even though I grew up with Christopher Reeves, this is the Superman I always envisioned. The action sequences were absolutely amazing. The fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat, they were tough and at times brutal and ultimately just delivered what I had hoped to see out of this movie. Michael Shannon was fantastic as Zod but his female side-kick almost stole the show. Amy Adams as Louis Lane was probably my least favorite character, not because she is a bad actress and does horrible, I just have a hard time picturing her as Louis. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were perfectly cast and I love they signed on for what could be considered minor parts. This is definitely one of those the critics got wrong. They have some legitimate critiques of the Man of Steel but I don't think enough weight has been given to its strengths which are many. If you listen to the critics this time around you are depriving yourself of an awesome entertainment experience. Go see it!",1
334,"One of the most AMAZING movies i've seen in my live, i cried when i watched at cinema, fight sequences are EPIC!!! Dont listen Critics bad reviews, they ",1
335,"After the Superman Returns (2006) I had strong doubts that anyone would be able to properly make a Superman movie. Superman is a really powerful superhero and in portraying him properly many film makers make mistakes. However, Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have managed to accomplish this. Man of Steel is a well balanced movie that captures the emotional depth of the Superhero and unlike the (2006) movie delivers magnificently on the action as well. Do not miss it.",1
336,"Man of Steel is truly an achievement. Zack Snyder took an impecable cast, a classic character and turned it into the loudest, most exciting film he could make that felt like the best Superman comic literally come to life. The origin story was paced brilliantly through well segued flashback sequences to get a sense of what life was like growing up for our hero without dwelling on upwards of an hour of footage that would have acted as an extended montage. The true accomplishment with this film I found was still in the level of feeling like a comic in the sense that not everything needed to be shown. Snyder played to the intelligence of the viewer and the ability to infer. We weren't needed to show in great detail why Kal trusts Lois, you just feel it in their interactions (which likely extend far beyond what is shown on screen). Virtually everyone cast in this film owns their respective role. Cavill's brooding longing to understand who he is, Amy Adams' fierce determination drives her character, Michael Shannon is intimidating, and desperate and Antje Traue demonstrates the most demonic sense of superiority that she truly is terrifying in the role of Faora. This is by far the best looking film so far this year, the action sequences are exciting to look at and well choreographed and the use of long shots really add to the powerful atmosphere of the film. Man of Steel is, as previously stated, a cinematic achievement that is more than worthy of the Superman brand.",1
337,"I think the flaws in this movie were exaggerated. I did not see anything majorly wrong with this film. Henry Cavill was destined to be Superman. Man of Steel is, in my opinion, the best Superman movie made.",1
338,"I don't exactly know what other people watched but I think this is a great movie! If you want thought provoking drama movies, go to the sundance festival or some such! This movie is supposed to be action and it delivers! This is how superman fights should be! I will watch the sequel if it comes out.",1
339,"Hands down this was the BEST MOVIE of the summer and best SUPERMAN move ever! Don't listed to the NEGATIVE Critics that are probably getting paid to dumb down this movie....it was spectacular! Best graphics, Best acting, edge of your seat entertaining. I plan to take the whole family to see it again, this time we are going to see it in 3D!",1
340,"Good movie, but fans of comics should be aware that this is slightly different interpretation of the well-known stories. The only thing that upsets  is an abundance of special effects. Sometimes you want to say, ""Whoa, wait. I do not understand what's going on."". A start. I hope they can bring the franchise to a new level, more than just a summer blockbuster.",1
341,"I've never been a Superman fan despite being a lover of all things superhero related. This film is a little patchy as it seems a directors cut would be great on DVD. The origin feels a little rushed as there seems to be no real connection to becoming Superman, it just happens. After the patchy first 40 minutes we're left with pure action. Personaly I enjoyed the film despite its flaws & I have a feeling the sequal will be amazing.",1
342,"I got high hope for the movie after I witnessed how Nolan accomplished for Batman franchise. The movie is great, I must say. But it got multiple rough edges. My actual score is 7.8.I don't think the superman is too serious. He is funny enough in another way, like a normal human. He  is optimistic, helpful, just like what a great person should be. The movie also reached my expectation on the stance of delivering emotion. The movie truely showed me the conflict in Clark about being normal or unusual.However, my first complain about the movie is the performance of some characters. Take Zod as an example, he never showed any sort of emotion. He was just shouting about how he love his people. I believe the movie wants to squeeze a little bit more from him but failed. General Zod and his people are like bad guys with BAD on their faces.Second is some of the plot made no sense. Why Zod wants Louise aboard? Why there's a control plug-in in her supposed jail? Why their ships' control is that easy to be overwritten? Why Zod is that easy to be killed even after he takes off his armor? It feels like the good guys were hacking to win.The third is the fighting scenes are way too chaotic even on Superman's stance. With the help of Bourne-like shaky camera and half-ass 3D effect, my eyes hurt a little. The fighting sequences are always like ""Superman shut up, he gets hit; Superman shout, he wins.""Overall, the movie worth the tickets, and I'm highly recommended it to DC fans and guys who want to see a blockbuster to kill some time. But I don't think it will be as memorable as Dark Knight Trilogy after couple of years.",1
343,"the first part of the film is a bit clueless but the second part starts with a quarter turn and can not be stoppedfor me the film is really good but I was expecting something amazing  but what I saw wasn't rotten but the film was a film that mixed superman and 2012but otherwise good work snyder and nolan",1
344,"I been waiting for a perfect superman my whole lifeand yes i got to see it in Man of steelThe story was perfect. this is exactly how one should say a superman storyitss just perfectthe movie had everything from emotions to actionsi give  a 10 on 10 for this movieand waitng to watch it the 5th time in theatre",1
345,"By far the best movie for the year 2013. Critics: this is a newer version of the superman, its not a remake but its a reboot to the franchise. It does not necessary have to be in line with all the previous movies or the comic. Way better than Avengers or even iron man.Awesome, Legendary & Epic!!!!",1
346,"A more human Superman hasn't been seen on the big screen yet. And even though Clark Kent is a man who knows himself, Superman is still learning how to be a super hero.Even though it is an origins movie, it feels epic, and the battles are truly of comic book scale.Henry Cavill is excellent all across the board; the visual effects are beautiful, and the destruction is of huge proportions.However, there are many weak points that prevent the movie from being perfect: Goyer's screenplay is, again, full of plot holes; the Krypton sequence is highly nonsensical, and Zod is quite shallow, specially in comparison to Terrence Stamp's role and performance in Superman 2.But the movie's strong points are very strong, and Christopher Nolan's touches can be felt all over the experience, which makes it a story deserving of the man of steel.",1
348,"Man of Steel is a great return for Superman. Great in many aspects and particularly in the beginning half where the back-story is explained. Acting here is good in some parts, bad in others. Everyone except Lois Lane was fine considering this is an interpretation of superman, not a translation. What I thought was unbelievable is Lois Lane and Superman falling for each other. A crush is plausible but Superman is here, there and everywhere. So how can a crush turn into love when he's hardly around Lois to develop anything? Story is also quite good except, again, Lois Lane appearing and going to places she'd never get near. The emotional content around what happens to Krypton is very, very good. A superhero movie that focuses on emotion, story, spectacle, and enjoyment is what I wanted out of this. It delivers.",1
349,"I had low expectations going into ""Man of Steel"" given the mediocre reviews (57% on RottenTomatoes) and Zack Snyder's track record that started to look a bit like M. Night Shyamalan's. After his break-out debut with the ""Dawn of the Dead"" re-make and followed by the eye-popping ""300,"" he started to stumble with the mind-bending ""The Watchmen,"" a cartoon movie about owls, and the disposable ""Sucker Punch."" But I was hopeful given the guiding hand of producer/screenwriter Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer. Man of Steel was a pleasant surprised and vigorously entertaining. Russell Crowe nearly resurrects his Gladiator greatness as Kal-El's/Clark's/Superman's reserved but badass father on Krypton. The deeper dive into the chapter of Krypton's demise is absolutely captivating with the addition of a ton of science fiction elements. Instead of re-treading Superman's back-story on earth which has been covered abundantly already, the use of flashbacks between the adult and young Clark works really well. Henry Cavill as Superman does a decent job switching from brooding to giddy to serious, although when he's not in his suit his sculpted body looks totally unreal. Amy Adams as Lois Lane plays the part of a strong female lead well while putting the character, as always, in completely ridiculous situations requiring the classic save by Superman. Michael Shannon from HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" is solid as the maniacal and ethnocentric General Zod. Unfortunately, the movie falls into tedium and redundancy during the ""smash-things"" climax where Superman and Zod (and his minions) do 20-times more smashing and destruction than all of ""The Hulk"" movies combined. The Avengers smash-things climax was even longer (I think) but 20-times more entertaining because they smashed things in very different ways. There is a limit to how many times you can watch invincible beings get hurled through buildings. Ultimately, even these flaws can't diminish a well-crafted reboot of the oldest super hero of all time. Zack Snyder may have just got his mojo back.",1
350,"This movie is AMAZING.The backstory is great as well as the story,it is very emotional in some parts and has some on the best effects I have ever seen in a movie theater.",1
351,Super Amazing and Super Intense. The movie was great but there were some parts that didn't make sense like the part when superman healed lois with his heat vision. It had so much action that it was really hard to remember the story. It also showed way to many flashbacks the entire movie. To me it kind of felt like a remake of superman 2. Its a must see film for all the DC comic fans like myself.,1
352,"The critics are funny....  A superhero or comic book adaptation will never seem to have the plot that most of your run-of-the-mill critics will enjoy. If you're looking for Eat-Pray-Love then this is not the movie for you. It's a must for an legitimate comic book fan that has a great balance of plot, storyline and incredible action.  Henry Cavill does a solid performance of playing the humble Superman but a great hero needs a great villian.  General Zod (MIchael Shannon) and his second command Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) do a great job in the battle scenes, plot and dialogue. I'm not sure where they go from here as movie almost leaves no idea on where it might go next (Luthor?) but as long as Nolan and Snyder are at the helm then I'll be in line to see the movie.",1
353,"(More of a 9.5) Awesome movie, critics are just being stupid. They believe this movie is too dark but its not. If you were to put superman in the situations he's been growing up, this is how it would be. Acting was amazing and story was very well written. Characters had so much layers to them, which made it all the better. The script is probably hands down one of the best. The gems in the script bring smiles to your face. Critics just don't understand this movie. I forgot about one thing, THE ACTION! The action scenes in the movie are far by one of the best I've ever seen. SO, PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE! It's amazing.",1
354,"Long story short, Man of Steel was a fantastic film with a lead that could hold his own on screen, brilliant supporting cast, amazing score, intense fight scenes and a story to hold everything together. Seeing as how The Dark Knight made itself more than just a comic book movie by making itself almost drama is the easiest way to put it when Man of Steel made itself just as believable but with science fiction and drama.  This ""first contact"" type of story being told will make it extremely easier to introduce the DC universe so time will tell. Needless to say movie tickets are freakishly expensive and god forbid you're watching a 3D version but i without a doubt would pay to see this again.",1
355,"Great Movie, Excited to see where they go with the sequels. I just wish they would have made Superman more vocal and emotionally connected with the audience in order for everyone to embrace him and cheer for him more in his moment of triumph. Good Job!",1
356,Epic Movie...just epic frame by frame...this movie takes us back to the days wer our elders enjoyed the flash n others..n the biggest action spectacular...thanks to zack and Weta digital....so we got ourselves our superman back.......its finally time believe a man can fly....,1
357,"Man of Steel is one of the most awesome spectacles in recent years. Words cannot express how truly impressed and riveted I was in the theater. All my expectations were blown away. Each and every character was solid, realistic and well developed.Some critics have gone on record to say the MOS has no heart, is too loud, is an incoherent mess, or is without any shred of a plot. They did not go to Man of Steel to see a Superman movie. That went to rite a scathing review, because they can. Critics are critical because it gets them noticed. There is always someone who wants to tear things down. And who has farther to fall than Superman?That said, Man of Steel is an over-the-top, full blown, this is what a hero really is thrill-ride. Man of Steel flies high, and critic know jack nothing.",1
358,"full of heart, Fun, fast pace, and over the top action. In a few words but i am not allow to be that short. It's not your Grand dad's Superman but he is still the good guy you want to root for in the end.",1
359,"o melhor filme de herois de todos os tempos, na visão de fã de hqs e filmes de herois.o zack realmente fez uma obra prima, e conseguiu levar o superman para o seculo 21.com otimas cenas de ação e uma boa historia do david goyer, completa esse epico que vai ficar marcado por muitas gerações",1
360,The best comic book movie since 2008's TDK. Cavill is Superman and the rest of the cast played their parts perfect. Good story and the action came at the right time.,1
361,"A strong and solid Superhero Origins movie, may not be the absolute masterpiece of the genre but is one of the best beginning. Man of Steel is in line with Nolan's Batman Begins or Sam Raimi's Spider-man, and while being not very much better than the first Iron Man is indeed more epic, more human, more deep and more BIG. What is less: is less witty, less funny and less rich of humor wich is really bad! (Straczinsky's Superman: Earth One has a lot to teach about!) What is more than any other movie: this Man of Steel is more concerning the true meaning of superheros than any other movie and than ALL other movies together we have seen during the last 3-4 years. The Greatest Superhero has finally returned.",1
362,"Such an AMAZINGLY AWESOME experience not just a movie. Thanks to all who were involved in bringing us the people, the consumer, the fans  those that truly do matter (unlike the typical negative critic everyone knows is just starved for attention.) such a world class film. I look very forward to more ""Man of Steel"". The bar hasn't been raised, it's been flown into the stratosphere. Not just an epic comic book movie but as a whole one of the best movies I've witnessed.",1
363,"Man of Steel, where do I start.  How about the beginning?  The movie starts with great science fiction.  A mother is at a loss as she gives up her son, and then concedes her life as the world dies.  Much more dramatic than what I'm typing. Clark, Mr Anon, is traveling America and trying to help where he can.  He does when an oil rig decides to go all fire and explosives, and only Clark can help save the people trapped.  He helps, it's awesome. Lois and Clark meet, and it's well done.  Many small nods to 75 years of canon.  I was extremely impressed by the knowledge of the writers.  Seriously.  This is the story we've been waiting for since I became able to read comics.  This movie tells the real story, and isn't a fluff piece that warms the heart, but instead shows that great power can be followed by a good person.  Superman could have been a jerk, he has complete free will, but he doesn't...I could explain more on that, as he does show a glimpse of his arrogance when talking to his father before the tornado storm.... Superman's fights were epic.  These were for us fans.  Seriously.  You don't put those out there for the critics, you put those out there for the fans.  The critics will think its too much unnecessary violence, because the critics don't really understand Zod's one mindedness and desire to crush the last El. Ah well, I'm tired, but loved the movie.  I plan on seeing it again.",1
364,As expected from  the duo of Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder..this was an amazing piece of movie making talent...the actors did their job well...David S. Goyer's work on screenplay was seen by all...and adds a lot to the totality of this movie's presentability...The makers have to be given the credit for presenting Superman in the way it should always 've been...A big thumbs up for no Underwear on pants and just wear a specs to hide ur identity..Man of Steel does complete justice to our Fav superhero..The vision of a person's struggle with his own identity...and what he he finally does..is absolutely stunning & beautiful..though at times it lacked momentum which was dealt with...Those giving -ve reviews...should consider the fact that this was just the first movie of a series...There's a lot more to come....giving a hope for better superhero movies......This movie stand true to the 'S' symbol of hope!!,1
365,"Great performances all around and some of the best effects I've seen in any comic book film. This is the Superman movie I've wanted to see for a long time. Henry Cavil gives a breakout performance while Russell Crowe gives us the best version of Jor-El I've ever seen in film, comics or otherwise. And make no mistake, this movie is all about Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El. I was very happy the filmmakers didn't attempt to just remake the Richard Donner films of the 70s and 80s. That was tried in 2006's Superman Returns to much critical acclaim and not much in the way of box office numbers. MoS really gives us an in-depth picture of who Clark Kent is, not so much in his dialog, but in his actions and sometimes inaction. From the time he's a kid to the time he's an adult he's faced with some really tough decisions. That's a running theme of this film and, yes, it's a familiar one: With great power, comes great responsibility. Is it an old trope? Sure, but it's still relevant to the superhero conversation. Unlike Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, this movie takes a darker world and puts a modern Superman in it. Is the movie gritty? Not really. There are plenty of dark characters and moments, but Superman himself (along with Lois Lane, Perry White, The Kents and especially Jor-El) gives off great amounts of hope. The world around them seems harsh and cynical, but there is a light in the darkness. Unlike Batman, Superman makes the decision to step out of the shadows and make himself known. Granted, there wasn't much choice in the matter, but when push comes to shove, this Superman makes the choice he feels is right, even when it takes a tremendous emotional toll on him. I usually don't like a lot of time spent on Krypton when it comes to Superman films or TV shows, but this movie actually made that part seem interesting. It even works in some cool effects and action, which was very unexpected. Is the movie perfect? Of course not, there's no such thing as a perfect film. Amy Adams shows so much potential to be the best on-screen Lois Lane there's ever been, but she doesn't get enough development in this movie to show us that completely. Kevin Costner gives such a tear-inducing performance, you can't help but feel his part was underwritten. Same with Diane Lane's Martha Kent, but at least that lady gets to be a real firecracker in one scene I'm going to remember as one of the all-time greats from any superhero film. Lawrence Fishburne just barely scratched the surface of his Perry White, but he's definitely the right choice for the role. Way better than what we got in Superman Returns. This Perry White is a take-charge, hard-news man. And he gets his own hero moment when things get really crazy toward the end. The humor in the movie is kept to a lower level than the Richard Donner films, but that's to its benefit in my view. Campy humor can be lots of fun and is in the Donner films. I love Otis probably more than any person should. But, for the modern screen, that type of things just doesn't work. Especially not if DC/Warner Bros. is really planning to compete with Marvel/Disney. Still, a sequel (now pretty much inevitable) could use with a little more comic relief. Not a ton, but that's where some good banter between Clark and Lois might help, along with maybe the introduction of Jimmy Olsen. But if the story/acting/effects don't give you chills, I don't see how Hans Zimmer's score could do anything less. One of the best movie scores of the last decade, possibly ever. I'm one of those people that liked Iron Man 3. I say that as a preface to this: I LOVED Man of Steel! It's certainly going to divide the fans as it has the critics, but I think this is the way to go for cinematic DC Universe. I can't wait to see where this leads next.",1
366,"Man of Steel was a great film. There was the origins of the hero's life, intense builds and tons and tons of insane action sequences. The film really showed just how heroic and powerful Sherman can really be, with enough seriousness and geekyness for an awesome fanboy joyride.",1
367,"This is by far the best Superman movie. And one of the best superhero films. It's not perfect; there are some plot holes, the fight scenes are a little long and it's put together a little choppy. None the less; the casting is fantastic, the music is top notch, the story is compelling and the action is intense. I left the theatre with tears of joy and an excitement for the future of Superman films.",1
368,"Having seen the poor scores posted by the critics here on Metacritic I honestly thought this was going to be a really poor and lackluster affair. Fortunately, for me at least, this was not the case. I loved the references to Batman, Lex Luthor and to a much lesser extent Aquaman. All in all I thought it was a fantastic film. I'd advise people not to judge this film by the score the critics have given it. Man of Steel, at the time of writing this review is sitting at 55 while Fast and Furious 6 is sitting at 61. Having seen both ""Man of Steel"" and ""Fast and Furious 6"" I find this strange to say the least. It's most definitely the last time I trust a ""critic"" to judge a film for me.",1
369,"MoS es una película donde se ve claramente el estilo ya marcado de David.S.goyer con el inicio justificando las motivaciones de Superman y esos falsos clímax. La única actuación que no me convenció fue la madre alienigena que al ver a su esposo muerto, tardo en reaccionar. No le doy 10 por problemas con el montaje, el inicio es confuso, y esos saltos entre presente y pasado hace que la historia no la termina de asimilar, he incluso la transición entre escenas es inmediata perdiéndome por no saber cuanto tiempo ha pasado  Con respecto a Louis Lane, es un personaje creíble, intrépida como son los periodistas y con una excelente personificación por parte de Amy Adams, pero en el guion por tratar de ponerla como protagonista queda en situaciones forzadas, ella es humana, no puede estar en todas partes. Como por ejemplo cuando la gente de Zod se la lleva al espacio sin justificación y cuando en la pelea final, luego de Superman y Zod pelear por toda la ciudad, alejándose por km de donde empezaron, Louis llega a los minutos al sitio. El hecho de planificar la película como un unitario fue lo que hizo que fuera extensa tratando de abarcar toda la historia, por lo que fácilmente se puede dividir la película en dos, una donde muestra a Jor-El luchando por sacar a su hijo de Krypton y la infancia de Kal-El y la otra donde por fin vemos que Zod amenaza a la tierra. El papel de Crowe que pensábamos que seria olvidado luego de su muerte tiene una importancia incluso mayor que las que tuvieron los padres adoptivos. Shannon hace de villano espectacularmente, sera todo un reto conseguir un villano más fuerte que él para la 2da entrega. Los padres adoptivos de Clark- Kent entre salto y salto en el montaje hace que se pierda su objetivo que es ser la parte nostálgica y reflexiva de la película. Cavill como Superman mostró un gran carisma que Routh no pudo lograr en Superma Return.   La maldición de Superman se ha roto! Creo que puliendo estos detalles( un montaje más ordenado, Lane en situaciones propias a sus limitaciones como humana, consiguiendo un villano cruel) la segunda parte será igual o mejor que The Dark Knight",1
370,Man of Steel is a great summer movie that makes up for all the action and spectacle not seen in Superman Returns. All of the characters are great and performances. The action is a lot of fun and Snyder's visuals are of coarse stunning. Hans Zimmer's score is PHENOMENAL! Man of Steel has a little choppy editing but nonetheless is still a great Superman film. Man of Steel: A-,1
371,Man of Steel=The GREATEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!! Best Movie this Year Overall. I was waiting for something like this for so many years and finally we have it!,1
372,"Amazing action, wonderfully put together and a joy to watch .Brings Superman straight into the 21st century! Cant wait to watch it again! I'm a massive Superman fan, and wasnt that impressed by Singer's 2006  Superman, and ultimatly, thought he would fall behind as the worlds favorite Superhero. But this film has restored my faith and is a rip-roaring ride! Wonderful!!!",1
373,Finally the Superman movie I have been waiting for my whole life. People who rated this low where hoping to find something that just doesn't need to be exist in order for this movie to please. You will never be able to enjoy the older superman movies after watching this. Literally the most amazing super hero fight scenes in cinema to-date! it makes the avengers final battle look like a school yard fight in comparison.,1
374,"The best superhero and action movie ever launched at theaters. With the action,effect, and the epic scene on the big screen. Better than the avengers. Can't wait for the sequel",1
375,"Action was superb and the effects were as good as any I've seen, if not better.  A small concern though is the lack of thought concerning all the damage done by the fight.  Superman cares about that sort of thing and it wasn't highlighted too much in this film.",1
376,"Despite what others wanted. I have been waiting for a superman movie that was willing to go darker and violent then its previous attempts. Though this movie was far from perfect it was very enjoyable and truly showed what kind destruction someone  of this magnitude can cause. I find it comical that some critics are upset that its to serious and not loaded with humor like the Avengers. Its a directors vision of how he wants  the movie why should be follow suit of previous superman movies.  I found a few scenes funny so maybe its just their humor that needs readjusting. The movie really focuses a lot on Kal-El  internal struggles accepting who he is and his powers. This movie shows some emotional depth in the man of steel, we finally get to see how he really struggled and that he truly is not perfect like everyone complains about. Ultimately he is faced with a decision that changes him into the Superman we all know and love. I went into the movie with very high hopes and this movie did not fail to deliver. Its not going to win an oscar but will keep you glue to the edge of your seats and Superman fans will find it a treat.",1
377,"the man of steel is the best movie of all the time, including all the marvel movies that are a joke, I recommend this movie because it is very epic, and emocialmente serious. I stole a couple of tears I assure you.",1
378,"We always wished for a Superman movie that was an epic above all.. Man of Steel is that one. Good script and direction, above all the action is just unbelievable.. this will convince you that Superman is not only much more powerful than any human and that he has an attitude too.. when need arises he can break some necks.",1
379,"In all my years I've been waiting for a new superman movie and it finally came. Man of  Steel is one of the greatest hero films ever i am very proud of watching the movie it is really a great story line of telling superman how his struggle in the world to become what people really need him to be the savior of earth. I thank you to Zack Snyder, David S. Goyer, and Christopher Nolan who made this film to put DC back in it's place and to bring back the greatest superhero come to life again. Man of Steel is the perfect movie to watch over and over.  I also would like to thank the cast members of playing their role in Man of  Steel they did a excellent job at being the characters and making this movie happen. What ever critics are saying that man of steel is not a good superman movie they are wrong this movie captured everything including great story details, this is a new generation a new era where superman will once again reign supreme as the greatest superhero on earth and in films.  #1 MAN OF STEEL is GREAT#DC Nation all the way.",1
380,"It's not a great improvement from Superman movies, but ""Man Of Steel"" has some great special effects, is well acted, with a very interesting storyline.",1
381,"This is the Zack-Christopher Masterpiece, combined with Hans Zimmer awesomeness, this movie gives you chills, from the beginning until the end !Don't know what is wrong about the critics on this..",1
382,"To be honest in my humble opinion, the opening sequence on planet Krypton felt so much more fleshed out than the entire Star Trek reboot films. That blew my mind away and got me sold on the whole movie instantly. Man of steel was an emotional ride for me. I found myself tearing up a couple of times during the first act of the film. Credit must go to David Goyer and Snyder for capturing the internal turmoil and strife that Clark Kent faces before accepting his calling to be the beacon of light that guides mankind from becoming extinct like Krypton. The action sequences were a beauty to behold. I was glad there was no use of slow-mo effects that Snyder is infamous for in his other films. I actually can picture Nolan’s universe of batman existing in Snyder’s superman universe. The lack of comedic relief in this 1st outing of man of steel can be forgiven because it was important to get his back story fleshed out for potential sequels. I think by taking a serious and realistic approach to this franchise they can build a solid foundation for JL movie or a World’s Finest movie. What also liked about man of steel was how the “villains” where defined in their motivations. General Zod and Faora’s back stories were really logical enough and added more depth to why they wanted to takeover earth in order to continue Krypton’s existence. Last but not least, Hans Zimmer’s score really pulled the strings in magnifying the scale of this movie. He captured all the emotions you should feel in every scene just by the use of music. Simply amazing! I’m gonna watch again 2moro in Imax 3D because I watched it in 2D only. I have to see planet Krypton in glorious 3D.",1
383,"First of all, i´m a huge superman fanboy, that being said, this movie rocks as far as being a darker version more realistic Superman movie, not the seudo tribute to Richard Donner that was Superman Returns.It´s superman meets The dark knight trilogy. Only complaint i had was the lack of John Williams superb soundtrack, it´s not there and that´s not cool at all, otherwise, it´s f...ing SUPERMAN, THE HERO OF SUPERHEROES.",1
384,This movie had everything this generation loves action thrill it was just suburb. People who liked the old general zod and that movie are just ruining this movie with the bad reviews and I even say next to an annoying guy during the movie and it was so good I still enjoyed it,1
385,"Really enjoyed the movie and it continues a trend of making our super-hero's more human. The one thing I can respect is how the film tries to show the humanity and morality as a key theme. Russell Crowe was great in his role as superman's father, very solid performance. Amy Adams is always nice to see on the big screen and she was more believable than previous Louis Lanes for sure. Must see",1
386,"I don't normally write a superhero movie rant out of fear of showing my true nerdom and societal ridicule but I think it's worth it so here it goes:Man of Steel is one of the most underrated films of this year and you should see it. If you like alien invasion plots, go see this movie. If you like Russell Crow go this movie. If you like Michael Shannon's ridiculous angry face go this movie. If you like people being flung through large grain silos, or flung around in general go see this movie. If you think that anything that Christopher Nolan writes is Gospel,  go see this movie. And most importantly if you want to see a something different in a superhero film, story about exploration, ability, empathy, and humanity, then go see this movie. And then go tell your friends.",1
387,"Story-wise one of the best Superman movies made. It really showed in a great way how Superman's fate started out and how he ends up being Superman on Earth. Thumps up for the great storytelling. Visually the movie is a masterpiece! But sometimes the heavy filled CGI action scenes is way way too long in my opinion. This sadly ruins the story a little, or at least my ability to be fully captivated in the flow of the story. I give this a score of 9 because it really is a great movie! But the sometimes way too long action CGI scenes prevents it for getting a 10 when looking at the full perspective of the movie.",1
388,"I had low expectations from this movie, since the last one was pretty lame.  Well, i really liked it, a lot.  For sure it was COMPLETELY different from Superman 1, with Christopher Reeve.  There is just something about that first movie that this new one did not have, a little more passion, feelings.  What i mean is that this new movie DID NOT give me any goose bumps during the movie whatsoever.  And that is a very bad thing. One thing that killed it for me is that the superman song is not in it.  After the movie ended i was like:  ""What the hell???""  What happened to the superman song, the super hero song???  From what i recall, THAT is what gave me goose bumps in superman 1 as soon as the song began playing for the first time, you know, when superman begins to fly?  Heck, even now after decades when i watch Christopher Reeve's first superman I still gives me goose bumps.  I think the music in the man of steel was not so good, music during a movie matters SOOO MUCH!  Very disappointing for me! Other than that, the fights were awesome, the effects were nice, the cast i liked a lot.  Another thing i liked about this movie is that Henry Cavill is more muscular, definitely helps a super hero look.  I did thought that his hair was too long, again, compared to Christopher Reeve's superman look.   I also liked this movie because i felt as if i was watching the original superman 1 and 2, ""combined"".  Awesome!  What i did not like is the end, the way superman kills general zod, and again, the MUSIC had not too much impact in me.  They HAVE to correct this in the next movie for sure. Over all i really liked the movie, but i think i still like the more recent Star Trek and bat man movies more. One of the reasons why i LOVE the new Star Trek movies is because they started playing the original song, an awesome and classic song.  Some things should just NOT be changed.",1
389,"As a kid I was always more of a fan of Marvel comics, but Man of Steel is my favortite superhero movie outside of the Dark Knight trilogy.  Superman gets a dose of humanity here without getting cheesy or relying on jokey bumbling.  Action is pretty satisfying, rebuilding all those destroyed buildings should help revive the struggling construction sector.",1
390,"It''s pretty funny that this is supposed to be the new grittier, hard edged Superman. This is just more Hollywood hokum   it doesn't even rise to the level of psychobabble. We hear ad naseum that ""you are the chosen one"" and ""I must choose between my people and my adopted people."" What evs supiedupe...this pap is unbelievably shallow. The writers didn't even try.He wears a giant S on his CGI unitard that we learn means ""Hope""  is that hope as in hopey-changy or is that just a team-building T-shirt? Come on, leave some mystery, like the S has some secret Kyptony meaning.This is supposed to be the now generations' movie  yet when people in the street watch the 911 destruction of their city, they stand there with their mouths catch-fly open and don't even pull out a cell phone for a selfie!That's just one of the minor gaping black-hole plotlines. The biggest is that this can't be an origin story when Supie hasn't yet earned street cred  now he's caused Earth a whole pantload of problems and yet no one knows who he is!  He would def be a parriah and run out of town on a rail.Other ridiculous holes include Kevin Costner standing in a tornado without a hair out of place and Amy Adams falling though the atmosphere in a crapstorm of debris and not even a mote of dust on her cheek.The LL character is a major disappointment, no edge at all, in the end just another helpless fem.The boring CGI video game scenes held no drama, who cared  at least the cartoon versions of this character inspired one to root for Supie. I guess 12 year-old boys will find this movie immensely satisfying...not that there's everything wrong with that.",0
391,"I couldn't finish it. The effects are great and Shannon and Crowe were definitely into it, but the storytelling is awful. The movie is clearly rushing towards its precious action sequences that it ends up undermining the entire movie. The pacing is terrible, time skips nonsensical, many plot points don't make sense or serve the plot in any way, character development is awful, and the movie has a bad habit of telling rather than showing. Even during some of the admittedly astonishing part of the movie, I was unmoved and was never awestruck. This movie apes at The Avengers or the Nolan Batman movies and fails at both. It never establishes a coherent tone, and all its action sequences are undermined by poor pacing and storytelling. One of the worst movies I've seen in a while.",0
392,"Instead of trying to make this ""The Dark Knight 2.0"" with the depressingly dark tone and overwhelming focus on the back-stories, Zack Snyder & The Company should have tried a different approach - a more fun and relaxed one would have been welcome.",0
394,"Main thing I loved about the movie was, it was about the ""man"" part of superman instead of the ""super"" part. They spent one and a half hours on establishing the character before engaging him in combat. Didn't rush to show us Superman but spent time on Krypton and in Clark's troubled childhood. Gave us something close to current comic book superman instead of trying to reintroduce 70's Superman like ""Superman Returns"". For me Man of Steel is even better than Superman (1978) and Superman 2 (1980)",1
395,Thus was a great movie the performances were good there were very good fight scenes. I have given the movie a 9 because i think that the movie went on a little long and the use of 3D was not that great but apart from that great movie one of the best of this year,1
396,"Critics got this movie dead wrong. To start off with the cast, They are very good. Cavill was a great pick to play Superman, Crowe was a great pick to play his real father, Shannon was a little rough at first but in the end turned into a satisfying villain, Adams played a solid love interest. The movie is absolutely filled with special effects, The last 40-50 mins of the film revolves around the destroy of a city, The special effects look amazing and I kind of regret not seeing it in 3D. The plot reveals far more back story to Superman then any of the previous Superman films and was pretty solid over all. In the end, Man of Steel is the must see summer action film and I will gladly pre-order it on Blu-ray when it comes out for home release. Go and see this movie, It's amazing.",1
397,"Its a bird, its a plane, no- its a reboot. This makeover is raw steak without the sizzle. For some it may be hard to swallow if you're used to Disney themes. Don't look for the cute puppy scenes to sooth your family with at this film, because the producers/director let the ravenous bulldogs out. Its silently operatic and combined with themes from Inception and Dark Night.  -Derrick G",1
398,"55 from critics? What the hell. This movie deserves while not 10 from 10 but very high mark anyways. This movie is full of action, when I say full I mean REALLY FULL. It is very bright and dynamic summer blockbuster, it has more speciall effects than Transformers alltogether and more action than Crank. It even has plot! Simple plot, but most of blockbusters dont have it at all. I understand drama and art-house lovers may find this movie offending for their sensitive feelings, but I believe they are just a minority from crowd. Definitely worth wachig. I also reccomend critics to rethink their marks.",1
399,"Whatever you do, dont let the reviewers crappy score for the movie miss guide you. Superman Returns has score of 75% by reviewers and we all know how bad that movie was. This movie is at least 2 times the movie superman returns is and trust me when I tell you that the movie will not disappoint.",1
400,"Amazing superman movie,while it could have done with a little bit of light touch still its the superman movie I always wanted. The action was the highlight and man that was amazing.love it,I hope they will continue to give strong action packed movies like this maybe next time with a bit more heart & soul so that it would be perfect.",1
401,"I guess the development of the story is fast, but is visually awesome and a perfect welcome to the century XXI to Superman, I think it fits to this new era.",1
402,"Was a good movie, wish I could see a bit more of everything. Looking forward to Superman man of steel 2 if it being made ^^D Underrated film, really I think this film needs a better metascore.",1
403,"Mature, intelligent, and polished. The planet Krypton chapter was so interesting I could of watched a whole 2 hour movie just in that world. Many familiar faces make a show and it works. Fight scenes are quick and exciting. Certainly worth a franchise reborn.",1
404,"If someone thinks this is a bad movie.. they must be a zombie or a die hard twilight fan because Edward wasn't in it or something like that. I can't honestly remember the last time I have been to a movie and so blown away by a movie like this did. I felt like I needed someone to help hold my arm when the credits were rolling because this movie was so freaking intense and awesome! I don't suggest that you watch this movie.. I'm TELLING you to go see this movie! grab your wife, kids, pet dog sparky and haul a$$ to the theater!",1
405,"This is the Superman movie people have been waiting years for  earnest, not smirking or offering obvious fan service, no camp, no apologizing for the source material at all. The tender moments have true weight and give the viewer a sense for what goes on behind making a Superman  his parents, his friends, his experiences growing up, his view on the world, ranging from the great to the terrible. The villains are introduced as evil yet not moustache-twirling caricatures. There is no fat on this movie, everything has its purpose and every character  even ancillary ones  are given their place in the (Earth's yellow) sun.",1
406,"Man of Steel is nothing short of an action epic. This movie has probably the greatest action I've ever seen. People are complaining about the action, but really, do you want another Superman Returns?! This movie has good character development through a series of flashbacks featuring the key moments in Clark's past, that make him the man he is today. This is Superman like we've never seen him before in a movie, there's no Clark Kent fumbling round the offices of the Daily Planet (I'm sure that will be in the sequel) but instead there is a man on a mission to discover who he really is, where he came from and what his purpose is in life. The opening scene to Man of Steel got me fully invested into the film, the action kicked off straight away and set up the villain for the rest of the film. General Dru Zod is one fantastic villain for the first film in a hopefully long franchise, he was menacing, fierce, but had reason behind his cruel and violent actions. The performances in this film were brilliant. Henry Cavill is the best Superman but on the screen so far, yes I said it, Christopher Reeve was a fun Superman, may he rest in peace, but this Superman is a character you want to root for, to save the world at the end of the movie. Henry Cavill really gave Kal-El depth and emotion, and I hope he stays on as Superman for a long time to come. Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kal-El's biological father, was a very some very good casting, a big improvement from Marlon Brando. Amy Adams was a good Lois Lane, although I believe they should have saved the Lois and Clark relationship for the sequel, it felt quite rushed in this film, but what women wouldn't fall in love with a flying man who just saved the world. Michael Shannon is a very good General Zod, he is menacing enough for the audience to fear him, but gives the character depth and reason behind his actions, and at some times even makes us sympathize with Zod. Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent gave some great emotional scenes and gave some great lessons to Clark about who he is going to grow up to be. The CGI was fantastic in the movie and the excessive use of it did not take me away from the movie at all. All round I do believe this Superman is the best we've ever had, the performances are great, the score is miraculous, Zack Snyder's direction for this is pleasing and the pacing of the movie is great! You can definitely see Christopher Nolan in parts of this film. David S Goyer's script is fantastic with little hidden gems like Lois' line 'Welcome to the planet' which had me smiling like an idiot. And keep a watchful eye DC fans, for those subtle easter eggs to other villains and characters in the DC universe. Ii am very pleased with Zack Snyder's take on Superman, and I hope he stays on as director for future movies. I only had a few issues with Man of Steel, and believe me they are few. For one, a line that a women soldier says at the end of the film 'I don't know, I just think he's kind of hot'. Seriously, what is that?! There is one scene that should have been changed to a more emotional and character building scene rather than just Superman fighting mechanical tentacles. And the relationship between Lois and Clark should have been saved for the sequel, because as I said before it felt rushed. Overall I think Man of Steel is one fantastic movie, the best of the summer so far, and the best of the year. I'm giving Man of Steel a 4.5/5.",1
407,"Few people failed to appreciate that this is, by far, the best Superman movie. They can always be dissatisfied if they choose to instead of just enjoying and appreciating a film from its positive outlook versus the opposite. Opinions are drawn from either spectrum just like how one views a glass filled with water. I'm one of those who﻿ sees things half-filled instead of half-empty. This review will attempt to point out the commonest complaints from dissatisfied critics & disappointed moviegoers. Hope this would help:1.) The most common complaint was the ""disaster porn"", the total annihilation of the fictional city, Metropolis. We assume that with total destruction, there also were countless lives sacrificed, right? Not exactly. During Supe & Zod's battle, one will noticed that the﻿ city wasn't filled with everyday working people & that is because majority stayed home heeding government's warning due to the earnestness of the matter (about this newly revealed threat to mankind) ergo it's fair to conclude that the number of casualties was under control & not in direct ratio to the amount of property damage. Daily Planet's employees need to be there to cover the news.2.) The Flashbacks. Understandably, some people don't like this editing approach. They find it tedious & annoying. But for many of us, they didn't really bother that much. It was a good thing, being artfully done, that Zack Snyder & team made the conscious effort to veer away from Donner's SUPERMAN films. For a second there, we cringed in our seats from the expectation that we were gonna be treated with a John Williams-like fanfare of an introduction complete with title credits as baby Kal-El's spaceship hurtles down to earth. It was actually a refreshing change.3.) Flat, Bland & Humorless---There's no chemistry between Henry Cavill & Amy Adams. Critics doesn't have to look away from that seemingly ""unromantic"" kiss. Any damsel in distress who has fallen, not once but twice, from the sky (not building) & got saved by the same flying ""knight in shining armor"" would definitely fall for her hero & give him that deserving kiss. Lois wanted to the first time it happened but Superman, in urgency to get to his mother, left before she could. Now ladies, wouldn't you do the same thing & let opportunity pass the second time around? The result of the litmus paper test for the chemistry between Cavill's Clark & Adams's Lois could not be fairly assessed in this first installment but in the next one since their romance was not the emphasis of the storytellers here. The central subject was Clark's search for his real identity hence leading the filmmakers drawing a theme of seriousness by deliberately keeping the whole atmosphere seemingly under-wraps dark & humor-in-check mysterious to make certain this come across believable especially that it involves the enigmatic question, ""Are we alone in the universe?"" Adam's Lois Lane character as the investigative reporter becomes the viewers' cursor as we keep track with her how Cavill's turn as Clark Kent become the Man of Steel. Not following Donner's ta-da treatment, this sensible approach in introducing our hero was timely brilliant & worked well for Snyder.4.) Lame--Jonathan Kent's ""Maybe"" answer to Clark's argumentative query & why he can't show his power & save lives like he used to in the old comic books. This is Superman 2013 & it's about time to upgrade him to this era. If his costume gets an update, why not his origin story as well. right? A little modification won't do no harm as long as it's grounded on logic & not stray too far away from the lore. Jonathan Kent's throw-caution-to-the-wind answer was just parental banter. Smart audiences understood it very well. Though not verbally expressed, Kevin Costner's Pa Kent character would really rather have those kids saved than left to die. The situation has become uncontrollable signalling that it was high time for them to reveal who Clar﻿k really was--for him to receive a lesson on subtleties & the importance of staying under the radar. If one is blessed with superpowers, should one flaunt or hide them? To quote another superhero movie line, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", it is from this cautionary premise that Clark's adopted parents were torn for their juvenile. They knew for the fact that the present government will not hesitate to take this child away from them and for the fear that, in captivity, he would be treated less than being human.5.) Why Lois? This referring to why Zod wanted her along with Supe's surrender. Remember that Lois Lane was rattled off by that fellow media person on TV--that she had knowledge of Kal-El. General Zod, being an advantage-driven military strategist, wanted to know to what extent that knowledge was by probing her mind. It's actually an interesting twist thoughtfully included & not just for the plot. It addresses & brings to mind ""alien abduction phenomenon"" & the things aliens do to their human subjects.",1
408,"This is a DragonBall Z Movie become a Real Movie! Deep and meaningful story, it explained why the Superman need to suit up, why the Kryptonite stone will weaken the man of steel. And the last part of the movie is SUPER ACTION PACKED! Just like DBZ come alive! punching through giant building, destruction and lightning speed fighting! One of the best action scene in recent years!",1
409,"went out with the Mrs to see the latest from Mr Snyder and Mr Nolan and have to say WOW!! as reboots are concerned,well done.the origin of baby Kal-El is fleshed out much more then in past iterations of the story.Superman's father Jo-El is given far more weight story wise.its the Fathers(plural)that do play a bigger role in the formation of Kal's character which i found on of all times,fathers day weekend,rather refreshing.when we do get to see Mr Cavill in blue spandex and cape,the journey he has taken to get to that point,fulfilling his destined role feels far more substantial because of the Jor-el/Kent dynamic.this of course was lost entirely by some of the big mainstream critics,who seemed to focus more on the massive collateral damage of the super fist fights Superman engages in later on in the film.i chalk this up to the jaded sensibilities of people whose world view is steeped in the 1978 film with Christopher Reeve.i find their revulsion at the level of violence and scale of the action rather quaint.this is what i would expect a SUPER-HERO movie to have in it,characters with incredible power at their disposal engaging in urban renewal on a massive scale.for those whom probably have never picked up and read any of the comics back in the day i can understand their trepidation.i just think its silly.i greatly enjoyed the movie for both the story and the spectacle.there are some gaffs performance wise by some of the players in certain spots,but nothing so jarring as to pull you out of the experience.ultimately its what a summer movie has come to be.big,grand,EPIC! and well worth a trip to you're local theater.",1
410,"""Man Of Steel"" was totally entertaining and enjoyable for a fantasy sci-fi action film and as such I give it a 9 of 10.  I like the fresh and different approach to this franchise and hope they continue to expand the upcoming sequels with the same freshness.  I am thinking Henry Cavill has just become a superstar personality and rightly so for he does a fine job as the man of steel.  Worth a look.",1
411,"Man of Steel Was worth the wait, time, and money I dropped to see it.  While Nolan and company may have fell a little short in character development and cheesy lines; Lois Lane having to tell Perry she is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, the story telling and cinematic fair far outweigh what is missing.  It also looks like some of the character development may be left to the sequels which brings me to my next point.  As I was watching the world of Krypton unfold before my eyes and listening the cool history of it narrated to me by Jor-el, all I could think as Kal-el zoomed towards earth was, ""I want more of that!""  The entire world and history of Krypton the way it was depicted could easily have been its own movie a la Prometheus y Avatar.  The only way the story and characters develop into critic approving fair is if this film is broken into at least two or three separate films to build the relationship between audience and characters.  Obviously, that is something critics of Snyder have had for some time.  The more I write this review the more upset I get at the missed opportunities of this piece.  I can visualize a Man of Steel series not unlike Joss Whedon's Firefly series with the awesome Serenity film finale.  Keep the actors, tone, mood everything, just replace the guy behind the camera and the film editors...can you people see it?  Ugh...Speaking of Whedon, if there was a silver lining in the film, it was Snyder's use of camera work in many of the film sequences that were definitely influenced by Whedon.  I was a late comer to Firefly and I caught it last summer on Netflix.  Remember the scene where Serenity is being chased by the Reavers and Wash has to pull some fancy maneuvering to escape?  That camera work was so cool, I must have hit the rewind button a dozen times to keep watching that sequence because I had never seen action shots filmed in a way that I could actually SEE the action and experience it as if I was flying with the ship itself.   Since then, I see that technique used more and more frequently and it never fails to amaze me.  It is so much easier to enjoy and SEE the film instead of seeing a jumble of flashes and letting the synapses of my brain translate what my rods and cones are interpreting.  I may have taken the scenic route to explain this, but Snyder's use of these shots was so much more clear as opposed to watching a Michael Bay film that is all flash and chaos.  OK.  So Man of Steel, though at times a little thin in character development and story telling, is definitely worth the time and money.  I can't wait to see any sequels alone or with the Justice League.",1
412,"This Superman will define this generation. When watching this movie, keep a blank slate. This is not the Superman from three decades ago, the Lois and Clark Superman, or the Smallville Superman, nor should it be. More often than not, critics tend to hang on to their favorite iteration of Superman which causes bias opinions. It's an unfair bias to think of watching this film and expecting to see the goofy bumbling uncoordinated Clark Kent, if so, you'll be disappointed. I had read a review from a critic stating that not once did Superman smile. But, was it necessary for him to do so, knowing that people's lives were at stake and an alien invasion was imminent? For the record, Superman and his alter ego, Clark Kent do crack smile. It is easy for the Superman from the first Donner film to smile. How can he not, when all he needed to do to avert a major disaster was to fly at light speed to reverse the Earth's axis to revert everything back to normal? Spoiler here, this does not occur in Man of Steel and I am glad for that! I was convinced of each actors/actresses role of the characters they portrayed. I was convinced of the character's depth. I bought into the idea that human parents had instilled strong morals and values to an alien that can crush mountains and teach him life is precious. I bought into the idea on Clark's journey to discover his place in the world, as most everyone should be able to relate to this. I understood Zod's motive. I understood, as a leader, why he sought to change the status quo early in the movie. I understood his action was for the betterment of his people. I like the science fiction aspect of the movie. It makes sense to me to tell a story of Superman's birth parents and where they had come from. The science fiction, and the technology incorporated in the story was very well done. I was very happy to see this was explored in the movie. This is the Krypton I had envisioned, an advance society that controlled the population. A theme that resonates from John Byrne's Krypton but differ on how the population was controlled. This film's action scenes are fast paced. Synder has a reputation of using the slowed down camera scenes, like his other film 300, this film is the opposite. I imagine this is how it would be to view super beings as powerful as Kryptonians engage in battle with one other. The fighting scenes were superb and were welcomed by me after an action less film in Superman Returns. If not for the few subplots on the story that did not seem to flow very well with me, I most likely would have given this film a near perfect score but the subplots were minor. All in all, you should watch this film, maybe more than just once.",1
413,"Great movie    This show to us The human side of Superman    Great visual efects, great score, plenty of action!  I saw it in imax and it was amazing!!   Dont bother to see it in 3D not worth your extra bucks",1
414,"I really enjoyed the movie, it was flawed but still super. I didn't like Sucker Punch and was concerned, but I'm pretty happy with this effort. The SF quotient is upped, yes, but for me this is a positive. Huge action scenes, likewise, they need to be super. I hope they give Cavill more (good) dialogue in the sequel, though.",1
415,"Man of Steel is a spectacular film with a villain and an incredible cast, a great story, great effects and this film makes you say'' This is the best film of 2013''.",1
416,"I was three years old when I saw Superman for the first time. I was so captivated that I jumped off the sofa in an ambitious attempt to fly. Of course, I crashed...hard into the side of the coffee table. Four stitches and twenty-nine years later, I remain fascinated by the alien from Krypton. We all know the story of Kal-El. It is one of the most familiar stories in the world. The myth of Superman appears to be trans-cultural and nearly timeless. For some people, that is one of it's greatest strengths. Yet for others, it was it's own kryptonite. It appears that Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan have found a way to make Kal-El invincible once again. Unlike the Donner adaptation, quite a bit of the Krypton background story was infused in ""Man of Steel."" Jor El, Lara, and Zod became more believable. Their struggles were identical to our own. Like us, they struggled with prejudice, racism and hatred. They cling to hope, love, and the desire to survive and thrive. And like us, they are blinded by their ignorance and arrogance. In a sense, they are what could happen to us if we ever lose our grasp on our humanity. Yet hope is preserved from within the infant, Kal-El. Kal-El crosses solar systems so that he can be raised by the ""salt of the earth"" Kents. They ingrained a sense of destiny that is deep-rooted. When hope meets destiny and is empowered by Clark's humanity; mankind is there to reap the rewards. Mankind has found it's protector and advocate, but not without grave cost. Zod's Kryptonian pride is as strong as Clark's desire to protect the earth. A battle of epic proportions takes place. Thousands of lives are lost in an action-packed struggle yet a predictable victor prevails. But not in a fashion that is traditional for the Superman saga. The conclusion will provide for great debate for many. I will say this, I think the conclusion helps form the character of Superman and deeply effects the moral fiber of Clark Kent. One of the main criticisms is that there is a lack of character development. I agree to a certain extent. More could be done to flesh out the characters. I would have liked to see more chemistry between Clark and Lois, yet that may come in the sequels. I would have also liked to see the charming and witty Superman that Christopher Reeve perfectly captured. Even Christian Bale was able to give Batman some humor within the gloomy Dark Knight movies. Even though there could have been more character development, ""Steel"" had plenty of heart-wrenching scenes. You can feel the sadness in Lara-El as she watched her son depart the doomed Krypton. It was gut-wrenching watching Clark witness the death of his earthly father and it was exhilarating watching Clark discover the scope of his powers. To say that there was little character development is not a true statement. Another criticism was that there was too much violence and action. I strongly disagree with this assessment. Zod was a military leader of Krypton. He only knows  one language: violence. So of course there was a ton of violence. Please remember context is important when reading uninformed movie criticisms. Was ""Man of Steel"" perfect? Absolutely not. It has it's fair share of logical flaws (why is Superman smooching with Lois Lane after thousands of lives were lost?), lacks some character development, and could use a touch of humor. However, ""Man of Steel"" has made us believe that hope can persevere, we have control over our own destiny, and that something connects all of us; no matter how lost we feel within our own world. I give ""Man of Steel"" an 8/10 stars. I recommend this movie to those with wild and vivid imaginations.",1
417,"I went into this movie with very high expectations, and while all of them were not met.  The vast majority were.  There were some scenes that could have used a little more length and attention I think it can be overlooked for what this movie did give us that previous movies have not, an actual display of Superman's powers in a variety of different situations.  I felt the character was more of a real person than in previous incarnations,  and for once I felt like I was looking at the Superman I have read in the comics for the last 30 or so years.   Excellent film, looses 1 point for the reasons above.  Beyond that I can't wait for the sequel now!!!!!",1
418,"Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan's hybrid baby is a beautiful film that will take you on a dark, emotional and gravitating first 100 minutes as the origin story of Superman is articulated. Although the last 45 minutes is a bit Transformers-esque with massive destruction accompanied by little emotional loss in any of the main characters, Man of Steel is the beginning of a series that should go up, up and away.",1
419,"Okay ""Man Of Steel""As a Superman fan I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Are there problems with it? Yes, but there are many positives.Problems: Choppy editing for the first half (not too big deal, unless you're a stickler about it)the story/writing (though good) was not ""great"" (at least not Dark knight great), but it is passable.The Characters felt slightly held back( partly in due to the writing), but they made the best of what they had to work with.You don't need to see it in 3D(unless you like the tech, me not so much), but definitely see it in theaters, and on the biggest screen you can.(love it in Imax minus the 3D)Positives:The ACTION!!! that is how a Superman movie is supposed to be (looking at you Superman Returns).(think avengers action times 10 to the power of a lot)Henry Cavill has a great mix of both look and presence as Superman (with a better director and better writing he has the potential to be on par or better than previous incarnations.)The Music. I am never disappointing by Hans Zimmer. It's Gold.MOST IMPORTANTLY: This movies has the potential to have a ""Dark knight"" level of a sequel if not better. (the ground work is there, and it is exciting to think about what will come next... I'm hoping for a very strong morality piece for a sequel.Overall I give Man of Steel an 8 out of 10. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and will most likely see it again in theaters, but I will say that if they do a sequel, they need to push for a better director and writer; or have the current guys step up their game big time.",1
420,"Excerpt from the blog: http://tilfilmdouspart.blogspot.ca/Its convoluted plot prevents it from reaching the same heights as some recent superhero movie classics, like X-Men: First Class (2011) and The Dark Knight (2008); however, Man of Steel is still an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable movie that was both thought-provoking and exhilarating.",1
421,"Man of Steel is a great movie, except for a few flaws that come to light when you closely look at its narrative structure. The cast was, simply put, amazing. Henry Cavil looks the part and acts like the sort of humble, polite, qualities that come with Superman. Amy Adam's Lois Lane is for the first time important to the story, she is given things to do and she does them well. No longer is she a ""damsel in distress"" but rather, an important part of Kal-El's journey to accepting his identity as Superman. The two fathers  Russel Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent are convincing and truly want the best for their son. Kevin Costner, in particular, moved me to tears. The only member of the main cast who I felt was slightly weak and out-shadowed by the others was Michael Shannon as General Zod. Sure, he was menacing, powerful, and a physical threat to Superman, but he was not on the level of great comic book villains in film such as Loki, Joker, or even Ra's Al Ghul to name a few. I would liken General Zod to Bane  the actors did a good job but both characters were given too little to do. Although Michael Shannon tried to convince the audience of his point of view, Antje Traue's Faora ultimately overshadows him as being a threat, deadpan delivery and utter ruthlessness makes her much more than a pawn. The special effects are amazing. Zack Snyder just knows how to make epic  and whether you take to his style or not is personal preference. Speaking of the director, Nolan's touches are obviously in this film. The noir color palette, the story, and the dialogue is very much Nolan but infused with Snyder's style as well. A couple of lines made me cringe, such as the army officer saying that Superman is ""hot"" and the controversial ending where (SPOILER) Superman kills Zod. Lines like those prevented me from fully immersing myself into the film. David Goyer's story is very much a comic book story, with twists and turns, exploring the psyche of Superman. However, I doubt if he should have attempted to stuff so many themes in a 130 minute(?) running time. In the end, not one theme resonated with me and the actor/actress's performances stuck with me. Overall, Man of Steel is the best film since the original Superman  visually impressive, strong performances, and some action (ahem Superman Returns) makes this easily the summer blockbuster of the year.",1
422,"Movie was great, I completely underestimated how good Cavill would be as superman, and Amy Adams was perfect as Lois.. Action scenes were great, maybe a little lengthy, but if you enjoyed any of the batman movies, this is for you",1
423,"I believe the movie is going for a certain tone and styles and since it sticks to its guns from start to finish, certainly people are going to be split from totally loving or hating this iteration.For me, the movie simply delivers far exceeding my expectation, which is quite high already with all the hypes and press.Current movie audiences simply needed a new Superman movie at this time but this different new take on the iconic superhero just isn't the same as the previous movies in the franchise.This highlights the problem whether or not people would praised the risks taken or cursed them for it, and judging by people's reactions and my own, it definitely leaning towards the former.Every movie will have its own faults and detractors, but I have a highly positive 3D viewing experience of this movie from start to finish and I scored it based on how much I enjoy this movie as a whole.",1
424,"Man of Steel brought the grandpa of superheroes back in style with a modern, accessible and action packed sci-fi drama that has not only opened the gateway for a whole new type of superhero flick, but also kept a firm handle on a challenging and outdated mythos that many directors/writers would have turned away from. Kudos to Zack Snyder, David Goyer & Christopher Nolan!",1
425,"Need to work on character on  development but for me this movie was what i wanted for a superman movie, not perfect but epic..best action sequence ive seen only word.. Epic,Best superman, movie of the year for me ",1
426,"The aggregate score does not do this piece justice. It's definitely the Superman film fans have wanted for a long time, however as a film it has it's fair share of flaws and some (not all) critics have a point. For the most part what I see hurting the film's ratings with critics is a backslash of nostalgia for Donner's lighthearted, campy approach. These critics are dead wrong for trying to measure up this rendition to something from 35 years ago. Instead of judging the film solely on it's merits they're disappointed that the titular character didn't live up to some personal idyllic version that they themselves have created. This is very much a story about self discovery. Kal-El didn't hop out of his space craft and immediately become the Superman general audiences know and love. Expecting him to do that is completely unfair. Instead this movie opts to tell the story of how Clark Kent the man evolves into the role of Superman through a human, almost humble perspective. This is where it succeeds. That out of the way some of the legitimate concerns were lack of development for supporting characters. Why would I care about these characters living or dying if I don't know who they are aside from a few glimpses into their personalities? I see some people complaining about how it was edited and told through a flashback format, but isn't that structure exactly what Batman Begins was praised for? In my humble opinion It can be excused because this is as much an origin story as it is a character piece. Another valid concern is the overabundance of destruction that Zack Snyder throws at the audience. It desensitizes the viewer to the point that it loses it's impact by the time it's supposed to matter. Snyder could have shown a little more restraint. I feel like he was overcompensating for Superman Returns' lackluster (in)action sequences. I will say that Snyder did an excellent job visually when it came to conveying the alien nature of Krypton and it's biotechnological culture. It was definitely the highlight and shifted this away from the stereotypical comic book movie and into science-fantasy territory. Man of Steel is worth a second watch due to the Kryptonian prologue alone. All in all it's a very good movie, but not great. More than enough of a solid foundation for Warner Brothers to launch their DC universe. I give it a 7.5/10, recommend that anyone who's anyone watch it, twice.",1
427,"SPOILERS:  There will be some in this review.  From the moment the movie started it had my attention and I was never bored.  I thought the acting was well done, with Amy Adams being the only weak link.  I never bought into her as Lois Lane, and I was bothered by how easily she backtracked through Clark's history to find out who he was. Obviously the action is what you expect out of a Superman movie.  Zack Snyder does a fine job with that in this movie, although sometimes it's a bit over the top.  You could tell all throughout the movie that Superman did have emotional ties to the people, and I could see so much emotion in him.  But then other times you wonder what he's thinking as he fights Zod in Metropolis and destroys so much of the city killing an untold number of people off screen.  That didn't sit really well with me, but I also realize to a certain extent this was a ""war"" very similar to what happened in the Avengers.  Who knows how many people were killed in that, and I think that's become acceptable for this type of film, as long as it's not directly on camera. I thought Michael Shannon shined as Zod.  People complaining about his performance in comparing him only to Terrence Stamp are just being naive.  Same as the people trying to compare Cavill to Reeve.  I'm sorry, but this isn't 1978, and if you read the comics you realize that the Superman currently in the comics does mimic what we got on the screen. The rest of the cast shined, although I kind of felt like we got a little bit too little of the Daily Planet staff.  I think that'll be fixed going forward. All in all, I thought this was a good start to a Superman series, and I enjoyed the movie, even if it did seem a little over the top.  But I don't know what else to expect when you go see a movie about an Alien with Super powers.  As for those who are reviewing this as a zero and then taking pot shots at other reviewers, maybe you should reflect on yourself and your poor grammar before you attack others.",1
428,"Ok so Im sorry but, critics are only as good as their taste! Man of Steel is the greatest comic book movie of ALL time! It is everything a superhero movie should be! Critics say its too serious and blah blah blah but did these people ever read a comicbook? Superman is a lost soul, an alien from another planet who never chose these powers, but is forced into deciding how to use them. That is more than just a dilemna. It is a choice that if it were true, humanity would have no choice but to conform to. Man of steel brings that question to us in a real world setting, where Kal-el has to make choices none of us would want to. This is a truly heartbreaking movie with incredible soul that the critics seem to miss in their reviews. He is an alien who is trying to figure out who he is and why he is here! He isnt a human with all our flaws, he is flawless and doesnt know why? Who wouldnt be quiet and seek solitude in that same instance. The actions sequences are very heavy, but please remember it is a superhero movie and really what would happen if aliens came here to take over and one of them decided, that wasnt going to happen! Heck we as humans have destroyed countries in seconds, imagine what super aliens could do! Henry Cavill is amazing, you feel his strength and his weakness(not kryptonite) his weakness as has always been his love for this planet and the humans who have adopted him. Critics aside Man of Steel is a great reboot to the franchise and as was Batman Begins it will be remembered for years to come. Go see it true fans will love it!!!",1
429,"Man of Steel was a very enjoyable film IMO. It wasn't perfect, but it's a fun ride. I love the overall themes, fight scenes, and all the acting. I was cool with some of the core changes they made that might make some hardcore fans mad as well. The pacing of the first half felt rushed and disjointed, and I wish they did it more linear so we could get more of Kevin Costner with young Clark and get more invested in the character rather than flashbacks moments interspersed throughout. I enjoyed the fight scenes immensely (though I get the complaints about them) and thought the last 45 mins of the film were stellar. I especially enjoyed how much this movie incorporates not only the super hero saving humanity but humanity (especially Lois) helping save him as well as Superman empowering them to save themselves. Superman is the ultimate immigrant who comes to make his new world a better while also realizing he cherishes, needs, and dependent on his new home as well. I think they did a decent job exploring this theme. Overall, it's a good modern take on Superman that gets me excited to see Superman in all his glory for the sequel now that the origin story is out of the way. Also, I loved the subtle moments between Lois and Clark in the film. More in the sequel please. I give it a 7 or 7.5 out of 10. Not as high as I wanted to be but nowhere near the asinine rubbish most movie critics make it out to be. Don't listen to their bloviating. It's miles ahead of Returns and a good step in the right direction.",1
430,"(Sorry for bad English. If i have bad English or you cannot understand some of them) Man of Steel is a movie that i have been waiting since it was announced. I always loved the old Donner classics (the first 2 atleast) and this movie delivers of what is to be the best Superman movie yet. I am quite disappointed by all the negative reviews. I mean critics complain about too much action, too serious, too long of a story before it gets to all the 'I must be Superman' part of the story. One of the things I love about this movie is that how young Clark has troubles fitting into society with all of his powers. After all he is an alien, this is one of the key elements of the movie. Its about how Superman can fit in the modern world. How people will react to him if they found out he was superhuman. Of course, people are saying that they explore this too much. About how from child to adulthood he is still suffering or pretty much him searching on how to be human. Well let me tell you something, this is life it has some difficult stages and specially if you are a alien from another planet. This film really captures that image. It captures how a man will fell like if they could fly. Superman wouldn't be just ""Hey, I know how to fly from the first time I lift off"" Realisticly he would be ""OHHH YEAH  I'M FLYING *CRASHES*""  This must be non-related but that scene in which Clark was in the church was just emotional, i dont know why. I mean this movie didnt just make Krypton this super sci-fi planet. They actually gave it a culture, animals, and traditional suits. Well the main plot of the movie asides the Superman getting to set to Earth is that Kal-El (Superman) is different from other Kryptonians. He is a natural ospring. According to Krypton tradition(In the movie), each child is breed for a specific occupation. A baby can be meant to be born to be a warrior, a worker, or a enginner. But Kal-El differs from the rest, because as soon as he was born he was sent to Earth and thats why Zod is out to find him. Henry Cavil did amazing as Superman, Amy Adams bring a more realistic Lois Lane which isn't just a damsel in distress but a strong character and ultimately daring. Micheal Shannon brought a faithful character. Russel Crow did great as Jor-El The other thing that is big, huge element is that this movie starts the DC Cinematic Universe. There was alot of easter eggs in the movie. From the satellite with the Wayne Enterprises logo to the mentioning of S.T.A.R labs, this movie just makes comic book fans shat with excitement. This is the first movie that will eventually lead to the Justice League movie. Rumors are unclear if they are going to directly make a Justice League movie with no team up or standalone movies first like Wonder Woman, Flash, or a Superman/Batman movie. Soundtrack  All I can say is WOW! Han Zimmer really delivered a amazing soundtrack into the movie. The intro of the movie just gave me goosebumps from the trumpets to the pianos. Effects  There is alot of action and effects in this movie. Hey, Superman was meant to be an violent person. His first comic book was called ""Action Comics"" for good sakes. So all the critics saying Superman is too violent go  off. There were alot of destruction and explosions in this movie. The CGI in this film is not the greatest but extremely realistic. From the building exploding, to Superman launching into the air. Anyway in a nutshell  It explains the real-life problems of Superman, alot of action, more Dark Knight less Green Lantern and is the best summer blockbuster movie you can go see.",1
431,"As a lifelong Superman fan who read the comics, grew up on reruns of the 50's TV series and the Donner films, I was primed for another reinvention of the character. After reading lackluster reviews I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed. Once I saw how the Krypton sequences unfolded I was hooked! Critics be damned! This is everything I wanted in a Superman movie. The effects are amazing.  The fight and flight scenes are beautifully realized and the emotional punch of the flashbacks are an inspired way to build the foundation of our hero's journey. Henry Cavill was the perfect choice for the suit and gives Clark a more grounded and morally conflicted soul. Amy Adams as Lois Lane infuses the character with more intelligence and bravery than previous incarnations and is given more to do than just get into trouble. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane shine as Ma & Pa Kent and deliver the most emotional scenes in the film. I only wish they could've spent a little more time on the Kents as a family. Russell Crowe is exceptional as Jor-El and Micheal Shannon's Zod a wholly different interpretaion of the character. His motivation is driven more by genetic predisposition than a megalomaniacal mind. You can tell that a lot of love was poured into this film, and the layers will keep me coming back again and again. Superman is back and better then ever!",1
432,"First of all i understand some of the negative feelings towards the movie from a lot of the critics,and i agree to some extend that the pace are a little off.The big problem isn't exactly in this pacing,but more because some of the backstory felt rushed and chopped that could easily be explained in more scenes.I feel like the flashbacks should be much longer to explain why Clark is what he is,a humble,kind kid with extraordinary powers that could easily be arrogant,selfish,and bullies his way into life.And a few cutscenes shouldn't and couldn't explain this well enough for us mere mortals to believe it. Second of all the Fighting scene was quite incredible to say the least,the Beating that he dealt(and take) is literally earth shattering and that is completely fine by me,even if the metropolis/south pacific fight was a little too fast to follow,what can you expect from superman? And i do notice a lot of critics who rated it low because of this,and its stupid because comicbook is a fantasy and how can you show the immense power that this being held without showing them? It should be embraced and the movie should not be judged by it. I give this movie an 8.5/10 but i round it up as a 9 because it is still a must see movie with small flaws that should be overlooked.Its a new take on the superman story and should be looked as its own and not a reboot.",1
433,"This is an epic, action adventure tale of one of comics finest heroes, and Snyder and Nolan have presented him in fine form.  For years fans have been clamoring for a Superman film that adequately presented the character and presented him with the formidable challenges he would experience in the pages of the storied comic book series  and now they have that Superman on film.  While many people consider the first Christopher Reeve  Richard Donner film to be the 'genuine article' when it comes to seeing this character on film, they fail to realize that within the pages of the comic lies the TRUE Superman  he has had many arcs told presenting many different sides to his personality, and one of the biggest criticisms of this film  that it is too dark  has also been portrayed within the pages of the comics from which he was born.  The entire 'Death of Superman' storyline gave a dark gravitas and weight to the character and thrust him into more modern times.  So why so upset that this film takes a more 'serious' approach to the story of Kal El  Clark Kent?  Perhaps it's that most critics still revel in the joy of the first true superhero movie made by Reeve  Donner so long ago that they have skipped decades of comics which flesh the character out in a more serious and somber tone more often than people would think.  If you are unwilling to accept this fact, that Man of Steel is a modern, real, and serious take on this character, then you should own the first two Superman films on Blu-ray and maybe read some of his comics...you might be surprised with what you find. The acting is outstanding with notable performances from Amy Adams and Kevin Costner.  When Costner's Jonathan Kent tells a confused and lonely Clark that he will always be his son you believe it  the weight of emotion on his face showing feelings many a parent has often felt.  The other actors and actresses do a fine job, Russell Crowe putting in a note worthy performance as Jor El, brilliant Kryptonian scientist and father to Superman.  We get more of Jor El in this film than previous incarnations, and this may be the 'definitive article' when it comes to this character appearing on screen.  Crowe gives an outstanding performance as a father driven to protect his child, while preserving the legacy of his dying world.  The same can be said for Michael Shannon.  His turn as the Kryptonian General Zod provides an element missing in the character, and not necessarily cannon in the lore of Superman  empathy.  He is on a race to save his people and his planet, and while his actions are deplorable, his expressed reasons make you empathize with him...even if only momentarily...and Shannon brings this emotional core to light. Henry Cavill  the man was BORN to play Superman.  Simply put, here is an actor whose skills have yet to be truly tested, and if I have one complaint about this film it is this  we don't get enough dialogue from the Man of Steel.  But what Cavill does have he executes with a calm, strong, centered reserve.  Loneliness, isolationism, bullying, and a commitment to just and moral action are all themes this version of Superman embody and Cavill does a great job bringing these emotions to the screen.  With the success of this film assured, and a sequel already green lit by Warner Brothers, Cavill's rise to fame is just beginning, and it will be this film that marks the breakaway point of an already well established acting career. Bottom line  this is a modern day take on a classic hero.  And it's one that many fans have been waiting a long time for.  While the Christopher Reeve era Superman was a character that embodied hope and was lighthearted in scope, this is a Superman that is more rounded in modern day society  we all feel loneliness and yearn for acceptance in a society that is less personal that the one that accepted Superman on the big screen so long ago.  The Superman we have now, may in fact be more human than ever before, and this story is a fitting first chapter in what is surely going to be a multiple film arc for the character.  Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan have all done a remarkable job and I for one am looking forward to the stories they will bring us in the forthcoming chapter of the life of Kal El.  Welcome back Superman  it's a changed world, but then you have changed with us.  All told we're very glad you're here.",1
434,"Esta película es fantástica los efectos especiales son espectaculares la lucha impresionante es genial Snyder. Muy de la Justice League Viva Man of Steel",1
435,"This for me was a four star movie. I will admit I went in expecting to like it but that has never made me bias, example Iron Man 3, or The Amazing Spiderman. This movie delivers from start to finish. The story is fast paced and for being 2 hours and 23 mins it flies by so fast I couldn't believe when it was over. There are certain characters that are not given the time they deserve but I feel it all made sense for the story. This isn't your Richard Donner Superman movie, this is Superman in the real world. When he is discovered things move fast and with the arrival of Gerneral Zod things really pick up. There is plenty of development of Clark, and General Zod is a creepily good character. The real surprise for me was Russell Crowe, Jor-El was given an excellent role and his character was one of my favorite parts of the movie. Like I said not all characters get great attention, like Perry White, but I feel that we will get that in the next movie. The ending of the movie sets up the next ones perfectly and I left truly excited to see more. The movie is action heavy, and it has awesome set pieces and the special effects are truly spectacular. If your looking for your family style happy go lucky Superman movie this isn't it. If your looking for a great Superman movie that taps into the full potential of this great iconic character this movie is exactly what your looking for. Could there be improvements made? Yes, Does that effect the quality of the movie, absolutely not. I don't think I really could've enjoyed this movie anymore than I did.",1
436,"The opening sequence on Krypton is quite spectacular with some truly stunning CGI and some great dialogue. It sets the scene for the entire story and I think it was just about as perfect a beginning we could possibly have had. We then come down to earth (literally) where we find Clark Kent discovering who he is and coming to terms with his powers and what a responsibility that places on his shoulders. Much of this is told in flashback with some great fatherly advice from Kevin Costner. It’s a section of the film that may have lost some (probably due to the lack of explosions) but I really enjoyed it as it gives us a chance to get to know what motivates Clark/Superman, and just what makes him a superhero. The third act, however, is where I had the most trouble. The plot wasn’t hard to follow and the acting was great, particularly Michael Shannon, no, all that was great. The problem was with the fight scenes; why is it necessary to topple skyscrapers and destroy entire city blocks. It put me in mind of climactic battle in ‘The Avengers’ movie; I had the distinct impression I had seen it all before. Yes, it was quite a spectacle but I would have liked something a little more original. But don’t let that distract from the fact it is still a very good film and one I would happily watch again. Top performances, well everybody really but Michael Shannon really does stand out; definitely worth a look. SteelMonster’s verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.3/10",1
437,"Man Of Steel. First word to describe it is WOW. Some of the best action and special effects I have ever seen, jaw dropping stuff. Also some really big ideas and themes of being a God among men. I really liked Cavill as Superman as well. However I can't help but compare to things like The Dark Knight and Avengers, and its not as good. It doesn't have the true darkness of Batman and doesn't have the wit and charm of Avengers. I don't think Man Of Steel has one joke and as good as the action is, maybe there is just too much which takes away the impact. However I still really enjoyed it and it has to be seen at the cinema.",1
438,"The movie was awesome, to say it was a bore you simply aren't a superman fan, excellent job, I hate how critics act like every movie has to have corny jokes, it had a fitting serious tone.",1
439,"I had doubts for Man of Steel since Superman IV was um, extreme crap. But once again I was proved wrong. Man of Steel is bulked with action and mastered its purpose, kudos to you Zack.",1
440,"Man of Steel isn't perfect, but it is a great time.  The first half is my favorite that is where you get the character development and through all the flashbacks I got emotionally investeted.  The second half with all the big action scenes took me away from it a little, but I can't wait for part two.",1
441,"Nolan and Snyder complete yourself in that new masterpiece.The action is amazing and the gladiator too.amy adams is a brilhant lois lane,and shanon is the worst man of krypton.",1
442,"Loved it. It wasn't a rehash of the older Superman movies and it does a pretty good job of starting off a new franchise. There were some bumps in the story and there was a excess in action, but otherwise I had a ton of fun. It just may be one of my favorite comic book movies yet!",1
443,"I believe the problem most critics have is that they are stuck on a Reeves Superman. They've never viewed Superman as character with depth or seriousness. This movie makes him feel more realistic. He feels like a man who was raised on a simple Kansas farm and has had to struggle/learn his powers. In real life, most men raised on a Kansas farm are going to have Midwestern values and stoicism.And the movie showcases Superman's powers better than any ever has. His flight, strength, and heat vision are exactly what I'd expect in real life. The destruction when beings with these powers fight would be ridiculous.Man of Steel does a good job of feeling like it could occupy the same universe as the Dark Knight movies. And unlike The Marvel movies, it takes an unrealistic character and doesn't turn him into a caricature.",1
444,"A+. Critics are wrong this is really good. First off Superman Returns sucked period. This movie was way better. These critics are idiotic snobs, I mean seriously the loved that pile of crap called Superman Returns more than this movie. I don't know how that is possible they are blind or maybe saw Superman Returns of the first time. Everyone in this movie, except the young Henry Cavill, is an oscar winner or nominee and it shows, acting superb. Henry is the perfect Superman. Action is amazing and engaging. Yes it's all huge and you might get sensory overload but the amazing thing is, I didn't take my eyes off the screen the whole time it was happening. This story was well written, everything happened for a reason and was had a purpose. I saw in 3D, I didn't really see anything popping out of the screen, but I have glasses and have to wear 3D glasses on top maybe that messed it up. My friends thought the 3D was amazing he swore hey saw stuff flying out of the screen. So the 3D in my view is a little mixed. I will watch this 2 more times, once in IMAX and once more in big 2D screen. A+.",1
445,"Personally, I hate critics. Screw 'em! If you are a fan of movies, you owe it to yourself to see Man of Steel! Granted I am a huge fan of Superman, but Man of Steel may very well be the best movie I have ever seen! Considering movies like Nolan’s “The Dark Knight”, Peter Jackson’s third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, “Return of the King” and Whedon’s “The Avengers” top that list, that’s saying a ton! What Zack Snyder has done with this film is “genius”! This is such a grand movie, yet nothing feels forced or exaggerated. Everything is given to you in exactly the right dosage. You aren’t force-fed action like in other summer blockbusters. In Man of Steel, the action feels natural as if it is part of a story being told. Imagine that! The origin story is there, but it isn’t too much that it bores you tears and Snyder goes about it all in precisely the right manner through flashbacks. This way, you get the gist of how Clark came to be the man he is, without the movie needing to be longer than it has to. All the actors/actresses do a fantastic job in their particular roles and help the movie to do what it is supposed to do: tell a story. While I’m still adjusting to a fair-haired Amy Adams in the role of Lois Lane, I can say that I left the theater content with her performance. She really grew on me by the time it was all said and done. Growing up as a huge Smallville fan, I was convinced that nobody could do the role of Clark justice after Tom Welling. While Brandon Routh fit the role physically in Superman Returns, he was just too stiff and too much of a Christopher Reeves knockoff to leave me satisfied. I’m not saying Reeves was bad in the role (quite the contrary), I just would have preferred it if Routh had brought something he could call his own to the role. That’s where Henry Cavill comes in! The best way I can put his performance is this  he owned the role! You know how it goes. Often times you’ve seen an actor or actress star in an iconic role, only to be dissatisfied with the choice after seeing the movie (or perhaps before and after). With Henry Cavill, I can say this, “Henry Cavill is Superman!” The whole time while watching the Man of Steel, I felt as if Cavill was truly an outsider from another planet. And, I mean that in the highest regard! Movies are often about the suspension of disbelief and we as moviegoers sometimes need a little push in the right direction. Cavill’s performance did that for me. The fact that the guy looks like he trained day and night nonstop tells you all you need to know about his dedication to the role. Kudos Henry! The special effects didn’t hurt either. As far as cutting-edge special effects go, this movie has it in spades! By far the best special effects I’ve seen in any movie to date…hands down! Better than Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Matrix, Avatar or any of the Marvel movies, including The Avengers! Words cannot describe them, particularly the Metropolis battle scene! Truly epic! Speaking of battles, the fight between Supes and two notorious Kryptonians (once seen in another of the Big Blue Boyscout’s movies) was in essence, borderline orgasmic! That battle seen alone was worth the price of the movie’s admission!...And Man of Steel still had plenty left in reserve. Let’s face it; we don’t go to movies about comic book heroes to be bored to death by dialogue. We want action and suspense to go along with a good, relatively fast-paced story. In Man of Steel you get that! It currently is and will be by summer’s end, the biggest and best movie you will see. Mark my words! So do yourself a favor and don’t walk, but run to your local movie theater! You need to see this on the big screen and I promise you, you will not leave the theater disappointed. If you do, then you’re either dead or worse, a critic! ""Gasp!""",1
446,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS ON THIS ONE.  Clearly the average person loves it, and reviews from most people who have actually read Superman (or even any comic book) are glowing.  It is the Superman movie you've always wanted: Shed of the silly Reeve portrayal that kept people from taking him seriously; Containing more action in the first 5 minutes than there was all throughout Superman Returns; writing on par with (better, in my opinion because I love Superman more) the incredible scripts found in Nolan's Batman films.  Also, Hans Zimmer nailed it again with a score I personally like more than Williams' classic.  Go see this movie: It's moving, thrilling, deep, and a spectacle like nothing else you've seen.",1
447,"This film is the Superman film we've all been waiting for. A lot of these reviews by the critics claim there is too much action or that it's not like the previous instalments of Superman like Superman Returns, STOP. This film was made with the intention that it was the first Superman movie of it's kind, It's a reboot not a sequel to a past film, it takes it's on twist on the the well know origin story and i have to give it praise for being the complete opposite that Superman returns was which was a complete snooze fest. Man of steel has a lot of talent and well directed sequences and i cannot fathom why this movie isn't getting the rating it truly deserves... Overall it made me believe a man could truly fly.",1
448,"Kudos to a well done Superman film. The movie was far more intense than I was expecting.  Kal-el faces serious decisions throughout, and the damage done by Zod and crew is not sugared down. Lois was presented as a risk taking real journalist, and the first non-family person Kal-el was able to trust. I am looking forward to the sequels where Clark is able to form more meaningful relationships now that he has chosen to really enter human society.",1
449,"Man of Steel introduces us to the world of Superman like no movie has ever done before.  With an emotionally engaging story and an amazing soundtrack it really is the movie superman fans have waited for.  Snyder, Goyer and Nolan are a team that shouldn't disband anytime soon  Hoping for a Man of Steel trilogy, because the story of this particular incarnation of Superman is just too good to let go.",1
450,I have to say this movie really came with an eraser to remove all the old superman history and start fresh.  We enjoyed the film as a whole and would recommend it to our friends. It is more than a refreshing update on an old comic book hero.,1
451,"Don't listen to the critics, Man of Steel is an epic Superhero MASTERPIECE !!! Best comic book movie of ALL TIME, I loved this movie. 10/10 need JLA",1
452,The critics gave it bad rating but that is what I come to except from them. They never like comic book movies. The only one they like was the new Batman movies. This movies lives about to everything we except in Superman movie. For those purist yes it is another origin story at the beginning but hey that is what you need we reintroducing to fan who know nothing about superman. Fans who never see will love it and become superman fans of it. So much action so much fun would highly recommend it. It is Hell-Ya movie.,1
453,This was the superman movie we needed!!! The director was perfect along with the actors and the story!!! This was the best movie I had ever seen!!! I can not wait to see what Snyder and Goyer have in store for the future!!!,1
454,"Man of Steel re-imagines the legend of Superman in modern movie fashion  beginning with the story of his home planet, Krypton. We first witness the miraculous birth of Kal-El, son of prominent scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), who happens to be the first naturally born Kryptonian (i.e., not genetically engineered) in a long time. Unfortunately, Kal’s birth comes just at the time when Krypton’s society is fracturing under the fear inspired by Jor-El’s prediction that the planet’s end is nigh. An attempted military coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon) sets into motion a series of fateful events that see young Kal-El raised on Earth, where he is warned by his adoptive parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) that his god-like alien powers will one day force him to make a choice about how he will change the world for better or worse. And when Zod and his minions suddenly appear in Earth’s orbit, ready to finish what was started on Krypton, Kal-El/Clark Kent realizes that his prophesied moment of choice has now arrived. As was hoped for by many, Man of Steel is a fine marriage between the rich character-centric storytelling of Dark Knight Trilogy architects Chris Nolan and David S. Goyer, and the signature visual talents of director Zack Snyder. The movie is very much “Superman Begins” in terms of its narrative approach and structure; however, in terms of themes and tone the film achieves its own identity as an insightful, reverent and effectively relatable Superman story. Are there liberties taken with certain details of the costume, origin story or character relationships? Of course. But then again; this is a fresh start to present a new Superman to a modern world  and in that, Man of Steel ultimately succeeds. Visually, this is Snyder’s most impressive film yet  and it looks pretty stunning in 3D. Everything from Kryptonian culture and technology to the way Superman’s powers (and the impossible physics surrounding them) operate looks on point and believable (enough) in a real-world context. Add to that an abundance of visual iconography and head nods to both the comics and Richard Donner’s seminal films (in particular Superman II) and it’s clear that Man of Steel‘s director has true love, understanding and appreciation for the subject matter at hand. The action sequences  while at times a bit too CGI-heavy  are pretty epic in nature and certainly deliver on that perennial fanboy desire to see a film that depicts how super-powered beings would look and feel battling it out in a real-world setting. The wonderful pacing, editing, smart selection of scenes and abundance of action make this two-plus-hour ride go rather quickly; although by the climax, seeing flying men get punched through buildings over and over again might have you checking your watch. The score by Dark Knight composer Hans Zimmer is phenomenal and heightens the film every turn, while also establishing yet another new-age superhero theme to replace a classic favorite (John Williams’ Superman theme from the Donner films). At the same time, Man of Steel  is not without some noticeable narrative flaws. The script can be very “comic-bookish” in some scenes of dialogue, and the jumps in time and place during the first act are not as cohesive as they were in Batman Begins. Clever editing and speedy movement earlier on often comes at the price of effective narrative development. In short: if you were one of those people who were hung up on the question of how Bruce Wayne made it back to Gotham after escaping prison in Dark Knight Rises, you’ll find similar gripes with Man of Steel. Thankfully, the studio and filmmakers pull the same magic trick they did with the Batman franchise by casting an impressive array of highly-talented actors, who help elevate the weaker points of the script. Meanwhile, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe add Oscar-caliber gravitas and heart to the film as Superman’s two sets of parents. Crowe gets a substantial amount of screen time to really flesh-out the character of Jor-El like never before, while Lane and Costner totally carry the family drama subplot, which is the most moving and beautiful element of the story. Even military side-characters like Genearl Swanwick, On the whole, this movie is exactly the sort of experience that many Superman fans have been asking for, with the added benefit of having some smart storytellers providing fresh insight into why the character is one of the most iconic fictional creations out there. Like Nolan and Christian Bale’s first Batman outing, Snyder and Cavill’s first crack at Superman isn’t a homerun (we’ll call it a triple), but having succeeded in re-introducing the franchise to the core.",1
455,"Pretty good Superman! Way better than the 3 ordinary 1 before. I can't believe those ""pro"" gave it a 55. What the heck are they basing their rating on?

456,"The movie we all have been waiting for. It's just incredible and much better when you see it twice. Amazing action, spectacular visual effects, tremendous acting, powerful soundtrack and well composed story. I must say that Antje Traue was one of my favourite and Henry Cavill is, by far, the best Superman after Christopher Reeve. 10/10",1
457,"PLEASE DO NOT LET THE CRITICS STRAY YOU FROM SEEING THIS MOVIE....go to it and be the judge of it yourself as I did.  What I will say next is strictly my own opinion and pretty much is in line as to what the majority of user reviews have been saying.  This movie is great,  not without it's flaws but these things can be improved upon in a sequel and In no way take away from the movie enough to make it deserve a score of 55....this just boggles my mind.  A few cheesy lines from military personnel and sometimes not clear action sequences are not enough to make this movie a fail. And after rewatching Superman 2 and Superman Returns last night I can fully say that Henry Cavill IS superman and Snyder has done a great job.  I'm not going to rant on about anything else, just got watch the movie yourself especially if the critics have turned you off from it...I think you will be a bit surprised.",1
458,"Do yourself a favor and do not read into the critical reviews. look at metacritic, the game has almost a 9.0 rating from regular people but a 55% from the ""professional movie critics"" who are obviously out of touch with reality. This may be the best movie of the year. The build-up to General Zod's arrival on earth is perfectly paced, they handled Krypton well (like, its just almost exactly like it is in the comics, down to the floaty communicator-thingys). Is there a lot of action in it? Yes. The action feels good though and it keeps you excited for what is next. There was a scene in Smallville that was amazing, the action is great. Overall, there is more action than story, perhaps yes, but it is appropriate for the first in a series or trilogy to set up the next movies for some good times to be had.",1
459,"What a brilliant movie it is up there with The Dark Night for me it is that good. There is a great cast some  amazing special effects loads of action for a 2 hour plus movie it never drags and there is  some nice additions to the story ,Michael Shannon is just becoming one of my favorite actors he plays the role of  General Zod so well, all in all this is a must see movie its a easy 10 out of 10.",1
460,Absolutely sensational film.  So original and refreshing.  Acting and Action we're among the highlights.  Great start for the DC Cinematic universe! I am not sure why it is receiving so much criticism.  One of the best CBM's yet!,1
461,"a diferencia del otro superman este esta cargado de mas acción  tiene una mejor historia  una actuaciones increíbles, y lo mejor es que en ningún momento de la película uno sufre aburrimiento",1
462,"After watching Man of Steel, I immediately came here to give it a review.  I am not surprised at the terrible score these ""critics"" gave this movie, as most of them are complete idiots anyways.  The user score is and always will be the only score that matters, and that is exactly what you should be paying attention to if you are an undecided Superman fan who's skeptical whether or not this movie will deliver. This might have been pre-programmed in my own mind as to how great this movie was, considering the list of failures so far in 2013.  Biggest of note, would be Iron Man 3, but those details will be more suited for it's own review which I plan on writing soon.  The pace, writing/script/story and amazing action/effects is what makes this movie one of the best of 2013 so far.  A massive redemption overshadowing the must forget ""Superman Returns"" which hung on the thread of Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lex Luther.  General Zod was the perfect choice as the super villain for this franchise launch(hopefully it's successful enough to be a new franchise), and was well played by Michael Shannon.  His female concubine was nearly equally as impressive, her sexiness and powerful warrior spirit pumped just the right amount of juice into what a mighty pair of foes should be like for Superman to face. The background story was touching, well written and was perfectly balanced not to bore your eyeballs out in meaningless cry baby scenes of over-emotion(IE Tobey Maguire's Spiderman trilogy). No one would have been a better fit for Jor-El than Russell Crowe.  Krypton and it's people/technology have never been portrayed in such great detail and special fx.  This movie, as a Superman movie SHOULD, never skimps on the epic action that is the god like red caped hero. So if you're not a pompous, over-arrogant, jaded, over-critical critic and are a huge DC comic/Dark Knight series fan, then this movie is a MUST SEE.  You will NOT be disappointed.  If you are more like the critics, not the users who write reviews here, move along as a cheesy romantic comedy might be more up your alley.",1
463,"Absolutely love, every actor was perfect for the part, Man of Steel is made of legend. He resurrected the Superman's mythos. All in this movie was worthy of attenction",1
464,"In my opinion, the best movie adaptation of Superman's origin story to date. It has some awkward editing moments and the action generally drags on for a little to long, but everything else is so well-done that you HAVE to ignore that 55 rating from the critics. Go out and see it for yourself.",1
465,"I was never a big fan of superman, I just thought he was a pretty generic superhero when I was a kid. this movie though, while being very slow at parts, managed to make superman look epic. General Zod was a great villain also and the fight scenes were good as well.",1
466,"My most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2013, from the mastermind of 300 (2006, 7/10) and WATCHMEN (2009, 7/10), the reboot of the most popular superhero has undergone a series of choppy fluctuations since the underperformance of Bryan Singer’s SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006, 7/10), so an IMAX plus 3D version for me is a prerequisite to watch. Not an avid fan of Snyder, but MAN OF STEEL is an up-to-par epic bandwagon superbly grafts the invincible Kryptonian alien under the context of a xenophobic earth milieu, a human environment-nurtured extraterrestrial identity chooses to combat against his own race to save the cynical earthlings. The film majestically branches out a unique palette of indigo and gray, a post-apocalypse solemness which is unlike most of its superfluous comic-derived peers (producer Christopher Nolan’s sway may be a plausible influence), and a hefty impetus of Clark Kent’s poignant relation with his human parents perpetually spurs the film to imprint its most eloquent fingerprints onto the heart of its recipients, a far better fulfillment than the parents-bereaved spidey (both Costner and Lane are heartwarming and sagacious in it). Crowe and Zurer as Superman’s biological parents, both are throwaway in the overture of Krypton’s demise, the former then resurrects himself as a bewildering wraith inside the flying vehicle, sabotages General Zod’s scheme. Against the ageism, Adams offers brilliant ballast as the mettlesome journalist Lois Lane, a paragon of the benevolence from human part, the mutual attraction between her and Kent is ignited, but markedly Snyder saves the best for the sequel. Antje Traue and Christopher Meloni, one is the ferocious sidekick of Zod, another is a human general fights till his self-sacrifice heroic act, brings out an intensive beast-and-prey pattern of diversion which is a rare treat for side players in mainstream cinema. Michael Shannon as General Zod, a bona-fide super-villain counteracts Superman’s almighty indestructibility, his human-eradication theory surpasses any comic fecklessness, and the gravity-reconstruction concept really put the entire planet hanging on a thread (I always redeem a sudden depletion of gravity is the way to our doomsday), Shannon is incredible to magnify his militant loyalty and the genocide-prone mercilessness whilst viewers would eventually be touched by the former, such a transcending feat to accomplish out of a fixated mold. Same can be stated to Henry Cavill’s Superman, he is a flawless messiah of our planet, and Cavill is the perfect Superman, both from his physique and his charisma (and finally the underwear goes underneath his uniform), his oscillation has never been shied away in the film, and it makes the final neck-breaking such an emotional disturbanceboth to him and to the viewers. The CGI effects are another fusillade of leveling cities and blasting buildings after THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10), but an amazing stunt is this time it ad hoc showcases an uplifting process of Superman’s sway of his flying expertise. A recurrent blip of the genre is the willful negligence of the aftershock, 5 seconds later, everyone act like they are totally oblivious of the apocalyptic attack no matter how damaged the city is, the transference is unnaturally nettling, the least one can do is to take a few shots of people’s contemplation as survivors of such a catastrophe, or raise hope to shoot scenes of the restoration and a panorama of the mess is a must to deepen the seriousness of the matter. Anyhow, MAN OF STEEL is a stylized orthodox superhero film which successfully recoups the fanboys and bolsters a stronghold for the series in its lucrative future projects, its mass appeal might lag behind Marvel’s SHIELDS coalition, but Superman’s adventure will be more audacious and reflective other than its entertaining face value.",1
467,"While mainstream critics are correct in saying the much of the movie is a action spectacle, I believe most of the general audience already had a solid footing on who Superman is and his origin. Warner Bros. picked up from where the whole idea of Superman has always left off. They gave Superman something to fight for but didn't take an hour to set it all up and it worked.",1
468,"The best superman movie ever. Full of action and great acting, this is the superman movie we've always needed. Zack Snyder has done a wonderful job bring superman into the real world and making him human",1
469,"I cannot believe how negative the critic reviews are on this site, this movie deserves a minimum of an 8 for quality alone, a 5.5(at the time of writing) is just wrong to me. I understand that you don't have to like a movie if you don't want to, but such a mediocre score for a movie I consider fantastic is just jarring. To make this brief, this movie has wonderful writing, wonderful acting, amazing effects, beautiful sets and costumes, a great amount of weight to the world and its people, deep characterization, and a conflict that actually takes some thought. There is only a couple of flaws with this movie, which is why i have given it a 9 as opposed to a 10. 1: Zod chewed the scenery too much for such a serious movie. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE some cheese every once in a while, but when the entire world takes everything so seriously, Zods overacting at points in the movie is kind of out of place and silly at times. 2: A couple of times people will say information before they know about it, like when a general says ""Krypton"" before Superman has mentioned that he is Kryptonian or from Krypton.Aside from those 2 nit picks, the movie is a very fun movie, and a very smart one too. But what else would you expect from such an amazing team as Snyder and Nolan.",1
470,"Finally, the most anticipated movie of this year has arrived. I was a little over hyped for this movie since there hasn't been a magnificently good looking Superman movie since ""Superman II."" I did notice that lots of critics didn't like this movie. I was really pissed at them. I still enjoyed this movie. Yet, it wasn't exactly what I expected. It didn't have much of the emotional tone that it had in the 2nd and 3rd trailer. The movie is filled with so much action/violence and miraculous visuals. It's truly breathtaking to watch but it has way more than what you expected in the trailers and promos. It does kind of make the story drag. I'm just saying, less action could have been better. Not much, but just a little. And more of a story could have made me give this movie a perfect 10. But for what it's worth it's a solid 8. Overall, even with it's minor elements, you will still love this amazing reboot.",1
471,"The Superman origin tale has been told and retold many times at this point however this is the first live action reboot since Superman(1979). Far from retreading the same steps the film focuses on Clarks' struggle over what to do with his powers and getting the world to accept him. I was particularly glad to see Clarks' childhood shown in brief segments showing why Superman does what he does as an adult. I also enjoyed the portrayal of emotion on Supermans' face shown with close ups; the first flight for example, as this really makes the character more real as that's how a normal person would act in such situations. The direction of characters was solid through out although the action scenes felt a bit jaggy as it was almost like the audience was in the middle of the fight and possibly not getting the best possible view of the action. I also felt as though although the General Zodd character was quite good he didn't quite fill the shoes of those who played the role before which is slightly disappointing and takes away somewhat from the film. Conversely, Jor-El ;played by Russel Crowe was used brilliantly and really helped the film as well also as the portrayal of Krypton  which compared to previous iterations felt alive more like a genuine planet.Rating 8 out of 10A well thought out and considerate reboot hopefully leading to bigger and better things in the future.",1
472,"Man of Steel is an excellent movie. I enjoyed the movie the entire time and loved every second of it. The story was great, the action was awesome, and the cast was superb. Do not listen to any of these idiotic critics who gave this film a negative score. It does not deserve any of the negativity that its been getting for whatever unbelievable reason. Just do yourself a favor and watch this film, you will not regret it.",1
473,"Man Of Steel is like a fast car accelerating through a fast straight race track while gradually gaining speed as it proceeds Snyder has created a visually spectacular movie with top notch visual effects but not only that he has started a fresh franchise away from the casual norm, l will looking forward to another and another",1
474,"Superman is an Alien on Earth but on Krypton he is “human”. I believe “Man of Steel” was designed to show just that, Kal-El is vulnerable and emotional. We all know the story of Superman, I think that is a healthy given to state in this day and age. Whether you know Clark Kent from Smallville, Christopher Reeves as the one “true” Superhero, or you know what Action Comics were. Every generation since the beginning of comic books knows who Superman is. This is Zack Snyder’s modern retelling of a classic story. I’ll get straight to the point and we can sort out the technical stuff for those looking for more to read. This film isn’t grade A story telling for the masses, it is closer to a B minus, and I know I said everyone knows this story but Snyder always seems to bring something experimental to his films. The film starts strong but immediately begins to skip tracks as Snyder tries to retell an old story in a new way. We are dealing with a lot of flash backs and not a whole lot of “read from point A to point B”. I think this keeps many audience members detached from what is happening on screen. Flashbacks aside, we are dealing with a very dark story here, which some would call “modern”. I believe time changes all things and although the core elements of the character Superman are shown here, they have been painted in dark, modern story telling colors. Nowadays we want our heroes to be relatable and “human”.  We want to see them hurt, cry, and love just as we do. Many non-Superman fans don’t like the old fashion “boy scout” image that comes along with this “perfect” and “overpowered” Superhero. It was from this mentality Zack Snyder finds his inspiration for Man of Steel. Still here, then let’s talk about the talent behind this film.  There is no shortness of great actors, and actresses on screen, such as Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and even Laurence Fishburne as Perry White. The soundtrack was composed by Hans Zimmer, in case you didn’t think there was enough talent involved with this movie already. If you enjoyed the film I would recommend picking up the soundtrack as it is another great piece of music from an experienced composer. Personally I thought the film was breath-taking, and I don’t mean that in a wordsmith kind of way. I literally mean that I silently screamed numerous times during this film. If you keep your eyes open and on the move you’ll catch many nods to other parts of the Superman universe, though I didn’t catch anything about a billionaire that recently lost his parents behind a theater. I actually kind of felt like the movie was telling us the Wolverine origin story in the beginning as Clark Kent searches the world for answers to all his questions prior to being hired as a fulltime Superhero. I think all the facial hair had a hand in this as well. It is really weird but I’m actually extremely happy with how they showed Superman move. It is maybe something you don’t think about very often but Superman can move at super speed from a standstill. It is cool to see the progression of his movement in other live action films and TV shows but if you really wanted to show just how powerful he is you would show only a facial expression that he was about to move, and then just a blur of motion. I think a great way to explain this film’s action scenes is Bruce Timm’s DC animations, specifically his presentation of Superman. If you have ever seen a fight scene from the cartoon, Justice League, then you know what I’m talking about. These battles normally lasted longer than just a few punches back and forth. The fight would rage on throughout the streets and into malls, across miles of city property, up into the sky, and out in space. You would be constantly reminded that these are not just two dudes in a bar throwing punches, these are gods among men, at least when meta-humans are involved. Do I think Zack Snyder managed to tell a story about the most powerful Superhero ever imagined and make him as weak as a new born baby? Definitely, and I enjoyed how serious the film took this change in direction. Snyder really followed through with his vision and I enjoyed seeing the “boy scout” in a completely different light. If you already know you are going to see it then this film is definitely a theater movie.  You don’t need to see it in fake 3D though, save your money.",1
475,"This is already the best movie of this year! Much better than othesr superhero movies! Excellent special effects, soundtrack, and very, very good action scenes! You REALLY must see the movie in 3D! Nothing more to say, it's just the most amazing action movie EVER!",1
476,"THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!! I seen this movie at the midnight showing with a few friends and we all loved it! All I can say is don't listen to the critics, watch the movie for yourself and make your own decision. The action in this movie is unparalleled, this is a superman we have never seen on film before and he kicks some serious ass!",1
477,"With Snyder directing, followed by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer covering the story and screenplay, the three of these men have created a Superman movie that will grip all audiences. The result: a film with bombastic and engaging action sequences, inspired performances by the cast (especially Michael Shannon), and a tone, albeit very serious, is one that fits this generations Superman well and adds accentuating depth and emotion to the story. Snyder's signature eye catching visual spectacle and stunning CGI paired with Nolan's story is sure to please not only comic book fans, but also the outside audience not already familiar with the source material. ""Man of Steel"" is not only an impressive film, both technically and emotionally, but it also is catching and gripping where Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"" was dull and often lacking or absent. Snyder has spawned the start of what could be an incredible franchise worthy in comparison to how ""Batman Begins"" stemmed Nolan's Batman Trilogy. With ""Man of Steel,"" Warner Brothers and DC Comics have returned to center stage and built upon on what could be the introduction of other super heroes in the multiverse to the big screen. The future for DC entertainment looks bright and stunning, with welcome competition from Marvel. Should be exciting.",1
478,"Its a great movie.  It finally gives a Superman we can say its super.  The movie is definitely DC version of Avengers.  It has alien battles that really are amazing.  The origin story is great for Superman in the movie.  I loved Lois Lane, Superman, Jor-el, Jonathan Kent, Zod and Faora in the movie.  I can't wait to see what Sequel will look like.  Hope Brainaic, Metallo, Parasite, Doomsday and Darkseid will make presence in sequels and Justice League.",1
479,"Man of steel is a visual masterpiece full of epic fight scenes. Although they set the emotional level of this movie high in the trailers, there is much more action than slower scenes. Nolan and Snyder prove to be able to work together and combine their visual idea along with a good storyline. I encourage superman fans to enjoy the movie for what it is and not this to the comic books. 5/5!",1
480,"A+++ movie. Please don't believe the critics, please see this for yourself. This is an amazing movie and you deserve to make your own mind up about it. I will say this for certain, though: Henry Cavil makes a phenomeonal Superman, and if any thing was lacking, it was that Michael Shannon's performance was just a little lackluster.",1
481,"You know. I'm really hurt watching this movie being bashed by the so called ""critics"". I just had to register.I'm a man who rates productions by how much they will move me inside. I can't believe, but for the first timein my life I cried on an action movie. Just go see the Man of Steel. You wont regret this.",1
482,"esta es una version mas actualizada del super heroe superman,a pesar q no soy muy fan,esta es una de las mejores peliculas basadas en un personaje de comic que e visto en mi vida.exelente trama y los ultimos 45 minutos no te deja ni respirar.nolan y snyder los lograron le devolvieron la vida a superman,esta entre las mejores peliculas que e visto en mi vida.",1
483,"Superman: Man of Steel, is the beginning of a new Superman series just as Amazing Spider-Man was for the Spider man series! The movie shows the evolution of superman on Earth. It starts from a planet named Krypton, his native planet which is on the verge of getting destructed and so his parents sends him to earth with the DNA's of the people of Krypton. The story shows how a man with such supreme powers overcome difficulties living with normal humans. It shows the duty and responsibility that Superman shows for the people of earth The movie is high on ethics just like Batman series. Its not just about action as we saw in previous Superman movies. Scripting is very accurately done. Cinematography is world class and 3D view of the movie is worth watching. The movie deals with highly modern technologies but not much gadgets were used as we see in other Action movies. All the action sequences are extremely brilliant. It surely defines a new era of Action scenes. Overall the movie is an outstanding mixture of ethics and action. It does have the charishma and brilliance of Iron man and Avengers movies to some extent. Must watch! Go for it straight away.Critics website: www.fridayrating.org",1
484,"I’m just home from seeing the movie and I’m still buzzing about it.!!! I loved the movie!!! I watched it with some friends. I saw it with guy who were not comic book fans, they  were blown away by it, and we were really surprised by how much we dug it. I knew there was  going  would be big, big action going in to the movie and I got it in spades, complete with all the characterization that  I’ve been wanting to see in a Superman movie since I was a kid",1
485,"I'll keep the review short and sweet with no spoilers. First of all, I'm not too sure what the critics were thinking when they rated this movie. I thought this was the best movie of the summer so far. Yeah, there is alot of action in the movie, and in my opinion it didn't ruin the experience for me unlike the critics. There were quite a few flashbacks (since this is an origin story), but I wasn't bothered by them at all, and thought that they fit in well. Lastly, the fighting scenes were done beautifully as well as Hans Zimmer's score. If you love superhero movies, or your just looking for an amazing summer movie, MAN OF STEEL IS THE ONE TO WATCH. It was a great movie, and I definitely think it's worth watching again and worth purchasing on bluray.",1
486,"As a long time fan of Superman, I was not disappointed. In fact, this movie actually surprised me by being better than I anticipated it. This is how you make a Superman movie! It's time to let go of the Donner films. That version of our hero simply does not work for our time. This is a raw Supes who can kick some serious butt. As a matter of fact, I wish the last fight was longer... That's how good it was. Ignore the critics and go enjoy this amazing film.",1
487,"I was uncertain whether this was going to be a redo of a redo or what, but one needn't worry.  Although the general plot elements that make it Superman were there, IMO, this is a new movie.  The elements that make it familiar are present, but the ideas injected into the story essential remake it.  It's not heroic DC, it's science fiction, and good science fiction.  It also has a injection of realism that a welcome change from the saccharin fare usually in this genera of film.  People in the audience actually applauded at the film's end.",1
488,"I just saw Man of Steel last night & I was blown away.﻿ I got a little sentimental watching Superman back on the big screen, reminded﻿ me when I was little watching Christopher Reeve being Superman. So much hype & I was not let down.Also this movie really really makes up for Superman Returns which was﻿ just an insult & just plain atrocious.",1
489,Man of Steel is by far the best Superman movie yet. Main selling points for me were: 1. No Kryptonite. I liked seeing Superman having to battle super cosmic forces such as giant interstellar gravity terraforming  machines (which were freaking awesome looking btw) 2. You actually got to see more of the alien culture from which the man of steel was spawned. Russel Crow was a kickass superdad. 3. It wasn't a cliche linear film where it starts with superman as a baby to child to teen to adult. It goes from baby to adult then cutting to flashbacks of revelvant-to-the-plot anecdotes. Very well done and will keep you thoroughly entertained.,1
490,I was a huge fan of Superman 1 and 2. I did not have high hopes for a reboot. This movie was amazing! Superman looked tough. The beginning of the movie is fantastic. There is not a boring spot in the whole movie. The villains were cool. I will see this in theaters more than once and from me that is saying a lot. I hope they make many more just like this one.,1
491,"This is a new beginning for man of steel, but the action can be some annoy, but the plot is good, and this movie is excellent for christopher nolan and David goyer.",1
492,"This is the Superman movie i had been waiting for in a long time. Henry Cavill is perfect as Clark Kent/Superman and Amy Adams is also great as Lois Lane. It´s not a masterpiece, but it is a great summer blockbuster!",1
493,One of the better superman movie. don't go by metascore go watch it by yourself. Superman has always been powerful but in this movie you really feel it. This may not be acurate to the comic book superman which could be reason for low metascore.,1
494,"I did not like this movie.  Watching (nearly) indestructable people throw each other into objects is pretty boring.  Then Superman simply breaks the bad guys neck...like why didn't he just do that in the first place.  Looking back on it I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from watching it.  I like some of  Zach Snyders other movies, this screwed the pooch in my opinion.",0
495,"It kind of breaks my heart to see anyone give this movie a high rating, it means that two-dimensional,  formulaic movies are more important than character and story.  And when you're talking about an iconic character like Superman, I think that's almost a crime.  From the get-go, when CGI monsters are attacking Krypton, I knew things were off.  The introduction of an ""S"" as meaning something Kryptonian is also just silly.  There's not even a breath of the Clark Kent many of us grew up reading and watching in film and movies  this is a total 'reimagining'  this Kent is charmless and dour, and ruled largely by fear in this movie.  Fear of being found out, fear of being different.  A Superman crafted of these elements tells a totally different story  it was never Superman's though.  It was Batman's, Spider-Man's, and a ton of other heroes, but never Superman's.  The dialogue is so stiff and cheesy, which might work in a comic-book interpretation  but here they're trying to make Superman into something emo and pouty, so it just comes off as contrived.  The effects are okay and the action works, but that's where all the attention went  and for a movie about the origins of a superhero, such a lack of character development is surprising.  Then there's just stuff like people wandering around in arctic climates in just a coat, no problem  that sort of thing.  But the biggest sin of this movie is that instead of being thoughtful, soulful fun built around very solid characters, like the Christopher Reeve movies, this one tries to make huge over-the-top action sequences be the 'fun' part.   I just feel it falls short on so many levels.  We're not supposed to think of Superman as badass.  We're supposed to think of him as our greatest advocate and defender  a man of unwavering character who doesn't have to think twice about motive or intent.  He always does the right thing, the good thing.  He's SUPERMAN.  Here he's just an 'every guy' trying to make it in this world with superpowers.  Superman was always bigger than that.  It is in fact what set him apart from all the Spider-Mans, Wolverines, Green Lanterns, Avengers, etc etc etc.  Oh sure, he played cat-and-mouse with his identity (a single pair of glasses magically managed that for him for decades), but I don't think the intent of the story was ever to feel bad about his role, almost like he's a victim.  Superman always was, and always should be, a representative of the opposite of that  he's the guy who never thinks twice about his role or place and just always strives to do what's right by the human race  and does it with a smile.  All while being a nerdy reporter on the side.  I don't know where any of this went.",0
496,"this movie is a pretentious ego trip for david goyer, christopher nolan and zack snyder.it has little to no character development or structure, it's all symbolism and talk with vary little substance and the product placement was just sad",0
497,"Truly dreadful. I was amazed at how bad it was. I had medium to high expectations when I decided to finally watch it, and maaan was I disappointed. Truth be told, I fell asleep during the movie, and had to watch the rest of it the next day. I am very sad that I did. It sucked!",0
498,"Hells Yeah Zacky, you did the Kryptonian Justice!!!This is by far the best Superman film to date. Changes Zack did to Superman that were long overdue- 1) No more lame ass cheesy retarded boyscout commentary from the man from Krypton. 2) No more distant cold character development. Kal El feels real. You don't see him fly, you believe he can fly, and you can finally relate to the character like never before. 3) No more half-assed boyscout action sequences. ""I am sorry citizen, I will have to take that puny gun from you, and put it in the garbage, and fly you over to the police. You behavior is childish and I won't have it, the ciry wont have it... And don't forget to use the sub-way, it is the safest way to travel"". Derp. 4) Got rid of that god awful excuse of a disguise (at least with Loise) which even a retard would see through much less a Pulitzer prize winner that has been saved by this man a dozen times. 5) No more the child becomes miraculously a super-hero crap. A reboot that finally explains the character and puts depth to him. May Zack live long and prosper to make every Superman film from here on out (that was from the wrong film wasn't it? Ah well, it fits in this case). Things to love about this film. Well, the action of-course. The psychological and sentimental story underlining everything is so deep it blows any other single Superhero film I have seen to this day out of the water. Amazing. Never thought so much depth could be added to such a character. Other elements the story touches on with regards to visitors from outer space, on hope, on so many concepts this film is simply hitting the mark on every single thing it does. The threat of the film was real. It was the best introduction and the best way to reveal Superman to Metropolis. It also fit perfect with the intro on Krypton which was such an amazing scene a film could exist on that alone. The end result is that it all makes sense. The villains make sense, and there is depth to them. They are not mindless jerks trying to do bad or steel some diamonds or what have you. The theme behind their own needs and goals (the villains) puts more depth to it all on a level that makes the steaks high even for the villains. It comes together so perfectly. And the entire pace of the film, with gradual flashbacks, explains and gives us a wonderful look into Kal El's upbringing, explaining further the reasoning behind him trying to help people out. He saves enough people in this film but not that much, as this is not the point to the film and it is all about him ""revealing"" himself to humanity. The mistakes he is forced to go through and make make him even more relatable, and create enough controversy that perfectly set up the next chapter, Batman v Superman. Snyder has absolutely hit the mark. I enjoyed this film a million times more than I ever did the Avengers. The story alone was so much deeper and carefully scripted and paced. The action at the end was a little long understandably for some, but after rewatching it I am glad it is that long. The perfect coming-out-of-his-shell for the Man of Steel. Once more, the Greek Mythology underlining in many areas was a perfect touch as well. Simply perfect. Gives the sense of an ancient god with Kal El being from another planet and all, though I wont elaborate much on this as there are plenty wonderful hints underlining the amazing direction Snyder took in this film that few will understand and fewer still appreciate. That is how deep this film goes. p.s, (spoilers) to all those **** about the destruction caused in the City. The casualties were minimal, a large crater had been already created in the city from the terraforming machine. Supes had hardly anything to do with all that when he was tossed and fought through several buildings alone against his will. Or was he meant to stop the fight and talk to a crazed Zod that cared less to fight Superman and simply wanted to kill people, and tell him ""not so fast general, there are civilians here, I would kindly ask you to move this outside were we can finish it like men"" Herp Derp.... Human nature of blaming Supes on all the destruction is evident even in the haters, which again, sets up for an even more realistic and believable premise to Batman v Superman. Simply, awesome, on so many levels!!! A deserved 10/10. I think I have watched this film 5 times more than I ever watched Avengers to this date. It is amazing.",1
499,"Critics are being too harsh on this film, but the more i think about it, the more I understand why. Unlike other recent hero films, this isn't the first film adaptation for the character, thus the general pop has differing views on how the character should be portrayed. I can understand that the alien focus on Superman can be jarring. Overall it's an above average, pretty good origin film. While It gets a bit overboard in the third act,  I occasionally wished for more Clark Kent flashbacks, and the pacing is a tad iffy throughout the film, overall it's highly entertaining, and has that fantastic visual flair that only Zack Snyder can produce. The cast does a fantastic job, particularly Amy Adams who has no issue portraying the feisty-ness of Lois Lane, yet also showing a tender side we haven't seen since Margot Kidder  7/10One final thought on the mixed critical reception *yet positive reaction from the general public* Of course opinions differ from person to person but it's becoming blatantly obvious which critics wear blinders for their favorite directors and how biased film critics have become.",0
500,"a Superman film that's embarrassed to be Superman, Lois exists for the sole job of Exposition, No emotional impact at all like the Trailers sold it to have. but hey if you like Transformers 3 and cant wait to see Transformers 4 this is the perfect movie for you, a Main actor who is as good as a Plank of wood with a cape, Action that's just there to blow  up and a resolution that leaves even the dumbest DC fanboys in shock as to just how dumb it is. 1/10 and that 1 stands for the 1 time i saw the film and will never watch this train wreck gain.",0
501,"Es monumental, es ÉPICA, es colosal, tiene momentos emocionantes, que se me ponía la piel de gallina,  por fin vemos a Superman haciendo cosas de Superman después de lo basura que fue Superman Returns, espero mas en la secuela.",1
502,"I am not a fan of superhero movies, but as they go, especially DC Comics, this is definitely one of the weakest and lightest. However, Man of Steel is still entertaining with really cool CGI.",1
503,"I must be getting old or just really old fashioned.  It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't one I'd want to watch again.  It's the worst ""Superman"" movie I've ever seen.",0
504,"A joyless 2+ hour long video game cinematic that forgot to include the ""hero"" in superhero.  If the endless DBZ fighting scenes and mindless punching are your thing, yeah, you'll enjoy it.  The movie kept talking about 'hope' and Clark being destined for more, but when the world is falling around him you expect him to at least occasionally save lives along the way.  I don't have a problem with how the fight with Zod ended, but I do have a problem that the buildup wasn't there so the victory/choice wasn't truly earned.  After thousands of people die (which he stops to stand over their corpses to kiss Lois, ugh not a romantic moment), he suddenly cares about four idiots in a subway who don't know how to run away?  Not convincing.  This frat boy punch face stuff just does not comprehend the heart and joy of the Superman franchise. Also, blatant commercial plugs for IHOP, Sears, etc were farrrr too blatant. The only reason this movie is not getting a '0' is because Zod was a well-acted, well-portrayed villain despite the strange voice impediment, and the Krypton stuff at the beginning was fun (though again, favored action over depth, at least it had more depth than the rest of the movie). This movie also has the most pointless death ever.  Because even though he's fast enough to be a blur, they needed some B.S. dramatic moment that 'looked cool' for some dumbass reason. Awful movie.  Made me realize how much better Superman Returns was because of all the things it got right despite being a flawed movie. Don't watch Man of $teel.  With any luck the Batman/Superman movie will be better, but I doubt it, because jock-brained Zach Snyder is still helming it.",0
505,"It goes beyond what we thought about the man of steel character. This movie is way ahead of it. It shows what really we all have been waiting for: soundtrack, acting, and mostly action",1
506,Most underrated movie this movie is a masterpiece people didn't like it because it wasn't marvel which is kid material and this is a new look for superman that I would love to see dc adapt to even there comics and I think people should watch it again so they can rethink about what to rate this its a 10 movie even the flight scene was probably one of the best scene of all time in any superman movie,1
507,"The movie felt shorter to me than the run-time. As for some complaints about not resolving relationships and such, this movie is meant to establish such relationships and complications, so they can be explored and resolved in the sequels, right? Superman has been around for 75 years, so I think it is hard for some viewers to recognize that this movie presents us with a neophyte hero  this is the first time he's wearing the suit and making tough decisions. As long as the character grows into the icon in the sequels, then it's a good thing. Do we really want a character, in an origin story, that has nowhere to develop? And that's what this movie felt like to me, an introduction to Superman, not a summation of the character. I give it 8.5 out of 10 (rounding up to 9 because I'm a geek). It's a solid movie with all the action anyone could have wanted (too much for some, but great for me, bring it on). It doesn't reinvent superhero movies but Man of Steel is certainly among the best of the genre. Sadly, the hopes and the hype were so high that the fact that it isn't overwhelmingly great has hurt the movie's reception. I recommend it to superhero and action fans without reservation. To those who aren't fans of either genre, I say this. Surrender within twenty-four hours ... A couple critiques. The shaky-cam effect is kind of jarring, especially in the opening scenes. For a moment, I was wondering if Krypton was having earthquakes in the early scenes, until I realized the camera-work was just a visual conceit. The tremor-vision calms down eventually, and for most of the movie, but returns for little, annoying bursts when least expected. Second, there are a couple actions that Clark takes (or doesn't take  i.e. the tornado scene) that seem out of character. Per my point above, about character development, I believe (hope?) that these decisions will be revisited in the sequels.",1
509,"Amazing film, but if you're looking for another typical, wise cracking superhero film then this is not the one for you. This is a sci-fi film, through and through. It explores first contact. Those that are critical of a lack of warmth, emotion and humour in the main protagonist, seem to be missing the point. He's an alien! Does he lack humanity? No, but he's been trying to find his path and a sense of belonging for 33 years. It's something I've struggled with in adulthood and I'm from this planet! (Mum,I am from this planet, aren't I? Mum?!?) All of the characters were well written and well acted. The 2 father figures were particularly impressive. It was good to see Jor El get some serious screen time and back story. Likewise, it was interesting to see more of Krypton than we ever have before. The world and its people became more real than ever. You felt a real sense of the impending doom that would befall their planet and the effect that would have on their (Zod and his followers) ""humanity"". There is perhaps one criticism that is being levied at the film by critics that I would regard as fair. The action is intense (which is good), but it could be said (or rather, IS being said) that the action scenes are too long. I accept the point, but we are talking about near indestructible super beings fighting against other near indestructible super beings! However, the amount of action perhaps had the effect of blunting the senses somewhat. But if there was less, would we be suggesting the film was less epic? Perhaps, and it is for that reason that I would not be too critical of seeing such action on screen. Watch it. Love it. Get excited for a sequel!",1
510,"This movie is without a doubt the best Superman movie ever made. What has Superman always lacked....action that meets with the character's powers. This movie has action in spades, and it is not too much. It is perfect. It is what I always wanted to see. There is enough story, some of it quite compelling. The best part is watching Supes transform from being unsure of himself and who he is at the beginning and turning into the Superman/Clark Kent that we are more familiar with... all twinkling eye and the boy scout smile by the end. But really, the action and speed and power of the fight sequences are really astounding. You believe this man is THAT strong and THAT fast. Word of warning. See it in 2-D. If I had seen it in 3-D, I would have thrown up It seems the bad reviews are mostly from people who saw it in 3-D. This thing moves, people, and if I had seen it in 3-D, it would have been too much of a good thing. My final verdict: Better than Avengers (a tiny little bit), as good as the Dark Knight (maybe a little tiny bit worse), and as good as the 1978 Superman (maybe a little tiny bit better). Better than the first Iron Man and the Spider Man and X-Men films (by a good margin). Makes Green Lantern look like something drawn by my infant son.",1
511,"Epic...Finally a good Superman,  alot of action and epic special effects. The visual was perfect. For me this is the movie of the year...Plz sequel and justice league ASAP ",1
512,This movie really soared above my expectations and competes for the greatest superhero film. Comic book fan or not this movie is a lot of fun and will keep you at the edge of your seat for sure!,1
513,"An absolutely spectacular arrangement of action and character development. The movie isn't paced like most others, opting for a more unique approach. It divides itself into massive scale action sequences and lengths of character exploration. Most reviewers have been put off by the massive scale, hour long action sequence near the end, but they seem to forget the thematic exploration of Clark's character that came before it. Superman as the depiction of the perfect immigrant? You have Clark coming in and doing various oddjobs to try and make a living before he finally finds his calling, and even then he is submit to scrutiny. Superman as a paradoxical character with a strength that is also a weakness? You have some pivotal scenes where Superman is forced to make a decision for the greater good despite his morals. Indeed at several points in the film, the villains themselves outright state this theme- that Clark's morals make him weaker. In addition to that, you have Clark's brilliant social predicament as a whole once again laid out perfectly. This absolutely incorruptible, truly good person manages to still somehow be put through a sad and lonely life. In addition to the thematic exploration being done masterfully by writer David S. Goyer, you have the incredibly character performances. Henry Cavill portrays a humble (if humorless) Kal El/Clark Kent who is always willing to do the right thing on his own terms. His facial expressions and overall body language enrich the film's quality immensely. The look of apprehension the first time he dons the cape and faces the threat. The look of weakness when he realizes that the enemy who has just slammed him into a wall possesses the same powers as him. The look of stern coldness as Superman taunts the main villain. The white hot intensity when Superman turns aggressive. It's all done superbly by Cavill. The aforementioned main villain is also an absolute powerhouse. General Zod is played by Michael Shannon (famous for his ability to simulate anger). General Zod's character as a whole is one of the most surprisingly good parts about the film. Sharply contrasting with Terence Stamp's cold blooded ""kneel inducing"" Zod, Shannon plays a megalomaniac bent on trying to restore life to his long dead race. You truly feel sympathy for Zod, but are no less satisfied when his character arc reaches its payoff. Shannon's portrayal is raw, threatening, and downright scary. He really has a way with eyes, being able to intimidate pretty much anyone he wants to. Superman's father, Jor-El, happens to be one of those people. He is played by Russel Crowe. There's really not much else to say here but the fact that he absolutely kills the role. The supporting cast all do their jobs very well, but are given rather little to work with. This should be more or less expected, considering the movie's marketing as Superman's origin story. Standout performances include Antje as the menacing-yet-sexy supporting villain Faora, Amy Adams as the adorable-yet-tough love interest Lois Lane, and Kevin Costner as the moral guidance of Jonathan Kent (Clark's father). There are some issues with the movie. The action scenes do indeed feel too drawn out at some points. This can be seen in the middle 20 minutes of the last action scene where the movie ends up feeling like a Michale Bay-esque building dropper. Fortunately, the action builds up even more, and ends up with a climax so exhilarating that it would take three Avengers movies to top it. As said before, the pacing is unique, but still strangely polarizing. The film is content with simply dividing the action and story development scenes into sections, instead of integrating them with each other and creating a coherent flow throughout the movie. And, above all, the film truly is devoid of humor. While this is a new Superman film, some of the humility (and humanity) of the original Clark Kent in the Richard Donner films came from trivial things that would happen to Clark. Fortunately, the ending of the film leads into something that may indicate a return to this style of humor in the future. The movie does contain some absolutely massive, drawn out action sequences. It is also paced in a strangely polarizing way, and the film is devoid of a lot of the humor that characterized the Richard Donner films. But one must not ignore the thematic explorations of the characters that came with those things and dismiss the film as a ""generic blockbuster."" Truly, with the teeming sci fi world of Krypton, strong character performances, and thematic respect to Superman's character, it is anything but. This movie scores a 9.5/10. Since Metacritic does not allow for 9.5s, and the critical response seems to be rather mixed, the score was rounded to a 10. ____ This is my girlfriend's cousin's review. I'm just relaying it here. I haven't watched the film yet myself, but as a longtime Superman fan, the talk of thematic exploration excites me to no end.",1
514,"Great movie, the character of Superman is above that of Bale as Batman or any other superhero. He is Stoic and reminds me of Gosling in drive. Doesnt need to say much or emote much and that is what makes you interested in him. The character drove me a lot. The story was great too!",1
515,"Somewhat humorless and a few silly story elements, but spectacular set pieces and visuals.  Even acting throughout.  A nice, different kick at the can at the Superman character.  First movie to really show how powerful Superman really is in the comic books.  (without oddities like turning back time or memory-sapping kisses)  Thoroughly enjoyed it despite it's problems.",1
516,"Best superman film yet!! The story was pretty dark, serious, and kinda emotional-thanks to Nolan of course. The action was amazing, the last 25-30 mins were non-stop over the top action-thank you Zack Snyder. The story of course was really good, talked about krypton which was good, how Superman/Clark Kent learn about his origin and how his step father taught him to be a better person when he was young. Lots of moral lesson in this film which I like. The pacing of the film was okay..I wished they took their time talking more about Superman/Clark when he was young. Overall the film was awesome, action was intense, cgi was top notch, and the story was dark and serious. Can't wait for a sequel.",1
517,"I'm a bit baffled by the general panning of this movie by the critics, because I thought it was a hell of a movie to watch. The action sequences were all very well orchestrated and never became boring; along those lines, I thought Snyder did a great job of melding a sci-fi movie with a big summer action movie. I was a little worried before I saw it, given all of the bad reviews, but I would highly recommend it. Great action movie, well worth the money.",1
518,"very entertaining movie with fight scenes that shows how superhumans fight. but something was lacking.christian bale was batman, rdjr is iron man... but henry, just wasn't superman enough. but hey, maybe because its just begun... we did not get to see the clark kent we all know till the end. MUST watch!",1
519,"This film was everything I expected out of a Director-Writer combo like this, that is Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan, respectively.  In my deepest opinion, I believe the writer/director team can make or break a film as easy as a twig as far as audience satisfaction is concerned.  Well, they definitely showed up for this film, and supported a beloved superhero no less.  This film was more ""realistic"" approach to Superman's origin.  It covered the short demise of Krypton, and was just enough screen time to understand why it happened, and for Superman's transit to Earth via Krypton. To make a great story short, this movie is loaded with tons of action, great acting, and great replay value.  You won't be disappointed.",1
520,"A nearly flawless film, to me. I loved each and every scene and I never found myself ""bored"" with what was going on, even during all the exposition. I really enjoyed what they did with the character, and mythology in general. The plot was simple and fun, the villain was fleshed out surprisingly well (which is something superhero movies in general don't do too much these days). And the effects are out of this world, I walked out of the theater like I just came off a roller coaster, with this feeling of excitement in my chest. I think that's the best way to describe this movie. A really amazing roller coaster. The emotional scenes were also tastefully done and I had all the feels for Clark through out the movie.",1
521,"Batman focused on being based in reality, The Spiderman reboot focused on science, Man of Steel focuses on Aliens as its tool to make the world believable. Great action, great acting, and goyers story is phenomenal as usual. That being said, there are some problems, mainly the non stop advertisements during one of the action sequences bothered me allot. The pacing is a little odd but seems like I may get used to it on a second watch. Last thing is I wish I laughed more then twice during the movie, if the movie has any fault it's in its non stop seriousness. But if you don't expect this to be an iron man 3 and more like the nolan batman universe your in for a treat.",1
522,"I was so relieved. Its good. Its really good. Critics and Audiences with a longing for the Christopher Reeve era may not find it as appealing. But Snyder has made a Superman for the new century. Henry Cavill as Superman is fantastic. He has made the role his own for at least a few more Superman movies. I would like to see Clark Kent explored a bit more. But the twists and changes made by Zack Snyder and the awesome action pieces manage to make the movie work brilliantly. There is a balance, between Goyer's Screenplay and the emotional and wonderful acting of Russel Crow; the menacing Zod, & Snyder's action and attention to detail. It was just short of perfect, but maybe that is our expectations getting in the way. In any case, this sets the stage for Man of Steel 2, which I feel will surpass even my high expectations. Ultimately, at the end of this movie, there is a feeling of relief and a big thank you to everyone involved in this movie. They finally....made the right superman movie.",1
523,"Zack Snyder's vision to deliver a ""one of a kind"" Superman movie was clear  and that's what Snyder does by delivering one of the best Superman movies ever.  Henry Cavill shines as the lead  he is perfect for the title role.  Cavill has the physical presence the role requires, the masculine voice that makes him a confident hero, and the artistic ability to add layers of dimension and vulnerability.  Michael Shannon creates a conflicted and compelling villain (General Zod) and is almost overtaken by his side-kick Faora (Antje Traue)  who poses a greater personal risk for the Man of Steel. Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) does really well  she's not the helpless woman depicted by the animated series.  She's tough, in a Pepper Potts (from Ironman) sort of a way.  Like Adams, Diane Lane (as Martha Kent) is great.  It's Cavill's interactions with these two woman that provide the greatest depth for his character  a nice touch. And if you're a film aficionado who loves movie-music, Hans Zimmer's score is masterful, as is this film's sound-mixing. Can't wait for the sequel, which already has confirmed key players, and ultimately the Justice League movie! Note:  There is no mid or end credit scene.  Bummer.",1
524,"This Movie is F'ing awesome.  This is what I want to see in a Superman movie.  I felt exhilarated and into the movie.  Now in saying that make no mistake that this not the Donner Superman movie, as this is not based on the silver age comic book Superman, Think John Byrne's Man of Steel comic book series or post crisis.  This is a God with God like powers living in card board world.  The pace wasn't a problem for me as I didn't expect Superman to be Superman yet, which is why they don't say that word alot in the film. Its not Lois and Clark with a bigger budget so don't expect a love story, expect a super powered being with real problems and a kick ass last 45 minutes and I promise you'll love it just as much as I did.",1
525,"It's the pointed focus on science fiction that elevates Man of Steel beyond that of just another Superman movie, Cavill is more than serviceable as our hero, Khal-El, while Crowe and Costner provide strong acting from the supporting roles. The action sequences are immaculate EPIC!!",1
526,"THE REBOOT SUPERMAN NEEDED. I was instantly drawn to this movie, by the time I saw the extended trailer. It lived up to my expectations. Zack Snyder blew me away (as always) with his STUNNING Visuals! David S. Goyer writes a captivating and interesting story about hope. The whole movie is packed to the punch with heavy hitting action. It will remain a superhero favourite in my mind. I give a 10/10... a 100%! A+ Film of the Summer of 2013!!!",1

530,"Man of Steel serves as a triumphant and bold return after the box office disappointment that was Superman Returns. Henry Cavill is brilliant as Superman. He plays the role with conviction and passion. All of the cast was well picked, and they all fit their roles. This Superman goes farther into Kal-El/Clark Kent's back story. As Krypton's core is collapsing, Jor-El(Russell Crowe) and Lara(Ayelet Zurer) have just given birth to the first natural baby in centuries. Unfortunately, the Council of Krypton refuse to stop drilling for resources from the core, and Jor-El and Lara send their son, Kal-El, to Earth so he can live a better life. He lives without being exposed of this information for 33 years, until General Zod(Michael Shannon), the former military leader of Krypton which is now nothing. Now Zod is leading his group into Earth to populate and overthrow the people of Earth. Superman must work to protect the people of Earth from the Kryptonians. The Special Effects in this movie are amazing. The only major complaint which I've  also seen with other people is the last scene. It's 45 minutes of mayhem. While I felt it was an epic conclusion to an epic blockbuster, 45 minutes was certainly way too long and upset many people in the audience. Overall, anyone who isn't upset by loud noises should definitely see Man of Steel.",1
531,"one of the best movies of this and all times, it is difficult to make a superhero movie that has serious tone and not just romp and jokes. It shows the human side of Kar-El, in trying to be just one of us, but his fate will prepare something bigger ""The ultimate hero of humanity"". It shows a Clark who suffer the consequences of being different, their emotions, their feelings. Facing decisions between who he is or who he should be. The cast was amazing, everything fit to perfection: Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Antje Traue, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne .. The music is beautiful and powerful Indisputably 10/10 Movie",1
532,"This film is incredible, don't take the critics complaints for it. If you do and don't watch this film you'll be missing out on something great. Best pure superhero comic film ever, The Avengers can just quit now.",1
533,"This movie was exactly what I wanted to see with my favorite comic book hero, Superman.  Snyder has that unique ability to take the universes right out of the comic and put them to the big screen.  There are a few things that I still had questions about once the end credits rolled, but it wasn't enough of a drawback to the awe I felt seeing Kal-el, Jor-el, Zod, and especially Faora done so well.  It elaborated the sci-fi element beyond just crystals and more crystals which I thought was an improvement over the older movies.  And Man of Steel may have some plot holes but so did Superman 1-4.  Such as if he can turn back time, why not use that every time a villain gets the upper hand?  You could call it Superman: Groundhog Day.  He just keeps repeating things till he gets it done right.  But despite that people still loved the movies, and I think the critics got it wrong with this one.  I highly recommend checking it out.",1
534,"This, to me, is one of the best Superman movies in history. It was very informative, it educated the audience on who the Man of Steel was/is. I would have given it a 10, but I felt that his childhood should have been incorporated more into the movie, being how the beginning started off. But, overall, I loved this film.",1
535,"Pure exhilaration. Nolan's contributions to the script definitely helped, but it looks like Snyder finally found a story that brings out his best qualities as a director. Probably has the best superhero action scenes ever, to boot. Cavill was born to play this role.",1
536,"The heck with the critics. Thanks to incredible action, a fantastic ensemble, a wonderful original score, fantastic script by David S. Goyer, and an incredible new direction, Man of Steel proves to be the best Superman movie since the original, and it is one of the best comic book movies ever. This is a fantastic reboot to the franchise, and a great start to an inevitable Justice League franchise.",1
537,"Zack Snyder created the Superman film we needed. He gives us some jaw-dropping visuals and an engaging and emotional story about loneliness and finding your mission in life that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Henry Cavill totally nailed the role of Superman in every possible way. He has a strong screen presence and gives the character a naivety that makes you relate to him. He has morals, but still can get angry, sad and desperate. The rest of the cast is great as well.General Zod was written in a very intelligent way because even though he was a force of destruction and violence, you can still understand his motivations.Man of Steel has everything to please both comic book aficionados and average movie goers, and is the perfect Superman movie.",1
538,best movie ever cant see why those critic don't see what I see bunch of idiots that movie was the best got great actors great action bunch of other things,1

Should be oscarized! and Snyder is a true visionary  I'll give it 20/10 if I could!",1
541,"Great Movie, most of critic reviews are nonsense, it is a great start for the new saga of Superman, the only weak points i found are, maybe too much details in the story, and maybe just maybe, too much destruction, but the movie was meant to be made in this way This is all what i expected from a Superman Vs General Zod Battle. Russell Crowe, Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon  acting was terrific. This is an almost perfect beginning for a perfect sequel.",1
542,Great reboot to a much beloved super hero.  As long as you go into this knowing that it is in fact reimagining you won't be to disappointed.  I hope that the keep the sequels coming.,1
543,"It's a Zack Snyder film, but it felt more than that. It was  a great visual spectacle, but cavill could have shown a little more emotion, but Shannon as zod was enough for me, people wanted a more serious superman and this is as serious as anything else, it didn't feel like a Nolan dark knight film. It was Snyder's and it was great.",1
544,I love the new movie because it started again and has finally a new enemy and kept the Lex Luther has a new plot of new players and I think Henry Kabila better at playing the Superman Brandon Roth,1
545,"I went in with high expectations and it managed to meet most of them. Which surprised me, it was fun and it tried to fit a lot in what seemed a short time, but was actually long. I'm sure the next one will have more character development and I can't wait. In short Super!",1
546,"This movie wasn't perfect, but by god it's awesome!  It's so sad that the critics don't feel the same way.  Criticism over the serious tone is probably due to harping upon nostalgia.  This movie is so thoughtful and provocative, and the performances by the actors are phenomenal.  My only sadness is that a quality movie may not get the attention it deserves.",1
547,"The Superman Movie story for this generation. Man of steel has pulled what other Superman movie has never done  this movie has shown us the core of the character and what he can do.

548,"Originally, I had low hopes due to the various negative critical responses. But as soon as I saw this movie at an advanced screening, I realized that those critics can just go die in a box!! MAN OF STEEL is the Superman movie we have all been waiting for!! The action, visuals and cinematography are all brilliant! Now does this movie have flaws? Yes it does. But those flaws can just easily be covered up due to the movie's spectacle. Zack Snyder has never been one of my favorite directors, but I realized that it isn't his fault. He is unluckily paired with amateur writers with scripts and stories that are very blurry or hard to understand. Snyder is a great director; blame David S. Goyer. The only good movies he's done are the Dark Knight movies. The acting in this movie should also be praised. Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Costner all do marvelous jobs portraying their characters. But the real person who should be praised in this movie is Michael Shannon. He literally steals the show due to a powerful performance as General Zod. Here's how I would rank this movie (On a scale of 1-10): Acting- 10Visual Effects- 10Action- 10Story- 9Editing- 9Music- 10Sound-10Cinematography-10 All in all, I rank this movie a 9 out of 10. I would definitely recommend anyone to go see it and I can't wait to see what will be in store for the next movie.",1

550,"I registered here at this site just so I could write about this movie. It is a must see. Saw it on Imax 3d, was incredible. Sound, effects, character developtment, action, pace, everything about this movie was phenomenal. I wasn't going to see it bc I was bored with the Superman story, but this has completely changed my opinion and made me a fan.",1
551,"Man of Steel Review (spoilers) English Version.How is this?. Superman does not kill ever, is not that their only unbreakable rule?. But no, this is a big change for an entire generation of fans of superman. By putting our hero in a world adapted to our reality would be a little improbable it was over pink.Disputes:This ""reboot"" (re-start) of the franchise and the superhero loved and wanted more from all periods presented controversy, as many have surely noticed divided the public into two parts (which you can notice in many of the criticisms this movie is having) those who loved him as my (I'm a superman fan-boy) and they did not like (mostly adult fans of the old iconic superman christopher reeve). The biggest problem is that by generating many changes and break so many rules of the old superman to make it ""fit"" somehow in this generation, takes a break with previous generations. This is where I have seen the iconic movies of reeve and have read comics and everything that surrounds the world of superman tell those generations ""get over it"". It is simple fact, in previous generations superman was so iconic for one simple reason, it worked for them. I believed possible and others, they served as inspiration, because superman is the best thing a person can aspire to be, beyond his powers, the man just does everything right and as it should be. But the idealism of perfection and practically ""utopia"" no longer fits in this reality. Not something that serves us more perfect, utopian, unattainable. We need something more ""credible"" because superman is the most humane thing to be and if it is so human to have problems and difficulties as all of us or possibly much greater than ours. Then a hero who has problems, difficult to adapt, and that to save humanity is to kill someone, it is more credible and more focused on a possible reality like ours, instead of as unattainable utopia of reeve. So the final feature which appears as a reporter superman does not fit all in this new adaptation. Final Score: 9/10 You definitely have to go see it to also form our own opinion. Regardless of the criticism the film is a success statistically speaking in terms of money raised. And are preparing the sequel that if Mr. Nolan confirms again be involved going to be a  They imagine that Nolan do what he did for the guason with Lex Luthor???  I blows my mind to imagine that. Greetings and thank you all for reading  enjoy this new, epic superman that brings our generation, and leave the past behind.",1
552,"Man of Steel is a remarkable film that critics don’t seem to fully understand but audiences everywhere are finding to be easy to love. Before I delve into the core of my review, I need to point out that the argument that this movie was an unnecessary reboot is completely absurd. It has been over 30 years since we had an origin story for Superman! Modern audiences have not been exposed to Superman in any real way ever since (Superman Returns does not count). If anyone deserves a fresh start, it’s Kal-El. Now, regarding the tone of the film, which critics have claimed is too dark and overtly serious, I feel that it works well considering what the filmmakers want to establish. Superman needs to exist in a more realistic world and that’s just what Man of Steel provided. Our world isn’t always happy and Man of Steel does wonders when it explores this very concept. However, I need to point out that Man of Steel is not the dull and lifeless film that critics are making it out to be. On the contrary, there are actually instances in the movie in which I and the rest of the audience broke out laughing. As for the plot, I genuinely believe that Man of Steel delivered a good story. Moviegoers get to see a dramatically different Krypton and are able to watch as Clark develops into the man he is destined to be. While there were issues with pacing, at times, this is easily forgiven considering the breadth of the story the filmmakers were trying to tell. The acting in the movie also happened to be quite excellent. Henry Cavill has a decent amount of dialogue and makes very good use of it. I believe that his Superman might be the best interpretation of the character (yes, even better than the great Christopher Reeve). Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, and the rest of the cast also do an incredible job. However, I need to give special praise to Kevin Costner. His Pa Kent truly is understandable and the love he demonstrates for his son was enough to bring many in the theater to tears. The action in this film is, naturally, amazing. Zack Snyder’s keenness for this stuff shines brightly in the film and I did not ever get tired of what I was seeing. To wrap things up, Man of Steel is a wonderful film and the critical reviews it has been getting show one thing: today’s professional reviewers have become so twisted that they can’t recognize a good film when it’s right before their eyes. Do yourself a favor and go out and see the film for yourself. You’ll love it.",1
553,"Awesooooooooooooooooooooome *_* This film is just perfect You could not ask for a better man of steel or to launch the project justice League I dream since childhood Snyder makes my dream I love you",1
554,this movie sucks so badly. i think superman return 2006 was better then this crap.............................. F THIS MOVIE...................................................................it sucks. the acting is terrible and the action isnt very good,0
555,"Easily best Superman-movie ever made! Script, acting, soundtrack, Superman's costume.. everything is just one big ""WOW!"" There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie!",1
556,"horriblecharacterscostumevillainsstorybattle, action scenesit's really boring to see movies, story that I already know.tired of same superheroes.I like Superman when they rescue people from accidents, disaster, hostage, burglar.but boring when they fight with villains, superheroes villains.",0
557,"What a disappointment!  What a cobbled together reel of clips, jumping from place to place and time to time!  With nonsensical renditions of SOME of the historical elements, and new illusions that make the ongoing story virtually impossible, as Lois knows who he is from the beginning! Also, since no one even knew him before he became the reason for this invasion of Earth and its possible annihilation, who would want the guy around!? And, what's with the incessant destruction, without regard for human life, as they meaninglessly push each other around through buildings, knowing they're supposedly invulnerable! This looks more like another silly effort for a franchise that could be one of the best movies every year it came out, with a lineage like James Bond but superhuman; but they keep getting these troubled, misguided directors who want to recreate the myth!  It's ridiculous!",0
558,"The soulless byproduct of committee thinking: no heart, no warmth, no character, no charm; and a script that has all of the narrative sophistication of the back of a dozen cereal boxes stapled together and left in the rain.",0
559,"This is the best superman movie ever made. Unfortunately, it is still unwatchable.  This movie had a bad plot,and dragged on far too long. The fight scenes all felt like they should have ended 10 minutes befor they actually did. At the half way point I was begging for it to be over. I strongly suggest you avoid this one at all costs.",0
560,"Man of Steel hooked me from start to finish.  The movie is longer than most, but I think the time it takes to lay out the story is time well spent.  It ended up being a more satisfying experience than watching the usual action movie.  I'll be watching it a second time.",1
564,"Convincing and reasonably intelligent re-imagining of how Superman became Clark Kent. Rather more of a piece than the earlier Christopher Reeve films. This time Henry Cavill dons the cloak and tights, in what is a good choice for the comic book hero. The special visual effects are numerous and outstandingly good. Michael Shannon is a fearsome villain in a cast which also includes the ubiquitous Amy Adams (somewhat coasting it here) as Lois Lane.",1
565,"This is an undeniably breathtaking movie.  It's visually spectacular, stunningly atmospheric, which has a lot to do with Hanz Zimmer's score, and anchored by a dramatically weighty story.  The actors are all first rate, especially Michael Shannon as the perpetually bitter villain Zod, and Caville makes a pretty decent Superman.  The one thing I object to though is that in the third act the action does begin to go on for far too long.  The action scenes are all amazingly well done so I won't complain too much but they're too much of a good thing after a while.  Nonetheless, this is on a level way above most superhero movies, filled with smart storytelling, and moments that can't be described as anything but awe inspiring.",1
566,Simply put the critics just need to stop whining and realise that this is a new take on 'Superman' and not the classic Christopher Reeve take on 'Superman'.,1
567,"Nice plot, great actions, and good actors and actresses. It gives a new perspective of Superman movie. Started with giving a dream of making a superhero who can fly in the big screen to expanding it into a new atmosphere in it. Snyder completed two aspects, first to make Superman in reality, how the boy grew up with such powers and complexion, with how people would react his existence, and two....the limitation of his great power when fighting with his enemy. it's just so wow boom bang action indeed. These two are never been explored much in The Superman movie. The only thing that is lacking in this reboot is the love story. Lois' part is one gap that Snyder really doesn't know how to fill. So its quite a waste of  Amy Adams' acting.",1
568,amazing movie can't wait for the sequel superman is back general zod was awesome strong performance man of steel does have some flaws but it makes it up by giving new taste to the grandfather of superheroes,1
569,"I personally loved this movie. It was a pleasure to see and to get engaged into the story and the characters Superman way better than the previous Superman in Superman returns and the others. I felt as if the story and the characters could have had a better thought process thought. Oh so Clark's dad thinks he an outcast and then kills himself for that idea (It was a marvelous scene which was very shocking and amazing) but that doesn't really excuse what humanity is like our survival instincts would have popped up in that situation. But I respect the character and the time they spent developing him. Excellent sci phi, The best I've seen in awhile in comparison to the other movies that came out (The purge,Evil dead) this one is amazing but due to the ending Superman kills Zod and the villans just being dumb. That's what keeps this movie from being a 10/10 100% recommend and I will be buying it when it comes out on Dvd Watch  http://www.angryjoeshow.com/ For game reviews movie reviews and a lot of comedy",1
570,"I absolutely loved this movie. Was it great scriptwise and with some acting?, no. Did it show the Superman I´ve always wanted to see?, ABSOLUTELY. This is Superman.",1
571,"""Man of Steel"", in my opinion, has everything I wanted out of a superhero movie. Superman is decorated with darker shades as far as the overall atmosphere, and the plot seems so engaging. Though many critics have seen the ""flaws"" of this film, I was one of the lucky members of its audience to see the hard work put into making it.",1
572,"A reboot is that, a reboot. An origin story tells the beginning of the character. I loved the new take on our classical and beloved Superman and while shocked by the ending I understand this is the explanation needed for Superman values and personality. There is a lot more to tell and I wish the creative group find its way the present us a modern mature all powered Superman in MOS2",1
573,"First of all, I loved the movie. Zack Snyder and his team really did a great job with this movie. Henry Cavill is in my opinion the best Superman I have ever seen. I can't really say anything bad about this movie. To see Clack Kent on his journey, trying to find himself  it was perfect. Great acting, great story. But you should not see this movie, and expect it is like the ones with Christopher Reeve. Those were good, but like many says, it is time to change something. Just the idea of using the suit from the new 52 was great. I couldn't have taken it serious, if he had the red underwear onIn my opinion, this is the best ""superhero"" movie I have seen, together with The Dark Knight.No movie is perfect, but I can't see the reason why some can it is pure garbage. IT IS NOT. It is a MASTERPIECE in the comic-hero genre.",1
574,"I'll start with the film's biggest flaw: it clearly can be split into 2 short films: 1. A sci-fi character drama about an alien trying to fit into society while struggling to contain and control his superhuman abilities. So this is what the first 4/5 seasons of Smallville should've been. The fact that it's handled via non-chronological flashback gives it dynamism, so it never becomes stale or boring. We even see an awesome version of Krypton, which actually looks alien, unlike Michael Shannon's (General Zod) screaming tantrums. Also, Russell Crowe is a badass Jor-El. But that lasts for like 15 minutes; the real highlights are the Kents (played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and all the child actors whom I don't even want to kill. Good job, Warner! I know I haven't said much of Cavill up until this point, but he doesn't have much to do in this part of the movie, but when he's on screen, he's serviceable and the emphasis is more on the struggles of young/teenage Clark. We get to see the man (/boy) with godlike powers constantly get bullied and emotionally tortured by idiots, a**holes and kids, which makes us see his vulnerability and desire to distance himself from us. When he's an adult though he (sort of) loses his calm once. Also, some citizens of Smallville (sort) of know who Clark really is. That's actually a refreshing and, if you think about it, logical take on the situation. At the end of this almost masterfully put together first hour there's a strange death scene however, which is justified in the movie, but I can see people having an issue with it. 2. Here come the problems (and not just the not ginger Jenny Alsen). This is basically an alien invasion/action movie in which Snyder lets his inner child blow s**t up, just without the slow mo. I'm just going to say: the action is great, made even better with the HD handheld camera perspective and the sound audio effects (along with Hans Zimmer's score of course) and the CGI is amazing. Thrown punches really do have impact and combatant characters don't look like rag dolls on ropes (I'm looking at you, X-Men Origins). Amy Adams is the best Lois Lane in a long time, Laurence Fishburne plays a great white (punpunpuuun) guy (note to Goyer: Perry NEVER says and never would've said ""Now's not the time for journalistic integrity!""), Cavill is actually a perfect fit for the big blue boyscout and Shannon is (somehow) just serviceable; but the menacing Faora (played by Antje Traue) steals the show for the time she's on screen. Oh, and the Lois (at that point he didn't have the name, so let's call him) Hopeman interrogation scene was awesome. Not quite this awesome though. Now for the major (yet minor... Well, f***k you too!) flaws: - Superman punches Zod into Smallville when there's nothing but wide open (uninhabited) fields surrounding them. That's now very cost or human life friendly there, Clarkie. AND right after this Martha Kent remains with Faora and a Kryptonian Pain and Gain reject AND THEY DON'T KIDNAP HER; because who needs leverage against Superman? - Necessary (almost like racism in Transformers) military-bro eye bonding moments. Because nothing says America more than the good old (red, white  Blue Steel. - Unnecessarily long action scene with a dubstep squid robot/ship, but I'm okay with that. Even spell check hates dubstep and so should Superman. If Skrillex is Lex Luthor in Batman vs Superman, I'm giving it 10/10 right now, because yes, dubstep is humanity's biggest enemy. Right after Adam Sandler. - The only Kryptonian scientist has a (glorious and) heavy German accent; in case you haven't noticed that the genocidal aliens with superiority complex are space Nazis. - Another controversial death scene that really could have been executed, pun intended, better. - More people die than there are Justin Bieber fans in Kansas, yet they don't get any kind of a memorial service or ceremony and that's just cold. If the movie specified they really were Girl Wonder followers, it would be a different story. A final and omnipresent flaw of the movie is the lack of humor. It's unfortunate, but the character stuff evens that out. The guy with the weight of the world on his shoulders needs some light hearted moments every now and then. In all seriousness, as you may have noticed, most of the problems are minor and my biggest flaw (the easy separation in 2 parts) isn't even a one if you don't mind heavy, dense action. Maybe it might have been a good idea to mix punches with tears and words a little bit more often for the sake of more action-phobic movie goers. Irregardless, Snyder still does far more right than wrong and this is definitely a huge step forward for him as a director. So, Man of Steel soared mightily, stumbled a bit at the last few yards, but still reached the Sun without falling. It's one of my favorite movies of the year, along with Iron Man 3 (I’m guessing up until I see Elysium).",1
575,"Although rather loosely based on the Superman story, this movie provides a fantastic kick start for a new superman. In a era of Iron Man and The Avengers for the superman story to survive it needs to adapt. I believe this movie is a step in that direction. Stunning special effects and strong performances from the leading actors makes for a must see movie.",1
576,"We start this re-boot of the Superman franchise respectively on Superman's home planet, Krypton. There we are told by Jor-El (Russel Crowe) that the Kyrptonians have used up their resources and that their planet won't last much longer. But their meeting is interrupted by a revolt, lead by the military General Zod (Michael Shannon). The planet is in turmoil, but during the revolution Jor-El manages to send his only son off the planet to escape the planet's doomed fate. Cut to thirty years later where we find Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) on a fishing vessel. An oil rig is on fire and he goes in to save the workers. We are told the rest of his story through a series of flashbacks as he continues on his journey to find his purpose. He was found by Martha and Jonathan Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner respectively) and raised to hide his powers because his father believed the world wasn't ready for him. Clark now has to make the choice, whether he is ready for the responsibility or if he will continue to hide his true self.The script written by David S. Goyer (known for co-writing Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy) is very well done and the dialogue sounds very good. But the film falls with the performances, nearly all of them don't give the energy or emotion that should come out of a script like this. It's sad to see this script go to waste.On a visual aspect, the effects are very good for the most part but only when you can see them. The camera work in Man of Steel isn't all that great. If it's not a stationary shot then the camera is unbelievably shaky and the scenes are very hard to depict. Sadly though for being a film by director Zack Snyder, Man of Steel was rather lacking on great visuals, especially compared to his earlier films like Watchmen. Although we are left with one great moment that looks like it came straight out of a comic book and it's meaning sparked debate between my friends and myself.And even though I've been complaining about a lot of the aspects of the film, I did have a good time watching it. The action was very intense and the ending was absolutely stupendous. I'm really excited to see where they will go if the producers decide to make a sequel. Overall it was a joy to see and it outshines the last reboot, Superman Returns, by a long shot.",1
579,"all around it was good with things like effects, action, dialog and so on but i fell that the back story about Clark's past was a bit rushed but at least it was not to long",1
580,"After watching Man of Steel the first time I had mixed feelings, its was an amazing new take. Especially compared to the previous films. The was so much action going on throughout the film.But after watching it for the second time i really appreciate this movie in all its own glory. The time was ripe for the new take on the franchise, and Zack did it great, from the actors to the abrupt ending which only show how much the superman character cares about all life in general! Great Movie the more you watch it and can't wait for the sequel!",1
581,"Finally a Superman movie the way it's supposed to be. Sure I had some minor problems with it (Lois' character ends up becoming a sidekick, some continuity issues), but overall, the directors do a great job of showing why he is the 'Man' of Steel. There's moments of genuine tension because one actually doesn't know if Superman is going to be able to save the day. ""How is he going to do it?"" is a valid question in this film, unlike Brian Singer's 2006 martyr depicting disaster in which it was just assumed that Superman somehow wins (aside from the incredibly stupid plot). Focusing on the origin story also gives us insight into the superhero abilities of the character and the limits of his power; not the god like omnipotent Superman that critics love, but a superhero with abilities and powers that have weaknesses (otherwise Green Lantern would never be a match for Superman). This is a movie that will delight fans of the superhero and the comics, not over intellectualizing critics who love the 'idea' of Superman and what he represents. As for the action  a nicely nefarious and destructive earth-destroying plot by the bad guys, fleshed out with some great graphics and art work. Good fight scenes that see Supe getting variously pummelled and also doling out some beatings. Again, that doesn't seem to appeal to the critics who slammed the film for 'too much action'. Dude, this is Superman; if you want character development, watch Pride and Prejudice. Ironically, the critics miss their own portentous pretentiousness when they at once claim the film is too sombre (I think it has an appropriately dark mood) and then ask why the characters and love story aren't the focus. Superman; action-film; ass kicking; excellent. They also seem to miss that Nolan and Snyder manage to masterfully highlight how being a child of two worlds is the central dichotomy of Superman's character and how it hurts him to be alone. It’s not a maudlin love for Lois Lane that’s tearing him apart, it’s the loss of his parents, his planet, his past, his people. He is evolutionarily superior to humans, but chooses to protect them out of love. That is the essence of the character, an idea that previous films have touched upon but never delved into, including the classic, but campy, 70's films. A lot of criticism focused on how the duality of Clark  Superman is missing, while missing this obvious duality between the human and the alien that is actually what Superman is about. More to the point, comparisons to the previous ‘Nice-guy’ Superman of yore and the whole idea that the character has lost his ‘innocence’ are almost nauseating; the whole reason Superman is amazing is because he’s a bad-ass, not because he’s a nice guy. In the 70’s it was possible to be a nice guy, witty bad ass, like Chris Reeve, but that kind of humour is completely passé today. The film does have genuine moments of comedy, but they are situational and not forced or driven by an innate image of the character. This Superman is a genuine bad-ass, quite unlike Brendan Routh. Comparisons to The Avengers also miss the point; The Avengers’ quirky humour is a part of the Marvel universe; DC comics have always had a darker, more serious, tone to them that the producers put across well in this film. All in all, a film that critics are sure to hate but that audiences are sure to love.",1
582,the best superman movie i've ever seen.....the origin of superman is so boldly represented at this movie which really is awesome. i like the appearance of superman very much. specially the costume is extraordinary than any other superman movies or series es. the actions were amazing. it sets superman as a real hero in each and every mind i think.......,1

587,"A compelling gritty story and a different take on The Man Of Steel we've not seen on film before but closer to the comic book incarnation. You have to accept change and a different Superman to what you've seen in previous movies to like Man Of Steel a lot of critics have disliked this but gave Superman Return's a good review why i don't know because Man Of Steel cast wise, story and character interpretation and the new take of this character is so much more compelling, touching and action orientated. It's the Superman story and the musical score is brilliant not one minute of the movie do you think of the original score. I was amazed, you can't please all of the people. you get three set's of fan's the hardcore DC fan's who will understand this take and like and love the movie. The cinema goers who love Superhero movie's and will like this because they want to be entertained and come out and be wowed then the fan's who are picky, go to a cinema to be negative, go to a cinema to come out and say that was horrible i liked Superman return's even though a week they hated Superman Return's. Who ever hasn't seen Man Of Steel then ask the first & second category of movie goers.",1
588,"I do not like superman. This character is so fabulous and right that could not sympathize with the emu . Because he can stop time circled around the planet and moving planet. But Zack Snyder managed to bring it closer to the common man. Snyder remade the image of Superman. He took off his red underpants over blue pants , showed us how difficult it is to him to accept the fact that he is not from this planet , and that's his fault so many people died .Now opinion about the movie. The film begins with a scene of birth of Superman ( Henry Cavill ) . General Zod ( Michael Shannon ) conceives revolution in krypton . Father of Superman 's ( Russell Crowe ) against Zod and kidnaps its confluence with the code body of Kal-El. He gives Kal-El write your opinion . Zod and his revolutionaries sent into space. Krypton explodes , and we came to earth . Clark Kent seems to us exile rolling from one place to another. He lives with his adoptive mother, Martha Kent ( Diane Lane ) on the farm. Through a series of memories, we know from childhood moments Clark. As he realized who he really is , how he learned to cope with their own . Suddenly the earth invades General Zod to turn the land into a new Krypton . Superman must stop him . Man of Steel appears to us a new reading of the classics, but it gives preference to the old films . Man of Steel is made beautifully and gloomy. In supervising Christopher Nolan film appears to us more realistic as Nolan Batman . The cast is simply gorgeous. Henry Cavill coped well with the role of Superman. It is perfectly suited to Superman physically . Amy Adams played well Lois Lane . But unfortunately it is not very good looks with Cavill . Michael Shannon has turned out one of thebest villains comic book movies . Superman 's father and stepfather turned out excellent. The film's soundtrack is very stressful and exciting . verdict Man of Steel is an excellent and intense film with a great cast and a gorgeous soundtrack. Man of Steel Superman best film since the days of Richard Donner film and best film in the comic books in 2013 .Rating 4/5",1
591,"Zack Snyder has done again! Bringing another comic book story and its characters to the big screen! Though this movie might have had some no action, yawn inducing, and maybe boring moments with Clark Kent and Lois Lane or Martha and Jonathan Kent, fan-boys can't get enough out of the awesome action fight scenes between Superman and Zod and his minions. And how we watch in awe of how Superman and other characters are reimagined in incredible ways. And the lore and tragic backstory of Clark Kent is both heart wrenching and interesting. Also even though Lex Luthor isn't in the movie, two Easter eggs foreshadow his appearance in the sequel. There are two scenes that show trucks that have the name Lex Corps on them! And best of all Superman is now renamed the ""Man of Steel"" complete with a new costume (with the undies not on the outside), and an even better theme song not composed by John Williams, but Hans Zimmer. For all those DC fans who are trying to find a descent enough DC movie, here's one that hopefully doesn't disappoint you that much like The Green Lantern, Jonah Hex, or even Catwoman did.",1
594,"Zack Snyder delivers a great start to a new cinematic universe, presenting us with a modern and more mature look at Superman. Though its more mature tone results in endless scenes of destruction which, gets repetitive and boring after a while. With that said, Henry Cavill is this new generation's Superman, and not only does he look the part, but he feels like The Man of Steel. The movie definitely has some pacing issues, and the way it was shot was too bleak and shaky, I would have preferred to see a more colorful and steady movie. The movie has some plot holes and is oddly paced, but it's still one awesome ride and a good way to start DC's cinematic universe.",1
595,"""Man of Steel"" 10 Scale Rating: 9.0 (Amazing) ... The Good: Superman is finally updated and made relevant to the masses. Is it an exact interpretation of the comic book character? No, it isn't. It is a modern Superman for a modern world and is extremely well done. Well acted, especially Cavill, Shannon, and Crowe. This is how a super hero franchise should start and I was impressed with the depth of the script. The flashbacks were extremely well done and helped move the movie along by skipping past yet another origin story in the opening act. The sci-fi elements and stressing that Superman is indeed an alien was a good call. Clark is isolated and alone, which was far more realistic than one would expect. Exceptional fight scenes that put the sheer magnitude of the powers involved on display. The Bad: During the final battles, the sheer amount of damage done and death was dizzying. It got to the point where I actually said aloud ""Why is anyone still in the area?!?!"" Some people are annoyed that Superman didn't save everyone, but that was sort of the point ... he can't save everyone. Shannon was up to the task and Zod was very cool, but came across as more than a little ham-fisted at times. I would have liked him to be more of a combination of wits and force instead of relying almost solely on power.",1
596,Cavill is a great superman! he really is! unfortuantly the film drags a bit and the action scenes drag on to much! but a really interesting movie and way to tell this story,1
597,Man of Steel is a dope movie. Henry Cavill as awesome as Superman. Easily the best Superman Movie to date. I Highly recommended.,1
598,"Not the perfect Superman movie, but its the best one. Some people want to be nostalgic and still say the first Superman with Christopher Reeves. That's wrong. Regardless of how nostalgic they want to be, they're wrong quite frankly. There were numerous things within the story that really bothered me, especially the end with Zod. Anyway, it was a fun movie to watch. A very enjoyable superhero movie. Warner Bros. green lit the sequel, and I expect the sequel to be better. The origin story was necessary due to the reboot, however, I felt like they spent a little too much time on it. We GET IT. HE'S AN ALIEN. I felt that was excessively pushed that he wasn't human. Anyway, I recommend it if you're a DC fan or even a Superhero fan. Its hard to make a Superman film, but Zack Snyder & Christopher Nolan did a damn good job.",1
600,"(Contains some spoilers)After viewing Man of Steel I found that I was talking myself into having a positive reaction for it.  Now don't confuse this for a condemnation, there was plenty to like about the newest iteration of the Superman story, but there was a lot to be critical of as well.  Let's start with the good stuff. The most exciting and perfect part of Man of Steel had to be the man himself.  Henry Cavill was an excellent choice to play the last son of Krypton.  His physical presence never sways far from the center of the film, as it should be when talking about THE superhero of superheroes.  Looks, brawn, and a subtle magnetism combine to give us the most believable Superman since the late Christopher Reeve.  That said, there was too much brooding and emotional detachment brought to the character this time around.  I don't necessarily blame Cavill for this as much as I blame the writer (David S. Goyer) and the director (Zack Snyder).  While gritty realism and a darker, foreboding landscape has become the post-9/11 norm in cinema, it does not work in the world of Superman, who has always been an optimistic beacon of hope in the comic and film world.  I think a little too much Dark Knight crept into the screenplay and creative input from Goyer and Nolan.Other members of the cast were equally excellent in supporting roles.  Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner deliver as the two fathers of Kal-El/Clark Kent.  Michael Shannon makes us almost sympathetic for the formidable General Zod in the end.  Amy Adams, while not a standout in this cast, turns out an worthy performance as the tenacious reporter who will eventually steal the heart of Superman.Also of note are the stunning visual effects, refreshing when this well done. Although there was enough in this film to make me hopeful for some even better sequels in the future, there was also enough in this particular film to cause some concern.  There was so much content in the form of origin, flashbacks, exposition, and the overly drawn out final confrontation in this film that the pacing suffered as a result.  There was simply too much story to tell in too little time.  The franchise would have been much better served had they left several backstory elements for future films.  Also of concern was the tremendous lack of character development of anyone outside of Superman and Zod.  I kept anticipating a scene where we could get some Superman/Lois connection, maybe not a deep emotional bond, but something other than random flirtation.  The frantic pacing and need for overlong building destruction was what we got instead.  Seriously, if I saw another random building come crashing down I was going to scream.  There is no way they can rebuild a city after all that, it would take a century, even with Superman's help. My greatest irritation with the movie was the way in which Johnathan Kent was killed.  Anyone who knows even a little about the story of Clark Kent knows that his adopted father dies when hes a teenager, and it's important to keep that part of the story because it was such a pivotal moment in the character's history.  However, to have Jonathan tell Clark to watch him die in a tornado just to protect his secret seemed a little unbelievable.  No one, not even Superman, would stand idly by and watch their father die when they could have saved him.  Not even to protect his secret, not ever. All that being said, I thought it was a noble first effort to reboot a storied franchise.  The film did an excellent job of setting up a classic superhero in the midst of our modern world.  I eagerly await the much higher potential that this story can climb, or fly, to.",1
601,"This movie proves that to be a critic you must be at the very least retarded. MoS is by far the best action movie of this Millennium. If you like Special Effects, Epic Fights and not dumped movies like lets say ....Iron Man 3? The Amazing Spiderman? Avengers?....and you do not want your intelligence get offended cause the director was retarded.....Watch Man of Steel. If you want an action movie that the starring hero/ superhero, is not some half-way comedian punk  that his powers some times are ON some times are OFF  Watch Man of Steel. If you want to see a superhero actually using his brain... Watch Man of Steel. If you want a superhero movie that isn't made for making 16year old girs getting in love with the starring actor........Watch Man of Steel. Last but not least, so far and if my memory serves well (apart from Nolan's Batman) Its the only Superhero movie that actually explains every single detail. This is a dark, epic, serious, well made action superhero movie.Its not supposed to be funny, nor romantic, nor for kids.",1
604,"Not gonna lie, this is the worst Superman movie. Even the God awful musical from the mid seventies stands tall over this diarrhea-fest. People have said that it's like Dragon Ball Z, but I think those people are like Peter Griffin in that THEY'RE MORONS. The plot is soooo freaking cliche and boring, everyone but superman is poorly developed (if at all) and  acting abounds. The fights are lame and somehow less interesting than those in Transformers 3. I really don't see how anyone likes this movie and there's already a sequel in the works so perhaps next time we'll get a good villain and a good actor to play him unlike this time around...",0
605,"Man of steel doesn't need the typical introduction that I usually give a film, because this is just a retelling of the original tale. Although the main difference is the villain; who is General Zod, and is told in a different way. I was excited for this movie for a while, but when the trailers started showing up; especially the: ""How does Superman shave?"", I started loosing interest. Seeing in how it looked like it was more focused on visuals than stories, and I wasn't too far off. With that said, this is pretty epic. Of course the visual effects are very pretty to look at, the planet Krypton is both mystic and futuristic. However the effects for the action scenes are the major problems. For a while I enjoyed watching them, but after seeing over a half an hour of superman punching people and them punching back, it gets really old and doesn't look convincing. Mainly the chick that hangs around Zod the most does this sort of super dash, which is annoying. Speaking of Superman, the actor they got was ok. He doesn't do anything that makes him likeable; I'd better explain myself before I get hated. I know he saves people which make him instantly likeable, but he doesn't have a interesting personality. Sure he protects people, but when he's not he is just sort of this serious boring guy. The other actors however were better; in my opinion, especially the guy they got for General Zod. It's a good performance; he does take some traits from the original: Terence Stamp, the character is a bit different though, but for the better I thought. It is strange in how I think they shouldn't have changed Superman's personality and yet changing Zod's is good, but at least here it makes him into an understandable villain. He was raised to be a warrior by the Kyptonian way, and is now protecting the future of the Kryptonian race. Also it's funny that Russel Crowe is like Marlon Brando from the original, in that there big stars only in minor parts, and he does okay. He doesn't take up the scene, but he does have this wise man routine down pretty well. The other supporting cast like Lois are fine; in that she doesn't male any negative impressions, but nothing great. With all that said, I still enjoyed watching this movie. I like the action at certain parts, the drama is good and is even great at times, and the actors do an okay job overall. This is definitely worth your money.",1
606,"5 Reasons Man Of steel Is The WORST Movie Ever Made: 1. Washed out blue cinematography throughout the whole movie. 2. Lousy director....the whole film shot with a jerky handheld camera to make it look excitingand full of action.  Trademark of amateur directors. 3. Lousy story line constantly jumping from the past and present on Earth and on a different world. 4. Overuse of CGI. The ending kept dragging on and on as they destroyed more and more buildings.  Less is more.  Was actually getting antsy and bored with all the destruction. 5. The ending. When in the world is this guy going to use his super speed to at least TRY to look like someone else. I know, I'll put on a pair of glasses and know one will ever recognize me....not even my mother.",0
607,"The Man Of Steel Is Made of Cardboard! But At Least Henry Cavill Has Nice Muscles! What a shame such a great story turned into something so boring, tedious and annoying! Unfortunately for the Man of Steel, every story has a beginning, middle and end. Something the average person learns when they are in kindergarten or First Grade! All three parts of a story need to be done well or else it's no fun! A great beginning does not make-up for a mediocre middle or a disastrous ending! The Man of Steel starts with a fantastic back story. For the very first time we really get to observe Krypton in all it's technological glory! Only to see the story slowly degenerate into camp with cardboard characters from the military that you could find in any comic books story. And, then like a car with a stuck accelerator, the story rapidly turns into another brainless war porn and 9/11-type flick (Chicago gets trashed instead of New York. When your story is so rotten you distract your audience by wrecking another major city! Wow! That was imaginative!) Man Of Steel is also the ultimate product placement film. In fact, you could randomly choose a half-dozen movies that have been shown on the big screen this past year - and I'll bet you the Man of Steel has more product placement then all of them COMBINED! It was so obnoxious it was distracting! In the 45 years of watching movies I can only think of a handful of times that product placement has been this aggressive!! It's also symptomatic of an incredibly weak story! The Man of Steel is so bad I was dying to walk out; but, I went to see the film with a friend so I felt obligated to stay. At least I had the sense to close my eyes and tune-out the last half hour of explosions, grunting and screaming in order to put my meditation skills to the test! I'm happy to report that even though I was totally sober I was able to completely tune-out the last 30 minutes of the Man of Steel and I could care less about what happened to any of the story's characters!",0
608,"As a Superman fan, this was the reboot I've been waiting for. This movie helped erase all memories of the lackluster Superman Returns and paved the way for a take on the 75 year old character that feels both fresh and energized. The Good: First and foremost, this is a Sci-Fi story at its core and I loved that most about this movie. It was great to see a look of Krypton that did away with the crystalline structure of the Donner films. This movie feels much closer to some of the more recent comics including elements of John Bryne's Man of Steel and Superman Birthright (where we see Clark traveling around the world and taking up various odd jobs). I really enjoyed the non-linear style of story-telling, it was very reminiscent of Batman Begins. Jumping between an older and younger Clark Kent helped us get to know him, without spending too much time treading on old ground. Performances: Henry Cavill does an excellent job portraying the Man of Steel. We see a Superman that's lonely, conflicted and struggling to find his place in the world. One of the character traits I, personally have found very relatable. Amy Adams, what can I say, shes awesome. A much better actress and way more attractive than Margot Kidder or to a lesser-extent Kate Bosworth. Michael Shannon nearly stole the show as General Zod, compared to the campy (but still great) performance of Terrance Stamp, we get a Zod that is both ruthless and menacing. Finally, Russell Crowe as Jor-El. One of my favorite characters from the Superman mythos and Crowe absolutely blew me away. He provides the explanations for why Krypton becomes ultimately doomed, why he sends his only son to earth and why Kal-El must use his gifts to help others. Another one of my favorite aspects of the movie was that we got plenty of screen-time with him (both on and off Krypton). I was entertained ;) Special Effects: The CGI was some of the best I've seen yet! The scenes with Henry flying around are absolutely spectacular and almost realistic looking. Compare that to the final scene in SR where Brandon Routh looks like a poorly modeled PS3 character. The Not-So-Good: Feels a little rushed in a few areas,Maybe a little too much action for the first movie and not enough time spent developing some of the characters. I'm sure we'll get some more of those in the sequel, but the main focus of this movie is Superman. Overall: 9.5/10",1
611,"The movie is great, performance, acting, effects, and the way they tell the story is very refreshing, of course people old or more than 30 years old and with little space in his heads cant undestand or acept that christofer reeves was great, but.... guys is other time, is a new movie, came on the effects here is extremilly more incredible that in the all movies ever made of this iconic heroe. i hate to allways  see a superman who with a little crystal can be defeated, came on... inclusive in superman returns he can carrie out of earth a planet basically made of cryptonite.... how time he was expose to that and dont die... well of course all fans of batman will be not funny to se a superman who can kick ass of batman in a wisper but is the reallity of this universe. if existed. superman will be basically indestructible... and came on batman cant live for ever. and all forget basic things like supernan is not human so pls, dont thing in him like a human, because is not. Excelent job guys i know man of steel II will be a great movie and batman will be great too in this cross over. But pls!!! dont try batman like a person capable to defeat superman because all know....is more tham imposible... and if you take lex on the bigscreen pls a lex like in smallville tv show will be great. Not an idiot like superman I, II, and others. Is a new world, we need new points of view and olders with close minds critic must be ignored.",1
613,"It's certainly not perfect, but Man Of Steel is a nonetheless an excellent reboot, to say the least. It completely changed my perspective of Superman (who I never had been a huge fan of) and adds many new additions to the Superman story. My only complaint is that Clark and Lois's relationship was very rushed; they start kissing after meeting each other for like only three days! I liked the beginning that showed us a glimpse of Krypton and developed Superman's backstory and origins. I liked the cast, especially Faora and General Zod. If you liked this review, read my other ones on a wide variety of movies and TV shows by clicking on my name and mark this review as helpful. Remember, every vote counts!",1
614,"Finally after 3 months of its release, i am writing this review..MAN OF STEEL has become nothing but an underrated movie with low undeserving scores, true its not the best adaptation..but, one cannot simply deny the fact that it was the most successful adaptation of superman on the big screen..lots of exhilarating action..a darker tone on superman unlike the previous ones...we have to admit it..its the best we have got yet..from my side..its a green lit review for this film.",1
616,"Nice movie.. i love Superman, it's really superhero movie. Awesome, i highly recommend it to you if you're fan for example of Superman franchise. I think it's movie is really underrated.",1
617,"I went in to this movie excited and with high expectations. These were met and then some. I personally thought the pacing of the movie was brilliant. The cinematography was beautiful and the mix of CGI, not to mention how realistic everything looked, was integrated extremely well. I thought Henry Cavill portrayed Superman flawlessly and the supporting cast were excellent. I know the movie has been criticized for lengthy action scenes, but I thought they were appropriate for the scope of the movie  Superman is extremely powerful and, unlike some weaker superheroes, deserves bigger and longer action/fight sequences. In other words, 10 minute fight scenes with loads of destruction are appropriate for this film/character. However, I can understand completely how this would turn off less hardcore fans of the superhero genre. I also got a great Nolan vibe from the movie, reminiscent of the dark knight trilogy. I was thoroughly entertained throughout, especially to the point where I had a cheesy smile practically the entire film. Personally, I loved this movie and believe it to be the first film to accurately give Superman's character and story the justice it so rightly deserves. I cannot wait for the upcoming sequel.",1
618,"It lacks character developement and has repetitive over the top action sequences. However, this reboot of Superman delivers emotionally and follows a sturdy plot for a mostly successful resurrection of a superhero.",1
619,This is the quintessential Superman Movie to date. It pays its respects to the source material and delivers a superman that people have been waiting to see. Snyder delivers on the action and Cavill's both physical appearance and personality is the Superman I grew up with since watching the animated series through to justice league and any recent adaptations. There is no Kryptonite and Superman punches people. Thank you Mr Snyder. Cant wait for Superman Vs Batman,1
620,"I'll start by mentioning that before seeing this film, I really wasn't a fan of Superman as a character. He was pretty clean cut, simplistic and boring to me. I have to say that Man of Steel is my favorite comic book film and one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite movie of all time. And that's saying a lot since i'm much more a Batman guy. I really have to applaud Zack Snyder for making the deepest, most complex and best version of Superman I've ever experienced. Man of Steel begins with the birth of Kal-El on his home planet of Krypton, which is literally on the brink of self destruction. Kal's father, Jor-El , knows this so he sends his son to Earth in the hopes of him carrying on their race. This portion of the film was done very well, and you feel every minute of the urgency and drama. Seeing Krypton fully beautifully and tragically realized on film was breathtaking, even if for a short time.  After the intro, things are a bit fast fowarded, as you see Clark Kent/Kal El now as an adult. Although you see Clark as an adult, the film does an amazing job of developing his character through several flashbacks of him as a boy, a teenager and a young adult throughout. Those flashbacks are meaningful as the events in the flashbacks shape him into the man he is and is to become. One of the more emotional flashbacks was during a time when Clark was just a little boy, being overwhelmed with his new-found powers during a classroom lesson. Man of Steel shows the struggle of Superman trying to figure out who he really is in a world that he does not come from. When he finally does find out in the middle section of the film, you feel the same excitement and exhilaration that he does, especially when he dons the iconic blue and red suit of his home planet. The tone of the film does shift shortly after when General Zod, the main antagonistic and villain of the film, appears. To put it short, Zod wants to turn Earth into Krypton at the expense of every living thing on the planet. Man of Steel showcases one of the best villains in a comic book film that I've seen since Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. Zod actually has a concrete and justifiable reason for his actions and decisions in the film, which set him apart from most throw-away villains in comic book films today. It's because of those reasons he actually feels like a threat and gives the film solidity. While the first half of Man of Steel is focused on character development and story building, the second half is a huge, action packed payoff as Zod attempts to carry out his plan of literally destroying one planet and rebuilding another. Some critics and people felt that there was too much destruction and death. To truly demonstrate how much of a threat General Zod was, the film showed the true result of a villain's actions. Im glad Snyder took this route of showing actions as opposed to just the plans of a would-be villain being foiled beforehand by the obligatory hero before anything serious actually happens. The villain actually felt like a true comic book adversary. By the end of the film when you finally see Clark putting on his glasses on his first at the Daily Planet, you get goosebumps and when Lois Lane says to Clark ""welcome to the planet"", it makes you want to smile just as Clark did. By the time the credits rolled with Hans Zimmer's theme following, I found myself wanting to continue in on Supe's story. 10/10",1

Having been a fan since the first movie in 1978, enjoyed the 2nd movie immensely and even Superman Returns which I watched again last night before seeing Man of Steel.The hype said realism (which I know with the universe is a stretch) but the other movies felt more realistic and this was a jumble of noise and CGI like Transformers, however even those movies felt more coherent than this mess.There were some sparks of interesting layout to the movie like Clark growing up and Lois showing integrity by not exposing him to the world, but really this is not in the same league as other superhero movies over the past few years.I would have preferred a sequel to Superman Returns than this...",0
625,"This movie was quite enjoyable. I think that indeed it was the best superman movie to be created and didn't have very many plot holes in it as some previous superman movies had. It was very different from the same old telling of superman: Start with him being shot off of Krypton, have him grow up, learning his abilities one by one, then killing Lex Luther in the end. No, it was very different from that (not going to spoil). I enjoy at the beginning how Krypton was a war torn world instead of a heaven like planet. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning and the end of the movie. The middle was alright so that is why I give this movie a 7/10,",1

Plenty of explosions, weapons and fistfights, though.  I wondered frequently throughout if I was actually watching a ""Superman"" movie.",0
632,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't like Zack Snyder, so I think I went into this movie with an unfair bias against him. That said, this movie was terrible. The opening scene on Krypton actually looked really cool, if you could see it. The cinematography was so shaky that you couldn't actually concentrate on what was happening. I don't mind the dark tone that Snyder takes, but he just can't pull it off. The script was terrible, it became either a laugh or cringe fest whenever anyone opened their mouth. The action looked like a video game, unrealistic, much too fast, and entirely over the top. I don't even want to talk about the science...just awful. And of course, the acting. I love Amy Adams but what the heck? All she did was scream and cry and she was some of the better acting. Russel Crowe was tolerable, Kevin Costner was mediocre, Henry Cavill doesn't pull off the inner struggle that Snyder wants him to have, and everyone else is absolutely horrid. Micheal Shannon was the absolute worst part of the film, and his portrayal of General Zod was soul-less without Superman taking it from him. Do not go and see this unless you enjoy bad movies or have a unique sense of humor. I was lucky that I got my ticket for free, and I'd certainly hate to see anyone actually spend money on this.",0
633,"Extreme disappointment to say the least. After a rocking Iron Man 3, Amazing Spiderman and Avengers, this is the exact opposite. Pathetic direction by Zack Snyder  the film lacks soul and actors mouth dialogues for the sake of saying it, without any emotional connect. Dialogues are ridiculous and childish, and the action/special effects is quite boring/repetitive actually. Nothing earth-breaking or new for those of us who have seen Avengers, Spiderman or Iron Man. Screenplay is very haphazard, going to and fro between flashbacks and present day without clarity. Some scenes appear out of nowhere. Most disappointing is the climax...after lots of punching and destroying buildings, Superman kills the villian by twisting his head!! Couldn't he have done it the minute he met this guy? The Superman series is clearly not in safe hands. Someone like David Fincher could breath fresh life into it. Please hire him for the next.",0
634,"I usually don't write reviews, but I had to warn you.I'm not one of those snobs who can't enjoy a summer flick, and some of my favorite movies are not academy-award material. But this movie is the first to make me it was such a stupid waste of time, that I left the cinema with my friends. The movie just takes itself too seriously and ends up not being fun. It's like watching a kid telling you a simple story, while being all serious and so sure it's the greatest most important story in the world. The dramatic scenes, which could have been the highlight of the movie, are cut too short for the effect to hold. It seems Snyder was worried his audience will get bored by actual story and just cut it down to a minimum in a way which, frankly, was insulting. It's like watching a movie with ADHD. The bit of story that did make it in, is full of absolutely idiotic holes, and the characters are flat and undeveloped. I wish I could give you examples without spoiling the movie, but I can't. I can just say that I was laughing occasionally because it was so ridiculous and poorly written. So many ""come on!"" and ""Are you serious"" moments. Most characters act out of whim, are totally irrational and they all feel like they are still in junior high. And the love story? Twilight fans should be pleased, because we finally found a movie with a worse love story. In this movie, there is simply no story. There's no love, and then there is, just like that  with barely any justification. The action sequences are terribly long and overdone, as if a little kid took control over the CGI studio and forced them to put his wildest fantasies into the movie. The action was rare and when it did arrive, it was way too much and not really fun. The visuals were very professional but lacked soul, ranging from generic computer game look to a terrible Instagram palette. Honestly, it was disappointing and not worth the price of admission. Eventually, during the great (boring to tears) finale, me and my friends realized we're not that target audience (We are a group of 24-30 years old). But knowing myself, I wouldn't have enjoyed this whimsical movie even at age 10. It's just not fun. We left and got something to eat instead. I realize there are a lot of fans out there, so before you send me any hate mail, just remember it's a matter of opinion. I found this movie to be a terrible experience for intelligent adults, but that's not a universal fact. It's just an opinion! ",0

After the 597th explosion and the 245th fighting scene you just get bored of all the noise and the visual effects that try to be realistic but are just too big to look in any way compelling. Little dialogue and even less story just give the film the last ""kick in the ass"". I seriously tried to be impressed, to be thrilled  but by any means I was bound to fail!",0
637,"As a long time Superman fan I had great hopes and expectations for this film.  I was very disappointed with this film.  Superman: The Man of Steel is NOT a good Superman film; it's not even a good movie.  I could go on and write a short story length review of this film and list what's wrong with it but instead I'll just get to the main points.  First, Zack Snyder was a poor choice for director (where is Richard Donner when you need him?).  He is NOT the right director for the character of Superman.  He was great for Watchman but Superman is not anything like WATCHMEN.  Second, the score was AWFUL!  There are no discernible themes for anything in this movie.  Thirdly, the action scenes were WAY over the top and just ridiculous.  This movie was so bad it makes Superman Returns look like a classic and Superman:The Movie look like the best movie of human history (which it almost is!).  Bottom line: don't waste you time on this piece of cinematic garbage.  Especially if you are a fan of Superman.  You WILL be disappointed.  I only hope this movie fails to meet the studio's expectations so we don't see anymore of these abominations!!",0

644,"Movie even worse second time, you start ti wonder why do they do this?  CGI nightmare, stolen scenes from other movies. Like 4th of July, Doc Oct, Loki mop scene fro. avengers, big robot looking villain walking down small town scene. The acting was terrible, I think one of the worse lois lane characters ever, Perry White awful and bad scenes. Same story written again about supermans beginning boring. Everyone knows who superman is the cops even went by his house. The fact that he didn't save his father was crazy period. CGi awful, a lot of destruction, even the Characters in front if the CGI background looked more like a game then a movie. Just nit good. Not sure why it gets some good reviews at all? The story was bad, from the beginning. Typical Hollywood goons can't make a DC franchise good. Enough of the origins of superman already.",0
646,"Man of Steel is something I give the benefit of the doubt, why I still prefer the likes of Christopher Reeve flying around with a toothpaste commercial smile in a story reminiscent of Kal-El's innocent upbringings in small town Kansas I was constantly reminding myself in my seat ""This is a modernization"", but does it hold up to what we expect from a superman story? Short and personal answer no. I found myself hoping it would take on the form of it's impressive teaser trailer back in 2012, majestic shots, large choir orchestra sounds and heavily inspiring words of wisdom on right and wrong. What we got was Zack Snyder's best film to date given the talent who was involved i.e Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer respectively, Zack's Filmography is a puzzle to me, he's an extremely talented man in the visual department and I loved the look of all he's previous work regardless of story and some minor casting calls but ultimately none of them manage to carry the weight and depth when tackling something so large on scale such as Superman. But I wont lie Man of steel looks fantastic, for it's flaws which are many, the spectacle of the movie is in it's destruction scenes be it Krypton or Earth, they outweigh all of what we've seen from Superhero Movies so far. the flying looks spectacular and as stated before Zack manages to bring scope and something much larger to screen then many could envision, even myself with my expectations was still very impressed with the routes they ultimately took and the consequences that follow. Which brings me to the weight and depth point I mentioned earlier, half the characters are generally not that interesting, big names with small parts who should've had a lot more screen time, I really wanted to see more of Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne and hell you make Jimmy Olsen a female called Jenny which I'm all for but she says and does virtually nothing that emphasised her character or the story that mattered at all (I know that the last thing isn't to big a deal because Jimmy is underplayed in all the movie series but it's why I bring up the next point). I found the exposition in this film startling, it goes from one scene to another so fast any interaction from the landscape or human interaction isn't really well executed, like the characters the audience is expected to just go with it, quick explanation, next scene. What does work is aside from effects is that Henry Cavil makes a welcome change for Superman, though the films ideal was to hit a darker tone such as the recent Batman Trilogy, Batman and Superman are both different for obvious reasons emotionally and ideology, so to see Superman (Cavil) go Batman is new for a superman story, but it just doesn't fit for my personal expectations, that said I did enjoy his performance to an extent and would definitely like to see him play the character again in more familiar superman traits. Ultimately though Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon steal the show entirely, Crowe's Jor-El gets a lot more screen time than I thought we would see but it's a wonderful performance that comes off more real than just comic book commodity, and with that holy hell Shannon's performance as Zod is so terrifying fierce and soulless to me it rivals that of Heath Ledger. So after covering both Performance and Visuals how was the story? well that's it there isn't one, one that's particularly memorable anyway. Superman trying to find himself, to an extent does, finds bad guys, puts them down, done the end, typical superhero flair, character motives are basic never bigger than what's explained or seen from the actual characters, so when the visuals are great, acting in some areas solid or flat and overall average story (y'know Zack's trademarks?) why does Man of Steel make the grade? Because and ultimately it's different, plain and simple not different from the directors standpoint sure but for superman it's both familiar and unfamiliar like a reboot should be. but does that mean it's good? I kind of know the target audience who will really enjoy this movie will be the ones who don't know that much on Superman, trust me I'm no stellar fan yet I've read John Byrne & Grant Morrison serials religiously and watched all the old films regardless how bad the later ones got, am I the only one who thought ""Superman Returns"" felt way too ""Smallville""? Man of Steel to me got alot of things right and wrong but ultimately it's succeeds in it's mission of Modernizing Superman, I would happily watch it again no doubt and I love the set up for hopeful future instalments but as an introduction to one of America's greatest fictional characters? do yourself a favour and look for the real deal. 7.5 Thanks for Reading.",1
649,"Man of Steel is a really good movie, it has the the best visuals ive ever seen, there where moments in the movie when my jaw dropped. Man of Steel is actually more believable than any other Superman movie ive seen. Henry Caville and Amy Adams are great as Superman and Lois Lane. This movie also has amazing music playing in the background for many of the serious or sad scenes. Man of Steel is a great movie overall, it has the best super hero fight ive ever seen and does not deserve all the negative reviews from the critics. Overall Score= 83/100",1
650,"It seems that DC has started something brand new in Zack Snyder's: Man of Steel. The movie packs a whole array of characters, suspense and action into its story. It upgrades from Superman Returns and brings a whole new array of elements to the DC Cinematic Universe; if there will be one that is. Man of Steel brings together a whole bunch of actors to the table and each one of them delivers exceptionally well. Henry Cavill as Superman nails the role perfectly, touching up on not only his physical side but his emotional side too. That's what I like to see, I'd love to see how emotional Superman, who is essentially a god, can touch up on his emotions if he has all this power. Amy Adams a Lois Lane and Diane Lane and Martha Kent are the leading ladies and boy do they deliver. Adams gives Lane that rough and tough feel about her that was present in comics and DC animated movies and that's what I like about her in this film. Diane Lane's the same who plays that overbearing mother who always cares for Clark/Kal/Supes throughout the whole film. The father figures in the movie are just as good too. Russel Crowe as Jor El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent play a rather large role here as they both are great fatherly figures. However, the big actor in this film has to be that of Michael Shannon as General Zod. He easily stole the show when I watched it and I easily felt creeped whenever he was on the screen. He was menacing, cruel and some could argue that he was a little bit evil. One of the best parts of the film. However, amongst all the greatness of this movie I feel like there are some flaws that I should address. Superman is seen as the symbol of hope in the comics, animation and hell, even in the movie itself. The reason I'm saying this is because Man of Steel sometimes felt a bit too 'dark knight' for my taste. It's like Snyder and Goyer were trying to Batmanize Superman and that is a big no no. Another thing that bugged me quite a bit was that there was no break from the darkness and no humor was involved in the movie. Just a few light jokes could have easily broke up the Batman type mood that the movie was. But that's I really found wrong with it. Man of Steel rocks! It is a great film that really dives into what makes Superman who he is, granted there are a few mistakes here and there and one big occurrence that would split the fans down the middle but overall it's amazing. It is easily a contender for my movie of the year! Pros:-Amazing acting-Spectacular visuals-Superman is reborn! Cons:-Too dark in most stages-Little to no humor included-Scene that would divide the fans VERDICT:9/10",1
651,"This movie was great, It was a game changer for comic book movies, it change the tone from usually seeing childish superheros to a more serious superhero who does not take crap from anyone. The visual effects were absolutely stunning, Zack Snyder is a pure genius. Henry Cavil is a perfect Superman, he did a fantastic job, Michael Shannon as General Zod was brilliant to the point where he made you hate his character",1
652,"Something tells me that many of the high scores and posts are from some PR firm hired by Warner Bros., because this movie was a train wreck. Anybody with a modicum of taste in a well scripted, paced  and directed film would agree. Attempting to bring a Batman-like seriousness to Man of Steel was an EPIC FAILURE!  ""Batman"" had a well executed story! True, it's my opinion...although my teenage boys didn't even like it! That's pretty telling. It's not an awful movie, it just seems to be two distinctly different movies in one. One part, life of a young boy dealing with being different while being raised in a small town (which, was not bad story telling in this film), and the other part, this over the top Michael Bay ""Transformers"" battle to the death, chock full of extraneous dialogue. Cavill is a ""good looking"" Superman for the eye candy crowd, in fact in the movie a character of a female cop sheepishly admits to this. However, this Superman is not a lot of fun, in fact he's pretty bland. Perhaps this Clark Kent should spend some time hanging out with ""Iron Man"" Tony Stark for a lesson in loosening up a bit.",0
654,"Boundlessly cool and entertaining, amazing visual effects, the fights are fast and explosive and the stakes feel high. Michael Shannon steals the show. He delivers a performance that gathers all the intensity he has ever played into one character (That's super intense). Take this how you will, but there is more destruction in this film than I have ever seen. Nothing is sacred. It's sweet. Hans Zimmer's score: I think it's some of his best work. With it, he pays more dividends to the plot beats and the characters than the script or actors. It is delicate and sensitive but at moments notice can go from 1- 100! It raises the stakes to where they should be and makes some of the more cheesy moment so much more palatable. He has gathered a brutal drum ensemble and it shakes you to your foundations! I will say that the film suffers from minor plot holes and some teeth grinding cheesy moments. There is a lack of comic relief, and perhaps some comic moments that seem misplaced or gauche. The pacing is strange and seems to polarise people, you either love it, or hate it. I'm not quite sure yet... but i'm leaning towards disliking it. I still think Superman is too ""good"". He needs to struggle with himself more! We need more internal conflict in order to relate more and for us to want him to win that much more. BUT.I think we finally have a superman film that is BADASS and another superhero that is accesible to this generation.",1
656,"I was very upset when I left this movie...expecting that this was the rehash of Superman as we know it, the writers and director decided to change the entire history of Superman to fit their overblown, overkill, over detroy whatever city they were in, and change all of the known facts of Superman, like Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent is Superman right away???  and Clark's father, Jonathan Kent, is killed by a tornado and NOT a heart attack???  And after he lands on earth, we go straight to 33 years later and he has a beard and works on a crab ship??  Why are all these hollywood types think that they are better than the original authors!!!!   And all the KILLING!!!   I almost walked out.  I like Henry Cavill as superman but pleaaaaaaassssseee   get someone who KNOWS superman history to write the next story and stop with all the special effects.   A few are needed but not all the destruction.   And where was metropolis???",0
657,"this is the single worst thing I have ever seen in the theater. It's nothing but a bunch of noise and smashing around for at least half of the movie; the other half was incredibly slow; The two best acting jobs in it are Russell Crow and Kevin Costner; there's pretty munch no meaningful dialogue what-so-ever and none of the characters give you any reason to care about them. The best thing to do is wait until it comes out on video, then wait a little longer for it to air on TV, then change the channel and watch something else.",0
658,"just boring, cheesy and monotone. henry cavill is just annoying -sonny boy...no edges....certainly no super-hero! music won`t stop during the entire film, it´s totally packed and you feel nothing else than relieved when it's over! booo!",0
659,"I walked into this movie with high hopes provided I love a good movie. Being produced by Christopher Nolan and a huge fan of generally speaking all of his work, I really expected alot from this movie. I came in expecting a movie that really dwelved deep into superman's character, but unfortunately none of my hopes manifested themselves. It ended up being a movie where the important character development was explained in its entirety in promotional trailer of the movie. Another problem I had coming into this was  my expectations for a modern superhero movie with semi-interesting plot and some character development, but instead felt as though I was left with 300:Superman Edition. The first 40 minutes kept throwing new information at me that I hoped would go somewhere. Hope that it would become something more, but those hopes quickly died. after the first 40 minutes the movie turns into that epic battle scene that lasts 2 hours too long. Beyond that, the story was faced with many plot holes, a superman that fails to be connected with, an a love interest that feels forced and rather stale. If you go to a movie simply to see a plethora of CGI, by all means, this is the movie for you, but if you are looking for a movie with any level of development your money would be better spent purchasing rope and an afternoon in your garage.",0
660,"Man of Tin As you can guess from the title of my review, I did not enjoy “Man of Steel.”  It had great effects and the scenes that took place on Krypton were awesome. But overall the MoS was poorly paced, poorly directed, and didn’t provide characters that I could really connect with.  The action sequences also lacked a sense of peril because the combatants were invulnerable. I’ll start off tin what I liked about MoS, Krypton. Krypton was amazing in this film. It looked and felt completely alien. There was a giant flying creature that Jor’El rode on at one point. The structures and plains in the background were uniquely designed. Krypton in this movie was a breathtaking sight to behold. The narrative on Krypton flowed better than the rest of the movie also. Major plot points are setup masterfully on Krypton but soon begin falling apart once the story moves forward to Earth. On to Earth, and the bad aspects of the film. MoS does a poor job of telling Superman’s origin story and establishing him as a character that we can root for and care about. We get to see Clark Kent roam around aimlessly with a big depression beard, while throwing in flashbacks of his childhood. This part of the movie wasn’t horrible but the pacing was odd.  He’s a man, then a boy, then back to a man, then a teen.  The individual scenes were good but they were linked in an uncomfortable, schizophrenic manner. The movie begins with Clark’s birth on Krypton, so how about maintaining a linear structure throughout the rest of the movie.  Clark discovers his true identity and becomes Superman in a rather matter the fact way also. Which brings me to another and the most problematic aspect of the movie, unnecessary subplots and superfluous characters. There’s a constant cutting away from Superman to give screen time to characters and subplots that could’ve easily been cut from the movie.   Uninteresting shots of military personnel meticulously setting up they’re gear and  they’re guns. Scientists who reiterate plot points that General Zod just explained two scenes ago.  Lois Lane’s search for Clark after seeing him use his powers really fell flat. All of these subplots detracted from Superman’s story and character development and he felt like a significantly underdeveloped character by the end of the film when we’re supposed to be really rooting for and empathizing with him. When this movie was first announced I was really put off by the darker tone, but it turns out they stayed true to what and how Superman is supposed to be. Well…. Up until the very end. When the writers put Superman in an impossible situation and he’s forced to do a very Un-Superman like act to save lives. The villains were not interesting at all in MoS. General Zod is no Joker, Bane, or even Loki for that matter. Zod has zero charisma and he’s completely uninteresting when he’s on screen. I didn't care about what his evil plan was, his fist fights with Superman lacked impact because they were both practically invincible, and his minions were of a dime a dozen seen’em before variety. Zod was the absolute pinnacle of mediocrity. So he fit the rest of this mess of a movie perfectly. So…… Since Superman and Zod can’t really hurt each other, everything around them gets destroyed. They manage to almost completely level Metropolis during the last 30 minutes of this movie (in between uninteresting shots of military personnel meticulously setting up they’re gear and  they’re guns.) I haven’t been this bored watching things blow up since Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I ended up just feeling sorry for all of the fictional people who were going to get stuck with rebuilding Metropolis and cleaning up this mess. During the final battle in Marvel’s Avengers there was destruction, but it was mainly cars and parts of buildings.  You didn't feel like there was a catastrophic loss of life during the final showdown in the Avengers.  MoS feels like a hundred 9/11s are happening all at once. It felt a little sad, because if city blocks are being completely leveled left and right, you just logically assume that thousands of innocent people are dying during this dumb slug-fest. That’s my opinion on MoS. It feels like another failed Hollywood attempt to bring Superman to life. Made by people with no respect for the franchise or the comic book art form. Superman’s story has been told correctly in animated form and re-imagined in countless comic books for years.  But the director, Zack Snider, and the writers of MoS thought they were all smarter than all of the people who have brought this character to life successfully. Sad. But this movie is still going to make a billion dollars because you people don’t care. You just want mass destruction and explosions. You don’t even care if the plot makes sense or if the characters are fully developed..wheregeeksgotodie.wordpress",0
661,"es una muy mala pelicula, ni buenas actuaciones, excesivamente larga, tediosa. Las escenas de accion están muy largas y el actor no es ni la mitad del Superman que fue el anterior.",0
663,"I judge movies based on what they promise versus what they deliver. The first MoS trailer and the following trailers promised a deep story centered on Clark and his quest on finding his place in the world to ultimately become the savior of humanity, this is what they were teasing in a nutshell. But instead what we got is a glorified Transformers-like movie: no real characters, no deep story, mostly stuff exploding for half the movie. The screenplay is particularly inept, it tries to cram so many insignificant details (do we absolutely need to know what the codex thingy came from or look like for example...) at the expense of smooth transitions (scenes can literally jump from two people in a room to them standing in the desert), character development (the characters are cardboard cut outs, and no, 3 flashbacks of 5 mins are not enough to actually flesh out a character sorry), and most importantly storytelling: indeed the whole movie is constructed like one giant exposition, you spend most of the time catching up on things that already happened instead of having the story naturally unfold before you, and it's not a particularly interesting or original one at that. So in conclusion, my hat's off to the marketing team, because they did a hell of a job hyping up this movie and making it look like something worthy of interest, I just wish the actual filmmakers could have been as competent as them.",0
664,It could have built on the foundation it laid in the first hour but instead it decided it wanted to be a Roland Emmerich film and became sillier by the minute.,0
665,"I have to say, I thought this movie was awful. Superman had no character. He barely even had any lines. The story flowed without much logic and it made the movie feel like a 3 hour trailer. It felt a lot like a Michael Bay movie, except everyone knows what they're getting with him. Bay makes Bad Boys and Transformers, not exactly high caliber material to begin with. Snyder plays with some pretty important works and just totally blows it. 4/10",0
666,Man of Steel was a total disappointment on every level.  Perhaps my expectations were too high knowing it was made by the same people as 300 and Dark Knight.  The preview was better than the movie.,0
667,"Terrible.  Plot holes throughout.  Then scenes where they do something that makes no sense just to keep the weak plot moving.  This is not a good movie.  The special effects were good, but the story just ruins it.  Seriously, at one point Superman is being beaten, with no hope to win, then he just wins.  That happens like 4 times in the movie.  I know it's science fiction, but give me something at least somewhat believable.",0
668,"I had doubts about the movie at first. And I was right. It didn't feel like I was watching Superman, but a guy who had his powers. He was a gloomy character and seemed more like a over powered irritated babysitter than a a protector of good.  And through out the whole movie all kept saying to myself is why did they do that or why didn't they do this. I guess Nolan and Synder thought that by adding a ridiculous amount of special effects and destruction that it would carry a movie with a horrible story. But one plus about the movie is that the kid inside me loved it. But I have been a grown-up  for a while.",0
672,"The movie suffers from its own arrogance really. It simply tries waaaay too hard to be epic in almost every scene and honestly it really takes away from the story. The plot is a sort of modern day twist on superman 2 and uses flashbacks to tell superman's past/childhood. The whole scheme really doesn't work all that well. In any case the move is overly dramatic to the greatest extent. It's as if the director, writer, and producer were so caught up in their idea that the movie would be sooo epic that they looked past the fact that it really wasn't epic at all...",1
676,"The two huge issues I had were the over-glorified destruction and death of millions, simply played for entertainment, and the poorly developed, half-baked romance between Kal-El and Lois Lane. Other than that, I really enjoyed it. It had very poor pacing as well, but a fun summer movie none-the-less.",1
677,"For a film that included non-stop building destruction and overblown fit-for-children violence, Man of Steel not only manages to be uninteresting and dull, but partly laughable in stages. An unholy amount of back story and flashes drags the first half beyond reason, and the outrageous amount of fist fights between immortals and half of America's army in the second only further points the movie toward tedium. The scale and enormity of the violence is laughably trivial, that I had to wonder if I was watching the blockbuster version of Dragon Ball Z, where the violence never ends due to the borderline immortal characters. Except, a film must end. And ignoring the awful cast and characterization  When a German actress playing a side role outdoes everyone else, you have a problem  the final scene of action is so hilariously trite. Despite causing Billions of dollars worth of damage and no doubt killing thousands in the process, they tag a moral scene on at the end for Superman  Yes, that is your name, despite the film's idea of subtlety  which is not only irrelevant, but insulting.",0
678,"This movie was good...about 10% of the time. The plot was confusing and jumbled, the characters were pretty dumb and most of them had 2 second screen time and had no meaning to the story of Superman at all, the acting was too overexaggerated and most of all, the movie was so boring that I would've enjoyed the Lone Ranger a lot more!",0
679,"This movie wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  It definitely doesn't rise to the level of Nolan's Batman trilogy, but it does return Superman back to the upper echelon of superhero franchises (we can officially forget Superman Returns). With that said, there were many moments that the movie got painfully slow.  The dialog and plot movement lacked a spark that the Iron Man series possesses, and simultaneously lacked the ""take me serious"" edge that Batman Begins and The Dark Knight clearly held.  It's not either of those, but it is more enjoyable (and even more plausible) than The Dark Knight Rises. The movie rates a solid 7, however, because the action sequences and creative elements take Superman in a new direction.  This is not a remake of Salkind Superman series from the 70s.  It definitely transforms itself into a legitimate 21st century film approach of porting a comic book. My hope is that with the sequel (and we know there will be one), that we avoid the Transformer-esque ""destroy everything"" and get back to some of the fun, humor, and ride that has always made Superman so fun.  I never thought I'd say this, but I kind of missed Lex Luthor.",1
680,"Terrible movie. It's more a ""War of Worlds"" and ""Independance Day"" than a Superman movie. You see more shooting, close combat, spacebattle and explosions than actually the main character evolving in the story. The medieval appeal of the Krypton doesn't fit at all my view of the home world of Superman. Sure, it was formed by the first movie from the late 70's but flying on dragons is something I wouldn't expect from Superman's father. It felt a bit like ""Game of the thrones"". Sure, the special effects are nice but the story suffers a lot.",0
682,"With one repetative fight scene after the next. Poorly utilizing Crowe and Costner and no character development of any kind for a number of key people in the movie. This gives you a joyless superman with no charisma or charm even from the man of steel. I was hoping for much more than just your average popcorn action movie. I love action movies but i understand others when they said the action seemed to dull down other elements such as who the characters are, why they are important, and why they do what they do.",0

689,"Minor Spoilers Below Man of Steel is the biggest disappointment of the year.  What makes it such a letdown is that despite the interesting ideas it presents it fails completely with the execution.  Take for example, the character development of the main character.  Henry Cavill is a fine actor but you wouldn't know from this film.  Clark Kent in MOS is a very poorly developed character. He has no personality and a severe lack of character development.  And when I say personality, I don't mean that Clark has to be glib or witty, I mean that we as an audience don't get a sense of his point of view.  We don't really see how he feels or where he stands.  We don't see him develop a sense of morality or a sense of purpose.  And this is largely because he spends most of his time listening to exposition of other characters of what he should be doing.  We don't see him make any important decisions as a result.  Instead he spends much of his life wondering from one place to another until through a very contrived circumstance; he overhears the discovery of an alien craft (Seriously?!)  And when he finds the ship, he is told again through exposition of what he should be. Thus when he finally becomes a superhero (which in other origin films-ex. Batman Begins- is one of the most triumphant moments of those films) it is very flat and uneventful.  The other main character Lois Lane, doesn't fair much better.  Amy Adams is again a fine actress, but she is not a very interesting character because much of her presence is contrived.  She often shows up in the film inorganically and is forced into situations with Clark and the other characters to keep the plot moving. As a result, she has really little chemistry with Clark because their relationship feels forced.  Thus when (small spoiler) they finally kiss at the end, it comes off very flat and uneventful. The other characters are suitable but if the two major characters are bland and dull, that is a major issue.The film also struggles to develop its themes.  In the beginning of the film two major themes are introduced: hope and faith.  The film suggests that Superman will be a symbol of hope and how he will be the one find a way, do the impossible, defy the constraints etc.  The film also introduces this idea that Superman will have a reciprocal relationship with the people of earth: he will have faith in them in making the right choices and they will in return have faith in Superman in saving them in their time of need.  Only, these themes, as interesting as they, are again developed very poorly.  Superman is hardly a symbol of hope in this movie because he simply doesn't do anything really hopeful.  We don't see him inspire people to be better.  We don't see him try to do the impossible.  In fact, in the last scene of the movie, when superman has a chance to deal with the main antagonist in way that defies expectations (hence hope), he instead opts for the lazy and predictable way.  As for faith, this theme is poorly developed for the simple fact that we barely see Superman interact with the people of the world.  We don't see them ""stumble and fall"" or ""join him in the Sun"" because the film simply didn't care to develop these ideas.  If you notice a pattern in my criticism, its that the film likes to introduce ideas but has either no idea what to do with them or the film decides to distract you with action.Which leads me to another major issue, the nonstop CG action in the final 40 minutes of the film.  About a little more than half way through the film, the movie forgets about the character development and themes(which it handled so poorly already) and decides to show 40 mins of pummeling and tiresome action.  If you are fan of Dragonball Z or the Matrix films  you may be amused for a while.  But there is only so many times that I can see someone be thrown through a building before it becomes tiring.  And during these ridiculous action scenes, Superman forgets to do the one thing he does in every other version of Superman (comics, cartoon, Reeve's films): saving people. So many building are destroyed and so many people are injured and yet we barely see Superman even acknowledge his surroundings.  Snyder was more interesting in topping the previous action scene than providing the proper balance of Superman fighting and saving. This last point is indicative of the problem of the film: style over substance.  The film gives the illusion of depth by introducing interesting ideas but does such a poor job developing these ideas.  Instead the film tries to distract you with expensive CG action scenes, but even these scenes ring hollow because there is nothing beneath the action.  If you are looking for film with interesting and relatable characters, quality storytelling, and good thematic development look elsewhere. If all you care about is action, you may enjoy the last half of the film.",0
691,"Visuals: one of the best I've seen (espec in a blockbuster)Cast: ok, althought the actor of Superman has too big  imhoStoryline: same as 99% of blockbusters, this got me really sad. Imagine if they really put a GOOD, not braindead story with these visuals.. wouldn't that be magical? -3 points for griffindor for that.i think I'll add one more thing: if you have control of the spaceship, WHY on earth don't you simply remove the athmosphere and kill all the villains?",0
693,"""Man of Steel"" is decent enough. Yes, there are problems in this 2-1/2hr epic but overall it gets its job done. My main problems are with the casting of all the major characters (Henry is great but he's too pretty, I wanted a grittier Superman  and Zod was not menacing enough), the wholesome childhood, the lack of emotional reaction when he finds out he's from another freakin' world, and how Lois Lane can't stay out of scenes. Then there's the very final scene where he joins the Daily Planet which makes absolutely no sense in the context of this re-telling, I mean, the dude just saved the entire planet from some very bad characters so now he takes a menial job at a newspaper. I guess they have to adhere to canon but it's just so unmotivated in 2013.",1
694,"Man of Steel was okay. Not great, nor bad. I think Henry Cavill was the strongest part of the film. They really went overboard with the action, as if they were trying to make up for Superman Returns. I found it sorta exhausting after a while. I've seen a lot of different problems pointed out about the movie. I have a few but my biggest is how was General Zod, who was the foremost warrior on his planet and bred to be the best, so easily beat by Superman's father, the foremost scientist of the planet. Then he loses to the man's son, who's genes were completely random. I'm just saying General Zod really sucked at his job if you ask me.",1
695,Worse than X-Men Last Stand and Spiderman 3. None of the story makes sense as the whole film is full of contradictions. Several characters manage to impossibly show up wherever the plot needs them to as well. It's hard to side with superman in this film as you watch him do more harm than good.,0
696,"First off, screw the critics, I've lost any respect I had left for them, MOS is a masterpiece, THE greatest comic book film made, this is what Superman fans have been begging for and it was delivered with perfection! Stunning visuals, gripping story and the best action fight scenes I've ever seen, it was brutal! It made the The Dark Knight trilogy look like the Brady Bunch, I also loved the Sci-Fi aspect of it as well, Krypton and the spaceships were unreal, thankyou Mr Snyder for this amazing movie and please don't listen to the critics they don't have a clue, they still want Superman in red tights saving cats out of trees! MOS smashes 1978 Superman in every area, it's how a Superman film should be, absolute carnage! I was blown away by this and if the critics think it was so poor then why did the whole cinema I went to cheered and clapped in the end? I've never seen that before with any movie! Man of Steel is the new benchmark for superhero films now, It's way better than anything marvel has brought out, if I could rate it more than 10 then I would, EPIC in everyway possible!!!!  15/10",0
700,"I was so looking forward to seeing it after all the great looking trailers, but this is a mess and the worst movie i have ever seen. Everything was a mess. Long, boring and predictable like every other stupid summer blockbuster.",0
703,"If we think of a super hero, almost ninety percent of us will think about Superman. When I think of one of the best movies this year, I personally think about ""Man of Steel"". But just because it's a great movie doesn't mean it's flawless. Some emotions feel forced, forgotton, or simply ignored, and from one moment to another, Clark Kent simply becomes Superman. There's no building tension to him realising, discovering and exploring his posiblities as a super hero, they just throw the costume into his hands and bam, you have Superman. This is one of the biggest downsides of the movie, but that doesn't mean it's a complete mess.",1
704,"Well... this was... I´m kind of confused here. Going into the theater I had enourmous expectasions for this movie. I was pumped and ready to go into a new emotional take into the famous story of Superman. And what I got was more or less forty five minutes of that and the other hour and a half... well let´s say it didn´t stik with my that well.The way the trailers made me expect this movie was more of a slowly dedicated and emotionaly striking version of the man of steel (especially the third one, damn!). Still the fourth trailer was more focused in action than in story and that´s how saw this movie at the end.The beginning of the movie which takes place in the exotic planet of Krypton, (yeah, when I say exotic I mean giant alien rhinos and really got me emotionaly atached to Jor-El (Superman´s dad). It actually pulled on my parents strings! Seeing the planet implode in such a way was breathtaking and kind of harsh!Then came the stretch of the movie which I actually feel confused about: The becoming of Superman. From Kal-El beeing sent to earth it immediatly cuts to him all grown up and going. I felt good about this decision, it gave us the feeling of mystery! Then came the flashbacks and these were reeally good! I felt the confusion of Clark and his attachement to his earth parents, the Kents. But then when this ends, (mainly at the reveal of the Fortress of Solitude) I felt that they were going too fast and the buildup lacked something. Then immediatelly Zod shows up! And I was like ""Woah! I espected this farther into the movie! I´m not ready!"" And then from the first attack on Smallville everything goes crazy! At first I thought the effects where amazing! and the fast paced action was dynamic. But then the scene dragged, and dragged, and dragged. And I felt overwhelmed and kind of bored. I was praying for an break to get into the deeper aspects that the movie had shown us at the beginning! Then it stopped! I was relieved and interested about where it would go from here! And then more action... and more action. I saw that they where going in with those world tearing machines that I saw in the trailer and actually felt worried for the character of Perry running from the destruction! But those scenes dragged even more! The action was spectacular but it lacked substance! Except for one part where Superman can´t destroy the machine across the globe and Perry is trying to save the other chick. That was intense. That was... Nolan! Finally! I found you! And then... guess what!! More empty action sequences... Damn, someone went haywire with the effects. The fight between Zod and Clark began with a good setting of... well ash. It was nice to see something new. That fight I really liked but maaan, content pleease! Then the movie ends and Clark goes to work at the Daily Planet and and yeah, the second half of the movie left me so mind numb that I didnt give a about the ending. Otherwise I would be cheering for that scene.An aspect that I want to highlight is the relationship between the Kent mom and Clark. I really felt something in that mother to son relationship.Henry Cavil also lacked some emotion. Russel Crowe and the Kevs Costner were pretty good and inspiring in their roles.To summarize my experience I cried more in the trailer than in the movie. That beeing said, it was not BAD! I only expected something greater.",1
705,"A bunch of boring set up with an even more boring finale. Good casting couldn't help this snooze fest from its terrible action, terrible villain and poorly constructed introduction on Krypton with a bunch of nonsense with Russel Crow.",0
706,"And yet again, Superman franchise is reborn! The best thing about this movie is Henry Cavill, fits his role perfectly, actually all actors did amazing job! Main plot is good, but the story progression isn't. Action part is probably the best this year so far. It's a ok start for Superman saga, even though it's not flawless!",1
707,"Good, but not perfect. A decent Superman movie at the very least, but i've seen better superHERO movies. If I could give you one tip? Don't expect too much from Lois Lane. She's basically there to be stared at.",1
711,"I seen the movie man of steel and i give 3 and a half star's that doesn't mean it is a bad movie., i like more Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980) and the soundtrack of Superman (1978)  is better.",0
712,"Cavil  não  um ator a altura do homem de Aço achei ele pouco frio as vezes robótico, Ele matar o Zod  aceitável, não da forma que dizer por ai ""mimimi Ele precisou matar pra aprender que nunca mais deve fazer isso"", ele não  nenhum menininho sem consciência do que faz, fica melhor dizer que ele matou por que não tinha escolha e mesmo assim não  um explicação muito boa, Eles destruirão boa parte da cidade, derrubando prédios e explodindo coisas, Superman parecia não se importar nenhum pouco com isso, mas nenhum pouco mesmo, tava nem ai.Não curti também o fato dele não ter ajudado o senhor Kent.Enfim eu esperava bem mais do filme, passa longe de ser do nível da trilogia Batman do Nolan!",0
713,"whinydepressivesad over a thousand 10,9,8, eh metacritic.How sad This movie is just a sad mess-and the fanboyisms showing up here is proof.Nothing in this movie works and the fact the so many have come to scream their disapproval is typical of the fingers in the ears approach to life.When 2 comes out, it had better be a far better movie, but with Nolans  on the last 2 dcu films, I doubt it.",0
714,Pretty good movie. Story is familiar. Lois Lane is ok. The chemistry  between her and Superman is a bit weak.  Good popcorn movie. Action was great. It's superman. You gotta see it.,1
717,"Great special effects, some decent fighting scenes, shaky plot and writing (imo) and good acting. I did find it interesting to see a more ""real"" feeling put in for superman. The movie focuses a lot on Clark Kent's identity crisis as well as his struggles to find purpose in his life. I never really got invested in it though  the opening scene wasn't done very well and it didn't really draw me in.  Add to that some questionable moments written to make the plot work better that detracted from my experience and this is simply an okay movie, instead of a good one. Marvel is still top dog in terms of superhero movies so far, sorry DC Comics.",1
719,"This score is generous and based on entertainment value. DO NOT walk into the theater ready to compare ""Man of Steel"" to the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, because you will only leave disappointed. Having said that, this movie is entertaining. It serves up a massive amount of action, and the special effects are killer. My main issue with the movie was the fact that I never really felt like Superman was being legitimately threatened. The plot issues in every Superman movie are consistent; Superman is literally just better than everything. But hey, at least he is the most humble superhero in modern film. #seeit",1
735,"What a bore! Overblown, soulless, unimaginative, uninteresting, dull, dull, dull. You would be more entertained if you watched a couple of the Dean Cain Superman tv series. I couldn't make it to the end, and I was not he first to walk out of this movie tonight. Really, don't waste your time.",0
744,"This review may be a bit biased since I've never been a huge fan of the Superman comic book however, as a film I found this one in particular to be completely uninspired and unoriginal. Hope this doesn't count as a spoiler but, the fate of Superman basically rests on a flash drive. Also the outdated CG made every character animated through it seem like rubber.",0
746,"This movie is absolutely awful. The actors are all right, but the story has so many plot holes it just makes me angry. The action scenes are dull at best, and extremely repetitive. I almost walked out of this movie, and was happy when it ended. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",0
747,"This movie does a lot of things well and a lot of things REALLY BADLY.  Single scenes are inspired, Jor-El's role in assisting Clark oppose Zod is very well-written and acted, and the production of the film is stellar. Yet plot holes abound, Cavill obviously interpreted Clark as a cinder block in a cape, and the entire second half smacks of typical Zack Snyder trash, all action, no thoughts, hero and villain punching each other from set piece to set piece.  The bipolar film careens from intelligent, interesting and boisterous to utterly imbecilic and back again, sometimes all in the same scene.  Sadly, this movie is not worth the price of admission as the sum of its parts are less than the individual brilliance of certain ideas. You spend the first half dealing with garbled backstory, presented via flashbacks. The actors playing Young and Teen Clark convey a good deal emotion, which is to say they do a whole lot more in their limited screen time than Cavill.  The character of Jonathan Kent is laughably stupid (Seriously, the theater laughed at him in nearly every flashback) While the individual flashbacks mostly work, they are jarring in the course of present-day plot and make the entire first act feel disjointed.  One has to wonder if this is where a better director would have helped, as the movie lacks a cohesive feel.  It harms the slower pacing and bores the viewer.  Overall, the film attempts something similar to Bruce Willis' Unstoppable: the creation of a superhero in the modern world.  It's not a bad idea and there is some merit to the film's attempt but it comes across as a mediocre sci-fi film (much like Unstoppable).  It certainly doesn't feel like a superhero movie, which doesn't seem so bad until compared to... ...the special effects-laden, seemingly endless punchfest the second half devolves into.  Given Zack Snyder's track record of making over-produced soulless action flicks, I suppose this should have been expected.  It's almost as if one of the producers helmed the first half while Snyder yawned and interrupted all the talky scenes with incessant one-liners and cries of ""Booo-ring"" like a highly paid high school student, then snapped to attention and started making race car noises when it was time to choreograph the action scenes.  There's not a lot to say past that.   It's highly produced action, non-stop, until the end of the movie.  Some of it is smart, some is moronic, there are highlights and lowlights, but with no serious plot behind it, it feels weightless. This movie does a lot of things, though none entirely well. At points every aspect is great and at others terrible.  As such it can only ever top out as a mediocre movie: an action movie that bores you to tears for half the time or an interesting plot device riddled with holes and a mind-numbingly stupid ending.  No matter which side you pick, you wind up disappointed.",0
748,There are more holes in this shoddy story then in a pair of fish net tights.The pace of the film is stupid.The story makes no sense at points.Like Lois just randomly climbing across an ice mountain edge just because. Its a joke.Like its the first film I have ever wanted it to end so I could leave the cinema.,0
749,It's a DISASTER to put Nolan's name in Zack's film. They are in different league! One of the biggest disappointment in 2013. But I should give perfect score for Hans Zimmer!,1
750,"When I first found out about Man of Steel, I quickly assumed it's place in the world of cinema was to fill the void left behind by the recent, and also brilliant, Batman trilogy. While I didn't particularly expect something similar from a film with the same producer, I did at the very least expect something with a fraction of the quality. I found Man of Steel to be a rather soulless affair, missing that certain quality that drives you to feel for the plot and those within- a low standard easily achieved by the decidedly bland acting from the majority of the cast, lack of development in the characters, and the poor screenplay riddled with clichés. That said, the special effects were superb throughout, with only the camera shake effect becoming far too jarring and over-employed. It is for this reason that Man of Steel can only be described as a film that embodies the notion of style over substance. If you like the sound of a film that is overindulgent in explosions and tiresome action action sequences, this may be just the thing you're looking for.",0
751,"Honestly, I was very excited for this movie. Very excited. The opening scene was well done. They changed a few aspects of the storyline, but I am really okay with this. However, a lot of that changed once the story shifted to Superman and his background. All of the dialogue was extremely cheesy and hokey, very little made sense, most of the plot and scenes seemed thrown together  in fact, although I was bored, I felt as though this was supposed to be a 4-hour movie that had someone cut random scenes out. It was actually that disconnected. Zod was probably the most redeeming aspect of this film, and Russell Crowe wasn't too bad. But there are too many poor aspects of this film to make it enjoyable for me, including the extremely overblown CGI and action, which actually made me feel that the director was trying to distract me from the rest of the movie, rather than entertain me. Here are some questions I pose. Was this movie really directed by Michael Bay? I've never seen so many explosions, and I saw the first Transformers movie 3 times in theaters. Amy Adams kept teleporting everywhere. Is she Nightcrawler? How come Superman has just met this woman, and is immediately in love with her? Is this the Notebook? Superman was struggling for (what we assume is) 20+ years with his power. One pep talk from his ""dad"" and now he has everything under control and can fly? How? And how come Zod just went ""GRRR I'M A WARRIOR"" and then could automatically fly? There was no learning curve, build up, or  well... any logic, even in the fictional sense of logic. I guess my real question here is ...why? Three superhuman aliens are fighting, and one is protecting you. Why is our military wantonly shooting (with no effect) all three of them? And then declaring HE IS NOT OUR ENEMY like some 1984 computer? And on that note, how come nobody in the movie made mention of the weapons having no effect? ""MORE BULLETS."" Is this what we've reduced our military to? Pathetic. How come everyone in this movie magically knows what's going on? The plot seemed to move along so quickly and without consequence. Amy Adams makes this discovery. Her boss believes her but also ascertains she's right to keep quiet. Superman is satisfied with this result. Zod shows up. All within, what, 2 hours? The part that killed it for me, where I absolutely knew this movie was ruined, was when one of the chief officers of NORAD says, about a U.F.O. they know nothing about, including if it's a manned spacecraft, ""Whoever's at the helm of that ship, he's lining up to make a dramatic entrance."" Dumbest. Line. In the World. And this movie had many of them. Keeping in mind, there were some redeeming qualities. The action, although overblown, was somewhat entertaining  although the ""climactic"" scene wasn't actually the ""final"" fight, and that next fight was dumb and reminded me of the Family Guy chicken fight. Some of the actors did okay, and.. that's about it. The opener was well done, too. But I already said all of this. If you loved Transformers 2, you'll love this. If you didn't, avoid this movie. And thank Michael Bay for the inspiration.",0
752,"I wanted to like this movie, and it started out promising with some interesting development into Clark's past. Unfortunately, it quickly devolved into a completely boring, formulaic, unintelligent, twist-less, and one-dimensional good guy/bad guy movie, with about 60 straight minutes worth of repetitive action scenes that reminded me of Transformers 3 (which also, not coincidentally was well-reviewed by the mindless public, but despised by critics).  Might be worth seeing for the first hour, but certainly at least wait for the dvd, or don't see it all.",0
753,"Man of Steel is in essence a hollow two hour music video featuring a caricature of Superman. The plot is wafer-thin, utterly incoherent, and instantly falls apart where even an iota of thought is applied. The so-called characters are one-dimensional, lacking any depth, development, or motivation. Nothing and no-one makes any sense. It would seem that the loud and flashy visuals were cranked up to 11 in an attempt to disguise or compensate for this. Shame then the visuals themselves are also quite poor. In terms of Superman's world-famous conscience and moral values, both the movie and the portrayal of Superman himself are also repugnant. I find it very difficult to believe that even the most casual of Superman fans would fail to miss the utter disregard for human life displayed. I won't say anything more about this to avoid providing spoilers. Fans of Superman  or just of decent films in general  should avoid this.",0
754,"Although Cavill himself proves to be a perfect match for the role, the movie is destroyed by a horrific script, painfully bad camera work, and no understanding of human emotion or logic. DC's live-action movies continue to suffer from a lack of quality and continue their desperate need for a major overhaul.",0
756,"this is the worst superman i ever seen. this is not superman at all. the story is so far off from the original film.and he is so geeky, trying to be mucho.  the original superman is more charming, brave, heroic.the new superman never saves anyone, he is crashing buildings and dont care about the people, that is not superman.   NO,  THE MOVIE WAS JUST STUPID!!!   the only good in it was the special effects.",0
758,"Man of Steel isn´t as great as it should have been, but at the very least what we get here is a very enjoyable movie. From a spectacle perspective it doesn´t disappoint, the last 45 minutes or so, is jam packed of exciting action that definitely gives the man of steel justice. From a character point of view however, the movie suffers in some key areas. This is not a lifeless Michael Bay effort in any way whatsoever, there´s genuine character development here that for the most part works really well, but the matter of fact is that it all doesn´t effectively ends with the right amount of emotion. There had to be more emotional weight in the final battle, one that not even Lois Lane is able to provide with Superman. It has some pacing issues and the characters are not as fleshed out as the trailers initially tease they will be, but what is here is good, very good indeed, and so it all happens to add up to a super-fun summer movie.",1
761,"Poor movie… there was not a single moment that made me enjoy or care about anything that happened on the screen. it was long, over the top, loud, melodramatic, and as deep as a ""steel"" can of tuna fish. No acting and no characters… a dark and gloomy transformers… If you love the DC universe… then you owe it to the wonderful universe the comics have create to hate this borefest…. Zack Snyder… seriously guy… you suck!!!",0
762,"Overall, despite all the eye rolling ludicrous moments and plot holes, I was entertained by this film.  The acting was good across the board, although I wasn't crazy about Michael Shannon's performance as the bad guy, General Zod.  Too one note.  I also get tired of people beating each other to a pulp only to get back up without a scratch on their body.  That is the norm in super hero movies, however.  I also felt the movie had one battle too many, and was way too destructive.  New York City is decimated in this film.  This film is LOUD!  The special effects were excellent and the 3D good.  Overall, a success, but not great.",1
764,"Reasonable first act, a good second act and then everything is ruined by 40 mins of CGI brawling and utterly stupid writing. It's almost like several different films were written then smashed clumsily together.",0
769,"Well of course a year before it came out, many people were wondering ""Do we really need yet another Superman movie ?!?"" The answer was clearly No after seeing this flop. A few positive notes first; I do like Amy Adams in her part as well as Kevin Costner and I'd say the buildup in the first third of the movie as Clark was growing up wasn't terrible. The biggest problem was in the end when you have the inevitable battle with a bad guy; one of those battles that just goes on and on and on ...and on and on. it was ridiculous. Keep in mind its one of those situations where of course Supermnan is essentially indestructible and of course his nemesis is almost equally indestructible, yet they endlessly throw each other through buidlings, throw cars and trucks at each other, bury themselves under tons of concrete and metal... but neither one is hurt of course so you just get totally bored with it. This was a total waste and 143 minutes of my life i will never get back.",0
770,"This was a terrible film.  A terribly-told story that was poorly paced and needlessly convoluted.  Cavill as Superman is well cast and the photography is visually pleasing.  Other than that, this was a total miss.",0
772,"I was really disappointed in Man of Steel. Henry Cavil makes a great looking Superman yes, but that's where the enjoyment ended for me. Zach Snyder's tone is just too serious for what should be the ultimate comic book movie feast experience. The movie feels self-indulgent and overblown, and not in a good way. I was missing the fun to balance out the heavy gloom of the the movie. But I'm not too surprised after seeing what Snyder did with, or is that to Watchmen. Lately the best examples of superhero movies have been X-men and The Avengers. What a pity Man of Steel doesn't deliver on that kind of fun.",0
773,"I never usually watch Superman films, as it is not something that really does it for me, however this film took me by surprise.A fully entertaining movie with some great actors.Action is well paced and thought out, this film is brilliant.",1
774,"This was the Superman movie I've always wished for.  For so long I wanted to see Superman kick ass, and finally I got the movie I wanted.  Previous Superman movies focused too much on romance, and his double-life as Clark Kent, and not enough on the fact that he's damn powerful.  I loved every battle, especially the final one.",1
777,"One of the best superhero movies I've seen in a long while... and that says a lot. Don't listen to the critics or silly nostalgiac, biased fanboys on this one  they're mostly angry because Superman's more humanized (makes mistakes  not the traditional boyscout as Donner's movies made him out to be), it's more serious in tone (not as much over-the-top humor as past Marvel movies) and saying it has too much action (a tad bit too much explosions but this is a Superman movie; what'd they expect?)!! I've seen even more ridiculous reasons for hating this movie  from simply hating the director, how they chose to get rid of Superman's silly and not-so-iconic underwear and Superman destroying half the city (compare this to the Avengers where there's 6 superheres in a team-up movie, Superman needs to be in two places at once and Superman's relatively inexperienced in this one). If you were expecting a Summer Blockbuster (that shows off CGI), a reinvention of the Superman mythos and some emotional scenes which cause us to see why Superman is the man he is today  then you'll be loving this movie. Don't go in with ridiculous expectations and go in open-minded. That's all I can say. Go and see it!!",1
778,"“Man of Steel” is a new interpretation of Superman for the modern post “Dark Knight” age of superhero films. The story is more serious and asks the question of “will I be accepted into this world or be feared?” While I like the new take on the Superman origin story and how uniquely it’s told, I found the script to be rather weak. The character moments are scarce, everything feels a bit rushed, and the dialogue comes off as super cheesy almost to the point where I was cringing. However, I am a huge fan of how this film is directed. Zack Snyder does an awesome job with what he has. The action sequences are choreographed amazingly, quit possibly the best action all year. Camera work in this film is really well done and the editing is spot on. There are some really inventive shots and the final fight sequence with Zod is riveting. The actors do a fine job with their characters. However, no one really stands out aside from Henry Cavill as Superman. While he’s no Christopher Reeve, I really like his take on the character. Amy Adams as Lois Lane is decent, but the way the character is written is kind of weak as I never really cared for her and she came off as a bit forced. Michael Shannon is pretty good as Zod, but the character could have used more screen time. Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast is solid and play their roles well. Visual effects in this film are top-notch. From Kypton to Earth, everything from a visual standpoint is breathtaking. I’ve always been a fan of Zack Snyder’s visual style in film and here he’s put them to great use. The score on the other hand is okay. While it’s great in the film, it’s rather loud and forgettable. Overall, “Man of Steel” is a solid piece of cinema and it has me pumped for more Superman movies as well as a potential Justice League film. However, it does fall short in the story department. I felt like I was going from one ride to the next without having a chance to breath. The film has some interesting things to say, but only on a few occasions does it take the time to say it and even then not very clearly. On the bright side though, we get the most action packed Superman movie and quit possibly superhero movie of all time. There’s a lot of fun to be had, but if you’re looking for something deeper and thought provoking this isn’t the place. I give it 3.5/5, weak story that is made better with great action, stunning visual effects, and fantastic direction.",1
779,"A lifeless tiresome drag of one huge explosion followed by another. The directing, writing, and editing are all pretty bad. The characters don't feel real and identifiable. Top it all off was the fact that there was no comedy relief from this bore.",0
782,"No redeeming value.  Big budget, dumb plot, just action sequence after action sequence.  When two invincible people fight, how do you decide what a ""deadly"" move is?  I just don't get it.",0
783,"Leave your brain at home and enjoy comic book capers.There are plenty of 'WTF??' moments related to the plot. Constantly shaky camera means you can't really get into the action scenes easily. Lois is not that hot.  Superman himself is cool. The bad guys will scare 12 year olds.BUT there's tons of action, thousands get splatted and massive destruction and incredible CGI.Not really worth the 3d ticket. One of those films where you have to see it on the big screen. Watch later at home and you'll be facebooking on your mobile on the sofa and only half watching before you know it.",1
784,"Holy crapstacks Batman!  It's official. This director shall forever be known as Hack Snyder. That's 3 horrific bombs in a row and yet this man is revered as genius. Can anyone answer why? He's another Michael Bay. His characters are flat and soulless. His actors are always chewing scenery and completely over the top. The action is ridiculous and akin to watching someone play their XBox for 2 hours. Thank god there was about 11 minutes of credits. I kept checking to see how much longer the pain would last. This is one giant stinking excrement of a movie and Warner Brothers is letting him make another one? I'm going to go watch Richard Donner's 1978 classic. You know, the one with heart, passion, great characters that you actually care about and a story that leaves you with a smile, not headed to the toilet. How far we have slipped as an audience to accept this crap.",0
786,Man of Steel deserves a classic superhero movie comeback! Otherwise the story is so amazing and the action was too intense. I enjoyed this movie but what I expected like The Dark Knight.,1
787,"I had a good impression to seeing the film. The story isn't neither too simply and banal nor too difficult to follow.The character have been reinvented and rewritten with good results. For me has been a success. I think that on the base of this movie is possible to launch an interesting trilogy. Maybe was properly that who wanted the producer after abandoned the last film launched in 2006",1
789,"In a word: Absurd. Is extremely predictable and full of absurd situations also, actors performances are not very good. I do not understand why the developers created it this film this way... Perhaps it was only designed for children.",0
790,"This is a popcorn flick. That's what I was thinking mid-way through the movie.After seeing the first trailer and having Christopher Nolan's named pasted on credits I was expecting the same kind of vibe from Christopher Nolan's Batman films, even though he's just handling production that's just the vibe I was getting from the trailer. Then reviews started making it's way to the internet. The more the reviews came out the more I was less excited about this movie.Going to the theatre with low expectations, then coming out after watching it, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie a lot, and I don't think it's unfair to say I wanted this movie to be deeper emotionally, because it did have some potential to be that just by watching some of the scenes. It didn't have to be the same dark themed level as batman(Christopher Nolan films) but it could've still been a pretty dark film. Pros. Visually very beautiful. From watching superman's cape slither smoothly around the ice, to General Zod tearing places up.. The first 20-30 min? Seeing the world of Krypton and watching it get destroyed was really interesting. I've never seen a super man movie start out like this, usually it would be the first 5 min of krypton, then you'd see Kal grow up on the farm.. Flashbacks of Kal growing up, trying to understand his purpose, struggling to fit in was something to expect but still done well with some very emotional scenes.. General Zod. Interesting character, and great acting by Michael Shannon.. ACTION, ACTION, ACTION! Man there were some really great action scenes, if there's something to look forward to in this movie it's the action. Cons . Poor character development. Lois Lane? C'mon.. A lot of the scenes felt very rushed, especially when it was progressing towards the ""Super man"" reveal.. There were moments where it had some great potential to be very dark and emotional but they squander it with some unnecessary comedy scenes.. I liked the action a lot but I felt if they cut down some of the action scenes that were taking more than half the movie to bring life to some of these characters (Kal) then I think I might have enjoyed it more. So yes overall I enjoyed it a lot, but like I said it had some great potential that was shut off for a lot of explosive action and some mindless comedy scenes. Still, I'm actually really excited for the next Super man film.",1
791,"In one super man movie he turns back time, sadly for the franchise this cant be done. It has been cursed to walk the earth as a dry cliche american pie Jesus swagger piece of junk. Avoids it or better yet just skip around and save your self 2 hours.",0
793,"the story is well written,the actors are great,the effect are awsome.but..........they made a little mass,this is how the movie progress:talking,talking,talking,talking,talking,talking,action,action,action,action,action.a good movie whould mix talking with action.not do talking 80 minutes of the movie and 60 minutes only action with almost no talking.this movie could have been better but i still reccomend to go and see this movie becuase it is a good movie.well it better from the horrible superman returns.and they succeded doing a good reboot i am hoping for a sequel.",1
797,"This is one of those few clear cases of critics doing the most. This movie has the most impacting action ever in a super-hero movie. That´s a great point. The character is difficult to handle by nature, so I think they did a really good job. It was very entertaining, it gets better in a second watch, and I also like the way they portrayed the female character. All actors were good. It was about time Superman got a serious film, a decent one. It is darker than what I thought, and that´s another point. The score is absolutely perfect for the movie. Just the whole first part in Krypton alone is surprisingly enjoyable and well put together. Super hero movies can´t really make it to the best films of the year. But damn it, this was the best summer blockbuster of 2013 (Iron Man 3 being the worst, as usual)  Definitely. Can´t wait for the upcoming sequels. They got it right guys!",1
799,Wow! What a hollow piece of Christian propaganda... Absolutely disgusting. Thank Jebus I didn't pay money to watch this tripe... This movie deserves 0 dollars.,0
801,"I thought Man of Steel was a good Superman movie. A decent action movie. As far as the 2006 Superman Returns movie,  Man of Steel was so much better. Henry Cavill makes a much better Superman then BrandonRouth did and Amy Adams a much better Lois Lane.  Although Man of Steel downplays the chemistry between Cavill and Adams. I saw potential in them as a screen couple, but there wasn't enough of a buildup.to their first kiss. Hopefully the sequel.will play up more as a couple. The action was good. Somehow I felt disappointed though. Not by the acting. There was no bad acting in the movie. Everyone plays their part well. I just felt like there was something missing. Like there wasn't enough story or something. I guess I just expected more",1
804,"The tasteless need to explain every aspect of this film causes poorly written and artificial to dialogue to preside. As these explanations are given before the story has really begun, it is hard to care or even listen. Were it not for these problems, the film would amount to nothing more than a generic summer blockbuster. It's worse.",0
805,"A good attempt to revive a classic, but just shy of a home run. The action scenes were fantastic, and you'll leave the theater thinking of how fantastic they were. But don't expect the movie to make any lasting marks. The film felt cliche' from start to finish, topped off with an eye rolling ending. The protagonist (need I say who) was extremely static  and monotone throughout the whole film, along with every other oblivious character. Beyond these problems, Man of Steel is a decent film that nails a plethora of things like costume design, music, and special effects. I believe Super Man fans should feel lucky this came out at as good as it did.",1
806,"*sigh* The Superman movie about how to not be superman... great...Lets get down to it right now: I hate superman as a character and no im not a stupid Batman fanboy yelling and cursing without thinking, i know what SUperman represents and i repect that (even like that) but Superman is just not my thing. Why i bring this up you may ask? well so you can think about why a Superman hater like me got that this movie doesnt represents superman at all and the thousand and one superman diehard fans love this movie. Another thing I am not the kind of poeple who knows alot about Acting so im not gonna judge the acting unless its so odvious that even i can notice it. Lets get the good things out of the way first, since they are fewer: The action, like everyone says, its amazing. Its full of intence moments and tons of  blowing up and its all good until you realize your watching a SUperman movie, or at least your suposed to. What imtrying to say whit this? well if you dont get it right now let me explain: This is not Superman ok? i guess they tried to ""Redeem"" him from all the bad movies but instead of been a good redemption like the Dark Knight it feels more like a kick in the balls like the Green Lantern movie (live action one). Hell the Green Lantern movie at least got the idea of the hero better that this movie does. Lets point out the biggest plot holes:- The beguing in Krypton feels.... awkward, even out of place somehow. While the effects are cool most of the scene feels too fast to the point you dont really care whats happening or why it happens, mostly your looking at the scene for the effects. Also whats up whit Sup's mother? you know your son was sended to god knows where, your arny is reveling against the goverment and on top of all that the planet is about to blow up and you look bored like ""oh here we go again"". It really throws you out of the moment, if you where invested in it at all. Its sad when the villain is the one showing some feelings. - The Scene where the step-father saves the dog from the car but the gets injured and.... you know for some reason tells Clark not to save him.... even hough he had plenty of time to walk to them or Clark to run normally and save him... or... you know i could be all day pointing out ways Clark could have saved him without revealing his powers, or using them at all... next! - Oh yeah Superman kills Zod... because.... aparently this Superman is way too stupid to know other ways to defeat Zod without killing him like, you know Superman does. Oh wait yeah i forgot this is not SUperman, just some othe guy wearing his costume. Those where only my mayor plot holes but they bring up the mayor problem of this movie: THIS IS NOT SUPERMAN! sorry for caps but i had to do it... but yeah this is not Superman! Superman is a hero who has a warm heart, whos prescence is enough to inspire hope in the hearts of all around him and who is incredibly strong but its kind enough to let his oponents live.A Hero who care more about to protect the people and even the buildings of metropolis than his own life. As much as i hate to give prays to Superman im a man of honor and i know when my enemy deserves respect. My name is Krayserlols and If i understand it i hope you do too. Now if you excuse me i heard Lobo appeared in Young Justice.",0
809,"I went into the theater with great expectations but what I am left withis just pure disappointment. So what went bad  Snyder is moreinterested in blowing up things, things he come upon road, sky, etc.than establishing his characters to intimate levels. If people are tosee the disintegration of skyscrapers and such, they can always haveMichael Bay at their disposal. But why Superman  This could have beena much better movie with little expansion of Clark's Kansas story andlimiting the explosions for a few occasions. I tried to see through ifthere's anything more than just detonations but I couldn't possibly do. There is some serious lack of charm in Cavill's Kal-El and so does inAmy Adams' Lois Lane. In occupying the screen presence, only Costnerseems to pull it off and Crowe in parts here and there. And there'sthis non-linear telling, which should have accounted for somefascination, actually back fires. Had the script been filled with sometake-the-cake cliff-hanger moments, it could have worked. I am a fan ofsuperman myself but, in all conscience, I cannot imagine me liking themovie despite its flaws, thanks to all the deafening things happeningin the last hour. Not entirely soulless though. At least not until when Zimmer is around.The living legend with all his might gives this undirected thing abackground score to rejoice. I cannot believe Nolan is a part of storycredit. Rest in peace, Superman. and if you are to resurrect, I wish togod, let there be some less noise.",1
812,"I have come to expect more from Christopher Nolan's projects. Even ones he doesn't direct. The film is beautiful, it's sprawling, it's epic, it's personal but at a certain point it's just more Superman and I'm not sure that makes it better.",0
814,今年最好看的超级英雄电影，特别是前面90分钟对于超人的前世今生寻找自我的心路历程描写的超赞，片头氪星超美，最后的打斗戏眼花缭乱较为平庸但还是比较震撼。配乐超级棒，摄影和剪辑超棒。亨利卡维尔的超人演得真棒！,1
815,"The film gets off to a slow start, but makes up for it later on with an 'almost' overly long action sequence but luckily the action scenes are well played out and are stunning to watch. This really is superman redesigned, if your a fan of the old superman and come here expecting the old superman, then your probably going to leave the cinema feeling disappointed. On the other hand, look at it in a brand spanking new superman and the effect is quite different. The story was basic but well delivered, but the narration could have used abit of work. Some characters didn't feel at all fleshed out and kind of bland at times, even superman himself at times. The biggest and liveliest character of the film was supermans enemy, Zod. Simply put, one of the best villains in a hero movie ever. Infact saying he was a villain would be almost unfair, if you actually get inside Zod's mind, you see that he isn't doing the things out of pure evil nature but for the good of his race and that is what he has been born for. I give this film a very strong 7 or a 7.5 if the rating system had it.",1
816,"Visually stunning and action was some of the best I have seen in a superhero action type genre (which literally saved me from giving this film a lower score).  Story could have used a lot of help though.  Pacing was really bad, too much jumping back and forth from and no real establishment of anything related to superman (you as the viewer are already expected to know the superman universe I guess).  I do think that critics have given it a fairly low score though, although it could have used work I believe that the ratings should be much higher, especially higher than the latest Iron Man movie which was complete garbage.",1
817,"Man Of Steel is movie that will split the audience in two. Gone is the humor and the light coloring,what there is left is a serious take on Superman, one that takes also makes changes  big and suttle. The basic superhero formula is gone, and if you expect Clark Kent, comes to town to save humanity, then you will be disappointed. Man Of Steel is about an Alien, that has to come to terms with this fact, to fit in and utimately make a choice  good or bad. And just because you have these superpowers and could cause mayhem as in total annihalation or be that individual that helps other and humanity  doesn't mean that you from birth is given this kind of morality nor commitment. And this is basically what this movie does. It makes us understand that Kal-EL is as complex as he is strong. The movie also shows us what his powers can actually do, and the destruction caused by these powers are more than huge  they are out of this world. To me as an adult, Man Of Steel is finally the movie that gives me what I would expect from a Superman movie 2013.Superman is holier than thou material, and as such I can understand, some of the bad reviews, but they miss the fundamental fabric of this movie, that it isn't supposed to mimic or replace Donners movies.",1
818,"Overall a fantastic superhero movie. But a little disappointment that General Zod the powerful enemy of superman dies in a little fight which should be extended for next part and there is disappointment from Henry Cavill's acting although he have a great body which is suitable for Superman but I think Superman Should at least looks like the ""Captain America"". I think this movie create new standards for action movies. Surely this is a next level of action in any action movie",1
820,"The main problem with this film is that it contains an inordinate amount of essentially pointless content. Roughly 30 minutes is spent on exhaustive (if superbly rendered) fight scenes, all of which could be described as totally unnecessary given that the films ending is so obvious: good over evil, difficult moral choice, bright future et al. The Christopher Nolan touch is apparent in the quality of the film's production, but not in it's plot. Furthermore, at times the dialogue descends into superhero movie cliché, none of which is as rewarding as it is in say, the Tobey Maguire Spiderman series. Aside from this, the film makes for an enjoyable watch, with some genuinely moving, epic and humourous moments, and it provides an excellent platform for what could be a fitting followup series to the Dark Knight trilogy in the DC Universe.",1
821,"I really like the movie. It kind of let me down though. It was really dark, their was few comedy. The old supermans were not like that. And their was to much mass destruction. Their was more explosions in this film than all the marvel movies combined. Snyder has done 300 and watchmen. And those were just like this. It put me on the edge of my seat more than I can enjoy. I think they were trying to be to original. Their also wasn't enough interaction between lois and clark. One second he is saving her and the next they are kissing. It was to rushed. I wasnt to big of a fan of the shaky camera thing that he did. All in all. Casting for everyone was perfect. Story was great. I just really wish that Zack Snyder didn't do this movie. This movie had so much potential. But he I truly believe is the reason this movie doesn't have a metacritic score higher than 60",1
822,"Just like any other movie written by Nolan, it will naturally have layers. And any movie directed by Snyder will look spectacular. But if it was edited differently, it might be more pleasing to the fans. Nevertheless, I thought it was fantastic! By far it is the best Superman film yet.",1
823,"Wouldn't be bad, if there wasnt sooooooooo cringe worthy acting and dialogue. Also a pretty bad casting choice for zod in my opinion. Take with this, a grain of salt, as i never really found superman to be all that good anyways. Still this movies an injustice to such comic book",0
826,"Man of Steel was good, no doubt, but I still left the theater somewhat unsatisfied. Why? Well, its hard to say really... most of my criticisms about the movie are nit-picky and circumstantial. A great amount of time was spent on a reinvented Krypton, introducing fans to new concepts about Superman's back-story, and providing rich content for those less avid superman fans, that is, until  Krypton is destroyed and a young Kal-El is shipped off to Earth. There the story becomes a little convoluted. An adult Kal-El is now, all of a sudden introduced to the story, and what little information is provided about his childhood is presented in the form of flashbacks. While personally, I would have liked to see a bit more development in this area, I suppose it probably couldn't have been done much better. I mean, entire comic books and even a television series have been based solely on his adolescence. Proper development in this area would have taken another movie, and well, put simply, ""aint nobody got time for that"". The overall presentation of the movie was absolutely stunning, and Snyder does an excellent job of displaying Kryptonian power to scale, on Earth. The acting was pretty decent as well. It would be hard to not to with such a cast. Henry Cavill did an excellent job of portraying Superman's overall demeanor, almost seeming very Christopher Reeve like in is interpretation of the character. All in all, the only real complain I have about the movie was the lack of character development. If Lois Lane had died in the movie, not a tear would have been shed in the audience, simply because not enough time was spent developing her story, or anyone else's. Doing so, however, would have been a monumental task. This movie done right, would have been two different movies. So, in that sense the ""Man of Steel"" franchise seems a little incomplete. There is talk of a sequel, maybe then we'll see what this story, and this version of Superman is REALLY all about.",1
827,"Though fans might miss the levity that made Richard Donner's classic 1978 film Superman: The Movie such a game-changing joy, the thing that really sells this respectful reboot is the dramatic conviction underlying all the mega-scale mayhem.",1
828,"Man of Steel is the breath of fresh air that's been so needed in the Superman film saga. It does its own thing respectively, completely ignoring the Donner films and instead, focusing more on the comic book material. At times a bit uneven with its pacing, and occasionally sacrificing character development/backstory for action, Man of Steel nevertheless is the crowd pleasing, action packed spectacle that Superman fans have been waiting years for. 3.5/5",1
829,"Good movie. A bit too overblown on action in the third act, but the movie has a good story, good acting, a refreshingly new take on the origin story of Superman, beautiful visuals and incredible action-scenes. A good start to what is hopefully going to become a new Superman franchise with Henry Cavill as the Superman for generations to come.",1
830,"Can't say i have ever seen anything superman related before this movie, so my review is solely based on the film itself rather than its place within its universe and to be honest i liked it. Sure there are some problems i kinda feel that the first section on Krypton should have been longer and it would have been interesting to see Clarke (or whatever you want to call him) growing up on earth in a more fleshed out manner but the film handles them well enough. What it really excels at however is the action scenes which if your into explosions and huge effects are pretty awesome and the music during these scenes is pretty good also, although it did remind me a lot of Mass Effect 3 with the world maker looking like a reaper and some of the same musical effects being shared. (thats not a fact they just sound really really similar in places) Louis's character is also pretty well fleshed out and although she does get saved a lot she handles herself pretty well overall. I feel like i'm missing what all the controversy is about, as far as i can tell Man of Steel is a good action movie that kept me enthralled throughout. Personally i enjoyed Man of Steel more than films like the avengers which i felt was massively overrated....then again it may just be me.",1
831,"As an avid fan of superhero movies, I started this one with high hopes and expectations but was highly disappointed. There was really no character development with most of the movie being outrageous fight scenes that ran so long they frequently lost my attention. The dialogue was cheesy and filled with cliches and awkward attempts at humor. The acting itself wasn't overly terrible but the horrible script and jumbled mess of overused special effects make this move just not worth watching.",0
832,"Cavill is convincing as Superman, the visual effects are of top quality and there is a lot of destruction. Unfortunately the plot is predictable, the battles are more like a show than a dramatic struggle to save the Earth (Superman is completely unharmed, entire city blocks collapse but no civilians are killed) and Amy Smart is boring as Lois. It's a good Superman movie but it's not exciting.argonautis.eu",1
833,"Personally I thought this movie was going to be terrible, but every part of the movie seemed meticulous. I wanted a Superman movie that didn't cover his origin story but here it doesn't feel like an origin story because it takes place during the same day. What made me angry was everytime superman got tinto a fought he destroyed a lot of buildings and it took away the fact that he is a vigilante. Also it feels that superman evolves as a fighter which makes you way more invested into the character of superman.",1
835,"I went into this movie not sure what to expect. I was impressed by the trailers but I knew that Zack Snyder has never made a good movie. I'm sad to say that this colossal disappointment is no exception. It seems Snyder was attempting to make an epic, soaring sci-fi film with a genuine sense of wonder, but the resulting movie falls flat on its face, weighed down by dreadful, tedious, overlong action scenes. If there's one thing the movie does get right, it's the casting. The lead actors are all fantastic, which helps the audience forgot how mediocre the script is for the first hour or so of the movie. After that point, everything is wall-to-wall building-crunching explosive action which seems to be catered specifically towards the Transformers crowd, but feels horrifically out of place in a Superman movie. For all its attempts to be ""realistic"", the movie glosses over the apocalyptic destruction and probably massive death toll wreaked by Superman and Zod over the course of what seems like four hours. The movie overall is extraordinarily unfaithful to Superman's character and lore. There are little mistakes throughout the movie, but the climax of the movie contains a betrayal so jaw-droppingly huge that I'm honestly surprised DC allowed it on screen. Perhaps the biggest problem the movie has is that it takes itself far too seriously. Superman has always had an aspect of silliness that the original films managed to capture nicely, but is completely absent from Man of Steel. Superman is a timeless character, and rebooting him isn't a bad idea, but it would take a director much more talented and intelligent than Zack Snyder.",0
836,"I'm going to review this professionally and efficiently. Here we go, man of steel sucks. Okay here are the things I like in that film. I liked the action scenes, the action scenes were good. The rest I found mediocre and stupid. The story was poorly executed, generic and boring as all hell. One of the problems I had with the story was what they did to the origin story and Lois. Basically they took them both of them and added super over the top action transformers crap They literally have Lois trapped in a pod crashing into earth and having superman dramatically float out of the ship and save her. And another thing I did not like about the film, the over dramatic feel of the film. I laughed when superman yelled when he killed Zod along with many other things that were unmemorable. The acting was the same equivalent of twilight with no emotion or life in it whatsoever. Most of the time you will be seeing a blank face for almost the entire movie. Another thing that bugged me was that it tried to capture the dark gritty feel of the batman films but failed in doing so. Overall very mediocre film, I suggest you don't watch it",0
837,"Overblown with tons of action-packed sequences, ""Man of Steel"" is able to slightly exceed its lack of humor and much joy in the film. While the film does feel hectic at times, the high flying spectacles and exhilarating action are interesting enough to exceed some faults.",1
838,"Compared to Superman Returns this movie is a hundred times better and I'm surprised to see how it's getting such negative reviews from so many movie critics.  Is it as good or better than the recent Batman movie?  No but it doesn't have to be to be a good movie and I really like this modern re-telling of the Superman story.  As well as the actors do a great job in the movie especially Louis and Superman's Dad were great in the movie.  The fight scenes are also amazing in this movie as well with the fight in Smallville being my favorite in the whole movie.  Overall it's a good movie worth seeing if your either a Superman or superhero fan with it only having one huge major fault.  But I won't spoil anything but Superman does one huge thing that is very, very un-Superman like.",1
840,Movie started of good with a story then it went to Superman meets star wars that is when I lost interest it is to bad as far as I am concerned there is no more superman you ruined it for good.,0
842,"Man of Steel proves that Superman is only interesting when he has a decent adversary. Although the final act may be too reminiscent of Avengers Assemble, Man of Steel is well made and well played, especially by Crowe and Costner as the fathers. Too long, perhaps, but the movement between past and present generally work. Overall, much better than expected and reported. So long as Lex Luthor isn't the only villain in the sequel, the franchise may have a positive future.",1
843,"This is the best superman film to date, finally my childhood hero can be done justice in this awesome movie. I do not know why this movie is looked down upon, yes it is a different superman, but I find this one more believable. Not only that but this is a movie where superman actually FIGHTS unlike the GOD AWFUL Superman Returns crap which somehow scored higher. Any way the flashbacks rendition-ed in perfectly and I think that the action scenes were fantastic go out and see this movie you will not be disappointed. Even a hardcore superman fan like me can put up with a changed superman. It is worth every penny.",1
844,"I didn't have any doubts that Zack Snyder would disappoint me, in fact he didn't  The whole movie is just a great portrait of the ""man of steel"", it's the Superman that I loved to watch and the story i just well-narrated.I don't understand all the hate to this film, but I just want to say that  ""the director of a movie is just the illustrator of his own comic"", so don't pretend to watch a movie perfectly-copied-by-the-comic, honestly I would gave to this movie 3 or less instead of 9  Btw, Zakk Snyder made a perfect job with some Nolan's councils, I guess (I saw his paw xD) and when I watched it, my adrenaline began to flow  Henry Cavill gave a face to the new Superman and he made a great acting, really great acting for this role and the whole cast made it the same, expecially for Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner (just amazing acting),Michael Shannon was a son of  in this movie, only him could do a role like Zod  haha !Conclusions  The film is great, is a director's view of Supes and we can all enjoy this movie  Cheers ",1
845,"As for the story, it was good, but could be better! The thoughtful characters, memorable performances, good music and effects. Its the new Superman, the best Man of Steel",1
846,The film begins with a fantastic action packed introduction on Krypton and it is truly a thrilling start to the film and the segment from when Kal-El arrives on earth to when he takes on the role of Superman succeeds in keeping the audience entertained through an origin story they have already seen before. One of the film's greatest attributes is the decisions and directions it takes in how to tell this iconic story. However the same cannot be said about the execution of these great ideas as there is not enough time given to develop them further. Once Kal-El finally puts on the suit things really start to pick up and the action really is outstanding despite occasionally dragging on for too long particularly in the final fight. Another gripe I had with the film is that there are only about four characters that get enough screen time and development which leaves actors such as Lawrence Fishburne not getting a chance to shine. All performances are good in this film and Henry Cavill does a great job in the lead but Russell Crowe's Jor-El is an obvious stand out here. Man of Steel is a good and much needed reboot of Superman that keeps the majority of the audience entertained. Despite a few flaws that hold the film back from being truly great Man of Steel is certainly lots of fun and could definitely be the launching pad for a franchise,1
847,"First viewing I came out conflicted.  I had gone in with a few too many preconceived notions, and despite a deep admiration for Zack Snyder, I left the theater with mixed feelings.Namely, the overall tone of the film (fairly dark), the seeming portrayal of Pa Kent, and the end resolution of the final conflict of the film. On a second viewing, however, everything fit together nearly perfectly.  It may not have been the Superman film I expected or wanted, but in the end it was an amazing film and a great introduction to the DC extended film universe. The action scenes are, of course, amazing  this is Zack Snyder.  The acting (with minor quibbles about Amy Adams) is excellent.  The biggest fault to the film has to be the script  it feels like an attempt to Dark Knight the Man of Steel  but the director working with Cavill (Superman's actor) gave us a modern day but still very true-to-form Last Son of Krypton.  The storytelling is great, but the plot itself is not what I would have necessarily wanted overall. To clarify, however, I'm not saying the plot is bad.  I'm saying that, in a perfect world with me calling the shots, the plot would have been different.  It's not a perfect world (part of the point of the film's story) and it's the plot we got.  Snyder and crew make it more than work, they almost make it sing. The score grew on me with repeat viewings as well.  It certainly adds perfectly to the emotions of the various scenes.  If they continue to use it I expect it to fall into line with the classic Williams theme (though, to be fair, it will never supplant it.) Easily worth a 10 out of 10.  Not quite Snyder's best work, but considering how much was riding on this and how constrained he surely was, this was a stellar piece of cinematic storytelling.",1
849,"Over the years, the Superman movies have all had quite the sentimental hold on my heart. Of course I have had my favorites and my least favorites, beloved nonetheless, but there was always this sense of longing I felt at the end of them. When I first heard about the ""Man of Steel"" and it's epic, amazing, beautiful production team I absolutely knew that that wistful feeling would finally be sated. This was the take on Superman I had been waiting for since I had first seen the original. No longer confined by the limits of the technology of our time meant a vision that was unhindered by the laws of what was realistically attainable. Unfortunately, I knew that not everyone was going to give this movie the respect and appreciation it undoubtedly earned. Though Superman is a fictional character, he in fact receives very real factual scrutiny. I believe this is due to a number of different ill perceived reasons: As the most widely known, first and original superhero, his story has been told a great number of different times and people are easily desensitized, especially in this ""golden age of superhero movies"". Another reason, I believe, is that people love to tear down and criticize icons. They splash their names on them with abated acrimony, laced with obtuse accusations and fallacy just to create a controversy, all for a little attention. It's really such a shame. Entertainment Weekly is quoted saying, ""...he's been transformed into the latest in a long line of soul-searching super-brooders."" An article on cbsnews.com says something similar stating, ""The film wallows in sorrow more than soars. It lacks the fun and lightheartedness of previous (Superman) movies."" Even Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun writes, ""Very little joy or humor in this story. Leaves something to be wanted."" Saying these allegations are preposterously incredulous is a severe understatement. I mean, do the critics actually try and understand the movie they are writing about? Is it not realistic that Clark would be ""soul-searching"" from the moment he not only found out he had not been born into his family, but also from an entirely different planet? Are you saying it isn't pragmatic for the film to lack ""joyfulness and humor"" when once the protagonist finally meets the handful of people from his obliterated home world he's been searching for the last 33 years, he is forced to banish them into an eternal prison dimension and beat the rest to death with his bare hands in order to protect the innocent people and his adopted home from utter destruction? Is he not allowed to ""wallow in sorrow""? It's not like these are new-age ideas and story-theories in the Superman universe, the director just puts that event in a tangible, real world setting. How would you feel if you had to endure something as immeasurably agonizing as that? Despite some of it's extremely negligent, distasteful reviews, ""Man of Steel"" is the absolute greatest depiction of Superman I have ever seen. It's story telling is incredibly flawless and it moves between Clark's origin and the main theme of the movie with a graceful and fulfilling ease. From the breathtaking opening scene of the struggle on dying Krypton to the legendary, groundbreaking, afflicted battle between the Man of Steel and General Zod, it is an epic showcase of achievement. The cast is absolutely incredible and their talent is unsurpassed as every scene they will pull you in and make you feel like you are a part of the immeasurable grandeur of this awe-inspiring motion picture. I look forward to the sequel with the same tenacity and impatience that I held for this piece of history.",1
851,"This was the best Superman movie I have ever watched. Snyder has given us a 2hr 15 min film filled with action, sentiment and most importantly grounding Superman in our 2013 world. The film starts off with Jor El, magnificently played by Russel Crowe, trying his best to send his son away from dying Krypton. He encounter general Zod whom would do anything to safeguard his people. A fist fight follows up and Crowe successfully sends Superman to earth. This whole sequence was shot with great spectacle by Snyder. The action when Crowe rides on the dragon and when he fights with Zod were shot fantastically. Hans's music stands out big time during these sequences as he follows a theme in the entire movie. I will come back to this later. After Superman is grounded in our world, we see him wandering around just like everyone else and meanwhile David S Goyer gives us an interlinked childhood life of Superman in his screenplay. He simultaneously shows us superman's childhood problems while still holding on to Superman's present stature. Screenplay wise, a great job by Goyer. Even the scene where a lorry driver pissing superman off in a bar he is working in shows us how bad humans can get as compared to superman. This makes us think are we worth it. Kudos to Christopher Nolan for this story. Then comes one of the most emotional scenes in the film where young superman asks his dad whether he can still pretend to be his son. And Costner says that 'you are my son', hugging him. Nolans scripts are always emotionally good with various shades of love and relationshps. The dad-son relationship between them was penned with perfection and the main reason for this is when Nolan writes off Costner. Costner dies in a tornado, beleiving that the world was not ready for superman to reveal himself. Cavil's acting in this particular scene deserves mention. This guy has talent. Fast forward and we see an action set piece in the middle of the road. Snyder has used fast action visuals to showcase superman's powers differently as the action is now much faster and quicker. Planes get blowed up,choppers get blatsed, glass shatters in every frame and explosions are vast in this sequence. The visual effects are top notch here as well. Now, moving on to the climax of the film which occupies nearly the last half an hour of the film. Superman has to stop a machine that's turning earth into krypton by general zod. He has to create a black hole so that zod and his team will get sucked in. Here is where Han's background score scores highly. His heavy drums together with the theme of the film gels well. I particularly loved the scene where superman rushes to save lois from free falling while zod's team get sucked into the black hole behind him. His acting in this sequence is very good. Even after all of theses ends, Nolan's touch of sentiment comes into play in the last 5 mins of the film. After crashing into a church after crazy fist fighting with superman, zod tries to kill a family with his laser eyes. Here, Zimmer's background score of just the piano works wonders as superman asks him to stop, only for Zod to say never. Cavil has huge talent and he cries in this scene so well that a tear drop fell from my eye in the theatre. Very rarely does someone cry in a superhero film, but Nolan shows us his quality of writing. So, in the end, this is definitely a 5-star rating from me. A must watch for me and you wont be disappointed.",1
852,"The Superman comic book fans have been waiting for!  First movie to truly depict his power in real world terms as close as visualized in its source material.  This movie is not for the faint of heart or children, it has plenty of powerful action and violence, but it reflects what the amount of destruction comics have often in the comics (e.g., read: *Death of Superman* comic book arc) and necessary to give a sense of what a Kryptonian invasion could look like, if these characters were real. The story itself is unoriginal as origin stories go, but Superman has always been unoriginal since his conception.  If you can stomach violent scenes, this movie is A Must See!",1
854,"I've always hated Superman, and didn't want to watch this. Don't listen to the haters on this one. It's fantastic. Easily in the top 3 comic book movies.

856,"Let me first say this, if there's an action hero that I always disliked it was Superman. Superman stories were always a giant mess of gigantic nonsense and plot holes bigger than Yellowstone National Park. This movie manages to bring a superman that fits and while the movie isn't perfect at all, its a very good movie, I enjoyed it for the most part. Characters  6They tried to get out of the 60's, 70's cliches, but its hard, the workarounds to get the characters into a more XXI's century culture didn't work in my opinion. Plot  6Maybe too much in one movie, maybe I'm wrong, but it just felt too much, still the plot is nice, doesn't have big holes in it, which for a superman movie is big achievement, things happens always at the right time for everyone that matters to be saved which in my opinion is what makes the plot a little weak, considering that the movie seems to attempt to bring ""realism"" into the story, it fails miserably, if you want to redefine superman into the new age, then don't be afraid of doing only half.SPOILER(stop this nonsense that only the grunts, the bad guys and some random civilians no one cares about will die.) Action  9Almost flawless, it achieves exactly what I think they wanted, the action sequences are brutal and well made, something that you can watch many times and not get tired of seeing them. Drama  8You know, its all about the search for humanity and so on, I think it has a little too much unnecessary drama, but its well made, you watch it without rolling your eyes, so its nice. Acting  7I'm not a good judge of this, but it didn't felt very good. Special Effects  10Simply put, extremely detailed perfection. Cinematography  8Its nice, its one of those movies where you don't really notice it, meaning it suits the movie well, but also means it wasn't extraordinary. Soundtrack and Sound Effects  7Just like Cinematography, nothing stands out, but there's some sound effects that stand out for the negative, its like they just placed them there because they sound very ""cool"", that is bad but not that bad since they were indeed, cool. This isn't a movie that I will watch again, probably ever, but, the action sequences where special effects excel, those I can watch over and over again, a good movie to see if you are in the mood for it, if you are not, then you won't like it very much.",1

862,"I panned this film at first glance, it almost felt like a Michael Bay movie with mass explosions and a bare bones story. After a second and maybe third viewing, I think this movie grew on me a bit more. Its a solid origin story that focuses on Clark's time in Krypton and General Zod's lust for power in a time of crisis. The standouts for me are Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane and Henry Cavill who were all good castings and did well with their rolls. The story does a good job of being its own movie while not trying too hard to set up for future movies or installments. On the downside, I did find the film to be unnecessarily dark at times, there was also I felt a over use of CGI and not enough practical effects.",1

877,"Up Up and a Waste What is this noise? This nonsense? Does anyone truly like this trash? Is this a re-boot or Superman V going off the charts? These are some of the questions I muttered to myself while enduring the punishment of sitting through Goyer/Snyder's Man of Steel. This post- modern, piecemeal picture provides us with a perfect example of what's wrong with movies today. You get a lot of bangs for your bucks but little else. The real Man of Steal here is Goyer, who should be charged with 150 counts of plagiarism. At first I thought all of the stolen bits crammed together in the Dark Knight trilogy was Nolan's work. But now I see the blame lies with Goyer. Instead of luring us into a narrative the way Joss Whelon expertly does in The Avengers, Goyer keeps throwing us off. We can't get close to a Goyer-penned movie or really feel much of a connection to any of its characters. Why? Because the entire story feels like a hoax. A sham. Fraudulent. The only thing I can really sense is the writer feeling good about himself. But forcing a lot of clever little bits together doesn't make a complete and well-rounded story. Does anyone other than other post-modern architects like post-modern architecture? And Snyder doesn't help the cause out much either. He is not a great director by any stretch of the imagination. He may not even be a good director. He's adequate. Take that to the bank. There is no Snyder signature or unique style. No well-honed skills much less practiced mastery. Out of his league here, he merely dekes his way through by going along with Goyer's hodge-podge of a script without adding much depth, definition, dimension, sensibility, intrigue or much of anything else to the movie. Some claim he's an expert with visual effects. Again, merely adequate. More does not make better. He's certainly not in the same league as Cameron, Scott, Gillian, Burton, Jackson, del Toro, Sommers or Verbinski. Any hack can rely on the Special Effects team and desaturate the colour. And the incessant, superfluously over-the-top, non-stop, nose-bleeding, mind-numbing climax which must have squandered a hundred million dollars alone was so polluted with your typical crash-bang-smash-up-and-destroy effects, I found myself nodding off out of boredom. Has the concept of originality become that offensive to movie studios? Remember when cinema was the arena for great story-telling and television the place for trashy entertainment? When did it switch? Sometime between Burton's Batman and HBO's The Wire. The studios should save money by using the same sound effects track on the climax of every action movie. They all sound completely identical. Close your eyes, this could be the Transformers or Iron Man or any final action battle scene. What a waste this was! The whole show! I felt bad for the actors and sorry for the producers. This was a bigger mess than any of the recent Batman movies (and that's saying a lot). The fact is WB/DC has no concrete plan much less a vision for its line-up of super-heroes. The Goyer-Snyder team-up cannot, by any stretch, be considered the World's Finest. Not to be a complete hater, there are three things I liked about watching the Man of Steel. The space ships were very cool. The alien costumes were quite awesome. And my trip to the bathroom halfway through the movie was a big relief. I had to force myself back to watch, hoping the movie would redeem itself. Fat chance. I used to be a big DC and Batman fan. But I now look forward more to Marvel's line-up of superhero movies than any future Bat-Supes bonanza. They should have given Wonder Woman to Whedon when they had the chance. Actually, four things. Antje Traue as Kryptonian warrior Faori-UI was a treat (if Warner Bros had the smarts they'd dress her up for the next Catwoman. But I suspect Marvel will nab her first. I could see her alongside The Avengers).",0
878,"This is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a while. It started out pretty good with likable and unique characters, but disaster strikes, and they all become flat and boring characters. The constant flashbacks in the beginning of the film were also slightly annoying, leaving no room to develop Clark in the present. The action scenes are pretty repetitive, overlong, and boring. The pacing was absolutely horrible, and the cinematography was absolutely horrible, with random zoom shots and lots of shaky cam. I had a very unpleasant time watching this film.",0
879,"I realize this movie came out over a year ago but I just wanted to say that I walked out from watching Man of Steel at the theatre simply feeling down. It was waay too much destruction and towards the end of the movie where like half the city is destroyed and you can visibly see thousands upon thousands of innocent humans plus thousands more off-screen inside of the buildings get killed in some way or another. Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing put together movie with awesome effects and all but all I'm saying is there is A LOT more destruction and death of innocents than is needed. I couldn't really be proud and happy for superman even after he won and saved Earth because the fact that all those people, no doubt including children who's lives were more cut short(not shown being killed on-screen but saying hundreds or even thousands die off screen is perfectly fine for some reason...). Superman saves people right? Well that did happen in this movie but on a small scale so to be honest, I simply could not appreciate this movie or even Superman. But then again this could just be me and my really sensitive heart... But I'm sure some people will agree though.",0
881,"The fact that anybody tries to defend this is beyond me. The characters are lifeless, the plot events are absolutely absurd, the acting is bland, and Superman possibly kills more people than he saves! Superman leads Zod to locations with more civilians just for some more cool action scenes. Here is the problem with that, SUPERMAN IS PUTTING LIVES AT RISK FOR NO REASON! People try to defend this movie by saying ""Its dark and gritty you just don't understand it"". Don't let those idiots fool you, this movie is not respectably dark. This movie takes no risks with its narrative or characters, making it loose any chance of being actually dark. This movie is just disgraceful. Don't spend money on it.",0
882,"This is just a very brief review, but DO NOT GET THIS. It makes no sense. The main problem is, it keeps going backward and forwards in time, until you reach the point when you have literally no idea when the particular scene is set. The only thing going for it is the giant dub step machine.",0
883,"I give the first 30 minutes of the movie a 10/10 and the proceeding hour and a half a 0/10. It honestly felt like the first half hour couldn't have been done any better and the latter part of the movie could not have been done worst.  Every event surrounding his father and protecting his identity was wrought with logic that doesn't stand up to outside scrutiny.  A reporter who had no prior contact with him tracked him down effortlessly and there's at least a few dozen people that have seen him in action and seen his face and yet when it comes time to save his father it becomes a necessity to protect his identity and let the father die.  That entire scene was a mess though as the family as it makes no sense whatsoever.  They open their car doors, start talking about how a tornado is about to reach them, and they feel the need to close the car doors after the realization and locking their dog inside which they somehow forgot about.  ""A tornadoes coming?!  I should first shut all the car doors and THEN run for shelter!"" The movie also killed the magic of superman as an extremely competent superhero with a few scripting blunders.  First of all, only superman seemed to be having difficulty with General Zod's men.  In that spaceship Lois managed to kill like 4 or 5 of the enemy alone using one of their own guns which undermines Supermans struggle with them as he kept getting knocked around in fist fights.  I'm also used to Superman media having him save the day before anything tragic has a chance to happen but in this movie a whole city gets totaled with an expected casualty count in the millions and we're supposed to think it was a happy ending just because an army girl calls superman ""hot""?  We're all used to Superman films, cartoons, and comics having lots of collateral damage to buildings and the city but there was never the implication people died in the process and yet this movie ends with the explicit message that many innocent people of that city were caught and killed in the turmoil.  Superman just felt like a sham of a hero with how incompetent he was at handling the situation and his failure to protect the people.",0
884,"I recently rewatched this movie and leave it with a higher appreciation: First of all I have to say that I also saw recently the JL and batman TDKR part 1 and 2 animated films and despite they are good movies (not great) the Superman character (and other heroes) is really dull and I didn't like it at all (au contraire of how interesting Batman is written).They manage to give Superman his own story in a compelling way, the character has depth, he is no a government dog he makes his own decision and he decides everyday what kind of being he wants to be ""the Savior"" or ""the Ruler"". Also there are a lot of people complaining about ""destruction"" there is a lot of destruction in the DCU, I believed them when they talked about the destruction but after seeing the animated universe the fighting scenes are really well done and are one of the higher points of this movie. Second, after seeing the direction of Batman v Superman through the trailers you realise that the movie has lot of nice details touching religion, how humans can react and that not everybody is prepare or will trust this ""god"" and how all this set the premise for BvS. Despite this cool things (and other I don't name), how look the movies looks, etc there are a couple of moments that don't make sense or there are really not reason to be there (like the tentacles thingy, or the military chick saying that superman is hot). This movie is clearly not perfect but is probably the best superhero movie right know, the actions scenes are awesome, everything looks nice, the constant possibility that is given to Superman to make his own choice is a great touch (despite we all know he is not going ""dark side""), how people is not necessary reacting well (sometimes it's beyond stupid how they react but it's also something that happened in the animated universe), personally I don't understand why people are complaining this much about the movie but  I'm not a comic book fan and, like I said, I'm talking from what I saw at DCAU (which, to me, isn't perfect neither).",1

Everything is so structurally unsound and apparently filled with explosives it's hilarious! Yes, there's an obvious plot hole based on miscommunication, but I guess they needed to create the tension somehow. For those who say it's dark and moody - you should really go watch Dark Knight again: that movie was dark and depressing on so many levels. This one is just literally 'dark' because of the color palette used, but other than that, no major deaths and the S-man is always there to save the day. Imho, Terminator 2 has a darker tone than this movies, and that's saying something. To summarize, it's a nice blockbuster movie with decent entertainment value. It's nothing to write home about, but it's worth the time to see it.",1

904,"Man of Steel – Revisited DC has entered the cinematic universe, and it all begins with this 2013 entry – ´Man of Steel´. The basics aren’t that well presented, it even goes a bit meh after a couple viewings, even though it still got its action-glamour. Plot holes, messy action & rushed storylines somehow didn’t get caught up in the writing process. A great background of the man from Krypton is a wonderful aspect yes, it even managed to bring a few ethical dilemmas to light, but the basics didn’t. The action is without any doubt great, but to fail to enlighten the audience a better, and a less odd storyline that doesn’t leave them with an “ugh that was odd”-feel; that’s bad storytelling. Our antagonist is on the other hand understandable, and both him and our main hero are very well established, and we get a lot insides to their past self, even though Zod just is a classic angry-villain. One thing is for sure and undeniable fact with this Snyder-flick; Hans Zimmer’s score might be the best aspect. Meanwhile shaky cam, an overly packed amount of vague CGI & some small fragments of overacting; that’s something BvS really got to overcome. But will Zach Snyder be able to look beyond his past and truly succeed with BvS? For the sake of the DC Universe, he better will. Personal rating: 70/100Critical rating: 51/100",1
905,"Pa Kent is not supposed to fill Clark with fear of humanity.  That bothered me much more than the mass destruction.  Clark's father believed in both his son and humanity that tomorrow would be better if people weren't afraid to hope.  Also, Clark does not find himself traveling the world but rather is grounded in being from a small, rural American town with family who love and believe in him.  That contrast against Batman makes both characters more compelling but the movie tries to make everything like Batman because he sells, Watchmen was a great movie.  Zach Snyder seems to enjoy reflecting heroes in a dark way largely because there's pressure for money and to follow gritty trends but it is disrespectful to the character of Superman.",0

909,"This is perhaps the best film to introduce the modern audience to Superman. Gripping straight from the start, Man of Steel takes the audience from the new and improved Krypton to the revised childhood of Clark Kent to his first climactic encounter with his titular nemesis Zod. It does everything right in a reboot, and it does it exceptionally well. Zack Snyder's choice for more graphical/ stylistic cinematography more akin to the comics is well implemented and brings back the strength of Superman. Cavill's portrayal of the beginning superhero is near perfect. Casting choices were great albeit character relations seemed a tad off. Despite this, the action never ceases to be engaging and fight scenes were amazingly done on a massive scale. I believe that this movie is extraordinarily underrated as it is able to capture the essence of the modern Superman perfectly. We get to see more of Kent's backstory as well as a more emotional take on the characters around him. The lack of a solid relationship with Amy Adam's character is preferred but not necessarily essential as it has been thoroughly established by the past few films. Overall, this is a magnificent start to the DCEU and sets the stage for the (also excellent) Batman v Superman. There can always be parts that can be be improved upon, but for now this is the best introduction to the modern Superman anyone can get. More emotional than the stiff Superman Returns, while also packing the action nessecary to captivate this ages audience. I think Man of Steel should be the standing example of what a good superhero film should be today. Side Note: When in comparison to films like The Dark Knight, it obviously isn't as well crafted but I'd like to think that TDK Trilogy is in a league of its own.",1

The acting is great, the special effects are incredible and the kind of never seen before Superman storyline is coherent, intriguing and interesting, we also get a lot of Krypton which is very nice.

The so called critics who slam the movie for not having enough humour or for over the top action or for whatever unprofessional reason are completely unfounded in their ""arguments"" and just prove how arrogant non objective they are, this is not 1970's, hero movies must retain a serious tone to be relevant nowadays.",1

In spite of that, Kent lets his father die because his father doesn't want him to reveal his identity? Really? And finally, are we really supposed to root for some guy who knowingly destroys half a city along with the future of his own species in the middle of a testosterone fueled fight? Really? Also, both my girlfriend and I had more sympathy for Zod and his crew (who were more or less the only rational people in the story) than for Clark Kent or any of the other ""good guys"", which is quite telling considering how one-dimensional the villains were overall.",0

The movie suffers the absense of a strong actor like Russell Crowe in the end (although they find out a way to keep him in the movie as long as it´s possible) but Henry Cavill does a good job keeping you interested. Not the best material for Michael Shannon but it seems like he could´ve done something more giving Zod more character or memorable things to do or say. The movie is a solid 8 but has problems in the story and the way approaching it. For a 2:20 hs of a film, they put together a lot of things for the future. Maybe in future films the rhythm can be tone down a bit to let big moments sink better. And less CGI goes a long way for a movie that wants us to believe that something like this can happen.",1
927,A very good superman movie after the campy superman returns. I loved this movies first half. The emotional scenes were so raw and real I felt his pain and agony of clark kent and how he was trying to figure out who his is and how to coupe with these new powers. I definitely had a Christopher Nolan feel to it even though zack snyder directed it. Henry cavil did a fantastic job as superman and russel crowe as Jor el was so good. Some people have complained about it's lack of romance you know what i say to that blah. I could care less. The one thing i do agree is that it could have had better character development. also In the movies second act the action was powerful and the final fight was well done but I though there could have cut at least one action scene of took a break for just a little. Some people might like this about the movie but i didn't. Hans zimmer was terrific as always. I mean when has the man never delivered.  Go out and see this movie it's emotional action packed powerful and definitely the best superman film we have been given in recent years.,1
928,"Although this film is filled with over the top action and forced Jesus symbolism with Superman, I can't say I didn't have a lot of fun with this movie and I am excited to see what DC has in store for us in future movies such as Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad coming out this year. Although Zack Snyder clearly has problems directing and I'm glad Ben Affleck is there to maybe talk some sense into him when he gets to excited and forgets to explain things such as why Lois is so important to Zod in this movie to the point where he demands to have her in this ship. Check it out if you're a DC fan or a Superman fan or watch it with some friends if you want to see a dumb action film.",1
929,"Well, I will try to keep this short. I love super hero movies, hater the D.C. universe in particular, and yes I have read the comics, seen previous movies and cartoons. I dont like DC comic. because it's dickhead",0
932,"This is the best movie in 2013, it's awesome, it's heart pounding like hell, Henry Cavill is the best superman I have ever known. The fight scenes is extremely awesome, the world engine is heart pounding, this is an awesome superhero movie ever",1
933,"Man of Steel represents the latest attempt by Warner Brothers to revive a Superman franchise that, since its stunning 1978 revival, has been abominably treated for about 30 years (ever since Richard Donner was unceremoniously fired from Superman II). This movie certainly looks and feels a lot different than any of its predecessors, and that's not just because of the crappy 3-D. It's more of a science fiction/fantasy adventure than a superhero movie. In a way that's good, because it doesn't come across like a tired retread of every origin story we've ever seen. On the other hand, it's not good, because the sci-fi feel has been overly influenced by the likes of Independence Day and Transformers. That's right: blow everything up, real good! Pyrotechnics! Special Effects! CGI up the wazoo! For those who crave cinematic mayhem, Man of Steel is right up your alley (and it will make a ton of money). But something important has been lost along the way: heart. This is a cold, sterile motion picture. The characters are so thinly drawn that it's tough to get much feel for them. And one senses that director Zack Snyder is less interested in Superman than he is in the orgy of destruction he gets to rain down on Metropolis. Somewhere, Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay are smiling. Man of Steel is, first and foremost, a great spectacle. The effects work is first rate and the action sequences, of which there are many, are delivered with a kinetic punch. The tone is dour - humor is at a premium and, on those rare occasions when it's there, the delivery is decidedly low-key. The movie wants desperately to be taken seriously and viewed as something more than a comic book film. Perhaps, in the end, that's one reason why Man of Steel rarely feels heroic and never truly soars. Sure, Superman eventually wins but at the cost of thousands of lives (we're not given a specific body count but it has to be very high). Christopher Nolan's influence will be hotly debated, especially since the producer has been coy about the full extent of his involvement in the final product, stating only that ""it's Zack Synder's film."" Indeed, Man of Steel is closer to Watchmen than Batman Begins in terms of its look and feel. It's a style over substance thing, spectacle over heart. Snyder never ceases to amaze visually but one could make a compelling case that he ""misses"" what defines Superman's uniqueness. It makes sense for Batman to live in the dark but Superman has always been a figure of light and truth. That's one reason he's a difficult movie subject because there's no ambiguity about who he is and what he represents, and there's something about the darkness that pervades Man of Steel that feels wrong for the character. The choice of Henry Cavill to don the cape is inspired; Cavill is easily the most accomplished actor thus far to fill the role and, while no one will ever fully eclipse what Christopher Reeve brought to the screen, Cavill uses Man of Steel as an opportunity to lay the foundation for what could be a long and memorable run. He combines the matinee appeal of Reeve and Brandon Routh with a stronger resume although, truth be told, the screenplay underuses his range. The main requirement for Cavill is to look the part. As a cookie cutter supervillain, Michael Shannon does a good job overacting. He snarls and yells and exudes menace. He rants and does all sorts of nasty things. In the end, however, it's the name ""Zod"" that puts Shannon at a disadvantage because it forces him to exist in the long shadow of Terence Stamp. Stamp's Zod is arguably one of the twenty most memorable movie bad guys and Shannon doesn't touch him. The other casting miscalculation is Amy Adams as Lois Lane. The part doesn't fit. On the other hand, there are some great choices, although most of them are sadly underused. Laurence Fishburne makes a terrific Perry White, although he has very little screen time. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are great as Clark's Earth parents although Costner in particular deserves more screen time. Man of Steel delivers forcefully on its promise to take Superman in a different direction. Perhaps that's a good idea; after all, Richard Donner (with an assist from Richard Lester) has done the ""traditional"" Superman as well as it can be done. But a lot is missing, and the most telling absence is the element that makes Superman more the hero of his own story rather than the pawn of special effects. This is a less promising opening act than Batman Begins because it mines so little new territory. Remakes like Man of Steel are about intangibles like tone and style and how well the soul of the central conceit has been maintained. Snyder succeeds in making this movie sufficiently different to justify its existence. The open question is whether this Superman can spearhead a franchise that aspires to greatness or whether this new ""dark vision"" is merely window dressing.",1
934,"I seriously enjoyed this movie. It is by no means perfect, and the darker tone can sometimes make it a little dull, considering how difficult it is to make a genuinely good Superman movie I feel Man of Steel delivered. One thing I wanted to see was Zack Snyder establish the Man of Steel, and highlight that this is an ORIGIN story. I feel that he delivered here. Superman is instantly shown to be a flawed individual, who has conflicting morales and emotions and, though as he gains more experience as the hero he will become the Superman that we know and love, this current inexperienced, young and emotional Superman is perfect for this new DC Universe. Henry Cavill plays the role very well, I enjoyed his performance and feel he will only get better as the Man of Steel. The score is incredible, and captures the tone and feeling of the movie in different scenes perfectly. Smaller roles such as Kevin Costner's Jonathan Kent and Lawerence Fishbourne's Perry White make excellent additions to the movie also. The main attraction here, as it is with most of Snyder's movies, is the action. The fight scenes with Zod's army and Zod himself are unbelievable, and the best action scenes of any superhero movie I have ever seen. Though it can sometimes become a little hard to follow, there special effects are unreal and must be seen for yourself. I was not crazy on Amy Adams' Lois Lane, despite being a fan of her acting. I feel she was slightly more of a damsel in distress than she should have been. I also think that sometimes the dialogue and story does fall flat on occasion, which is fairly standard in Zack Snyder movies. All in all though, I believe the critics have got this one very wrong. It is a very enjoyable movie which could be the start of something great for DC. If they don't mess it up.",1
935,"Let's get the negatives over-with: I would preferred Ed Harris as General Zod, as he would have been more intimidating. While Michael Shannon is a good actor, there's something a bit goofy about the way he speaks in the role. I did not like the tornado scene. I liked certain things said by Jonathan Kent, but didn't like the way he was written overall. The were a couple of times certain plot-points could have been resolved more logically. The pacing was a bit off, and there didn't need to be so much CGI spectacle. Other than that, this is the movie the made me like Superman. That's an achievement in itself. Great action contrasted by some touching little moments with characters like Martha Kent. The visual design of the Kryptonian elements were genius.",1
936,"Un Superman prometedor, espero que cumpla con su cometido en el futuro. El villano y la historia regular.",1
937,Man of Steel is the best Superman movie in my opinion. I was never that into him until I saw this movie. Cavill is the definitive Superman. My gripe with this movie is the over the top action and fight sequences that went on for too long.,1
938,"Muy buen reinicio para este super héroe. Años esperando una adaptación decente para el Hombre de Acero, después de bodrios (III, IV: The Quest for Peace & Returns), al fin llega una película que le hace justicia al personaje. A pesar que el Nolan estuvo involucrado en la producción de la película, tiene algunas fallas, tanto en algun desarrollo de a lo largo de la película, aunque no es tan malo. Me encantó que Zack Snyder muestre el verdadero poder del Hombre de Acero en esta película, desde hace tiempo que quería ver a un Superman así. El soundtrack de Hans Zimmer es magnífico en toda la cinta, y en las escenas de acción lo logra mostrar mejor. Me encantó el enemigo de la película interpretado por Michael Shannon, ""General Zod"", un buen villano, para comenzar este reboot, incluso me parece mejor que la versión de Superman II. Muy recomendable para aquellos que desconfiaban que no iba a haber otra buena adaptación del Hombre de Acero.",1
941,"Man of Steel is by the best Superman movie to DATE. Henry Cavill is worthy to the role of Superman once perfected by Christopher Reeve. Michael Shannon as General Zod intimated me and you feel for his character as he wants to make sure krypton will still exist regardless of the amount of people he kills. Amy Adams as Lois Lane impressed me because for so long Lois Lane was the stereotypical girl who would always be in danger, where as in this movie she is a self independent woman who give up on a story.",1
942,"The best Superman origin story ever told in a movie format. Henry Cavill looked and felt like the Superman the world deserves and needed. Russell Crowe was superb as Jor-El. Filled with over-long action sequences and a re-telling of the most iconic Superhero to ever exist in our modern time.Michael Shannon as General Zod was frightening & intense while at the same time you can understand the reason as to why he does the things he does. Sorely for the people of Krypton! The romance arc between Clark and Lois felt forced and lacked any real reason as to why they even fell for each other, however I did enjoy the way Lois found out about Superman. The kryptonite for this film was its weak script. While it didn't kill the film, it certainly hurt it and made it suffer. The dialogue and the pacing could've been handled a lot better with certain sequences being executed poorly. What did this film do best? It brought a perfect being we know as Superman into a world that is not so perfect. It threw away the Silver Age character we knew of and threw it into a pool we call realism. And that turned a perfect hero into a hero with flaws which made me care about the character. (Why care for a superhero that is always perfect?)",1
943,I really enjoyed watching this film. There is a lot of action to keep you entertained especially the fight scenes. The characters are played really well and I never got bored. The graphics are impressive and the story line is really strong. I can't see any reason why you wouldn't want to watch this. I highly recommend.,1
944,"Man of Steel is one of the most underrated superhero movies of all time! My excitement for this movie definitely payed off as it is beautifully directed by Zack Snyder as he rivets me from scene to scene. He is not the greatest director ever, but he does manage to give us a pretty bad-ass superhero flick that we should come to expect out of Superman. With his masterpiece of Watchmen, he has proven us that he can indeed create a breathtaking comic-book adaptation -- excluding Batman v. Superman. Rating: 7/10",1
945,"A lot of the hate against this film is because of the attachment that long time fans had to the late 70's version of Superman. Christopher Reeve did an amazing job with Superman. For it's time and for that vision. He did great. People are attached to that version of Superman. In 1978 where Lois Lane can't tell the difference between Superman and Clark Kent. Even the 1978 version of Superman had moments of darkness where he went through self doubt in the fortess of solitude and grew a beard and punched people at a diner.Man of Steel's Superman is so compelling and so well written and acted out by Henry Cavill. It's a compelling story of self discovery. Clark Kent does not become Superman until he is 33 years old. The acting in this film is terrific, Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe steal the show as General Zod and Jor El, Superman's Krypton father. The first 20 minutes of the film are amazing. Sent to earth in Moses like fashion. Rather than being treated like a campy hero in this universe. Superman is a strange alien who is seen as a threat almost devil like. This is exactly what would happen in today's society. Ultimately, Superman accepts the responsibility of being the earth's savior. So many religious tones in this film.  Great looking and great feeling film. Very emotional and compelling. Hans Zimmer's music is mesmerizing. Such a beautifully made film that is treated by some in a very ugly fashion.",1
946,"This movie is just great. It has everything: good plot, actors, spectacular special effects and a fantastic soundtrack. The suit of Superman has been improved and is more sofisticated and real than in other movies. I love this movie so much! If you like superheroe movies and sci-fi, you must see this film.",1
947,This is how a Superman movie should be made. It was a thriller from start to finish and I enjoyed every second of it. The fight scenes in this movie are legendary.,1
948,"Sure, the script is lacking and the action is a bit over-the-top, but ""Man of Steel"" still succeeds as a fantastic superhero story. The characters seem real and intense, and the score is breathtaking. If you love Superman, you're going to love this movie!",1
949,"What Man of Steel delivers in great action sequences, visual effects and musical score, it dearly fails in its poor storytelling, dull tone and bad direction. The overall pacing of the film was my biggest dislike, going from extreme action to slow storytelling and flashbacks, right back to fast action without keeping consistency on how the plot is developing. The final fight was, even though great action, pretty much pointless from the plot's point of view. Character development outside of Superman was, well....to be fair there pretty much was none. The dull tone of the movie really went in the opposite direction as to what Superman is and what he should be. The moments between Clark and Lois Lane seemed off. There didn't seem to really be a connection. On the other side though, there are some things this movie does right. Michael Shannon made a great villain in General Zod. Hans Zimmer once again delivers a musical score that, even though at times delivers an unnecessary darker tone, connects the audience with the power that Superman has. Overall, if you're willing to bypass the obvious storytelling flaws just to see Superman do battle in epic action sequences, this is the movie for you. Everyone else, proceed at your own risk.",1
951,Man of Steel is the best Superman movie in my opinion. I was never that into him until I saw this movie. Cavill is the definitive Superman. My gripe with this movie is the over the top action and fight sequences that went on for too long.,1
953,"although its extreme action sequences are as far fetched as ever, Man of steel offers a different perspective upon the superman story and overall emotion and action are balanced out which make this film a possible masterpiece.",1
954,an amazing visual film with a modern take on the character a movie that works together with the DCEU movies especially Batman v Superman in terms of character development. a great new superman.,1
955,"Man of Steel is the best interpretation of the Superman character I have seen so far. Many critics don't know how hard it is to create a Superman movie without it becoming corny or downright boring aka Superman Returns. Conclusion, Zack Snyder, proceed!",1
956,"Man of Steel in some ways is an odd origin story for Superman but overall I still really enjoy watching this film. I like the casting choices and the heart the movie has. Many don't like the ending, but I personally appreciated the different take on Superman's character.",1
958,"One of my favorite super hero movies ever made.  After seeing this the first time I really like it.  Now after seeing it multiple times and as a few years have passed I absolutely love this movie.  There will always be parts that could have been done a little better, but over all this is the best superman adaption ever brought to the big screen.  The music is great, the thought put into the villain and their motivations is great, the thought put into superman feeling like an alien and coming to grips with this is great, and the action is amazing if a bit much at times in the end but what do you expect from Snyder.  Easily in my top 5 favorite super hero movies.",1
959,"Man of Steel is neither the best DC film nor the best movie that Zack Snyder has ever created. However, it is the Superman movie that we deserved. Although there are some pacing issues; the story is solid, the acting is great, the action sequences are awesome, and the musical score is just perfect.",1
961,"The presence of Christopher Nolan as producer and David S. Goyer gives a greater touch of maturity and dynamism, particularly for the action sequences that maybe exhausting. By some reason, no matter the efforts, the result has not all the charm of previous of 1978.",1
963,"This is good. I think it's user score reflects that this film is much more highly regarded than various internet douches would have you believe. I liked the structure, it mixed things up a bit but was entirely coherent. It looks gorgeous, of course. The performances are universally good. Zod is threatening but you can see why he does what he does. Clark and Superman are beautifully portrayed by Henry Cavill. I love the uncertainty he brings to early Superman. The Smallville action scene is genuinely awesome. On the downside, the climax is mis-judged, not because of the amount of death and destruction but it's just too long and the CGI grates. The scene on board the Kryptonion ship is a bit hokey. But I do believe this to be in the top three super-hero movies ever made.",1
964,Man of Steel takes Superman and makes him realistic. The movie has superman fighting like he never has before and truly shows a world where superheroes can live in. The movie is amazing in its character development and action scenes.,1
965,"Despues de superman 1, Man of Steel se convirtio en una de las mejores peliculas de superheroes seguido de Watchmen, The Dark Knight, y Spiderman 2, Zack Snyder logra darle un giro nuevo a Superman exitosamente demostrando como seria si un kriptoniano existiera en la vida real, acompañado con un hermosos soundtrack, increibles batallas y escenas memorables que logran convertirla en mi top de mejores peliculas de Superheroes.",1
966,"Zack Snyder's Man of Steel to me was absolutely what we deserve of the hero. If Superman was to exist in the real world, this is how I'd imagine it to be. The story, the visual, and the action choreography (was 1 of the best for a superhero movie). I remember when fans would complain that Superman was a boring character because not anyone can take him on, so the director had him take on General Zod & kneel before him. Henry Cavill is my favorite Superman to date.",1
967,"Man of steel is the new generation superman! The part that I liked the most is the music, the power of the shots and the power of the message. Darker than Marvel / Disney without a useless joke carries ambition. That is to say, Man of Steel must become the new flagship of DC Comics. It is unfortunate to see that this is not the case. When I see Captain Marvel, I'm disappointed that this Man of Steel did not take. Compared to other supermen one is led to see Crypton in the end of its history and with its history. What is disappointing is that the difference between earth and krypton is huge, but that the film only scratches the surface. After Clarck was a baby we showed krypton we have limited interest in not making us feel the 2nd version of ""Superman Teen"" and still we have it Durand 1 scene. This film is not perfect, but the action being well dosed allows us to have a good time.Man of steel est le superman nouveau génération ! La partit qui m’a le plus plu est la musique, la puissance des coups et la puissance du message. Plus sombre que Marvel/Disney sans blague inutile est porteur d'ambition. C'est-à-dire que Man of steel doit devenir le nouveau fleuron de DC Comics. Il est dommage de voir que ce n'est pas le cas. Quand je vois Captain Marvel, je suis déçu que ce Man of Steel n'ait pas pris. Comparé aux autres supermen on est amené à voir Crypton dans la fin de son histoire et avec son histoire. Ce qui est décevant c'est que la différence entre la terre et krypton est énorme, mais que le film ne fait qu'effleurer cette vérité. Aprés Clarck était bébé du coup nous montrer krypton on un intérêt limité à ne pas nous faire sentir la 2e version de ""Superman Ado"" et encore on l'a Durand 1 scène. Ce film n'est pas parfait, mais l'action étant bien dosée nous permet de passer un bon moment.",1
968,"This was the best of the Cavill Superman movies to me, mostly because Michael Shannon was so strong as Zod.  It wasn't too long and though overuse of cgi gives me a headache, enjoyable.  I liked Superman as kind of a momma's boy and the moral questions of loyalty were done well. It was interesting to see him more dangerous than Reeves, though Christopher Reeves had a tongue in cheek awareness that was Rolls Royce to Cavill's Honda. Amy Adams is underrated, her characters are as developed as possible, given a structure of storytelling nearly a century old.",1
969,Biraz geç kalınmış fakat Marvel'ın ardından sinemaya evrenini aktarmaya çalışan DC ilk olarak dünyayı yok etmek isteyen Superman'in düşmanları ile evrene başlamış ve Superman'e yer vermiştir. Hikayenin orta seviye olduğu filmde aksiyon yeterli düzeyde.,1
970,"I enjoyed the action and story of this movie. The only downfall was when the story was going slow, and lasted longer than it should. It deserves a watch.",1
971,"The main reason I watched and liked this movie so much is because of Faora-Ul and the other Kryptonians. Their alien-esque feel and look, together with the extremely nice action scenes make this movie one of the most underrated movies of all time.I hated the critics and the public so much for not allowing Superman movies to continue in this fashion.",1
972,A beautifully shot movie and one that does extreme justice to Superman. I'm happy that Zack Snyder took this seriously and didn't introduce DC as a Marvel Movie. This is a proper DC movie.,1
973,"With the imminent destruction of Krypton, their home planet, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife seek to preserve their race by sending their infant son to Earth. The child's spacecraft lands at the farm of Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) Kent, who name him Clark and raise him as their own son. Though his extraordinary abilities have led to the adult Clark (Henry Cavill) living on the fringe of society, he finds he must become a hero to save those he loves from a dire threat.",1
975,"For what it represents, by history, by music and effects,I think it is a film that is very little valued.Is a very good start to good saga. The act of amy adams did not have much argument to give, but the rest in the movie was very good.",1

977,"A beatiful origin story and a beautiful movie overall. Man of Steel is a story of heartbreak and rises to happiness. It is a twist on a story we have seen before. Sure there are things that I don't like personally like, but I will put that aside as this is a movie for everyone, an not just an individual. Overall this movie is a recommendation for families who just want to leave the real world for a moment and just have fun.",1
978,"Man of Steel is a well-intentioned film that doesn't always hit the mark, but when it does, it hits hard. There's some strong thematic work in here, and while those themes aren't always fully explored, it's still more interesting to watch than a lot of other superhero movies. It helps that Zack Snyder is a strong visual director. The film is stunning to look at and the action is some of the best ever in a film like this. That's not to say the movie isn't over-indulgent or misguided at times, because it is, but the things it gets right, in my mind, more than make up for the missteps.",1
979,"Yeah maybe they did lay on that saviour imagery a bit to thick, but this has got to be by far my favourite modern superhero film. Strong supporting cast of big named veteran Hollywood actors. A origins story that was actually interesting and not just a foundational prop for the next film. A conflicted superman I could get behind and care about. As much as I loved Superman 2 that Superman was a very clean cut two dimensional boring Superman. The actual villains made that film for sure.",1
980,"This movie is an extraordinary movie. I just love it. What a beautiful superman story. Fantastic acting, good graphics made this movie awesome.",1
981,"Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is, for me personally, the best Superman film yet. Henry Cavill was an amazing choice for Superman and I also liked Michael Shannon as General Zod. A lot of people complained that the film was dark in both tone and absence of a lot of color. I have two things to say about that. One, that's just Zack Snyder's style. Two, not all superhero films have to be rainbows and unicorns and always happy. In the end, this is a film that is very enjoyable and is great with some room for improvement. My rating would be 7.8/10",1
982,"Certainly a slow burner, but oddly satisfying and ultimately fulfilling its purpose. Man of Steel pulls the curtains on who Superman really is and his origin. It’s not without its contrived moments and occasional slogs but it made me learn a lot about the hugely renowned hero; the film truly explodes into life later on with some fantastic visuals and lovely action. Henry Cavill is the perfect actor to play as Superman, he fits into the role seamlessly and looks the part. The rest of the cast are not without compliments either, there is good character development everywhere and it makes it that much more wholesome and rewarding. Solid film in my books.",1
983,MAN OF STEEL is a more realistic take on the superhero genre. This is what would happen if there actually was a superman. The cinematography is really good and visually appealing. A really good movie by Zack Snyder.,1
984,"Man of Steel is pretty great in my opinion. To anyone complaining it's too dark, I just reject that notion. We've seen many serious superhero movies that were based on silly comic books (The Dark Knight, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Logan, etc.) and nobody complained about those. The ""too dark"" criticism is just a scapegoat excuse for not being able to properly criticize a movie.Henry Cavill's Superman is treated like an actual human being in the 2010's. Having powers isn't easy, and suddenly finding out that you're not even from this world is just emotionally brutal.The internal conflict is also fantastic. One father (Pa Kent) saying you need to be a good man and hide your powers from the world and another father (Jor-El) saying you need to be the savior of the human race. I love Man of Steel. Best Superman movie yet.",1
985,"(76/100)Great movie, too much destruction and immortal beings fighting in my opinion but still a fun movie.",1
986,"Unlike most accounts, excluding the WB television series SMALLVILLE, when we first meet Clark Kent in MAN OF STEEL, he is kind of lost, trying to find his place but feeling very out of place, which is something we've all felt at some point in our lives – immediately making Clark the most lifelike he’s ever been.The path that Clark is on here is a heavily emotional one, and more importantly about the consequences that arise from the choices that life forces you to make.Throughout his journey in MAN OF STEEL, Clark has to reconcile the teachings from his Kryptonian father, Jor-El, and Jonathan Kent, his father from Earth, if he is to become the man that, arguably, both fathers would want him to be, in their own ways, ultimately having to find acceptance and come to terms with who he is.This is not the colorful Superman tale of old that flies with the swelling orchestral music of John Williams, this is a more relatable figure who deals with very human issues of love, divided loyalties and family, even as he is anything but human himself.From the vital flashbacks that take the audience across Clark’s childhood, teen years, and post high-school years, to the very controversial yet powerful scene where Superman kills Zod, every moment within this film is a fragment of the puzzle that is Clark trying to understand himself.All these themes stand-out more powerfully than they did before – and the violence that is spread out throughout the film becomes the least exciting.Cinematographically, Snyder opts for a handheld feel throughout the film where the camera zooms in harshly during the action-packed moments – a journalist filming the action as it happens – and softer hand-held scenes during the more intimate moments – a family member filming for a home video.With that in mind, the film has some breathtaking visual moments.The film is quite CGI heavy, but what super-hero film isn’t nowadays? At least the CGI in MAN OF STEEL has purpose and doesn’t stand out like it does in a certain Wakandian film.Many, including myself, complained about the level of destruction and violence that occurred in the film but this is the consequence of war, and an allegory at Superman’s internal turmoil. Instead of uttering the phrase, “I’m being torn apart,” Snyder and co. decided to show and not tell.War is not oversaturated heroes flying around defeating bad guys without it taking a toll on them – war is ugly, it’s devastating, and damaging both externally and internally.During a scene that shows Clark fighting with his father Jonathan, Snyder yet again uses nature’s rage to parallel Clark’s, this time by the means of a tornado.Clark is ordered by his father to take his mother to safety, and when Martha realizes that she’d forgotten the family dog in the truck, it is Jonathan that decides to go save it, which he does, only to be injured and lose the ability to get himself back to safety.Clark, seeing this, moves forward to save his father using his abilities, only to have Jonathon raise his hand and subtly shake his head no, due to the countless witnesses around forcing Clark to stand by and watch his father perish.This heart wrenching moment haunts Clark and is the basis of his identity crisis having lost the only father he’d known up until this point, and no other connection to his birth parents.Never had we seen this amount of heaviness in a Superman film – and this is why MAN OF STEEL is as powerful as it is.It’s all in the choices that Clark makes – the decisions that later carry consequence.On the other side of the coin, General Zod, the film’s antagonist is one whose choice was taken from him at the time of his artificially designed pre-determined role to fill Krypton’s society.He was designed to fight for Krypton and as such knows nothing else and cannot chose anything else to fight for nor live for.Zod’s arc brings forth the theological aspects of the film.His initial feud with Clark’s father is due to Jor-El being very much an advocate of free choice, which made him a criminal and an enemy of the State on Krypton.Jor-El, an advocate of free will, sends his only son Kal-El in the hope that he will continue that philosophy and bring hope to the people of Earth.Hans Zimmer’s musical landscape for MAN OF STEEL is another crucial layer of this film.Zimmer brings forth the souls of the characters with the sounds of his melodies and the rage of Superman with the gusto of his percussions.Earth, one of the final tracks on the soundtrack, is a bittersweet theme for the trinity of Clark Kent: the son/man, the hero, the heart.Ultimately, this film is about the internal fight of a man who is trying to figure out who he is, where he belongs, and what his purpose on this planet called Earth is, and the brilliance of it is that the film ends with Clark only taking one step towards figuring it out.It's the Superman chapter we needed.",1
987,"E-Value: 7Acting: 8Plot: 7Seven years have passed since DC Comics’ famous and iconic superhero, Superman, was last seen on the big screen with the release of 2006’s Superman Returns starring Brandon Routh. After a long hiatus, he has finally return to the big screen with a reboot and unconnected to the previous Superman movies. This movie features the origin story of Superman and is the first instalment in the shared movie universe unofficially known as DC Extended Universe.In the final hours of Krypton before its destruction due to destabilisation from the mining of the planet core, chief advisor to Krypton’s supreme council, Jor-El, steals the genetics codex and infuses them into the DNA of Jor-El’s new-born son, Kal-El. While this is happening, General Zod (Shannon) and his loyalist attempts a coup against the supreme council and killed Jor-El to retrieve the stolen codex. Despite Zod’s rebellion was stop and sentence to the imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, Krypton explodes after that.Years after arrived on Earth, Kal-El is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, whom they named him Clark Kent (Cavill). Clark has faced difficulties in his childhood due to his special abilities. During his adulthood, he goes on a journey for years and found an ancient Kryptonian scout ship where he finally learnt everything he needs to know from the hologram of his late biological father. Daily Planet journalist, Lois Lane (Adams), who has been investigating the ancient scout ship for some stories, is saved by Clark after she accidently triggers the ship’s security system.After that, he dons a Kryptonian suit with the symbol of his birth family. Finally embracing his alien heritage, he becomes humanity’s hope and inspiration. Meanwhile, General Zod, who have been freed from the Phantom Zone after the destruction of Krypton many years ago, have finally discovers Clark’s location due to the reactivation of the same ancient scout ship.In comparison between the late Christopher Reeves and Henry Cavill, both of them are great and there is no clear winner. Reeves’ version is more light-hearted and campy which is suited in the old days while Cavill’s version is more serious-orientated and realistic which more suited for the modern day era. Even Michael Shannon’s take on General Zod is totally amazing and definitely one of the best comic book villain in the big screen.The music in this movie is totally awesome especially during the fight scenes between Superman and the villains. The combination between the music and the fights scenes creates a huge hype up and very exciting. Two thumbs up to Hans Zimmer, whose music has never ceased to impress me. As for the plot, it was good start up for an origins story.On the downside, Superman got too much character development at the cost of supporting characters in the movie getting less character development which makes it less interesting for them to be care about. The movie also lacked some sense of humours and comedy relief moments. Nevertheless, the movie is still fun to watch. I am looking forward towards the next instalment.",1
988,"I got to admit, i've never liked Superman as a character. But, BUT when i saw this movie in cinema, my opinion had totally changed. Henry Cavill nailed it as Clark. Movie has a solid story and awesome OST.",1
991,"Man of Steel was a lot better than I thought it would be, but it still failed to be as good as some stories from MARVEL. The plot was good, if not a little slow at times. The special effects/CGI were amazing in the action and the fight scenes, but everywhere else they looked like the filmmakers could have done a better job. Bottom line: Great movie, but it could have been better.",1
992,Man of Steel while very dark for Superman is very entertaining and has a solid villain. Overall Man of Steel packs a solid punch.,1
995,"don't know if there's ever been a film about Superman's history, his planet and his family.That's what I liked most about this movie.it just bothered some times I had so much war scene I didn't expect to have so much action,could have been less than his was good.Superman is very well chosen I like a superman,at the same time as the body of this man Superman liked you say.",1
997,"This reboot has beautiful visuals and an abundance of intense action sequences, and proves that Henry Cavill was a great casting choice as Superman.",1
998,"First DCEU movie wasn't disappointing at all, as some people say. For me, this movie has everything anyone wants in any movie.The action sequences mixed with a great CGI, with one of the greatest soundtracks of all the time, and for sure, a great reason for everything, and that creates a spectacular story! With a great performances! Well, that what I meant to say by saying ""this movie has everything anyone wants in any movie"".I guess I said all I want to say..",1
1000,"This movie was amazing ! The soundtrack, CGI and the casting was nearly perfect !",1
1001,"SIN DUDAS LA MEJOR PELÍCULA DE SUPERMAN, EXCELENTE BANDA SONORA, EXCELENTES ARMADURAS, EXCELENTES EFECTOS. ME PARECIÓ UNA PELÍCULA PERFECTA DEL HOMBRE DE ACERO",1
1002,"Great origin of superman, Amazing cast and great story ",1
1004,This is a perfect and the best Superman movie till date. Zack Snyder is a genius.,1
1005,"Unwatchable basically. Pretty much every scene is off and cringeworthy. The CGI is pitiful, and Superman screaming all the time really makes you want him to die. The fight scenes are ridiculous because the CGI generated characters have no gravity, which is something that has been added to computer games even in the 80s, that is how long they know that this makes CGI at least somewhat believable.",0
1006,"Man of Steel brings depth and nuance to the titular character with many rich and relatable themes while giving so much more detail to his origin story which contains grand visuals of groundbreaking action sequences that show struggle between superman and his earthly acquaintances, specifically Lois Lane who shares some sweet moments with the man of steel. This film also crafts a much more fleshed out relationship between Clark Kent and his parents. To be extra, Russell Crowe was pretty cool as Jor-El and the musical score/soundtrack was lit.",1
1007,"Although the film was generally fine, there were some pointless scenes until the last scene, balanced progress and well-balanced characters and good stage transitions offer good viewing pleasure.",1
1008,"It is a great movie. Probably one of the best super hero released. Henry Cavil and Amy Adams did a great job, Zack Snyder too.",1
