0,"If I had to describe 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman' with one word only, it would be ""divisive."" SUICIDE SQUAD falls into the same category. Even though I liked both MoS and BvS, one could say that those 2 films tried too hard to please critics. The admirable thing about SUICIDE SQUAD is that it disregards the critics altogether, and makes it an entirely fan experience, for better or worse depending on who you ask. The audience I saw it with was electrifying; it's, without a doubt, the most fun I've had all year since 'Deadpool' back in February. In my humble opinion, SUICIDE SQUAD is exactly what this lackluster summer movie season needed to spice things up. Director David Ayer has his mark all over this; it's unlike any superhero movie I've ever seen. Sure, you have some of your typical superhero tropes, mostly in the 3rd act. But then you have the antithesis of what the genre entails, breaking just about every single rule and convention. This ain't good versus bad; this, my friends, is bad versus evil. This movie is the living personification of its own characters: absolute, bat **** insanity! It's uneven, character motivations get a little wonky, and the story is a hot, sexy, mess. Word of advice? Double down on the comicbookiness of it all; it gets pretty weird. But within all the madness, I couldn't help myself guys... I kind of loved this movie. It's by no means perfect, but I also feel like critics are over exaggerating the film's faults. I was never bored, not once. The film moves at a killer pace. There's quite a bit of exposition near the beginning, but after that the film kicks into high gear. Steven Prince's score, which was reminiscent of 'Pacific Rim' and the first 'Iron Man,' infused such infectious energy into the movie. The use of hit song after hit song got a bit overwhelming however, making the movie feel more like a music video at times. Filmed mostly in my home of Toronto, this was quite the surreal experience; I have walked through those streets before, and I have stood in those subway stations before. I was even an extra in the film. Did I make the cut? Well, that's a whole other story... but I ain't mad. I was genuinely shocked by how incredible Will Smith was in the role of Deadshot. Going in, I thought he'd be adequate but not too memorable. I was wrong; he is the best thing this movie has going for it. Scratch that. He comes real close to taking that title, but it's Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn that this movie will be long remembered for. She nails it. Absolutely nails it. Robbie is to Harley Quinn what RDJ is to Tony Stark: perfection. Joel Kinnaman was another standout for me. While the writing for his character felt the most forced out of everyone, his actual performance sells it well and makes me feel for a character I could, otherwise, care less for. The film is juggling a lot of characters, and that's never an easy task. Characters such as Killer Croc, Katana, and Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney was great?!) aren't given much backstory at all, but they were all given at least one great character moment: just one scene to make you fall in love with them. But if there's one obscure character that'll emerge as a fan favorite, it's definitely El Diablo. He's given an impactful backstory, an emotional character arc, and some kickass action sequences. In fact, most of the action in the film was executed  well. But there wasn't that one moment, like the 'warehouse scene' we got in BvS, that made me go ""holy ****"". if you ask me, Jared Leto had the toughest job of them all; he had to follow Heath Ledger's timeless performance as The Joker, which is an impossible feat. So, the best thing Leto could've done is something completely different; he should make it his own. Which is exactly what he did. Whenever he's on screen you can't help but be captivated by him. He's not in the movie all that much, but just enough to wet our appetites for this whole new incarnation of 'The Clown Prince of Crime,' while still honoring the name of the film. This is a Suicide Squad movie after all, not a Joker movie. It's ironic that in a movie about bad guys the worst part turned out to be the villain itself. The 'evil' in bad versus evil, if you will. I would've preferred a different antagonist altogether as the one we got here was pretty forgettable. Without giving any spoilers, the whole 'brother' angle was by far the worst thing in this movie. That's all I will say. People comparing this movie to last year's catastrophe 'Fantastic Four' need to drop whatever it is they're smoking. SUICIDE SQUAD has something that film didn't: personality. It has soul. There's a great deal of heart. The characters are dynamic. The team chemistry between all the actors was fantastic; even if you don't like the movie they're in, you'll still end up liking the Suicide Squad themselves.",1
1,"I feel like people are rating this highly just to try to get revenge on reviewers. Unfortunately for them, the reviewers are right. This is a very poor film. Thin, predictable plot, uninteresting villain, equally uninteresting characters the majority of whom barely get any kind of backstory beyond a few lines, implausible plot even for comic book movie standards. I don't care about the money I lost but I'd love to have the time I spent watching this garbage back.",0
2,"To get right to it, Suicide Squad is a blast! I had an incredibly fun time watching this film. That's not to say it was perfect. Far from it. There were moments that made me cringe. But the sheer entertainment that this film delivers is well worth seeing. Suicide Squad is not a complicated film. The story is very straight forward - it's not going to shock or surprise you at all. And the villain's portrayal and motivations are the weakest part of the film, unfortunately. However, as with most comic book movies, the focus is really on the ""heroes"". And the Squad delivers! Watching them interact was a delight. All of them have their moments to shine, though Deadshot and Harley grab the most screen time. And their performances were excellent. The Joker was a great addition to the film. I thought Jared Leto and David Ayer did an amazing job coming up with a fresh way to bring this character to the screen. My only real complaint with him is that he didn't have a big enough presence to really shine. If he ever gets the chance to take center stage and play the main villain in a DC movie, I think he would be perfectly horrifying. The film can be a bit skittish in places. It moves quickly through some sequences, and feels a little unfocused, but I believe this is intentional. I think the film is supposed to capture the unbalanced quality of its characters. Overall, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It was so funny, and such a thrill to watch. But go expecting some things to be a little too ridiculous.",1
3,"I'm not long ago went to the film ""Suicide Squad"". This film is really fun and interesting plot. I would gladly went at it again. In my opinion this film is for people not even be familiar with a lot of Marvel and DC universe. Company DC to try very hard on this film. Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Will Smith and all the other actors are fully accustomed to the role of his character. All the characters are very emotional. Also very cool movie soundtrack.",1
4,"This movie has a great idea and a decent plot that goes with it. As a normal comic book fan i've always perceived villains to be not so bad and liked to root for them from time to time, this movie takes that idea and goes all in, I didn't like the fact that as the movie goes on they just become plain heroes and not villains they actually are. Now for the actual movie it's enjoyable, there's not much to say, I don't care about the tiny details that they've might've got wrong because I simply didn't notice them, I enjoyed this movie as I thought I would, I don't know is it because I came in there with high expectations but I got what I wanted from this movie. Margot Robbie was fantastic as I expected, Will Smith was hilarious and kept the movie funny, The Joker was obviously **** I mean he just doesn't look like the Joker or act like the Joker we know, but he wasn't as bad, simply because it's another take on the Joker. Cara Delevingne should've definitely been a more valuable character looking at that she's one of my favorite actresses and she's hot as **** In fact most of the other villains were pretty much here and there for the entirety of the movie, but it's really nothing less then I expected.",1
6,Story plot is full of holes and some part of the movie felt too long. Good enjoyable movie overall. Margot Robbie and Will Smith make this movie really worth watching.,1
7,"Another lesson for Warner Bros. When you hire some of the best talents in the business, stick to their instincts and don't second guess them.  What you have here is something that could have been one of the better superhero flick in recent memory, but bludgeoned to death by WB's intervention.  The soundtrack? One of the best. The performances? Exemplary. Kudos to Robbie, Leto and Smith for giving their best A game.  However, the higher ups got a bit jittery: it's too dark...it's not like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  They  a second cut without the director's intervention, and both parties compromise.  The end result...starts of great, then jumped all over the place, with weird pacing and tonal inconsistencies.  Nevertheless, you can see that the creative team gave it their best...and despite all the rubble, Suicide Squad squeaks through...",1
9,"Wow, that was bad. I mean I didn't expect something extraordinary but at least on par with stupid, but charismatic and fun Guardian of the Galaxy. Yet they somehow wasted all potential and create some mess.1. Characters supposed to be bad, ugly and interesting. But ones that actually somehow interesting are Deadshot, Harley and El Diablo. Others just kinda there, doing stuff. Japanese girl, Slipknot (haha, at least he had a story-wise purpose), marines, Croc, Boomerang (wtf? boomerang? seriously?) and even Joker could be easily removed from the movie.2. Bad guys are just... there. As you could imagine they bad, they ugly (and a bit sexy), they try to destroy world (for some reason) and produce zombie-like minions. Yep, that again. They even didn't forgot to add giant portal in the sky.3. Plot is clunky inconsistent and plain stupid. Most interesting part is actually introduction of the characters in first part of the movie, down from there it's just mess. I tried to enjoy this movie, I really did. But it's just not good, it's not fun, it's not smart, not ironic - it's average at best.",0
10,"Day 1 and the DC fans are out in full force creating multiple accounts to spam 10s for a movie they probably haven't seen. Click on 95% of a '10' score and notice how the account only has ONE movie reviewed. You think they would at least remember their log ins to they can reuse them for BvS, Wonder Woman and all the future DC movies but I guess when your creating temp accounts all day that's too much work. Not even a week in and this movie has twice as many positive reviews than a movie like Furious 7, that was received well A YEAR AGO.  Keep struggling to get those user scores up, boys.Aside from the poor pacing, bad editing, so-so acting and spotty story telling, let me give you some reasons why this movie has glaring issues that fans don't want to admit to.This movie is a perfect example of writing the story to fit the scenes that are needed, besides writing the scenes that are needed for the story.  Here's just a couple examples?We need to have Batman in this movie and show that Deadshot is a family man:  Batman attacks Deadshot and his daughter in an ally and then says he doesn't want to ""do this"" in front of his daughter.  Deadshot pulls a gun and aims it AT HIS DAUGHTER and Batman stands there with a little girl between him and a bullet.  A failure on all levels.We need to show the pyro gang-banger is a changed man:  Have him stand in the middle of a fight and do nothing to show he's a pacifist.  Luckily no creatures attack him so he doesn't have to fight back.  Then the very next fight have some one provoke him into fighting.  Mission accomplished.. I guess.We need to remind everyone that Katana is a good guy:  So she talks to her sword so Rick Flag can explain that the dead soul of her husband is in that sword.  Great.We need to show The Joker is ruthless and unstable.  How about a club seen with Common not really hitting on Harley, but the Joker goes berzerk in an entire scene that makes no sense what-so-ever.  And why are the Joker and his thugs all gang-bangers?We need to show that Amanda Waller is a back stabber and can't be trusted:  How about we have her kill her entire team of technicians for absolutely no reason. ""They didn't have the clearance for this""  For what? Their jobs?  Huh?My favorite:  We need to have a end credit scene with Batman leading into Justice League:  Have Bruce Wayne approach the coldest most ruthless woman in the world and ask for a list of meta humans.  She figures out he's Batman, of course.  Smooth move ""Greatest Detective.""  Why didn't he just steal the information and remain anonymous?  Better yet, didn't he get this information already from Wonder Woman in BvS?Many character got 2 introductions and a special flashback just to bring on the 'feels"" but it all felt jarring and took us out of the action.  I didn't know a movie could have ADD.Due to all the exposition and origin stories needed the movie felt crowded and rushed.  That's the downside of rushing into the team up movies in a shared universe with all new characters.  They had 7+ characters to explain. Did they all need origins? Too bad there weren't previous movies to do that ahead of time. They tried something different than Marvel's slow and steady method and it's starting to show cracks in the DCEU foundation.And the biggest one: Why is a Suicide Squad even needed.  This is a world were we see the Flash and Batman exist IN THE SAME MOVIE! The world is being destroyed and these heroes do nothing about it?  And why would a handful of untrustworthy thugs with knives, boomerangs, bats and claws be better than some highly trained and well-armed soldiers?  They even had some soldiers in the Squad to keep them in check so why bother bringing the bad guys?  Because that story need to happen.Why was the Squad being formed in the first place?  What was the mission?  By the time they are being selected, Enchantress goes rogue and they are used to stop her.  So why were they formed in the first place?  To fight a possible ""bad"" superman-like meta human?  What are a bunch of non-meta humans with guns, boomerangs and bats going to do against a real meta human?  The only Squaddies worth their weight were Deadshot and Diablo.  Why don't you ask any of the good guys in that list you gave Bruce Wayne, Amanda Waller?  Because this story needed to happen.Now let's talk about the worst Joker we've ever seen on screen.  This is a buff Joker with tats all over, ""Damaged"" written across his forehead and a metal grill in his mouth!  Really!?!  The Joker can't even speak or laugh menacingly due to all the metal in his mouth. DC fans are content with this?  It's like they have been starving so long for a DC cinematic universe they will devour anything that's put in front of them.  The opening weekend will be record breaking... the movies will break even... and WB will learn nothing from their mistakes.",0
11,"Over-hyped, Hollywood needs to stop being so lazy in badly ripping off bad comics. It probably doesn't matter how badly this movie does in the box office, they'll all make money in the end and just produce some more terrible comic books.",0
12,Terrible! Don't watch it! Waste your money on building a fence around your house to lock movies like this one out. I don't even know where to start... a Joker that cares about money... cars and expensive rings? WTF...? Seriously?? Did the director even bother to read one comic?,0
13,Really enjoyed this movie especially all the cast like Will Smith and Margot Robbie were best performance in whole movie there were some scenes are messy u didn't mind it all,1
15,"I've seen a lot of movies. I have seen a lot of good movies. I've seen a lot of bad movies. Suicide Squad is a bad movie. However, it is bad in a unique way. This is the first movie I've ever watched that made me feel genuine embarrassment. I wasn't even out in public. I was watching this at home, and this movie made me feel embarrassed for ever liking DC Comics.Where to begin? The pacing is atrocious. The film doesn't know how to start. The final cut feels like a dozen trailers edited together. The editing itself is awful. The soundtrack is insulting. The script is predictable. The dialogue is hollow. The visual effects feel dated. The action feels dull. The lighting is bland. The cinematography is uninspired. The character's motivations are whatever is convenient to the plot. The actors performances are truly awful. The film also cannot decide on what tone it wants to have.On top of this, the movie is mind-numbingly boring. I was watching this at home with some friends, and they fell asleep! We weren't even watching it late at all! Ugh. This might be the worst DC movie. I think the only people that like this movie are people that like to pleasure themselves to Harley Quinn. I know that statement is probably going to get this review a lot of downvotes from the Metacritic trolls, but I don't care. Bring it on!",0
16,"I really wanted to like this movie, the misleading trailer was brilliant and Margot Robbie and Jared Leto looked amazing. But let me warn you now the trailer is a lie! This movie was not enjoyable and seemed to lack any coherent scenes instead blending into one hour and half long scene. Also plot holes, how did Viola Davis get away with killing those soldiers and she seemed to randomly materialise at the end of this movie. This has been talked about a lot but where was the Joker, he was in the movie for about five minutes. I suppose the soundtrack was fun though.",0
17,"An irritating mess of a movie, with a plot that makes no sense, dull and pointless characters, and countless things that made me cringe more than anything else.",0
18,"Where to begin with this mess. The only decent thing about this movie is Will Smith cause he acted perfectly but everything else is an abomination! The story is rushed, the movie on focuses on Harley Quinn and Deadshot, the movie is dark, the story also made no sense, Slipknot and Katana are useless, the acting is stupid, the Harley Quinn moments have more cringe then the word cringe itself, The Joker is barely in the movie, and the action moments are bad, and most of all the movie is pointless. Why is it pointless? Why can't they just get the heroes to defeat Echantress? Are the heroes on vacation and the villains are the only ones left? Overall this movie by far is the worst movie I've ever seen...okay maybe Foodfight is the worst but Suicide Squad makes me want to commit suicide.",0
19,"I loved the comic, and this movie ended up being a huge disappointment. Maybe I had too high expectations? I barely forced myself to watch it for half an hour. Harley had... No personality. Joker was a gangster which is just... So not joker. Deadshot was good as far as I had seen. The plot was more shallow than that of an average chick flick. The movie seemed like an half-assed fanfiction an edgy tween wrote loosely based on the comic. I just don't get why they had to basically ignore the comic it was based on?",0
23,"Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!! Just terrible!""!!",0
27,"Hugely disappointing, especially coming after the magnificent BvS, but looks like that (and MoS) were the exceptions and DC is now going to start cranking out superhero movies as mediocre as Marvel's.First problem: tries to establish way too many characters, with the result that we wind up not caring about any of them. This has been plaguing the X-men and Avengers movies too (who actually cares about Bucky?), and apparently DC has learned nothing from it. One hero we actually like with a real dramatic arc is way better than 6 we don't care about.Second problem: Unbelievably bad villains. Magic Tentacle Dude and Shadow Woman are some of the least compelling villains since Loki's army of faceless aliens on hoverbikes. They're not threatening, they're not interesting, they're not even neat to look at. Relatedly, the Joker (who apparently was supposed to be the main antagonist in early versions of the story) is lackluster and given absolutely nothing to do in the plot. Turns out his whole point was just to be in the trailers and tease audiences into seats; we're not coming out to see Captain Boomerang after all.Third problem: the story's own internal logic doesn't work. This is supposed to be a team of people who could fight ""another Superman"", yet almost none of them have any real powers, and half of them have already got their butts kicked by Batman? It's not a nitpick, this is a serious story problem, since it undermines the whole premise of the movie for every second of screen time and makes a lot of the characters' actions incoherent.Fourth problem: Too much Will Smiff.Fifth problem: The PG-13 rating. If you want to make a funny, edgy movie about badass anti-heroes, you need to go full R, period. Deadpool took that chance and it paid off beautifully (that was really the movie this wanted to be).I'm bearish on the upcoming Wonder Woman and Justice League movies too; the former has the Grrlbusters problem of trying to turn a fun action movie into a nagging feminist lecture (""you're a secretary? Where I'm from we call that SLAVERY!""), and the latter is probably another overstuffed designed-by-committee fanservice-fest with no cinematic heart or soul (but this time with more Marvel-style snarky quips!). It looks like for the foreseeable future Nolan's Batman and Snyder's Superman movies are going to remain the high-water mark of this genre.",0
28,"I am not going to waste the time to talk about why this movie is the worst I have seen all year because it is clear that Warner Brothers did not take the time to ensure that this would be a quality movie. Instead, I am going to give you a list of recommendations based on what the marketing had people fooled into thinking Suicide Squad would be, but really wasn't. If in a comic book movie, you are looking for: -A good licensed soundtrack, watch Guardians of the Galaxy.-a fun team of characters, watch The Avengers (or Guardians).-good humor, watch Deadpool.-realism and emotional maturity, watch The Dark Knight-good characterization, watch Spider-Man 2. And last, but most certainly not least: -something cohesive, funny, tense, exciting, authentic, or even remotely entertaining, you'd have better luck with almost any other movie than Suicide Squad. It may not kill you, but it'll hurt you... really, really bad.",0
30,"All that studio interference is gonna get your film hurt, shame on you Warner Bros. This hurt me, really, really, bad. Thank heavens for Margot Robbie though, and for once Will Smith playing Will Smith really works. Davis also kicks ass. Otherwise, this is a hackjob; like Fant4stic, it shouldn't have been released in the version we got. And if this is truly David Ayer's preferred cut, what the hell was he thinking?",0
31,"Suicide squad really lives up to its name. Whomever produced this crap must have been suicidal. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The plot must have been written by a blind monkey, it jumps all over the place and I'm sure even the writes don't know wtf is going on. The only reason this movie didn't get a 0 is because of some solid acting performance from Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Do not waste you money on this crap.!",0
32,"I did not expect much when I went to see this movie but It was a lot more disappointing than I ever expected.I forgot I was watching a 3D movie lol, awful plot,awful CGI, awful dialogue.Joker is a cameo. Waste of money,pure marketing movie. I knew I would not like it but maaan the movie sucked so hard",0
33,"I had to walk out of the theater for this one. It was an incoherent mess that was slapped together with an Elmer's Glue stick. The narrative was completely ruined with a torrent of flashbacks, which felt more like inconclusive and poorly edited montages. I drew nothing from them, they were scattered all throughout the plot, and they inevitably confused and annoyed the s*** out of me. I got about an hour or so into the movie and realized the experience was going downhill. My friend had fallen asleep and my patience was wearing thin. I had to get out of there. I don't plan on seeing any other installments for this s*** franchise.",0
34,"I don't really know what good to say about this movie. The editing is bad, the plot makes no sense, most of the characters have little to no value at all. They could have just cut out the Joker, since he had nothing to do with anything. The humor felt forced and for the most part out of place. Harley Quinn is a good example here. Every time she opened her mouth, it had to be a ""funny"" one-liner, something that got old and cringey very quickly. Deadshot was ok I guess, even though it was just Will Smith playing Will Smith. The only character that I would consider interesting was El Diablo. There is a problem when you are making a movie about 8 different people that should be treated equally, and only two of them work. Not a good movie, but I guess you can enjoy it if you can overlook all of its problems. I sure couldn't.",0
35,"Good thing piratebay exist so you don't have to pay for this **** I was not able to finish it. After one hour, could not take it anymore. Harley is so annoying.",0
36,"The entire movie is a mess. The plot is as basic and predictable as it gets. Special effects look dated. Performances of Margot Robbie and Will Smith are good, but the characters are so poorly written that they all fall flat in the end. Music in general doesn't help nor hurt the overall experience. There are SEVERAL scenes with laughable screenwriting, the most clear one being the ""Harley Quinn cellphone"" situation.The movie is trash get over it people, most of the good reviews ignore completely the points i just mentioned and say ""i liked it because i liked it"". Avoid it at all costs, it's a waste of time.",0
37,"Frankly, it was awful. I like films, even bad ones (most of the time), because I enjoy the experience of going to the cinema with my friends. In this instance, I felt bad for my friends and for myself for having to endure it. Terrible dialogue, terrible editing, terrible villain, terrible CGI, tonally all over the place and the pacing makes my nan's heart seem stable. I'm trying really hard to find something to recommend it, but I don't. Sorry.",0
39,"Mauvais et médiocre. Très mal rythmé, les scènes s'enchaînent comme des clips. D'ailleurs c'est à se demander si ce n'est assumé... La présentation des personnages est lourde et fait office de catalogue de produits. A chaque perso, une nouvelle musique cool mais ça ne suffit pas pour faire un bon film.Passé la première partie de présentation et la mise en place de l'intrigue, le reste du film est long et monotone. On s'ennuie alors que ça dure environ 2heures, chapeau bas...Beaucoup de répétitions de scènes ad nauseam. Les combats sont sans plus. C'est relativement basique. Côté scénario, il est atrocement mauvais. Le méchant est nul et on nous rejoue le coup de la destruction/domination du monde. ça en devient lassant surtout pour une équipe de super-méchants.Et c'est là qu'on arrive à l'échec principal du film : Ce ne sont pas des supers méchants. Ils ont été repeints à coup de peinture emo/bien-pensance. [spoiler]    Ils ne tuent personne ""d'innocent"" ou gratuitemen    [/spoiler]    t de tout le film. Le plus massacré est ""Deadshot"" par un Will Smith générique et une trahison complète du caractère du personnage des comics. Les autres personnages sont insignifiants (Boomerang, Killer Croc (qui est tout petit et ne fait pas peur), Katana (qui est juste lol). Harley Quinn est pas mal par moments. Malheureusement sa relation avec le Joker n'échappe pas au coup de pinceau de team Bisounours. Le Joker est anecdotique, sans doute trop de scènes coupées.Il n'y a aucune tension dans ce film alors qu'on suit la ""Bisoun.. pardon Suicide Squad""...Cara Delevingne est catastrophique, le jeu zéro dans toute sa splendeur. Franchement qu'ils arrêtent avec les mannequins. A éviter à tout prix.A quand un bon film DC ?",0
40,"Since it's faster to tell you what's good about this movie than what's bad, here we go: Margot Robbie ! ...and the way she manages to give life to a character that suffers - like every character in this movie - from the god awful dialogues, the bad costumes, bad acting, the wannabe-try-hard-complete-fail-coolness, and the terrible plot. Of course this is far from saving the movie! 1. Dialogues: some of the worst c*** I've heard in a long while. uncool, meaningless, unfunny, far from gritty, farther from credible. example:HARLEY QUIN, looking at KILLER CROC: ""He's ugly on the outside, too.""KILLER CROC: ""Not me shorty (long dramatic pause) I'm beautiful.""HARLEY QUIN: ""Yeah, you are.""KILLER CROC growls Me thinking:...that supposed to be funny, cool, meaningful, gritty, mysterious....or is it just C**P! Movie is full of this. 2. Bad Costumes: either boring, not befitting of a modern version of the villain or just plain hilarious like the enchantress. 3. Bad acting: will smith is will smith. Delevingne portraits the enchantress like a cheap B-movie witch, Kinnaman desperately trying to sell us the tough guy. everyone else (except Margot Robbie) fails or doesn't get the chance to be anything meaningful. 4. Bad actor choice: Delevingne, Smith, Joel Kinnaman don't fit into their roles. especially Delevingne looks like a teenager although she is supposed to be an archaeologist. 5. action: wave of useless minions which don't pose a threat anyways - meaningless trash talk - wave of useless minions posing even less of a threat - meaningless trash talk - wave of minions - trash talk - uninspired, short and boring boss fight - more meaningless trash talk that no human with a brain could emotionally or intellectually relate to. If at least the action scenes would show something spectacular or creative or flabbergasting..but...nope. We get good old Steven Seagal B-movie fight scenes of the 90's. 6. plot: irrelevant 7. character development: no (unless u browse Wikipedia while watching) 8. the joker: One major reason for me to go see this flick was the joker. Unfortunately he almost never shows up and when he does, his appearances are so short that Jared Leto can't really shape his personal take on the new joker. That's why I want to be cautious in judging him and his performance. I can't say that I liked the new Joker as much as I did Jack Nicholson's or Heath Ledger's, but given the circumstances he did an OK job. Conclusion: definitely among the worst movies of the past ten years considering the amount of money and actor-potential involved.",0
45,"I am a fan of superhero movies. I watched it all!!! and all I can say is this is different. I Love it! They are criminal, Criminals are normally coward. weak. unorganized. but still human. And I saw it all. I was fully entertained and would pay to watch it again. I could not wait for another movie like this. I thank the creator of this movie. Nice job on picking margot robbie for then role. She nailed it.",1
46,"I can't believe I am going to say this, I thought Batman vs. Superman was better than Suicide Squad. What the heck is wrong with DC that they keep turning out crappy movie after crappy movie. The plot is beyond ridiculous. The Suicide Squad doesn't go up against world ending magical gods. They do the job that no one else can do because it is down and dirty. I for for **** sake their skills are are bunch of melee weapons, one guy who is strong and has alligator skin (but is only 6 feet tall . . .), a couple guys who can shoot, and one guy who can manipulate fire. It is just the wrong story line for them. They spent a ton of money on the film. It looks good. Except for Killer Croc. Instead of a monstrous man, he is a normal sized dude with scaly skin. Just terrible. The Joker didn't do it for me either. Crazy prison tats and just psychotic. Harley Quinn was hot, but that was it. They made too big a deal of her. Overall the script was baffling and a complete misfire.",0
47,"Oh boy! Ohhhh boy!!  Suicide Squad has to be one of the worst movies of the year. Suicide Squad is directed by David Ayer (who is usually good) and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman along with a host of other good actors. The problems with Suicide Squad starts with the plot. The original comic's had the villains carrying out political murders and other types of covert operations. They were NOT saving the world from a witch thing and her CGI brother. I guess it would have been okay if the villain was a well thought out character. Instead, we're ""treated"" to little character development and a clíche evil plan. Not to mention the villain looks like she's hula dancing 50% of the time. It takes the ending of ""Ghostbusters"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and countless other films by going with the whole ""beam into the sky"" thing. The film also feels the need to have an exposition dump at the beginning of the film in the sloppiest way possible. They should've just showed us files on each the character. Oh. Wait. That's what they did!! They literally opened files and gave us basic info on several of the characters. Only the important ones. The other members received nothing which didn't really matter because one of them got killed in five minutes anyway. However, Katana didn't die probably because she never did anything at all. No development besides knowing her husband's soul is inside her sword. The soundtrack isn't even that good. It's like listening to the Top 50 charts for three hours. Finally, we get to the acting. It's all decent. Viola Davis gives the only great performance as Amanda Waller (a pretty scary one as well). Will Smith and Margot Robbie are both good, but Smith is just charismatic. It's not like he's that great playing the actual character. Robbie doesn't steal the show as many people thought she would. I think it has to do with the fact that Joker is in the movie for about 15 minutes. That's right. We were teased for a year that he would be a big part of the film and he's hardly in it. From what I say, Leto is okay, but not great. The big problem is the portrayal of his and Harley Quinn's relationship. It could've have been a great dynamic, but they cut out the part of the relationship where Harley grovels for attention, and Joker abuses her. It would've have provided a much needed dynamic that we never got. Instead, the director pretty much asked you to sympathize with Joker when he lost his girlfriend to prison. In the end Suicide Squad is a huge mess. Bad writing, a poor plot and only decent acting make it another failure in the DCEU. It could've have been fresh, strange and fun, but instead it devolves into a clíche ridden disaster. I give it a 1/10. Save your money and go buy a DVD disc of The Dark Knight.",0
48,"A dishonest movie, directed, shot and finally edited as if it was a long trailer, showing off cool characters. It does not even try to provide a coherent story, to link the different scenes together or to explain the characters' choices. A mess nobody should watch.",0
49,"Stupid movie. The actors are terrible with the Enchantress being the worst. There is no chemistry. There is no charisma, hell, there is not much of a story.This version of the joker is the worst and that's including ALL the jokers, from comics to cartoons to movies, ever. He actually does a Phyllis Diller laugh (a female comedian from the 50's). If you don't believe me, check her out on YouTube.I think this is one of the most black-washed, violently racist movie I have seen in a while. The absolute worst, and the performance that made me lose all respect for him, came from Will Smith. I love the guy and have most of his films. When he took a gun and pointed it at a white cops head, in this time of real life death, where blacks are killing whites because of the color of their skins, for him to do this is unforgivable. He is a role model. Does he agree with the killing and violence? I guess so. Remember, this is a movie. That cop could have easily been black, but no. Instead you get the angry black man pointing a gun a a policeman's head. How anyone can be so stupid is confusing. How can anyone with a slogan that includes ""lives matter"" justify murdering? How can a race that complains of being treated bad because of the color of their skin treat others bad because of the color of their skin? I think the cumulative average IQ of the murderers and looters must be in the low 60's or so. How does looting stores and burning down businesses help their cause? This nation is crazy and the BLACKS HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAS ACCOMPLISHED SINCE 1960 with ""our"" president encouraging them. Wow, what a crazy time to live in.In all this is a stupid move that shouldn't have even been made and I truly feel sorry for anyone stupid enough to watch/enjoy it.",0
50,"The best part of this movie is the soundtrack.  Jared Leto's joker is a teenage tryhard disappointment (including the 'damaged' tattoo). Will smith is boring and not believable as his character. The jokes are forced and unfunny. Save your time and money, wait until it's free to watch this overhyped let-down.",0
51,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not one throw out low scores to films just to spite them because I didn't enjoy a movie. Suicide Squad really is a bad movie. I found it to be a hard 2 with little to redeem it. Do not watch this movie. It's the most dead on arrival pile of garbage I've seen since Jupiter Ascending. I was excited for this movie like everyone else. It looked like a blast! Once we got a Batman v. Superman that left me saying ""Meh"" I became a bit worried and even more so after the mixed reviews for Suicide Squad came rolling out. But I went to see it anyway secure in the idea that even if it wasn't good it would at least be a fun little ride and a fine way to spend a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon. Boy, was I wrong. I could go on and on about all the problems SS has but I'll save us both some time and just go over what it does well. 1. The acting was fine from the main cast. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller in particular stood out. Will Smith seems to be gaining some praise for his performance but I think people are confusing his Deadshot being a central character as him giving a good performance, because I thought he really phoned it in and it was completely lacking in the Smith charisma he's known for. 2. Enchantress looked cool, at least when she wasn't dancing an unexplained portal weapon into existence like a goof. 3. That's it. Yep. Solid acting with a few exceptions and a cool *looking* villain. So what's bad about SS? Literally everything else. Story was flat. Dialogue was bad. Laughable at times and not laughable when it was supposed to be (""I'm beautiful!"" says Killer Croc ""Grooaaan. Why are you even in this movie?!"" says me). Pacing and editing all over the place. Simply riddled with plot holes. It's just bad and worse than that, it isn't even fun. Thirty minutes in I was bored. An hour into it I was debating on leaving, and by the time the credits rolled I was so happy it was over. Not only to end the boredom but also so I could ""Boo"" it. I've been going to the theater for 25 years and this is the first movie I've ever actually booed. Save yourself ten bucks. Watch the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" trailer again. There, you just saw a better version of Suicide Squad than the actual movie. Ugh.",0
52,"I like superhero movies and actions flicks but this is a terrible and stupid movie. I was bored watching this at the cinema, it's a total let down. There were moments I cringed and then laughed at the cheesy stupidity of what I was watching. The trailers are better than the movie. Massive fail.",0
53,"Great great movie. Good surprises and keeps with the Joker being nearly immortal. 9/10 because there's a strange hole where Batman and all the rest of the DC world's superheroes are nowhere to be seen??? Awesome soundtrack. Joker was well well done. Harley also excellent.",1
54,"Suicide squad is a good superhero movie. I was totally afraid of what the critics are saying and was very afraid when entered the hall but only after 1 hour, was like Critics are mad. From today onward i am not going to believe any critics until and unless i watch the movie first. I will only mention what can be done better for the movie. * Movie should have more introduction of Enchantress and her brother of what exactly are they. * We are hearing that a lot of Joker part was cut, which they should not have. Jared Leto as Joker is great. Awesome. * El Diablo :- How he turned into that giant monster when he was facing the Enchantress brother. Everyone  already knew that the Batman will be present in the movie, when they stated that movie will be made. And they nailed it. This aspect of batman is the one which we missed in the BvS. The smooth transition from Suicide Squad to Justice League is also nice. LOOKING FORWARD TO WONDER WOMAN & JUSTICE LEAGUE.",1
56,"This movie is not a good movie or a well made movie it is a bad movie. I can see how dc fans can find enjoyment watching their favorite heroes on the big screen but when they say this is a good well made movie they are wrong. The movie suffers from countless writing flaws and studio interference's. there is too much **** in this movie to even try to explain it all in under 5000 words so I will tell it too you straight the critics got it right. This movie is terrible it is not well made it is terribly written and terribly edited. The only things I enjoyed in this whole film was will smith but even then I was just watching Will Smith play Will Smith. The only part of the movie where I thought that was cool was when deadshot was on the car shooting the waves of enemies. The villain is trying to learn to dance. She wants to do something evil ... kill us bases I have no clue. They have to use a flashback text images and a voice over just to explain who a character is. At the end of the movie nothing changed. The only character or story that changed or grew at all was the one who died. The joker did not even need to be in the movie save me the torture. Nothing was funny in the movie there was one person who laughed in my cinema. The music felt forced and stupid. It made me cringe who hard dc was trying to make this gotg. The ending fight scene is worse than fan4stick. The editing looks like it was done but a 5 year old. That does not even cover everything that was bad in this movie. I was going to give this a 4/10 but after thinking about it does not even deserve that. I had my expectations lowered so much I did not expect this movie to be worse than my expectations. If you enjoyed this movie good for you but you can not tell me that this movie was a well made movie you are plain and simply wrong.",0
58,"Suicide Squad gives a great premise but it delivers with lousy plot. It had a good start but lose its grip as the movie flows. The villains are dense and didn't give depth to the story. Slow-paced that you lose grip at what they are trying to tell you. Some one-liners are good enough to give you a chuckle (mostly from Harley) but most are forced and out of place. Fight scenes tries to be good that they look ridiculous. However, Margot Robbie gives a great Harley Quinn. Will Smith gives a good Deadshot.",0
61,"This movie is a blast! It's far from Citizen Kane, but that's not what a comic movie is supposed to be. It doesn't take itself too seriously and while there are a few pacing issues that crop up, the storyline is simple and was easy enough for me to follow. The acting is fine, and there are some great lines. It's worth it to see on the big screen for the action scenes (of which there are many). Ignore the critics on this one.",1
62,"a non spoiler review of  suicide squad.........as a comic book lover i love this movie....the characters where well executed ...will Smith was Will Smith, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was amazing , jay Hernandez el diblo blew me away and Jared leto,s joker was  scary didn't get much screen time but it wasn't hz movie..... and i got goosebumbs in every batman scene....... if u want to have a fun weekend i recommend dz movie.....",1
63,"This is my first Metacritic Review, But I have Used the site for years. Suicide Squad was absolutely worth the ticket price.  The ""Critic"" reviews of this movie are criminal.  If you're a fan of ANY of these characters, or just getting started in the DCEU, give this one a try.   Some of the ""Jokes"" didn't land perfectly for me, however, just like in real life, people often say what they would think is funny, and everyone will just look at them in awe of them saying something so predictable.  I would expect a Suicide Squad movie to either be as good as this one, or better.  The Writer/Director did a great job, and the Box Office/User reviews will confirm that.  I hope they offer him a second installment.  Lastly, if you Enjoyed Suicide Squad, check out ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" DC Animated Feature.   Its a ""Suicide Squad Movie"" but animated, and actually has more blood than the live action one.",1
64,one of the best movies I've ever seen it's soooo great I love it the joker's character was awesome the suicide squad album is so cool loved it. It's awesome,1
65,"This is a very good and fun film.  Great casting for Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Amanda Waller.  Would have liked to see more Joker, but I understand this wasn't a Joker film.  The only drawback is the lack of a motive for the main villain.  Suicide Squad proves once again that the DCEU is critic proof! 8/10 Highly recommend to all DC comic fans.",1
66,"Good action movie. The characters are interesting and well played, the visuals are spectacular, the directing is also great. The only minus would be the plot, which is a little messy at times, but still decent. The critics/haters are overwhelming apparently, otherwise I wouldn't see why you would score this movie under 6, even solely for the visuals and acting if not for anything else...",1
67,"Seriously what movie where the critics watching. I was expecting the worst after seeing those reviews, but when I walked out the cinema I was thoroughly entertained.True enough, it's not a perfect movie. The criticism towards the tonal shifts, using too many pop songs, weak story and villain are certainly valid but overall the movie is definitly entertaining. But overall the movie worked.Jared Leto's Joker works, Margot Robbie's Harley Quin works, even Will Smith - who I was worried about the most - actually turns in a pretty good Deathshot performance, not to.mention VIola Davis' Waller.My only real complaints are that the task force X members turn out to be a bit too sympathetic in the end, at least for the psycho- and sociopathic supervillains they're supposed to be. And an R-rating probably could've worked better, seeing some of the cuts made.This movie is way better than BvS which was a great disappointment to me (though not as terrible as the critics lead you to believe) and most MCU movies(people seem to forget half of those movies are decent at best..*cough*..*Thor the Darkworld*..*cough*). Definitely worth the admission price of a movie ticket.",1
68,"This movie lives up to it's name, and commits seppuku in regard to plot, script, and immersion.  Making this a PG-13 was Warner & DC's second greatest mistake.  Tapping Ayer for both writing and directing seems to have been their first.  This is the same style of schizophrenic nonsense that plagued Superman: DoJ, where the movie cannot decide what it is supposed to be.  Even the music, characterization, and fight scenes are corrupted by the random thoughs that were slapped together, and tossed at the screen.  The most disappointing thing about this entire fiasco, is that we quickly see they converted the so-called criminals into misunderstood people, leaving us with no badguys/gals in the entire Suicide Squad.  By the end you will be wondering if Disney secretly took over Warner, and taught them the art of paint-by-numbers movies. Largest disappointment since the other DC movies (even Killing Joke is better than this) of 2016.",0
69,"To the point, great movie, plot and story flows as a comic does. Understood that the film focus was the ""Suicide Squad"" not the Bats or Mr. J (Affleck and Leto nailed both roles btw.) Knowing this going in eliminates cameo expectations. Timeline was perfect following BvsS. The cast were great for each of their roles, they captured the spirit and essence of their comic characters. Looking forward to a sequel. The only reason not a 10, there was awkward slow down pacing in some scenes which seemed like some editing was over-sighted. The color in scenes were focused to the characters just as a comic which I thought was captured masterfully. It kept focus on characters both verbal and non-verbal communication. Integrating these characters to ""live action"" was done perfectly I thought in just one film, that had to be hard to do. The dynamics between Harley and Joker were intense excitement leaving you wanting more. The rage and sarcasm in Capt Boomerang was solid and fun; the intimidation and power was found in Killer Croc; the heated internal passion was in Diablo, Enchantress was dark and powerful, Col Flagg had realistic heroic presence, Katana was energetic and passionate; Quinn was sexy, fun, sadistic; Deadshot was a deadly assassin with something to lose (you usually do not ever see that combo and it was flawlessly executed.) I appreciate that the film was made for fans not theatrical professors. I am intrigued to see how all the characters develop in upcoming sequels and thought the cast was perfect.   Will go see this movie again and purchase Blu-Ray upon release.",1
70,"After so much hype, so many hopes, and so many talks about the casting and storyline, Suicide Squad is here, and it is fantastic......in parts. First of all, let's discuss the story. A group of supervillains is promised time off their jail sentences if they succeed in a mission deemed to dangerous for soldiers to do. It is nothing special and expect a few plot twists in DC movie fashion. This movie is full of big names, and most of them shine, notably Will Smith, Viola Davis and Margot Robbie. Will Smith's Deadshot is a fully fleshed out character, and not just your average hitman. It becomes evident in the first half that this is Smith's film to take.....until you see Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). She is probably the only character done without flaw in this movie, equal parts crazy and equal parts sexy. Other than that, Viola Davis does an amazing job as Amanda Waller, Jay Hernandez as El Diablo was fine, but he got a good amount of screen time and backstory for me to say that he was very well fleshed out. Enchantress also has a bit of backup story, and Cara is fine in her role. Everybody else, including Slipknot, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc and Scott Eastwood's character, were basically left in the dust. I know you cannot cram in a lot of backstories in a single film, but a little something about them would help. They basically follow the Squad around and kill a few here and there, but even their wit and charm cannot save them from being overshadowed by the bigger names. Speaking of big names, let's talk about Jared Leto's Joker. And I have to say he does an amazing job, and I really enjoyed when he was on the screen......which is not that often. Leto has about 6 or 7 minutes of screen time and shows up mostly in flashbacks of Harley Quinn. A little disappointing for fans who want to see the movie exclusively for him. The film's tone changes gradually from a little happy here to deliciously evil, and that is what makes this a fresh change from usual comic book movies. David Ayer has a great vision, and he executes very well throughout. There are some beautiful scenes in the film, particularly Joker and Harley's ''Chemical Wedding"" which was shot extremely well and is one of my favorite sequences from the entire film. Then you have the humor, which was also a top notch element to the movie.  Really, this a comedy above all else, a fresher take from the usual DC films. This film is really fun to watch when sh*t hits the fan, the characters bond, there is a decent amount of dialogue between them, and they ultimately ACTUALLY become a legitimate ""Squad"". And that is why Suicide Squad excels in characters, not only they bond, but their weaknesses are why they are here. There is some choppy editing in parts and some scenes from the trailers never show up here. But, whatever was given to us, was a well acted, funny romp that takes advantage of the great characters in the DC Universe and never shies away from silliness. This is a GOOD movie, it may be flawed, and Joker may not shine here, but Suicide Squad is a silly, funny and jam-packed blockbuster. Do not miss it this weekend.",1
71,"The movie was a lot of fun. Good points Margot Robbie nailed Harley! El Diablo was very interesting to, I actually would like to see more done with him. Story was fun an even paced and I really did like the soundtrack but I am sucker for older rock. I am not going to gush over Will Smith because I see this same character in most of Will's movies. I see Will Smith not Deadshot. I am still not sure how i felt about the Joker though. Jared Leto didn't do a bad job I just think there were somethings that took me out of his character. One STOP USING THE STUPID SMILE TATTOO ON THE BACK OF THE HAND! I was disappointed in Katana you could have removed her and it would not had been a loss. The worst part of the movie to me was really the villains and even that did not bug me that much. All in all it was fun and not  a waste of money to me and it really does fit in to the build up of the Justice League. So a solid 8.",1
72,"Im going to be honest here, I really liked this movie, and do I hate critics for disagreeing, no because it is just an opinion. Lets start off with the characters, deadshot was pretty awesome, not just in action, but in character development. He was also really funny and probually one of the most relatable characters in the movie. Harly quinn was fantastic in this film. Not only does she have the feel and humour of the character from the comics, but she was had moments that really surprised me. The joker has serious potential for the little screen time he had if he's in the new batman solo film. Side characters are good, but some just don't get enough development. The story has it's flaws. Somtimes, it doesn't explain why the characters are here, and its plot is just a simple this person wants to take over the world plot, but at least they explained the plot in a pretty funny way. Speaking of funny this movies jokes are pretty funny, with it adding more fun to the dc cinematic universe. The action sequences are also entertaining to watch. And when it comes to character motivation, it's much better than batman vs superman. I feel as if why the characters are doing what there doing makes sense. Overall you may like it, you may not, but think you should definitely check it out to see what you think.",1
74,"SUICIDE SQUAD 2/1/2 STARS OUT OF 4 Suicide squad is a perplexing film. Be it from lack of direction, or some could say overabundance of direction from the studio. Some could say there is a good movie hidden under the layers of bad. What did work, was some character portrayals of characters. And that is where the movie shines the most, the whimsy and joy that Viola Davis, Margot Robbie and Will Smith bring to their respective characters of Amanda Waller, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, and to an extend Jared Leto (who really did not have much to do in the movie) as Joker, and surprisingly Jay Hernandez as Diablo. Rest of the cast really did not have enough time or material to be developed properly. Killer Croc is just there to be menacing and growl(even though has two fun quips), Captain Boomerang is Jai Courtney (enough said) there is also another guy in a group? You're going to have to take my word of it because I am still wondering why he's there.  Katana who is a somewhat obscure character is in the movie as well  and also just not given a lot to do. This all brings me to Enchantress who is not that well known character from the comics. Her character is very interesting, and they should have focused on her backstory a bit more for everything just to seem well connected. Rick Flagg is the a  leader of the rag-tag of villains and does fine job at it, however nothing in the script really allows him to have any meaningful breakout moments. Where the movie fumbles a lot is in its execution of the plot and especially editing of that plot, which partially makes sense if the stories of multiple editors working on the film. This all culminates in the tonal disparity between parts of the film. It almost does not let the movie breathe, as at a point in the movie plot just one would say changes entire direction, and from that point on it is as if you are watching a different movie. And that would not be so much a problem if that change was not as jarring as it is. Main plot of the movie sort of just happens and you as a viewer are just along for the ride, not  much is really explained, and fore mentioned characters of Harley, Deadshot, Diablo and Waller are what is keeping the movie from collapsing into itself completely. Parts that I really really loved about the movie, other than those four characters which I cannot stress how fantastically were portrayed by their respective actors are small things in the movie. Harley Quinn's backstory and flash backs with the joker (there is a scene that is going to smiles on lot of people's faces that have read the comics). Location of where the main battle is happening, which is a location well known throughout the DC universe. Cameos throughout the movie that are well placed and not too jarring. All in all movie is far from being perfect or even great, however it is entertaining and well worth watching if not so much for plot then for the character portrayals of some of DC's most interesting and beloved characters.",1
75,"You want to know what's seriously wrong with this film? The villains. This unfortunately makes Suicide Squad an extremely dorky film. Like, seriously stupid. Beyond stupid. But I still think it's quite entertaining, to be honest. There's not enough Joker, which is a shame. But Deadshot and Harley Quinn are great leading characters. And at least it's funny. I like that it doesn't take itself too seriously. So I'd say it's an OK film, I liked it but I can understand why a lot of people wouldn't.",1
76,"Suicide Squad was one of my most anticipated movies. of 2016 One of the main reason is because it looked so different and unique. After finally seeing it I will say I was  pleasantly surprised by how entertaining this movie is. The look of the film, the costumes and overall aesthetic won me over. The humor was great. I laughed a lot. And most of the action works pretty well.Will Smith, Margo Robbie, Viola Davis and Jay Hernandez are STANDOUTS. I loved their performances as Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller and El Diablo, respectively.The plot is not perfect. It has some weaknesses. and the villain is a bit uninspired. Which is unfortunate because his/her setup was thrilling.Overall, what makes this film fly in my opinion are 1. The character. A unique and colorful mix of offbeat characters who are played exceptionally well by the actors playing them.2. The humor. This movie is funny.  Funnier than I expected.3. The soundtrack. I loved the music.4. The overall design. I wanted to see more of this world.A definite recommend!",1
77,Great popcorn flick. Critics had me fooled. The movie is judged way too harsh. Clearly a casual flick meant to just be enjoyed. Which is what most people want when going to see these films.,1
78,"WHAT I LIKED: Alongside it's style and tone, the thing that this film does best is to establish a brand new set of brilliantly quirky characters in a way that makes it feel like you know and understand them allready. I suspect this is largely down to the meticulous character work of David Ayer (as well as some excellent performances from many of the stellar cast members) but what's so great about it is that you're genuinely engaged in the situations at play because of this.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The problem comes in the fact there just aren't enough 'situations' that play out at all. In fact, there's virtually no events or plot points to test these great characters, which in the end makes the movie feel somewhat thin at the centre.VERDICT: This is my favourite DCEU effort yet simply because the characters really engage you and give the film life. Once you're there though, there's precious few events to hold onto.",1
79,"Suicide Squad is a bad film, but damn is it a lot of fun. Not my thing, but I can see why one would enjoy it if they are into comic books. Me, however, I am not. As it stands, it leaves more than a bit to be desired. First though, the positives. Will Smith is very charismatic and knows how to play Will Smith. Margot Robbie is terrific as Harley Quinn. Acting-wise, she is hit-and-miss in the film. However, in terms of playing Harley Quinn, she was born to play the role. I loved June Moore. Cara Delevigne did well as her. She struggled as Enchantress, but I loved June Moore. I really liked Jared Leto as the Joker. I loved the gangster take on it, which certainly plays into David Ayer's sensibilities, but I enjoyed it. That said, I would have either gone full Joker or cut him entirely from the film. He was a bit like filler in my mind. Additionally, I thoroughly enjoyed the middle of the film. The film moves past the classic rock music and the character introductions to truly find its groove. Here, it is imperfect, but thoroughly fun and enjoyable. That is, until the end. Now the negatives. The film often plays as if David Ayer loved classic rock and had longed to make a music video for these songs. Unfortunately, he was misled into thinking this was a good time to do so. As a result, the songs are entirely distracting and take away from the film. They frequently pull you out of the movie and focused solely on the movie. The opening showcases this as they try to introduce the characters. The character development also sucked. Suicide Squad forgot there were more characters than Deadshot and Harley Quinn apparently because nobody else got any attention, especially Slipknot(?). If you were not aware of any of the characters beforehand (as was the case for me), you wee entirely SOL. The character interactions were also dreadful, particularly when Killer Croc is involved. The dialogue was poor for everyone from beginning to end, but his was a special kind of horrible. I physically cringed every time he opened his reptile mouth. The other characters' dialogue were also bad, but not as bad. Captain Boomerang was also entirely useless. He throws boomerangs twice, but both fail. His little unicorn was far more enjoyable than him. This said, I am glad that only Deadshot and Harley Quinn got any attention at all, because the rest were horrific actors. They did not need any more lines to deliver poorly. The ending also leaves a lot to be desired. Though I loved June Moore, I wish they had not used Enchantress because this ludicrous, off-the-wall, and thoroughly unenjoyable ending is sadly impossible to avoid. I do not know how else to end it, so I wish they did not choose her as the villain. That said, the special effects regarding her were solid, though they felt like they were straight out of the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies. Finally, the movie just felt oddly ordered. There was no flow between scenes. Instead, they smashed into one another (much like in Batman v. Superman) where they barely related to one another. It was almost as if Ayer came up with some cool ideas for scenes, but had no idea how they related to the plot or what order to put them in. So, he shot them and figured the editors could somehow work miracles with the nonsense he shot. Unfortunately, editors are not miracle workers. Thus, for this, I do not blame editing. Unlike Batman v. Superman in which there was a good film desperately trying to come out only to be killed by Zack Snyder, there is no good film underneath Suicide Squad. Instead, there is only disappointment and David Ayer failing spectacularly at telling any kind of worthwhile story with this set of characters. This is very unfortunate, considering I was really hoping that Suicide Squad would be really good. Even after the reviews, I hoped I would like it. Yet, here we are. Though it may be enjoyable, Suicide Squad is a bloody mess.",0

92,"In a world where audiences cannot get enough of superheroes, comics and geeking over the impossibly feverish fade of comic book hero’s adapted onto the big screen, DC Comics is trying to cash in on this highly lucrative cinematic craze by developing a feature length feature, and their competition to The Avengers with Suicide Squad. Yet, if we really look at the bigger picture of Suicide Squad, one can easily see some stark differences, for example; none of the characters are really superheroes but villains; none of the characters presented are really recognizable names, with the exception of The Joker (who isn’t even a member of the squad in the film) and Harley Quinn (who is destined to become a household character by the end of this film, with the help of Margot Robbie of course), and, if not most importantly, assembling a team together, including cast and crew, that couldn’t be more, disassembled.Quite frankly, Suicide Squad is a complete disaster and mess of a film. The writing of the film is so incoherent, it makes the objective of the team and the audience really question as to why they are doing it altogether. The direction of the film feels forced and almost lacking any artistic creativeness by David Ayer and more-so of a forced studio film shoved down the artistic team’s throat, and, the story is just convoluted, discombobulated and weak. Ayer, who was on my radar of becoming one of my fav directors, blending, almost effortlessly, the use of action with real-world comedy, thanks to the near-perfect End of Watch, **** the bed on this one.With such star power, including the uncompromising Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, and the once attached Tom Hardy, you would think Suicide Squad was a film with some massive potential to wreck box-office havoc at the end of a very disappointing 2016. Yet, the film itself is a very sad excuse for a summer blockbuster, insulting its audience with any sort of artistic and cinematic credit.While the narrative of the story has been told before, like seriously, almost exactly like the narrative in the first Avengers. Just to refresh, here is it;  A loved one of one of the team members (Thor’s brother’s Loki in the Avengers and Nick Flag’s (Joe Kinnaman) girlfriend June Moone, also know by her villain name Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) in this one, wreck havoc on a city, a team gathers to save the city (New York City in the Avengers, Gotham in this film). Coming out of the gates, the film does not have much street credit.Suicide Squad was easily one of the most anticipated and exciting movies of summer sixteen. The trailer, which features one of the best bands ever assembled singing one of the best musical arrangements ever created, was easily one hell of a ride to watch. Unfortunately, some of the best parts of the film were featured in the trailer, which took away and ruined the film overall, or, the music just brought the best in the footage. After all, its pretty hard not enjoying watching anything while listening to the angelic voice of Freddie Mercury.While the movie did feature the likes of Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the sadistic mastermind behind the formation of the Suicide Squad, in a compelling and completely engaging role as a devilish, heartless and soulless women, who takes her job WAY too seriously, the only real redemption the movie has is Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and I mention those named quite carefully. Notice how I didn’t say Deadshot and Harley Quinn, the characters these actors are playing. Smith, who is an excellent actor whom audiences love whole-heartedly, did not play an interpretation of the almost obscure comic book character. Smith, in turn, essentially just plays himself, in a film adaptation where he must kick ass, save the world and give the occasional motivational speech. Its hard not to like Will Smith in anything really (we will completely ignore After Earth), hence why much of the good criticism will come from him, but people will quickly forget that Will Smith is a likeable guy, but did he give a spot on, target approve depiction of a DC comic book baddie, heck no.With Margot Robbie, one of the hottest and most attractive Hollywood actresses working today, its hard not to like her in anything, especially when for the duration of the film, she is featured in very sexy short-shorts and ripped nylons, as well as while the camera takes the liberty of shooting her from behind most of the time. Geeks and fanboys, compose yourself!",0

The soundtrack to Suicide Squad was superb and matches the feel of the movie in general. Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Jay Hernandez all played their characters perfectly. I for one, actually like Jared Leto's Joker. It was something new and wasn't a complete letdown and carbon copy of Heath Ledger like Lex Luthor in Batman V Superman.",1

103,"It feels like another movie which had its potential thwarted by the publisher (Warner Bros.). Absolutely amazing performances, great soundtrack, good quality CGI and a terrible, terrible script. I don't know how much of it was butchered by WB, but some lines were so forced that I felt sorry for the actors. I feel like it would be much better if it was made as an R rated movie. It IS a really good movie for younger audience but I wish they went back to the Dark Knight format where the movie was not only a money maker but also an amazing piece of art. Great job to everyone who participated in making absolutely the most out of what WB allowed them to do. If you guys didn't do like you did and instead went for ""pretty good"" I think the current critic score (40) would be a proper note.",1
107,"Vamos lá? Como é essencial pra todo ser humano ter sua opinião própria não? Enfim, vi o mais novo título da DC que vem causando tumulto pela crítica (que caiu totalmente no meu conceito agora, a partir deste filme), o Suicide Squad (Esquadrão Suicida) e vamos lá. O filme não é ruim, mas uma vez eu uso meu argumento (não só meu pelo visto, que também é de um querido colega distante vulgo ""Creissonino""), vocês estão acostumados ao PADRÃO MARVEL DE FILMES (""HURR DURR, SEU FANBOY DA DC"", será mesmo? Apontar que há um padrão Marvel/Disney é ser fanboy da DC ou ser realista? Vai tirar mesmo o mérito dos outros filmes? Eu acho que não). O filme é bom, ele é divertido, as piadas rolam e acontecem da forma mais natural possível (dá até alegria de ver um tipo de humor que funciona, tô cansado do humor pastelão da Marvel), a ação é legal, alguns personagens se destacam muito bem, outros nem tanto (mas não por terem sido mal colocados, é justamente pra não ter que forçar um personagem que não cola, coisa que a Marvel adora empurrar), vi muitos falando que o enredo não é lá essas coisas, e pra que ser essas coisas? Gente, beleza que é o Esquadrão Suicida, e tem sim seus personagens com sua significância, mas pra que ter um enredo tão profundo pra uma equipe B da DC? (sim eu gosto deles, mas que eles são um esquadrão pequeno é mais do que fato). Um dos pontos mais altos do filme é a trilha sonora dele, as músicas funcionam bem e não deixam as cenas chatas e tediosas. A participação do Flash foi rápida porém muito importante pra gente saber que tipo de pegada o filme dele vai ter, e sim claro, a do Batman também (ele convive com os vilões na área dele, era mais que obrigatório ele ter qualquer interação com os mesmos). Vamos agora pro mais polêmico, eu acho, o Coringa. Como é que dá pra julgar um cara que mal tem 20 linhas e mal aparece no filme? Eu gostei da atuação dele, da caracterização, mas não dá pra falar que ele é um bom Coringa se ele mal participa de fato no filme. Então nesse ponto eu vou ter que concordar com uns, ele não era pra tá ali (mas ainda sim não dá pra julgar ele por inteiro). * Eu dou nota 8, é um bom filme, com boa ação, com uma boa caracterização dos personagens (e vale lembrar que a Arlequina e o Coringa possuem uma abordagem diferente), acho que uns se desapontaram por criar hype demais em cima dele, e esqueceram que o Esquadrão Suicida não é um grupo ""primário"" da DC comics. - Coisas que eu não gostei: * O Killer Croc podia ser mais forte, não precisava atolar de CG ou coisa do tipo, mas fosse uma pessoa mais forte (bombada).* Legal o El Diablo mas eu vejo que o Onda Térmica se encaixaria perfeitamente, mas eu acho que eles precisariam de um meta humano mesmo pro papel.* O fato do Coringa estar lá pra não ter importância acabou ferrando a imagem dele.* Não curti e nada aquele Capitão Bumerangue, o pessoal mal o que apareceu no crossover de Flash/Arrow mas até aquele ali é muito melhor. - Considerações Finais: * Karen Fukuhara, casa comigo (nova waifu).* O 3D do filme é um 3D mesmo, toda o visual do filme é bem colorido (como proposto nos posters) e isso fica bem exposto na apresentação dos personagens* O filme mostrou de fato que há o universo de filmes da DC, e conseguiu fazer isso muito melhor do que Batman VS SupermanE pra finalizar, já é o segundo filme da DC que a dita cuja crítica desce a lenha injustamente, eu acho que já é hora de todos se questionarem sobre isso não? ""Onde há fumaça, há fogo"". Abraços.",1

115,"Simply put, Suicide Squad suffers from an abysmal, confusing plot and uninteresting characters played by actors without any passion for the craft. Everything about this film feels like a hobbled mess thrown together from half-baked ideas thrown out from other projects. The cast, though diverse, is one of the worst I have seen in an ensemble film. The only standout performance was Viola Davis, noticeably attempting to cobble together an interesting part from an awful film.",0
116,"Look, I know it's hard to take a score of 0 seriously, but hear me out. This is tied with 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' for my worst cinema experience ever. I understand that 0 should mean a barely functional movie with no structure, characters, or anything redeeming.... Although, come to think of it, that's a great way to sum up this movie. Despite what you think, I believe that if this was my worst cinema experience EVER, it is more than worthy of a 0. The whole thing seems like one big trailer, devoid of any charm or like ability. Characters are introduced left and right, some even half-way through the film. And 'characters' would be a generous term, as none of them have any to speak of. What is utterly pathetic are the people spamming out 10/10s without even seeing the damn movie, giving this a completely undeserved user score. This is the movie equivalent of Donald Trump. Some blindly follow it, some blindly hate it, but the majority of sane people dislike it.Except Trump is far more likeable than this garbage.",0

I thought Viola Davis, Will Smith, Jared Leto and Jay Hernandez were decent enough, but was surprised at how unawesome Margot Robbie actually was as Harley Quinn (outside of what you see in the trailers).  Storey was a jumbled mess and I have seen better action in an episode of Paw Patrol.  Not the final nail in the coffin for DC movies, but I honestly felt the train went seriously off the rails on this film.",0
120,"What a letdown. Trying hard, forced acting, poor script and confusing storyline. The premise, with the back story at the beginning made me think, okay this is interesting, but after that it went straight to a limbo. I don't expect that much, plot-wise, on superhero movies or in this case a supervillain movie. But with all the hype, i thought it's gonna give something different. But I didnt really like it. The first part was okay, the middle was getting lost, and the last was rushed. Also, i also find the cgi bad and the minions - haha, any japanase supersentai tv series were far better haha. I gave it a 2 for Smith, Davis and Robbie.",0

128,"Terrible film with little purpose or intention to even respect the source material. Suicide Squad is a classic example of how to make an unwatchable movie. The few positives from this film are the strong acting performances across the board and a few misguided attempts at humor that gets a smile. It has a relatively decent first act and a few classic comic book shots, but overall does not save the movie from its diabolical existence. Everything from dialogue, pacing, plot, cinematography, action, internal logic, CGI, soundtrack and lighting are complete garbage. There is no attempt to make a coherent story and is only entertaining for a simple minded arsewipe. The movie can be better served as a torture tool in Guantanamo than any reason for its existence.",0

130,"Movie was really enjoyable and that's what matters.Good interpretation of the characters, pretty much all the actors nail their character.Good soundtrack, I heard several people on the Theater that they like it.With Batman V Superman I can understand the critics, but on this one i think they didn't see the same movie as I did.",1
131,The film was awesome. This version of the joker was mad and just kept making me want more. The story appealed exactly to the crowd that would be expected to see this movie and each character was unique and enjoyable.,1
132,"We watched the ""Suicide Squad"". And I want more. Yes, again, the critics trashed the film DC, Yes, the Director pressed the Studio, the editor wants to tear his hands and dialogues could be significantly better. But, damn, do not be boring. From the mess of colors, characters and music shines with such charm that it is impossible not to admire. This is probably the best comic book movie of all time was released: the frames are to each other, one scene after another, and you feel like turning over the pages of a comic book like panels lining up in the story. Yes, this film is not for everyone. But unlike ""Batman vs. Superman"", which we still can't speak without shame, and is ready to discuss only drunk like a childhood trauma, this film clearly does not deserve much Haight. Margot Robbie pulls out into every scene, her Harley already included in the Golden Fund of legendary characters of mass culture, and damn the chemistry between her and the Joker is just incredible. This pair of pearl film, they fall in love in just a second and they want to see it again and again. Harley solo album, solo album the Joker, sitcom, musical, anything, but let us take a look at these two again. They are not just crazy, they are crazy, and repulsed the lovely couple comic book movie. In short, you understand. Don't listen to anyone - definitely worth a go, at least in order to make your own opinion, will fall in love with gangsters on acid, and update your playlist.",1
133,"Suicide Squad is far from the steaming pile of s**t some (most) critics would have you believe. If you're looking for a silly, fun and albeit messy ride, Suicide should more than fit the bill. Will Smith turns in a solid performance as the worlds deadliest Assassin, Deadshot. We're given a deeper look into his life behind closed doors with the inclusion of his daughter to the story. I found Margot Robbie's acting to be quite cheesy in some parts of the film, it had me cringing quite a bit but for the most part she also delivers the goods. The other members of the squad aren't really fleshed out all that much but they bring a little to the table at least. El Diablo gets a humanising bit of back story but it was pretty needless and didn't really work for me. The member I was most surprised about was Captain Boomerang. I'm not a fan of Jai Courtney in the slightest but he's actually funny here, the funniest member of the ensemble. Lastly, Jared Leto's Joker. Probably the aspect of the movie I'm most disappointed with. It's not his performance, it's rather lack of. The Joker has 10 minutes tops of screen time. There's little of substance to it and it feels separate from the actual plot of the movie. Taking the Joker out of the story would have little to no impact on anything that happens. However, this is a Joker I'mdefinitely excited to see more of, Leto well and truly chewed the scenery every opportunity he got. The editing of the film is downright bad. Totally haphazard and sloppy. I won't say anything more on that front, you'll see for yourself. The villain is also painfully generic and boring. Folks at Warner Bros. Reel it back it down on the CGI. All in all, a fun movie that suffers from terrible editing and a lousy, CG crippled villain. 7/10",1
134,"Let us remember, to enjoy any movie we have to allow ourselves to be convinced by the narrative.  To that end,  I thought Suicide Squad was edgy and entertaining.  As a matter of fact, it is exactly what I expected, a gritty, unique comic book movie with Margot Robbie in a half-shirt and spanks and Jared Leto portraying a post-modern Joker.  Two thumbs way up.",1
135,"Enjoyable from beginning to end but a few flaws hold the film back from being DC's Avengers, very little Joker (never once interacts with Squad), a few underdeveloped characters and villain, and third act begins to fall apart around the end, but still holds together with an amazing cast, spectacular visuals and action, and fixes many of the flaws that most had with DC's last two superhero outings (Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice).",1
136,Suicide squad is one of the best DC movies I've ever seen. So much action and the characters were really well done perfect actors lots of comedy etc. I believe critics just don't want to believe that DC can make a good action movie or they are just hardcore marvel **** that try to make the movie look bad these people were complete unprofessional towards this movie and need to fix their thoughts. This movie was amazing GO SEE IT DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE HATING ON IT!!!!!!!! Idk that's my opinion. It's definitely better than batman vs superman. Go see it NOW!,1
137,"The movie was a little choppy, but with the number of characters it was well balanced,the characters that needed to be shown. The back stories were fitted in when they were really needed.",1
138,"Despite what all the critics are saying, I wouldn't call this movie bad at all. It's not perfect (most films aren't) but it will be enjoyable if your just looking for two hours of entertainment. Most of the characters are bearable. Captain Boomerang, Harley Quinn (outside a couple of corny jokes), and Deadshot. But I think there was a forced energyless conflict which turned out to be a lot more anti-climatic than you think, but its a satisfying end. I'd check it out if your looking for a superhero movie different from any Marvel or DC movie for that matter. A LOT better than Batman v Superman (A LOT), and I liked it more than Man of Steel at least.I hope there isn't a sequel tho, this works best as a standalone story.",1
139,"I was really hyped to watch this movie and hearing all the negative press for it scared me to death. Decided to still go and watch despite it all. I have to say I'm glad I did as everyone there looked to had tons of fun and enjoyed the movie. It honestly blows my mind how most are trying to claim this is as bad as Fantastic 4 or Green Lantern. This movie is in my opinion on of the best they've put out thus far. To keep it short and to the point. This movie isn't at all as bad as critics claim it to be. Form your own opinion and don't listen to jerks that constantly say ""don't watch it"".",1
140,"The movie was great... i loved Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Loved the action scenes, and fight scenes in the movie. The script could use a touch up on certain parts of the movie. All the characters i felt were in sync with each other. Though i have to admit Leto is no Ledger and his joker could use some touch up, but all and all i liked the movie.",1
141,"Again critics fail to view a Comic book movie more as it's source material (re: a Comic book) than only watching and judging the medium by which it got to them. A great portrayal of Joker and an excellent Harley Quinn are icing on the cake that is a well done, if not quickly compiled, and contained story that allows plenty of room for expansion in a budding DC Universe. Silly, Dark, epic and back again, it was a great watch I'd like to see again. Falling in love with characters like Croc and Boomerang was unexpected and watching [all of] their interactions change from silly and overly confident to deeply introspective and contemplative when the odds shifted was a ride. Now fix the fact that there are almost an uncountable amount of licensed classic rock songs in the first 20 minutes and your movie is then an A-",1
142,"Disclaimer: If you think this movie is good, good for you. I didn't. That's fine. I'm allowed to hate it. You're allowed to love it. Can't we all just get along? Now with that out of the way, time to trigger people who are super easily offendable by not liking their movie. Where do I begin? Suicide Squad is an absolute mess. From start to finish, it's awful. I'm mad I forgot to bring my bottle of drain cleaner to the cinema so I could wash the pain away. Everything from the characters, to the pacing, even the awful choice in music combine to create a **** like I had never seen before on the big screen- I genuinely think this might be the worst film I've ever seen in a theater. I'll run down my points quickly only using examples from the first act to keep this as spoiler free as possible. The Characters: For this let's go back to screenwriting 101. In crazy superhero movies like this it usually helps the audience to be able to follow someone from start to finish. Let's make up a name for that person. Let's call them ""the protagonist."" That's a good name I think. The protagonist helps guide the audience through the story. Usually the protagonist changes, develops, and grows as characters- this is called an arc. Let's, for humor's sake (because the plot is so muddy it's very hard to pick out a true main character), say the protagonist of Suicide Squad is Deadshot. Deadshot starts the film as a hitman for hire who kills people with impeccable aim. He loves his daughter and would do anything for her- besides giving up being a hitman apparently. At the end of the movie Deadshot is a hitman who kills people with impeccable aim. He loves his daughter and would do anything for her- besides giving up being a hitman apparently. No that wasn't a copy/paste error, Deadshot has about as much of an arc as most of his shots- it's non-existent. He's pretty much the same character at both the beginning and end of the film. ""But Dan!"" I hear you cry. ""SS wasn't about Dadshot! It was about Harley Quinn!"" Alright. Let's quickly analyze her then. Harley's whole purpose for being in Suicide Squad is to dispense AWFUL one-liners and to be as unnecessarily sexy/slutty as possible. That's all she does. She says things like, ""now that's a killer app!"" and contributes pretty much nothing else. You learn that she wishes her and Mr. J had a normal 2.5 kids, suburbia life- and that's pretty much it. Her character changes in almost no way throughout the film. The Pacing: Suicide Squad had more pacing issues than a 68 year old's heart after a latte. This is because of the ABYSMAL editing done in this flick. It's atrocious. The only thing worse than the editing is the writing, but we'll get to that in a second. This film feels like it was edited by a 38 year old who wanted to prove he was still ""hip"" and ""with it."" I can't go into too much detail without spoiling anything- so I won't.  But trust me, some of the choices made will make you want to scratch your head. And by scratch your head I mean ""run face first into a wall."" The writing didn't help Suicide Squad's horrid pacing issues, it compounded them. The clunky dialogue would make even George Lucas go **** that's not how people talk to each other."" Every time someone speaks, they're just giving exposition. The film speaks rather than show. It's dumb. And when they're not being walking exposition meat bags, the ""characters' are trying to sound kool by saying some of the most cringe worthy one liners ever put into film- do I need to bring up the ""killer app"" line again? The Music: Whoever did the soundtrack clearly was inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy and thought, ""I need Queen in my movie too!"" Hey dip****. That's not how that works. You can't just put Queen into your movie and expect everyone to love it. People loved the soundtrack for Guardians because it meant something to the characters and added to the overall story. Everything here feels VERY out of place; hell, half the scenes with the bootleg Guardians soundtrack playing feel like they weren't shot with the eventual music choices in mind. It blows. On the whole, Suicide Squad is a mess, much like this review, probably. It's the kind of mess that has the potential to ruin DC's already tarnished reputation. Nothing worked for this movie and you honestly shouldn't waste your hard earned cash- go see something better like Star Trek.",0
143,"Why does this movie get hated? Most of reviews don't really tell a single reason why the movie is bad. The movie is great cause the characters are great, keeping you on the edge on your seat, and much more.",1
144,"When Man of Steel came out a few years back and disappointed, everyone assumed things would improve for WB/DC. They keep getting worse! Batman v Superman is still probably the biggest disappointment, but Suicide Squad is the **** of the **** They need to burn it down and start all over.",0
145,Unless there is another cut sitting around in a dark room somewhere--this film is doomed. So disappointed that the critics were right. It's a huge mess. Feels like about 20 people took turns editing the movie on a laptop. Main plot is lame. Main villain is lame. So even with another cut smoothing out the rough edges--I doubt it would make much difference. Ugh. I give it a 3 for Margot Robbie and a couple of others for at least trying.,0
147,"I loved the performance Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, it was epic, her charisma, absolutely everything, the best.Desde Colombia, ame a Harley Quinn, es tan hermosa, y tan agraciada, la verdad no me arrepiento de haber visto la película, una de las mejores.",1
149,"As i expected the critics are just stupid... and haters... (most of them) Just the movie i expected... the characters are awesome, this is not a Joker or a Batman movie, and a lot of people is throwing **** because of that. The story is simple.. the characters are presented in a simple way, with a little sample of their past, and that is ok, the thing is Warner people is feeling rushed to achieve the same succes as Marvel, and that is keeping them repeating some mistakes, but definitely they are putting their **** together in order to bring alive their universe.universe. The cast is amazing, and i am sure they can do a lot more in a sequel or in the new Batman Saga. How about some Deathstroke??",1
150,Suicide Squad was nothing but pure fun and entertainment !!!! Don't believe the truth I.e. critics as much worse movies have been given higher scores by them.,1
151,"Suicide Squad Spoiler Free Review:Once again I have become dismayed with the majority of major film critics with the exception of Dan Jolin from Empire being the exception in this case with a fair review. Suicide Squad is a delight. It is the quintessential Dirty Dozen of superhero movies that nothing else; including from Marvel has quite matched yet. The plot is indeed a little bit thinner then Batman v Superman which is not a bad thing in this case. The movie revels in its characters and has fun with them. You can tell the director enjoys working with an ensemble cast which is no surprise coming from David Ayer of Fury and End of Watch. Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller are the key scene stealers in this film. I was surprised to see even some of the characters that I thought would get ignored did not, and had a big impact to include Jay Hernandez as El Diablo and Killer Croc. The main bad guys are not nearly as well fleshed out as the good bad guys in this case, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag has a hard time keeping up with Will Smith outclassing him, and while he plays the straight boy scout just fine it is hard to enjoy the character when so many others are fun. Now I come to Jared Leto as The Joker. Leto plays his joker with a modern gangster edge, but sprinkles in a little bit of classic 30's James Cagney from the public enemy. There is not enough Joker in this film to make a full determination or comparison to Ledger or Nicholson however, but enough to whet your appetite for the next Batman film. The movie is funny and has plenty of action to boot for the average moviegoer to enjoy without having to jump into comics to understand what is going on. Fans of DC Comics will appreciate the easter eggs, surprises, and post credits sequences. A lackluster villain and thin story aside; this is a funny and exciting film designed for you to enjoy the characters, cameraderie, and action while building on the existing DC Extended Universe.9/10",1
152,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the characters were handled well, the flashbacks for the characters were well done, overall a very cool movie. DC has a different way of doing superhero movies, the world is darker for the most part. I think this movie is indicative of DC being on the right track.",1
153,"Fun movie to watch. Harley and Deadshot were amazing. Amanda Waller, she just ooozed Jerk (which is what she is). Cpt Boomerang was good too.. the rest of the characters could have been utilized a bit better but overall a good movie",1
154,Opening third to half is really good but the. The latter half is a bit cornet and doesn't feel genuine enough to the characters. Feels like a huge lead up to the next movie most likely featuring the joker who is less interesting than everyone anticipated.,1
155,"Suicide Squad had the potential to be an excellent entry to the new DC universe films, but it tries so desperately to be funny and quirky that it ends up being a cringe to watch. The first mistake people have made with suicide squad is to compare Leto to Ledger. They are two very different Jokers. Although Ledger has been the least comic-book accurate at the time (yet still inherently perfect to Joker's character - and well represented), Leto's Joker now takes the cake. The Joker. You didn't need screen time to determine the quality of the new Joker. Leto's performance was excellent and impressive, considering how badly and inaccurately his character was written.The Joker is not a thug, never was. He doesn't wear bling and he surely would not act like a mob boss, hanging out in clubs. For everything he's always been, the Joker always set himself apart from common thugs without trying to. This is not the case here. Everything that he's represented as is a stereotypical thug, from the acts he performs to the idiotic design with his generic and lame tattoos. (don't believe me? Google ""thug"" and see for yourself). We see a moment where he shock's Harley Quinzel's brain. Why? Harley didn't have to have her brain scrambled to become who she was, she was made by the Joker's brilliant insanity. This small little detail instantly removed any depth their relationship had by implying that Harley only sticks with him because he's physically damaged her brain, not psychologically influenced it. Harley. Also known as, boobs and ass representative to keep little boys entertained and demean and cheapen the Harley character. There's nothing more to say than that. Deadshot. Well, now here's the saving grace. The one character I was expecting to fail manages to pull us through. Sure there were some odd plot decisions, but essentially he was well represented and wasn't portrayed by an over-acting artist. Will Smith really shows how it's done and was lucky enough to have a well designed and written character. Wait, there were others? Oh yes. We spend a long time getting an intro to the main characters and 10 seconds of an intro to characters that are meant to be forgotten. Slipknot? How was his death not more obvious? The ""fire-y"" latino. Oh yes, very smart, I see what you did there.BvS was a great film and Ben Affleck is arguably one of the best Batman's we've seen, but considering how they've chosen to design and represent the villains I've lost a lot of hope for the new Batman franchise. You can see that there was some inspiration taken from the excellent Assault on Arkham, but unfortunately they just couldn't create a movie near as good or with decent enough characters as that. The real suicide squad movie for any DC die-hard is Assault on Arkham, Suicide Squad is just a means to make the majority happy by giving them what they would expect.",0
156,"[Spoiler Alert] This is a very fun movie!!! There are some questionable editing choices, but overall the film is thoroughly enjoyable and different than most of the comic book movies out there. Pros:- Excellent casting choices. Love Jared Leto's Joker, and Margot Robbie's Harley, and the dynamic between the two of them. Have to see more of these 2 together in further DC Movies. Will Smith was bang on as Deadshot, Viola Davis makes a perfect Amanda Waller (is she the true villain? Hmmm). Rounding it out with Rick Flagg, Killer Croc, El Diablo and Katana.- Soundtrack!!! Songs choices served to only enhance each scene and were perfectly chosen- Humour! About time DC introduced some humour in their movies, and it works, without detracting from the serious tone with which underlie DC movies, and there are scenes that carry some emotional gravitas.- Action! Hey what's a cb movie without great action scenes. Cons:- Weak villain. Another weak/underdeveloped villain in a cb movie is nothing new, but I'm hoping one of these movies give me a true villain worth contending with some time in the near future. Loki remains one of the top ones of course ;)- Some of the suicide squad characters remained underdeveloped.- Steven Price's score was phenomenal when it was heard. Thought it should have been used a bit more. All in all, I left the theatre very satisfied and wanting see more of Suicide Squad in the future!!!!",1
158,"good movies, will smith and margot robbie its frickin awesomee, the plot a little bit dull but its a lot of fun, the action was engaging and the comedy was a lot of fun, cara and margot its frickin hotoverall good movies, just lacking plot",1
159,"This movie is exactly what i expected from Suicide Squad: Crazy, Fun, Crazy, Dark and Death.  Thank you DC for killing people left and right and not bringing them back like Marvel does.  For those who wanted more of the Joker, this is not the movie for him.  He was but a small part and it was perfect.  The twists and quickness of **** hitting the roof was excellent.  Will Smith was amazing and funny.  Dont believe the reviewers who are Marvel Fan Boy's or who wanted the next Oscar worthy film .  Its just plain fun and enjoyment.",1
160,"""Suicide Squad"" Is As Good As The Actions Of Its Antiheros ""The world changed when Superman flew across the sky... and then it changed again when he didn't"" says Waller at the beginning of the film. Based on the villains from DC comics created by John Ostrander and Len Wein in the early 80's; ""Suicide Squad"" (the most anticipated film of 2016) erects its story after the events witnessed in ""Batman v Superman"" (another of the most awaited of the year). Without the protection of Superman, USA is defenseless with respect to national security, therefore, Amanda Blake Waller ( Viola Davis) - high-ranking American government official and associated of the agency  ARGUS - rethinks her project of national protection reforming ones few changes with the purpose of be accepted. Her project is entitled ""Suicide Squad"" and it constitute by highly dangerous criminals imprisoned in a high security prison. It is here where we know to Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Courtney), Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje), El Diablo (Hernandez), Sliptknot (Beach). “You want to put our national security in the hands of witches, gang-bangers and crocodiles?” asks an official public directly to Waller. This, the only alternative of global salvation for attacking to Enchantress (Delevingne), a powerful witch of black magic that wishes to exterminate the human race with its granitic brother, Incubus. The anomalous dissemination of the film has solidified the expectations of the whole world, the boys most evil and deranged of the planet as heroes, Suggestive? Of course, but as if it were another Hollywood product, so wonder is not relatively true. I am of those who do not see trailers, TV Spots, interviews or ads with products of such great magnitude like this one, so I attended to the movie theater with the naivete of a child small, without consent of its argument but predisposed to amaze me. However, I was also predisposed to bring me a bad taste due to critics reviews published yesterday that I accidentally saw, and the result was a mixture of both presentiments. ""Suicide Squad"" possessed potential and knew take advantage it during certain scenes with certain characters, nevertheless, an unintelligible script, untapped characters and an directing not appropiate for this kind of movies makes it a small step for the DCEU and not the leap to fame of a company that strives to predominate. They had the opportunity on their hands, but some villains snatched them shamelessly. The comic fans/ cinephiles will receive pleasant delights from its screenwriter and director David Ayer, in addition to some cameos (""The Flash"" & ""Batman"" portray to police officers imprisoning to villains, something not very useful for a generic development, except for the arrest of Quinn), the soul and costumes of the characters are chimeric and hilarious. Its soundtrack fits with delicateness and rebellion to the harmony of each scene; Eminem, Rhapsody and Skrillex offer a dark auditive landscape. Ayer also delights to the eye with comic fidelity, nevertheless, the double-edged of this strategy made less than more,  basing on several comics, they omit some important information (about the Joker) complicating the creation of a rational and harmonious argument for the film. By the same token, the comical aspect was at the hands of the Harley Q - steals the scenes -, a black humor with Deadshot and crazy humor by the Joker. David Ayer feared to repeat the mistake of Znyder (""BvS"") with ""SQ"", so, he decided to make the so known ""re-shoots"" for fill it of color and visual saturation, however, nor darkness nor the fluorescence has been of the pleasure of critics. Disappointing was to see that Leto's much-vaunted Joker did not form part of the squad and also with all the advertising boom and anticipations did not reach the connection I expected, Yes, he is a worthy successor to Ledger but his scant projected story and his not so majestic appearances placed him in a third plane. More striking and shocking I find to Smith, who, as his character, never wasted a bullet and with Deadshot just dead on target, again. ""SQ"" also lacks of a villain worthy of presence, Delevingne does not convince and was a bad play establish her as the antagonist main, weak point of the script. Robbie is undoubtedly the protagonist of the film, her introduction, her dialogues, her hobbies and her psychotic and brazen way of being ridicule others male villains, Margot steals the credit and we look forward to her solo film with greed. ""Suicide Squad"" is Harley Quinn, the Joker, Deadshot, specific scenes of the development and allegorical final scene. We need a sequel, with the same characters, but with a script more lucid and comprehensible, more progress around the other antiheros and a distinct focus, sorrowfully, our villains continue with the bad luck of DC and remain as an excellent summer blockbuster, 2016 has not turning back, but 2017 is coming (""WW"" & ""JL"").",1
162,"Had so much fun with this movie that I had to go see it twice.  Character driven movie that had my attention from beginning to end. Great introduction to Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller and Deadshot.  The actresses and the actor did great justice to the comicbook while also being relatable to those that are not familiar with the comics. If your objective is to fun you should definitely go see this movie.",1
163,"critic's think that ghostbusters 3 was better than suicide squad..... the question is why TF we need them? they don't understand movies. About movie, it's not greatest thing in this summer, but it has something that can interest thous who watching.",1
164,"This is a good movie, with an unfortunate series of problems in post prod (based on what's been said by different media sources) that shows in some scenes that just feel weird or out of place, but overall a good and fun movie. Loved Harley and Deadshot, liked Waller and Enchantress in her **** up form(not when she is all princessy), the rest where good, and i'm not quite sure where i stand on this Joker's iteration. For me, the majority of issues are on the first 30 to 45 minutes of the film, but once it picks up you really enjoy the ride. 7,5 / 10",1
165,"This movie was a ton of fun and a great movie overall. It was visually dazzling, well acted, and dark yet maintained some humor. No it isn't perfect but it was definitely immensely enjoyable and a lot of fun. The movie integrated humor while retaining a pretty dark tone and was filled with fantastic action scenes. This movie is definitely worth watching in theaters in IMAX and follows up yet another great DCEU movie, even if the critics don't agree.",1
166,"Nao entendo o por que de tanta critica negativa. Coringa excelente, arlequina atuou muito bem. Piadas legais e tudo muito bem feito. Melhor filme da dc que eu ja assisti. Na minha opiniao",1
167,This film is such a beautiful masterpiece! A fun and great film. David Ayer is genius and for creating this unique film with a wonderful diverse cast. 9/10 for me! I can't wait for more DC Films to come and the sequel of this film!,1
168,"recomended is not perfect but is pretty good, have accion,comedy is not a complicated film have god argument  nice visual effects great music and the trama is easy to folllow",1
169,I loved this movie. Yeah its not the best movie I have seen but they handled the ensemble cast perfectly. Solid 8 out of 10 but I'm giving it a 10 because of the poor critic reviews. Go see this movie!!,1
170,"The movie is great. Excellent performances by Will Smith (Deadshot) and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn). DC comics did the most with this movie. They got it right. Viola Davis (Amander Waller) did not disappoint. Overall, the movie is great, great  effects, great acting. It has all elements a movie should have. The romance, the jokes and most importantly the action. Epic!",1
171,"Excelente pelicula, independientemente de lo que digan los critos, el publico es el que decide si es buena o no, si la pelicula llega a ser taquillera la opinion de los criticos no importara mucho, lo importante es que la gente lo disfrute y listo",1
172,"Okay, that was Suicide Squad.  Fun popcorn movie that fits the comic books well and does the right amount of character for Will Smith's Dead Shot and others.  This is DC done right, third time's a charm.  There is absolutely no reason this movie is getting the hate that it is.",1
173,"This movie is as polarizing as the new Joker. I enjoyed myself in this bag of neon glowing snakes, but I can't lie when I say that I don't know if the movie ever knew what it wanted to be. But it was still a good time and don't get all the hate.",1
176,"Shallow story lines and characters that are not fleshed out in any way shape or form. If you are not brain dead or a complete fan boy, this movie is an atrocity.",0
177,"NotSoConcernedAug 5, 201610I was really hyped to watch this movie and hearing all the negative press for it scared me to death. Decided to still go and watch despite it all. I have to say I'm glad I did as everyone there looked to had tons of fun and enjoyed the movie. It honestly blows my mind how most are trying to claim this is as bad as Fantastic 4 or Green Lantern. This movie is in my opinion on of the best they've put out thus far. To keep it short and to the point. This movie isn't at all as bad as critics claim it to be. Form your own opinion and don't listen to jerks that constantly say ""don't watch it""""",1
178,"This movie sucks. It's all over the place leaving you confused and cringed at a lot of times. For example they cram an action scene, humor scene and an emotional scene within the timespan of 2 minutes. Thus making none of the scene noteworthy. This goes on throughout the movie making you only remember the general plot and none of the details.",0
179,"""Loved it, and Angry joe, Jeremy Jahns and John Schnep all love it too. Im in gud company."" - the top review Yes, who needs Pulitzer-prize-winning film critics like Joe Morgenstern when you have famously annoying Youtubers that agree with your opinion about a film that only exists because of Guardians of the Galaxy?",0
180,"I'll keep it simple. I'll start by saying, never forget that movie critics trashed Apocalypse Now when it came out. Is Suicide Squad as good as Apocalypse Now? Hell yeah it is! For me at least. This was the Apocalypse Now of superhero movies for me. There I said it. Hahahaha. This is the kind of filmmaking I like. I loved how it cuts away like Family Guy to show us the awesome exposition rather than just say it. Kept me on my toes. Everything with the Joker is perfect. But he is the conduit to get us to Harley Quinn. This is her movie, not his. When watching BvS I understood why some critics didn't like that movie. I didn't agree, but I understood. I have no idea what these critics who are trashing this movie are smoking. Or maybe it's what they're not smoking. Maybe they thought they were getting a Joker movie and they got a Suicide Squad movie. Will Smith and Margot Robbie owned this movie. It was so much fun to watch. I laughed, cheered, even got a little emotional at times with Harley and Mr. J's romance. There wasn't a character in this film I didn't like. Even Adam Beach and Scott Eastwood stood out. Kinnaman was a big surprise. I loved his relationship with Delevingne. Viola Davis was wicked good. Jay Hernandez took what could have been a throwaway character and gave him so much spirit. Jai Courtney and Karen Fukuhara played off each other wonderfully. Killer Croc has some of the best one liners. To sum it up, I just feel bad for anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. I'm glad this movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be. Fun, fun and more fun. I cannot wait to go watch this movie ten more times in the theater. It is simply epic. Best comic book movie of the year, just ahead of Deadpool. For me, up there with The Dark Knight and Burton's Batman. Do not understand at all why this movie got panned. I'm not expecting everyone to think it's the best film of the year. For me it is. I just can't quite comprehend people thinking this is worse than ID42, which according to RT, it is. C'est la vie. I feel like if Tarantino ever made a superhero movie, this is what it would look like.",1
181,"I gotta say this film had the best marketing campaign of any film ever. No one can forget how hyped up this film was. But hype can be detriment if the film can't meet expectations. This film certainly didn't. Suicide Squad starts out OK then crashes and burns. I really wanted to like this movie but it was just impossible. There was no character development at all, the CGI was freakin terrible, the editing sucked, the main villain had potential to be awesome but they didn't use her at all, and it was super predictable. I did like some of the characters. Margot Robbie was good as Harley Quinn, Will Smith was such a likable character as Deadshot, Jai Courtney did the impossible and was good in a movie, and Jared Leto was easily the best part of this movie. He killed it as joker but there is one complaint I have with his character, he's in it for like twenty minutes. Every time he was about to do something that you wanted to see the scene just ends. Joel Kinnaman was fine but his character had really corny lines at times, El Diablo was alright, I didn't really like Killer Croc,I really wanted to like Enchantress but the way they used her was pretty boring and the movie just felt incomplete. Batman is in it for a little bit in the very beginning and it made me think to myself during the final battle ""where the hell is batman during all of this?"" The movie doesn't take place in gotham but we saw he has a jet in B v S. There were so many plot holes and the ending of the movie is so rushed and half assed. Suicide Squad wasn't just a disappointing movie but it's a bad movie.",0
182,"So ""Suicide Squad"" is not the best film by DC.Battle in this film so bad,like you are watching film from 90 's.In this team only Harley Quinn and Deathshot is normal.Joker isn't Joker,its SWAG pimp,really.Just look at his costume,at his tattoo.The Story line is boring,because we all saw it in advertising.So i waited more.",0
184,"I could careless for comic book movies. I find most of them boring and overloaded with obvious cgi, but.....This was suppose to be the summer's answer to Deadpool( he owned the winter). Let's keep it dark and fun with a PG-13 rating. The Good:-Will Smith (Deadshot), Viola Davis(Amanda Waller) Jai Courtney (Captain Boomerang), Margot Robbie(Harley Quinn)- The soundtrack The Bad:- The Enchantress- The Joker aka Proud Member the Juggalo Fan Club- CGI CRAPFEST- The editing- The dialogue (prepare to listen to repeated lines)- Those tar/rock eyeball creatures (They reminded of those black globs a goo you fight off in the Where the Wild Things video game - Which is also a Warner Bros property.)- Similar plot to Escape From New York (Get the bad to do work for the government, inject them with a poison/explosive to follow their orders, send them to some place to retrieve the heart from a leprechaun.(I made that last one up, but you get the idea.)- The Indian and the Mexican might not make it out alive- Phoned in cameos- Not dark enough- Not fun enough- The Enchantress's dancing (very laughable)- Boring set pieces ( city streets, a subway, a bar, an office building, and a sewer)- Why was The Joker even in this?- Not enough unicorns- Why not show off all of the characters intros?- Why not show off all of the characters wishes?- An R rating couldn't have saved this morning-",0
185,"I really don't know what the hell is wrong with the people who writes these critic reviews for a magazine or so. I mean not everyone will like this movie, of course. But it definitely deserves more than 41 point (as it has right now). Personally I think it was an awesome movie, really funny and entertaining. Especially I want to mention Jared Leto who play The Joker on the movie. He did a really good job but of course he can't be as good as Heath Ledger was. All in All a cool movie who you should check out. And believe me it's like thousands times better than Batman vs. Superman was.",1
186,"The movie is awesome , full of actions and also have a lot of feeling , the characters are all very cool , I expected a lot of the joker but was good , it's good work really movie of the year I think I will watch it again",1
187,"It's dumb but for the most part fun. Had the potential to be better but after the team is assembled things go south as the villains and their doomsday magic portal bs are as generic as it comes and there doesn't seem to be a reason for a lot of things.  It is another dark and for the most part by the numbers movie, fortunately Deadshot, Harley, Diablo and Waller are good and do well with what they are given to make it an entertaining popcorn film that you'll have forgotten most of in 6 months time.",1
189,"This movie is not perfect and has a lot of flaws, but overall I had a great time and would recommend seeing it. It gave me a better sense of fun than what I got out of something like Batman v Superman. It has energy to it, a sense of fun with some darker elements to it. This is the kind of movie I want to see from something along the lines of DC comics movie.",1
190,"Suicide Squad, es una película buena con nota 7.5, es entretenida, pero no la mejor del año.Uno de sus grandes desafíos es la alta expectativa que tiene por Batman vs Superman. Will Smith y Margot Robbie se roban la pélicula. La participación de Jared Leto, fue con gusto a poco, mentalmente demostraba locura sin embargo los actos no fueron los mismos.Suicide Squad, es una mezcla de ideas que tenía para sacar una película de 9-10 con sus actores y su trama, por se protagonizada por villanos, pero una mala dirección afecta el resultado final.",1
191,"Joker, Deadpool and Harley Quinn all stood out. I'd like to see this Joker get his own movie tbh. Definitely better than the 40s or whatever ridiculously low score critics are giving it.",1

193,"The only problem with this movie is that it has so many characters, and all of them needed an ""introduction""... I think that this is the main reason for so many bad reviews, 120 min are not enough to do all of them nicely. Other than that, this is a really entertaining movie, I really enjoyed it.",1
194,"Decent super hero movie that could have been better but still was a blast to watch. The character were all great, but for killer croc who I felt a bit short, not really I was expecting him to be bigger. Thats my only real complain about the movie. Killer sound track, and a fun movie to watch. Well worth the IMAX 3D ticket.",1
195,The worse a movie is rated the better it does at the box office. Proof that most theatergoers don't read reviews. Dead giveaway: this has Will Smith in it. Simply one of those people who was in the right place at the right time. Except think of the talented black actors who don't get parts cause he got them. Too bad.,0
196,"Now let me tell you, Suicide Squad is really what people want to see. However it's been getting some negative reviews. Being a fan and cartoons and other stuff, I felt for me to say of what I think of this moive, despite the fact I didn't see it. So what do I think? I think it's funny.......... undeniably flawed but still really funny. I like Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as the Joker. Sure it has choppy directing, a mixed-up plot and not written well characters, But I still think it's okay.",1
197,"Not a definitely bad movie, but a total disappointment of my expectations. The subject was wonderful, the cast was great, it really had the potential to be an amazing movie, different from the other superhero-movies we hot this year. But it didn't. When they showed us the background of every single member of the squad (in a very lame way) but one, was it even possible not to guess that he was going to die first? That was way too predictable. The mood wasn't half as dark as it should have been and the antagonist was just another super-powerful, supernatural, super-boring being, when there are tons of more human and insane Batman villains who could have been way more interesting foes for the squad. And then there was Joker. Let's be honest, I liked Leto's Joker a lot, seriously, but why was he there for just two or three  scenes? The movie would have gone on perfectly even if he wasn't there at all, they just put it in there to attract customers! That was very frustrating, especially after all the hype they created for him! If he had been the villain of the movie, the result would probably have been much, much better! Instead, this turned out to be the story of people bad, but not quite enough, forced to do serve the government by doing dirty, but not quite enough, missions, fighting a dangerous, but not quite enough, entity, in a dark, but not quite enough, mood, while behaving in a funny way, but either not quite enough or too much. It was like seeing the Guardians of the Galaxy stuck in a Nolan's Batman movie. Awkward and pathetic.",0
198,"Suicide Squad is extremely boring and forgettable with very little humor. All that this film really has to offer are gunshots, explosions, and a lineup of villains in which only some of them are interesting. There's Harley Quinn, The Joker, Deadshot, and then there's everyone else.",0
199,Dont listen to critics go see the movie its worth it! I cannot be sure what exactly these so called critics see that  the audience cannot.Suicide squad was fun.. and nowhere near as dark as they interpreted it to be. It plays along with DC comic content and stays true to its origins.. its not Marvel/Disney.. crap critics just need to understand this!,1
200,"Before I start, let's be totally honest here and address the elephant in the room - while I LOVED it, I get that Suicide Squad isn't for everyone. I do however think that the negative response has been ridiculously overblown. This does not deserve to be the most hated film of the year by any means. I'm often bewildered by the negative hyperbole generated by film journalism these days. Anyway, on to the review. When the film started, I have to admit that I was unsure. The opening of the film is choppy, and almost put me off it completely. However, the awesome cameo appearance of a certain character around the 10-15 minute mark sucked me in, and from that point onwards I was along for the ride. One thing I found myself surprised by is that things that many would cite as negatives actually contributed to my enjoyment of the film. Suicide Squad has a very unconventional structure, its pacing and layout can at times be completely insane - and for me this was actually a GOOD thing. Some have labelled these choices as incoherent rambling, I on the other hand praise David Ayer for having the guts to do something completely different from any comic book movie I've seen prior. Not only did I find the crazy nature of this film a refreshing break from the all-too-safe norm, but I find that it actually perfectly personified the subversive and insane style of some of the best comic books featuring these characters (check out Conner and Palmiotti's initial run of Harley Quinn or the recent reboot of Suicide Squad under DC's ""Rebirth"" brand to see what I mean).Another fantastic factor of this film is the aesthetics. The pulpy and often deliberately garish art direction of Suicide Squad will inevitably turn some people away, but I for one loved it. It makes the film pop, and especially suits its characters. On the subject of characters, that's where the biggest strengths of this film lie. The biggest standouts are Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, Will Smith's Deadshot and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller. Margot Robbie is exactly as perfect a Harley as you'd expect her to be. She's stunning, adorable and insanely lethal. I'm a die hard fan of this character, and I can say with confidence that she is done justice. Keep your eye out for some stellar moments of fan service. Will Smith's Deadshot is cool as ice, but plays a large part in the unexpected injection of heart in this film. He's a blast to watch. Amanda Waller is played by Viola Davis to haunting perfection, she's the shady government operative responsible for the Squad's creation, and an intimidating lady you don't want to mess with. As Deadshot would say, she's ""gangsta"". Even the often hated Jai Courtney was hilarious as the cantankerous Captain Boomerang. One of the best things about this film are the many cameos which give us a tantalising glimpse at the larger DC universe, and by far my favourite of these is Jared Leto's Joker. And yes, despite being a central figure in the film's marketing, he is just a cameo - but a damn great one. Leto's Joker has been the divisive topic of much controversy, but I'm on board with him. He's a different and contemporary but not necessarily new version of the character, and I can't wait to see where he goes from here. Now before anyone trashes me for being a DC fanboy blinded by hype, let me talk about the film's negative aspects: As mentioned earlier, I found the first 10 - 15 minutes of the film to be put together in a somewhat shoddy and off-putting manner. Some of the editing choices in the film ranged from questionable to irritating. While I overall loved the insane and unconventional structure, there were a handful of moments scattered across the film where it didn't quite work, leading to the feeling that certain shots or scenes that should have been in the movie were missing. One of the film's three main antagonists (yes, there are three) is severely undeveloped, and amounts to something pretty forgettable and lame. There is an action scene shot completely in fog, and it's pretty difficult and a little frustrating to discern what's going on. These flaws exist, and the movie is far from perfect. But unlike the flaws of the previous film in this franchise ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"", these flaws do not cripple the film when it is looked at as a sum of its parts. Summary:Suicide Squad is a radically different comic book movie to any of its predecessors, and despite what most have suggested, it's insanely sewn together brand of craziness actually serves the film rather than hurting it. If you are a comic book reader and/or love the characters, there's a good chance you will love this movie. If you're a more casual movie fan looking for a refreshing break from the all-too-safe norm, this subversively wacky ride might just be for you. My final rating:7.5/10B+",1
201,"The cut was choppy and hoping there is an extended edition, the movie was fun and entertaining and I really wish I could see more, I think the biggest thing was that at the end I wanted to see more of it, more character time not because they lacked anything in the theatrical cut but because they were really fun to watch. Definitely worth watching.The villain was good for their first mission, but not as great as I expected. Although, it fit well with the story that didn't need the JL characters or left you wondering how come the one of the JL members isn't handling this.",1
202,"There are flaws with this movie, but they aren't as damaging as critics are leading people to believe. Suicide Squad is a fun simplistic comic book movie with a bunch of colorful characters. I think Will Smith, Viola Davis, and Margo Robbie steal the show. If you don't go into the movie thinking it's going to be a massive plot and tons of Joker scenes, then you should have a fun experience.",1
203,overall this movie was fantastic they chose the best actors to portray each role i kinda wish the joker had more screen time but other than that great movie,1
204,"Suicide Squad was really good. For the first 30 straight minutes I had the biggest smile on my face. It was a fun, geeky roller coaster ride. And I can also say that having read the original suicide squad comics, it was actually pretty faithful. I really liked it. I also think overall, its a more palatable movie for the masses, and will, (and should) be better received by fans and moviegoers than batman v superman was. The standouts for me was captain boomerang (who embodied everything that made me love him in the suicide squad comics), Harley Quinn (the role Margot Robbie was born to play, pitch perfect portrayal), Amanda waller (stone cold and ruthless, as she should be), and deadshot (while different from the Floyd Lawton of the comics, Will Smith owned it, and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast)",1
205,Awesome movie. All actors awesome. Awesome direction from David Ayer. Awesome actors Morgot Robbie and Will Smith. Soundtrack awesome. Love it so cool,1
206,This movie was AMAZING!!! forget all of these comic books nerds get hell out of here you sloth locked up in your rooms.It had everything you needed to see in a movie and Joker was a freakin amazing gangster psycho.GOOD JOB LETO!,1
207,"Movie was awesome.  Margot Robbie was fantastic as Harley.  Will was good as Deadshot.  Also, Jared Leto is my favorite Joker.  He nailed it.  Wish he was in more of the film.  Critics just don't get these films.  We want to be entertained and I was.  My entire family loved the film.  Yes, there was lots of chaotic shooting and action sequences.  However, I expect them in these types of movies.",1
208,"The film was amazing,fun to watch and entertaining as hell.Sure the story is cliche but the characters are so well performed that you barely care about the story.Please support this movie.This is a huge achievement for the dceu",1
209,"I don't understand the negativity. It was absolutely on par with what I expected and I loved every second of it. Is it a perfect movie? No. Are there some flaws? A few, but nothing that ruined it for me. I feel like the strengths far exceed the weaknesses and I loved it so much that I'm throwing up a 10 for it.",1
210,This move was amazing  totally throught harley quinn would steal the movie.   In the end it a  very good will smith   movie   my one. my one and  only problem with the movie   was it need more joker  (jared leto) by far the  best joker   we have ever got in a movie .,1
211,"What a pathetic excuse for a movie. The writing is just abysmal. The jumbled mess of a story makes Batman v Superman seem coherent and straightforward. The promotions for this movie were completely misleading. Even the most ardent DC fans will eventually recognize what a piece of garbage Suicide Squad is. It is seriously insulting how bad this movie is, especially when you consider how much money it will inevitably pull in. I've watched hundreds of movies that had 10% of this movies budget and were still better in every measurable way. Giving it a 3/10 is extremely generous.",0
212,"All Hail The Suicide Squad! Our Saviors of the DCEU. Don't listen to the critics. Go see this movie, because it is FAN-F-ING-TASTIC and F-ING RAD. The DCEU's best yet. Pros: - Margot Robbie embodied Harley Quinn and nailed her. All I can say is Warner Bros., green light her solo movie for the big screen. - Will Smith shined as Deadshot. And, when he got his moment in the movie, everyone in my theater clapped. - Viola Davis showed her fear as Amanda Waller and proved she's not one to mess with. - El Diablo was the one who surprised me and had a great arc in the movie. And, when the huge moment happens to him in the big finale, people will go nuts in a good way. - Rick Flagg also gets a good arc in this movie as he struggles to save his love while honor his duties and it pays off well. - Jai Courtney happened with Boomerang. Even if he was reduced to comic relief, he was still fun to laugh with. - I also really liked how the movie in the opening addressed the aftermath of Batman V Superman's when we see the influence Superman's sacrifice gave the world. And, this movie really set up a lot for where the future of the DCEU is headed, especially in the film's mid-credits scene, which you all should stay for. - Now, it is true we didn't get a lot of Jared Leto's Joker in this movie, but, when he was on screen, I thought he played the Joker well. And, Heath Ledger is still the best. But, Jared Leto's Joker when he did show up on screen was cool. I hope we see more of him in the DCEU, soon. - How Batman fits into this movie works well. And, the surprise JL cameo of [SPOILER ALERT] The Flash works well with Boomerang's backstory. And, I hope we see those two fight each other in the 2018 Flash solo movie soon. - The music worked well, especially when Eminem's Without Me played, that really impressed me. - Killer Croc is what he is and is not bad. - Katana doesn't get much to do, but, when she speaks to her husband's soul in her sword before she goes into battle, I thought it was a sad but nice quiet moment. - The flashbacks of the majority of the Squad and how they fit in work well. Cons: - Enchantress felt like a generic villain. - Some scenes in the trailer didn't end up in the movie. Hope to see them on the Blu-Ray. - No Lex Luthor cameo. Oh well. Overall, you shouldn't miss out on this one. Go see it. 5 stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",1
213,"The plot may not be perfect but the characters all were, they were funny and very interesting. The actors are too talented for their own good. The movie deserves better reviews.",1
214,"This movie was bad. The entire movie I was wondering when it would all end. Seriously, whoever made this cut needs to be fired. I am very upset about this film. DC is really dropping the ball here and needs to get their act together. Harley Quinn was the only good part of the movie, everything else was complete ****",0
215,"Just got finished watching the film. Film critics were way to harsh on the film. Its a decent one off comic book film. Will smith, marggot robbie were great in the parts they play. Even though they didn't make harley bonkers enough. Everyone else were fogettable and useless charcters. I thought entretchees was awesome and cara devigne was great in the part. Leto was terrible as the joker! Even if you forget about the ledger performace. Leto joker is still bad. With lines that arent funny and doing things that the joker would not do. Hes more of just a common criminal thats just a little sadistic. Overall the film is watchable and i thought it was going to be terrible with all the bad reviews but it wasn't. DC only problem is that they never had that great of charecters as marvel.  So they really have to dig. Marvel always had the better comic books and charcters. Last thought....I've never seen a more beautiful woman than margot robbie and even though she is aulstralian she can nail a new york queens accent with no problem.",1
216,"You just get into this state when you see films completely different than ""critics"". Goes both for Suicide Squad and Apocalypse. I absolutely enjoyed every second of this movie and it was exactly what I've expected from it. Great characters, amazing music, awesome action. This is what I expect when I go to a cinema. Give it a fair chance.",1
217,"I can't believe how boring this movie was. Everything has been done before. This is essentially avengers age of ultron with the brightness turned down.Will Smith was the only decent performance in the movie and I couldn't get over how disappointed I was with Harley Quinn. I was hoping for more Dr. Quinn and a lot less skanky the clown, but it seemed she was mainly around for the eye candy, which is unfortunate.Was the joker even on screen for more than three minutes? Why did he take up 90% of the trailers and only 0.01% of the movie? I honestly went into this thinking it was a Joker Vs Suicide Squad movie and I couldn't have been more wrong, except maybe thinking this might be a fun summer movie.",0
218,"Suicide Squad is a failed attempt to re-invent the old and overused marvel characters even more. Though the writers tried to create a brand new plot that wasn't the typical 'hero sketch'. They made a witless and cleverless film. Although you can't wait anything brilliant from a film of this nature, suicide squad is even worst that you can't imagine.",0
219,"I had a great time with this movie.The characters are great, specially Deadshot and Capt. Boomerang.Granted the villian and the plot aren't nothing you already saw in TMNT, Avengers, Ghostbusters, etc., but the character development is good enough to compensate that.",1
220,"Loved it, and Angry joe, Jeremy Jahns and John Schnep all love it too. Im in gud company. The joker is amazing, i just want more of him, like way more. Batman was cool for the small amount hes on. And the movie had 3 villains, 2 were awesome and 1 was average. Dosnt make it a bad movie. Go c it",1
221,"Es una pelicula excelente.... me encanto desde principio a fin, DC esta haciendo un exelente trabajo con sus peliculas posee mas humor pero sigue siendo obscura mantiene la esencia de las peliculas de DC es simplemente sublime",1
222,"Just watched the movie and was blown away with how much I really liked it. Clearly this movie isn""t made for critics, it IS however very much made for fans. It serves the perfect necessary need for a story covering the time line gap between BvS and Justice League. Acting, story and spacial effects were perfectly executed. Make sure you stay for the mid credit bonus scene.",1
223,"Is  AMAZING! The film is entertaining , funny , interesting, with many strong moments . It is not boring or bad . If you're a fan of comics , this film is a delight, and I hope to continue the saga of "" Suicide Squad "" vs "" The Justice League "" . Bravo Warner and DC",1
224,"This movie was a massive success. The characters were done right, it was well paced, and they didnt muddle it down with too much content like BvS. Bravo DC, this is how you make a superhero film.",1
225,"the action sucks and the joker is a very disappointment, but the worse are the villains.May be one of the worse super heroes movie of all time......",0
226,"Once again the critics know squat about the comic book/superhero movie genre. For those that are wondering...Jared Leto was outstanding as The Joker, Margot Robbie nailed it as Harley Quinn and Will Smith was great as Deadshot.",1
227,"один из лучших фильмов по комиксам, я от него ничего не ожидал и получил отличный боевик, даже безпривязки к комискам",1
228,"i love this movie, cant wait for a sequelwill smith was really funnyMargot is a really good actor and she is perfect for the moviei wish we would see more of the joker",1
230,"It was better than I thought it would be. The ensemble cast does a good job, and Amanda Waller is appropriately despicable. There are quite a few laughs along the way, which helps. Capt. Boomerang and Harley in particular bring some comic relief. Minor gripes: Will Smith is not cut out to play Deadshot, at least not one that is accurate to the comics. However I can live with it because the movie as a whole was satisfying. Also, I don't know why they subsituted Killer Croc for King Shark. Maybe they couldn't afford the CGI for King Shark? Anyway, I'd bet dollars to donuts it is better than BM v. SM or Man of Steel. At least SS does not take itself too seriously.",1
231,"The critics are way too critical,this movie is actually quite good.Its entertaining and worth the money,funny in some parts and action packed!Will smith is exceptional as always",1
232,"Not perfect but does have very notable strong-suits. The movie was actually pretty good. The cast nailed their parts in both the serious moments as well as the parts where they can fool around and show that they do have a sense of humor. Introductions to each character wasn't long and boring and read a lot like a page in a comic book. Meaning, the cameos (as many know to be mainly Batman and the Joker) to introduce the characters were nice and very loyal to the comic books and animated source material...a ton of easter eggs were to be found for comic book lovers that didn't take away from those who aren't well versed with the source material. Only gripe was the villain...just seemed out of place and a bit over the top for the Suicide Squad as their introductory movie. Probably the weakest part of the film but there is a silver lining: The movie didn't waste time. We got right into the action and it didn't take away from getting to love the characters. For the main gist of the movie being ""worst heroes ever"", it does score high for properly proving that in a way that provides good entertainment.",1
234,"Suicide Squad is not a perfect film, but none the less a fun one.The cast all have great chemistry and give fantastic performances, i was also very impressed with how funny the humor and back and forth banter. Jared Leto was very confronting and intense as the joker, and the action was well put together and most of all entertaining.The films plot however is really muddled at times, a lot of this due to the sheer amount of footage that was so blatantly cut out of this movie. Some characters do not receive the amount of focus they deserved. The villain of the film (Of which i will not spoil) was extremely bland and had barely any screen time to have an impact. The film also had multiple strange and sloppily edited sequences. All in all not a perfect film but entertaining and funny.7/10",1
235,"This was a DC Comic brought to life on the big screen. This is what I’ve waited years for. When the film gets things right, it totally gets them right. It’s a weird, kick-ass, action-packed ride and just an overall blast that breathes life back into the DC Universe because of how much heart it has. I cannot wait to spend more time with these characters in a potential sequel or even other films where they might pop up in. The cameos are smoothly inserted, the world building isn’t forced and it features a mid-credit scene that I’ll say is one of the best a comic book film has featured to date. Even if you dislike the film, stay in your seat and wait for that as you won’t be disappointed. If you’re still on the fence, I really only have two words for you: Squad up.",1
236,"This is beautiful film but its not perfect. Critics marks are doesn`t true because actors are playing their roles so good, and this soundtrack.... It`s impossible! Now my playlist is ful of suicide squad`s music. I think this fil is rival of deadpool, and this rival is better than deadpool! Deadpool`s critics mark is 65! Hey, how much money does it costs?!! Suicide squad is better than deadpool in: soundtrack, characters, jokes and story. So, I think suicide squad is very good film, but its not film for 10.",1
237,"Story was good and on par with most of the recent superhero movies, its not the Dark Knight or first Iron Man but it worked for me. I liked the characters and the action sequences were great - and its more action than superhero which is a nice change from whats going on in the comic book film universes.",1
238,"Suicide Squad offers terrific performances from Smith and Robbie, top-notch visual effects, and a solid narrative, but, in the end, the film tries too hard to be funny, and many of the jokes and references don't hit home.",1
240,"Why are critics being SOOO harsh on these movies???????? Is it that they were expecting something like Marvel or something????? I thought that Suicide Squad was a fun, action packed and funny movie. The characters are likable (Joker, Harley Quinn and Deadshot anyone?), the cast does a fantastic job playing their roles, the action is badass and the humor is funny. The only problem i had with the film is that how much screen time Joker got. He was 2nd top billed and was shown a lot in the trailers but yet he is only in the film for like 15 minutes!  There were more Joker scenes but they were cut from the film. I hope we get to see the deleted Joker scenes. Overall, i enjoyed this film and i look forward to seeing more of the Suicide Squad in the future! I HIGHLY recommend  people to watch this film cause they are gonna have a hell of a fun time!",1
241,"The casting of the characters for this movie was probably the number 1 thing of this movie, every person from Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn to Jared Leto as The Joker ex was portrayed and delivered successfully well. The film had an interesting story and added in a lot of action pact as well as comical moments. Introduction to the characters I believe was successful because it made you want to see A LOT more especially Joker who definitely had a lot of scenes cut and I want David Ayer to release if there is one a full version of the movie on the DVD and in future release the full one in cinema' and that goes for any director of a DC film. At times I felt bits where rushed and a few bits unanswered. I do recommend people to watch it as it does have everything a comic book movie should have; action, comedy, intensity and you're desirous for more.",1
242,"Just came back from the movie... and thought it was pretty fantastic. There are some disjointed parts and some of the character introductions are very short. I'm mostly talking about Captain Boomerang and Slipknot. Slipknot does not even have a introduction even though he has briefly used in the movie... The main villain is probably the female Amanda Waller who is organizer of the Suicide Squad but really she just wants power and control. The movie does a good part of humanizing the villain...particularly Harley Quinn and Joker  have some very good scenes together. These  two couple easier have their own movie together. I liked the prospective from the ""bad guys"" rather than the good guys for once. Enchantress and her brother also are very well done. I was also glad to finally see Killer Croc get a significant movie role as he is oftenlooked! Great movie... dont listen to the critics. See it.",1
243,"Suicide Squad is nowhere near to the dumpster fire that critics would have you believe. In fact, it's a pretty fun movie carried by its magnificent cast of characters. The actors really do give it their all; Will Smith isn't just being Will Smith cosplaying as Deadshot, he's a fun somewhat new interpretation of the character that really works in favour of the movie. He's comical when appropriate and serious and engaging when the story calls for it - you really get the sense that this is a good guy who uses his talent to better the life of his daughter. It just so happens that his talent is being really, exceptionally good at shooting people. You immediately gravitate towards Deadshot as the audience can relate to him in many ways, and he injects much needed humour into the DCEU. Now I'm not saying that the DC movies need to be Marvel levels of funny, in fact I prefer the darker tone of DC, but human being naturally are quite humorous even in dark situations so it appropriate for some characters to make humorous comments like real people do. Margot Robbie embodies Harley Quinn and does the character immense justice. She's beautiful and crazy and that's just what we wanted. I cannot fault her performance at all. My only issue is with her characters physical design; I find her outfit incredibly skimpy just for the sake of making it skimpy. I know she's hot in the comics I would have just preferred a more decent outfit - love the tattoos though. And her relationship with the Joker is by far the best thing in this movie, I just wish we'd seen more of it. Jared Leto is phenomenal as the Clown Prince of Crime and now all I want is more Joker. Specifically his relationship with Harley. Jai Courtney, an actor who is basically terrible in everything he is in is wonderful in this movie. He's funny and charismatic and just overall a great presence in the movie, although in terms of actually aiding the team in combat, he's a bit useless. The other members of the Squad are all great just some like Killer Croc are very under-utilised which is sad, because he was a great character. In terms of story, the first half of the movie is fantastic; from the way they introduce that characters, to assembling the squad, to readying for the mission is all superb. Where the movie faulters is in the villain, specifically their motivations. They're just evil because why not. Like ""let's destroy the world with no explanation other than we're p evil using a machine that will take awhile to work giving the heroes (or in this case bad guys) time to stop us"" kinda evil. The final act of the movie is also rather disappointing. When the squad fight the muhaha evil guys they don't work as a team each using their powers to aid them they just kinda shoot at the big bad than leave one guy to take it on while the others stand perfectly still and watch. It's really underwhelming. Despite the crappy last act the chemistry between the team is enough to keep you invested and carry the movie through to the end in a movie that isn't terrible and in a movie that isn't fantastic, just in a movie that is fun and mostly enjoyable. Suicide Squad is a real step I the right direction for the DC franchise. Let's all look forward to Wonder Woman and Justice League because this movie proves there's still hope.",1
244,"Well i don't blame critics for any of the fuzz, but it doesn't mean SS is bad either. It's passable for sure lots of actions lots of fun. The characters in SS is by far the most handled of all DCEU Movies, SS give more multidimensional aspect of it's characters without sacrificing it's core. Margot Robbie steal the show, and i'm amaze will smith and Joel Kinnaman kills it, both of them surpass my expectation. Viola davies also gives THE TRUE INTEPRETATION of amanda waller and WB should bring her to another DCEU Movies.  I can't lie that i want jared Leto more, his performance is good but the moments he's in isn't elevate him into stellar performances, he should given more screen time eventough i knew he should be a third party in SS. Batman cameo and the Flash cameo it's a good move to show interconnected universe that been build in previous two movies, and i gotta say Ben affleck still best Batman potrayal on screen. Well i gotta be honest that SS had little bit messy transition between the scenes and the cut seems rough in a few scenes, it's like repeating ""Batman v Superman's Mistakes"" which is not a good thing. The plot little bit loose in the middle and The 3rd act it's the worst one i expect more  a stellar final battle. Overall i enjoy it, but please do your homework Warner Bros, it seems you keep repeating the same mistakes.",1
245,"My first reaction after (and during, I suppose) watching ""Squad"" was 'What movie did the critics watch? Because it certainly wasn't the same one I just did!"" I found Suicide Squad to be one of the most enjoyable comic book films of the post-Christopher Nolan ""Dark Knight"" era. The performances were spot on (even Leto's Joker -- whose limited screen time I thought was a smart move on part of DC; after all, it's only been 8 years since Ledger's Oscar-winning performance), the one-liners kept coming while the action kept the story moving along that by the end of it, I felt I'd watched a 90-minute film instead of a 2-hour +. Okay, the story that I just mentioned ... a little weak, but based on just about every other superhero action flick of the past 5 years (yes, I'm looking at you Marvel), I don't think the movie should be completely trashed off of that and that alone. The *spoiler* Enchantress-villain final battle scene was excellent, and that special final scene at Belle Reve was quite possibly one of my favorite in the entire movie and will definitely help set up Quinn's future in the DCEU. It seems the ""professional' reviewers are going out of their way to make this film sound like one of the worst superhero flicks of all time and a 26% Rotten Tomato rating has me very puzzled. It's not perfect, no, but it's the most fun I've had at the movies in a very long time. If you're even remotely a fan of ANY of these DC characters, you should do yourself a favor and check it out -- and if you're not? Check it out anyway! ""Suicide Squad"" is DC's most experimental film ever, and their best since 2012's ""The Dark Knight Rises."" A solid third entry for the franchise!",1
246,"Dont believe the critics: the movie is just what it pretends to be, with Margot Robbie stealing the show. Lots of action, and it's basicly a film for the fans. And it shows. Props for the guy who did the music, everything meshes so well with all the stuff going on, and they know EXACTLY which age group they are targeting. I had fun wacthing it, so did my nephew and niece with whom i was going and after all, isn't that the point of going to the movies?",1
247,Loved the movie. The editing was very comic book like. The love story between Harley and the Joker is amazing. Deadshot (Will) is amazing of course. Finally we get to see our favorite comic book characters on the big screen. It's been a long time waiting.,1
248,For what the movie was it was good. Just don't expect to get an emotional attachment to anyone not named Deadshot or Harley. I think this movie would have been great if we got a tad bit more backstory on everyone. Joker was great in his own way!,1
249,"the ¡¡WORST!! DC movie, ever made, me and my girlfriend got so disappointed with this piece of crap, the joker was awful, he looks like a painted Jhonny deep, he even doesn't remember me as Heath ledger's joker and i thought that he was supposed to be the main villain, but NO, all this **** time the villain was Enchantress, they hire jared leto as the joker ¿¿JUST TO FIND HARLEY??, the only good thing in this movie was Harley quinn & Deadshot but that doesn't mean this movie was great, NO!!, don't waste your money",0
250,"omg this movie is sooo underrated!!! I went to watch it with two friends of mine and all three  of us enjoyed the movie enormously.I don't understand why critics nowadays have to take movies apart like that and analyse every single shot and word that is spoken... The most important part of a movie is that it draws the audience with it and makes you enjoy yourself isn't it?And i don't know about you guys but i definitely enjoyed myself!",1
252,"I saw the movie and in the half of the movie i left the theatre, its the worst movie of superheroes ever, its boring, nonsense, bad editing, the music was so so... never hook me....its really hard that i left a movie but with this crap ill do it.... for example for me batman 2 the dark night its a solid 9.2 but this movie its a solid 0. TERRIBLE- UGLY-BORING",0
253,This movies is a flat out insult on your intelligence. The writing of the first act is probably the most terrible thing I scene in any movie ever. It's seriously 30 minutes of weirdly cut together scenes with explanations of characters. The second act serves as a generic shooting fest that serves to move on the movie but just barely. What small amount of good character arcs that are the film are easily distracted by useless characters wasting screen time. What a total waste of the premise and the cast. On the plus it sure beats staring at a blank screen for two hours. It's partially enjoyable in the way it's so bad it's kind of funny to watch.,0
254,"In the trailer they had a scene explaining the premise of the Suicide Squad was if their mission went for bust, the recruited members became the scapegoat, At no point did that stake materialize in this film. Ike Barinholtz as the abusive guard is the best part of this movie. The low point of this movie is when First Nation's actor Adam Beach (Slipknot) steps out of a car and decks a women. I think the intention was to make this character unlikable but FN men are stereotypically known to being abusive to women.",0
255,"The critics have lost their damn minds! There is no way in hell this movie is not good. This movie carries you through a range of emotions...it will make you laugh, cry, get scared, and it will even make you gasp at some actions of some characters. Definitely a character driven movie. The ending suspends time a bit and so that maybe the only flaw in the storytelling which was a simple story...nothing that could confuse anyone. unless you want to read all the info on each character which some people with ADD may do. You got to be crazy not to enjoy Suicide Squad. If you are take your meds before watching. LOL. The critics are mad hatters man!",1
256,"Movie was fun!Eveyone has to press the reset button, this is not the same universe that Richard Donner, Tim Burton or Christopher Nolan set their movies in... This is new... And as such it needs to be viewed as an original with unbiased eyes. That being said this movie is a movie!! And being a movie it's going to have flaws as do every other movie but flaws give character and make something original the key is to imbrace the originality!",1
257,"Its Scorpion King meets Batman and Robin with a lousy plot and storytelling. The movie was terrible. I had hoped the movie would be ok, but it was a huge disappointment. DC just keeps failing.",0
258,"Junk. Let's look at logic - the premise of the movie is to assemble a team of criminals/sociopaths (with the exception of Diablo, none of them are meta-humans) to fight a magical villain?  The whole point of the suicide squad in the comics was to perform black-ops type missions that could be repudiated by Argus if needed.  They aren't the ""anti-Justice league"" or any sort of bad guy complement to a good guy hero team.  So, instead of a grounded, edgy movie, we get blown up special effects similar to the last half hour of batman vs superman.  Between MoS, BvS, and now Suicide Squad, I'm beginning to think that the DC cinematic universe is beyond saving and needs to be rebooted.  This is a really sad thing - I'm a MAJOR DC comics fan, but this universe is off.",0
259,"Film in the spirit of the original, but rather a restart of The New 52. Despite the fact that the film is another bridge to the ""Justice League"", it is possible to watch without watching ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman V Superman: dawn of justice"" or knowledge of comics. In the tape is as vulgar humor and ordinary. Most of the humor is built on the relationship between the characters and their statuses. Part of the heroes of bilateral (just kidding about the Enchantress), what you don't know which side prevails now. Personally, I say Captain boomerang like more than the original. Katana very few were significant, compared to other characters. El Diablo does not use certain abilities, which could play an important role. New the Joker even appears a little (about one-third of the film), but it will show itself more. Perhaps a scene after the credits hints at a solo Batman, but that's just my guess. The film has both humor and a typical style of DC Comics. It looks all natural, but if to compare with ""Green Lantern"" (2011) , so this is a masterpiece. Should go to fans, fans of fighters and humor. And there's the Bible, the [very bad word], uselock. Action there on top. Entertainment is clearly not necessary. In addition to the Boomerang, the film looks much better Amanda Waller: she's not fat **** like in the old series, but not a young special agent. It is a government puppet. Cold-blooded and sensible. Well, Deadshot is a typical will Smith, but this is clearly not a minus",1
260,"First of all i should give this movie a 8.5 but i give it a 10! because it needs a higher score than 6.8. The movie is ok, not Fantastic but ok, Critics giving it a score lower than 5 are crazy a'holes.Margot and will where amazing.",1
262,"Harley and the Joker are the most real unreal characters in the movie, the performances from Margot and Jared were brilliant. I went in with low expectations and came out quite pleased. Is it perfect? No. Does it have plot flaws? Yes. But it is a blast and very entertaining. It looks like they toned it back to get the rating, so here is hoping that the extended version will get some of the missing content added in, like they did with Batman vs Superman, the extended version improved the movie considerably.",1
263,"What the **** with critic nowadays? This movie desert more respect from them. It not master piece like Citizen of Kane or Titanic but it a fine entertainment movie. Way better  than **** BVS and Xmen: apocalypse . The humor. , the cameo and and ester egg put in really well done. This is the fine start for Gotham  and Batman. The director did really good job to make film balance. If u wonder should i go see this movie or not i suggest u give it a try. 7/10 is my score",1
265,"Ignore the hipster critics this movie is awesome! Good fun, good characters, good story and great soundtracks! You should see it, ignore the critics!!",1
266,"Like most films of this caliber the trailers and promotion are better than the final product. Since the villains are heroes, the actual villains are corny and laughable. The music is good but not as obscure as it was made out to be.  Will Smith wants gun control except when it comes to this film.",0
267,"So, why was it bad? Poor structure / story: To be honest, I don't think there even was a structure to this movie. After a rushed and choppy introduction to each of the characters, a bunch of stuff just happens for them to fight. The story is non-existent. There's no central character to follow, or even a decent villain to understand/appreciate their motives. To sum up, it seems like they changed/re-edited the film AFTER they made it. Everything is so choppy and poorly edited, that you can't help but feel large chunks of it have been left out. Undoubtedly, this is not the movie that they started with. Forgettable action: Okay, so the plot isn't very good. But as a comic book film, the action can salvage this, right? Wrong. It's not that the action is bad. It's just that there's nothing memorable about it. Batman vs Superman had the amazing first battle (followed up by the amazing Martha Kent rescue by Batman), and Civil War had the incredible airport fight. Suicide Squad has NOTHING. It tries very hard to create one meaningful/impactful sequence with Deadshot, but it is soooo underwhelming that you begin to feel sorry for them. Joker: If you have high hopes for the amazing Jared Leto and the iconic Joker character that's contributed to most of the movie's hype, then prepare for an epic let-down. Firstly, he barely even features throughout the two hours. And secondly his introduction and the few scenes involving him, are so rushed and pointless in the grand-scheme of whatever the plot is. Again, when they edited this, Jared Leto's Joker became somewhat of an afterthought. There was no real insight into him, no progression, and quite frankly, you quickly lose any interest in him because his role is so meaningless. It's remarkable how badly they got this wrong! Uninteresting characters: Harley Quinn quickly grows tiresome with her dittzy/crazy demeanour. If you've caught all of the trailers and promotional material beforehand, then you've already seen her best bits. The croc dude is pointless and just growls. The fire guy has a sympathetic backstory but offers very little. Jai Courtney is quite funny as the Australian bloke. And although Though I was cynical going in, Will Smith as Deadshot was surprisingly good (so props for that). There are many other things wrong which, at this moment, I don't have the energy to put down. And as a viewer it's becoming increasingly frustrating to not get a good stand-alone comic book movie anymore. The producers are so franchise-focused that they concentrate more on setting up future instalments, than just making a good movie.",0
268,"It boggles my mind how anyone can see this film and think ""that was a great movie"". For the record, yes, there are fun parts. Ultimately, I didn't feel like my time or money were wasted. But really, this film left me feeling sad. Sad that THIS is the Suicide Squad we got when the talent DC has compiled for this movie could have given us an actually good film. There are good pieces, even a fun moment or two, but the actual construction of this film is a complete mess. I'll start with the good: Viola Davis is perfectly cast as Amadna Waller, Margot Robbie is the BEST part of this film as Harley Quinn, and Will Smith is...well, he's Will Smith. I'm even a fan of Jared Leto's Joker; a version that feels like the Joker without feeling like a ripoff of Hamil, Ledger, or Nicholson, though I do feel like including him here was a mistake (I'll get to that). Most of the rest of the cast just isn't given enough to do. Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, and Adawale Akinnuoye-Agbaje all show promis as Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, and Killer Croc respectively, but they are sidelined for most of the film so we can get more time with Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg. Without wishing to belabour a point, Kinnaman sucks as Rick Flagg. Partially he just can't carry the role, but also the writing for Flagg is atrocious. I wish this was the extent of the film's problems, but that only scratches the surface. The plot is a disjointed, jumbled mess. Some characters are given far too much time to their backstories (Harley) while others are introduced in a sentence or two (Katana) with no explanation for why they are here or what their motivations are. This isn't helped by the inclusion of the Joker scenes (I told you I'd talk about it) which add nothing to the film and only serve to make an already poorly plotted film worse. Seriously, the fact that the Joker, an entirely tangential player who never effects the plot outside of one scene (which is immediately undone), has more to do than Katana, Slipknot, Killer Croc, or Captain Boomerang (all members of the Suicide Squad) is ridiculous. A single scene from the clown at the end would have been sufficient. For what its worth, Batman also overstays his welcome, featuring heavily in both Deadshot and Harley's backstories when the film really doesn't need him there. These, combined with a clunky cameo by the Flash, makes me increasingly worried for WB's rushed attempts at a shared universe a la Marvel. I haven't talked about the bad guys yet because there isn't much to say. Enchantress and Incubus are simply too forgettable to be of any note.  Their mooks are just black blobs in human form - entirely uninteresting as enemies. Its a shame, because Enchantress seems like she could be an interesting villain when we first meet her, being used as a magic slave by Waller, but the film never commits to fleshing her out as a character and so she never moves past the one-note, ""take over the world because magic"" cliche.On the subject of the mooks, here would be a good place to talk about the action scenes, which are generally uninteresting. The enemies are boring in their design, and the film actively avoids having the main characters with the most interesting styles actually use them. Heck, its even a plot point that the one with the coolest powerset (El Diablo) refuses to actually fight for most of the film. When we do see him let loose though, the cgi is too cheesey to take seriously. And we haven't even gotten to the problems this film faces in character arcs and development. Harley is suddenly so attached to the squad because...? Deadshot likes Flagg because...? Flagg trusts the murderers and psychopaths around him enough to remove their leashes because...? The final act starts too early and drags on through too much boredom and unwieldy tonal shifts to be consistently entertaining. From the get go, every ""twist"" is painfully obvious or even outright explained before the twist actually comes. You will know immediately who will become the villain, who will die early to show that Waller doesn't mess around (hint: its the one who the movie forgets to introduce), who will sacrifice themselves heroically in the end, and who will ultimately turn out to be the ""good guy"" of the villainous squad. Is this film an utter waste of time? If you like Harley Quinn or are ok with watching the movie for a handful of good scenes and largely sleeping for the rest of it, than go ahead. Like I said, there are enjoyable pieces. Just don't expect a good film, or even a coherent film.",0
269,I think the movie was good not exellent but everyone is just saying the movie was not good and its not good because they only focus on three characters and the cast was so huge that i didn`t think it could manage to many characters and it didn`t but it was a ton of fun to watch.,1
270,"The third installment in the DCEU proved it's worth (For DC Fans), beating both its predecessors by miles. It's becoming a usual thing for me seeing Bad Reviews for DCEU movies, and i won't be surprised if the same scenario happens with the WW movie. I haven't believed the conspiracy theory that Disney pay critics to say bad stuff about WB movies but now the thought is bouncing in my head, anyway lets get on with the review. Pro's 1.The acting in Suicide Squad was spot on, Will Smith was my highlight performance of the movie,perfect as Deadshot, managing to capture both aspects of the character, the hit-man and the Father. Margrot Robbie was just amazing as Harley Quinn, and i'm really excited about what DC will do with her if she gets a solo movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller just steals the show every time she is on screen. 2. The story was good, as it really made all members of the squad interact with each other in so many ways, relating both to their Criminal lives and their personal ones. 3. The Action sequences are very good, especially the ones having Deadshot in them.Con's: 1.The movie was too predictable,when i enter a movie i wanna be curious about whats gonna happen later in the movie, but with Suicide Squad i really didn't find that, as the ending was very predictable. 2.Too little screen time for the Joker.I really find it annoying that they didn't give much screen time for the Joker, one of the reasons why i wanted to see this movie was because of the Joker, as i wanted to see if Jared Letos performance could top or equal that of Heath Ledger's performance, but i really couldn't as i wasn't shown enough of him to make my overall verdict about him. 3.Very Weak villain, as you saw in most of the trailers and the large media campaign WB gave to this movie, they focus very little about the villain. The final showdown between the Squad and the bad guy wasn't that interesting, as the villain was defeated very easily. Overall Verdict: It's a good movie and is definitely worth your time, it is better by miles than Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. The movie could have had a better villain, more screen time for the joker, but all in all it is a good movie and i am certain most DC fans will like it.",1
271,"+Viola Davis, Will Smith and Margot Robbie performance+Soundtrack+First 20min of the movie+Superheroes cameo -Plot-Script-Deus Ex Machina moments-Weak villain-Joker's ""gangster"" personality-Villains having more ""superhero"" attitude than Batman and Superman in BvS",0
272,Don't believe all the haters. While not a masterpiece it's still fun. Yes the main villain isn't that good and some of the comedy seems a bit forced but if you go in not wanting to hate it I think you'll enjoy it.,1
273,"I don't understand the negative reviews. I found this movie to be great. The highlight is definitely the characters. Harley Quinn was funny, quirky, crazy, and even had a few emotional moments. She had a good backstory and development and that made you quickly fall in love with her character. Deadshot was another favorite, with a very fleshed out character arc and backstory, he was very easy to relate to and was able to flawlessly execute being complex and funny at once. El Diablo was very interesting, his powers were very impressive to see and his development/backstory definitely made him feel real and the audience could connect with him very easily. Killer Croc and Katana were a bit underdeveloped but nonetheless badass, they didn't get much screen time or speaking but were good additions to action scenes. Boomerang was somewhat comic relief, but it worked well for him and I found his character very likable and funny. And the Joker!! He didn't get a lot of screen time which actually disappointed me, but he was amazing. He wasn't Heath Ledger, so don't go into this movie expecting him to be that. He was a very different take on the Joker, I would say more like a gangster Jack Nicholson. But he stole every scene he was in and perfectly encapsulated a crazy crime lord, he was probably the most intimidating Joker we've seen thus far. And his relationship with Harley Quinn roped me in straight away, I just loved seeing them together. Viola Davis/Amanda Waller was fantastic, she shone in all her scenes. She was tough, smart, hard to read, strong, and intimating and she amazed me. Enchantress was a super cool villain, I loved her original costume but felt that the second costume looked a bit tacky. Her plan was simple and straightforward, which worked well. She doesn't hold a candle to the Joker or Lex Luthor or Bane or Zodd or any other iconic DC villain, but she is a solid character. She had a clear plan, albeit a fairly thin one. She is in the same category as villains such as Thanos, Yellowjacket, Ultron or Red Skull, as in she works for her movie and is entertaining to watch, but not the most developed or interesting stand alone character. I loved the feel of the movie, combining the grittiness of Batman with the fun of Deadpool, giving the exact tone a comic book movie should have. The music, colors, visuals, etc. all worked really well in this aspect. It had a great mixture of seriousness and playfulness and I think it was well balanced in this respect. I didn't notice any pacing or editing issues when I was watching it and I don't really think most casual moviegoers would either, but hardcore movie fans/critics may have a problem with this. Overall, a worthy additions to the DCEU, a very fun, gritty, exciting, hilarious and entertaining movie that I thoroughly enjoyed and would highly recommend.",1
274,"I generally find DC are a bit hit and miss most of the time and, after the travesty of Dawn of Justice, my hopes for Suicide Squad were a bit dulled. But nevertheless, i went in with hope in my heart. Unfortunately, the awkward dialogue and ""Banter"" were the highlights of the movie. The plot was fairly cliche, the acting lacked cohesion and the pace felt stuttered. Jared Leto, for me, was the highlight of the film for me, a genuinely new way of looking at the Joker. Like Dawn of Justice, i probably won't bother to pick up the home media version of this one.",0
275,"Suicide Squad is an amazing movie, despite the editing being done a bit rushed. The movie is still enjoyable, the critics are so wrong about this movie. I really loved  the characters as well. Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is perfect, as for the Joker, he did an amazing job, would have loved to see him more on screen though, Leto also admits a lot of the scenes (starring him) didn't make it to the final cut. Therefor I'm eager to see those scenes in an extended edition of Suicide Squad.9/10! Good movie!",1
276,"The entertaining parts were few and far between,  A few slightly memorable scenes but overall I wasn't that engaged in the film, characters or story.  Suicide Squad has been frequently compared to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy because they were both outlier comic book characters that tended to be a little more subversive and irreverent.  Low expectations, light marketing and a mostly no name cast preceded the premiere.  Two of the characters were a tree with a one word vocabulary and a snarky CGI racoon.  On the other hand, Suicide Squad seems like it has been aggressively .marketed for years and contains an all star cast.  WB films are so insanely frontloaded with advance ticket sales and wild expectation that record opening weekends are all but guaranteed. I suspect marginal word of mouth will kill momentum for Suicide Squad before its second weekend and experience a 70%+ drop in box office, similar to B v S. I wish I would have skipped this and waited for it to appear on cable.",0
277,"I am giving this a stars, because there were a couple of performances that were slightly less than terrible. Apparently, Jared Leto is throwing a fit, because they cut so much of him out... he should be writing them a thank you letter. It's absolutely true, The Joker was merely a fleeting presence, just enough screen time to justify his place in the plot... if you could call it that, but performance was so God awful, that the less of him the better, both for the audience, and for his reputation as an actor. I could go on and on about the pitiful stabs at humor, and pathos (Daddy don't!), the ridiculous, and lazy reliance on flashbacks, the absolutely unfathomable fantasy/dream sequences (I guess that's what they were, but perhaps this will some up the sheer desperation of this movie... SPOILER... There'a witch in it... a friggin witch, with all the cheese special effects that go with it. Think The Huntsman, set in Gotham. Oh yeah, then theres the Ben Affleck jaw double in the Bat Man suit from Harry's Halloween shop. I never walk out of movies, bit this was close.",0
278,"Super fun, great movie. I loved it and Robbie was awesome as Harley. Great summer movie!!!! No matter what the critics are saying, they are always going to hate because it is hyped up, well worth seeing",1
279,"Movie has a good plot and good movie cast! Of course movie has some disadvantages, but they're not as big as some critics say. I'll wait for new parts of Suicide Squad!",1
280,"I do not understand about perturbation of a simple plot. This film does not advance the plot , but only familiarizes us with the characters. One thing i would change is Captain Boomerang and Crock must leave after scene in bar.",1
281,All I can say is utter amazement DC Knocked it out of the park with this one. The cast and story telling was flawless in their performance that made me feel as if I was actually watching real events unfold right before my eye's. And seeing the role how there finally interconnecting there Universe's movies like Marvel has had much success with has me at the edge of my seat waiting to see the sequels if there are any. Last but least I was skeptical that Jared Leto could fill the space that Heath Ledger once filled with as much passion. Yet I found myself in awe of his depiction of the Joker and he OWNED IT. This Movie over all was AMAZING I look forward to watching it a few more times. It was so good hopefully DC Komics continues to follow this Trend these last few Superman's and Batman & Superman have me glad to see some serious Quality product coming out of those Comics.,1
282,"Suicide Squad is fun, different and full of interesting themes. The DC Comics universe continues to blossom and it’s a joy to behold.  It's wonderful to see the DC films completely embrace the comic book universe where supermen and magic all exist side by side and that's just the way it is. Like Kevin Smith, I cannot wait to see it again and I have a feeling my rating may only go up.",1
283,"We saw it at a sneak preview. Halfway through - I had to ask ""Is this as bad as I think it is?"" I guess it was worse.  The ""Ghostbusters"" bizarre ripoff at the end - made no sense. The plot had as many holes in it as either presidential campaign - nothing original here, nothing at all, if you've seen one of these types of movies, you've seen this one. Bad. I had to give it at least two red bars because I just feel bad for Will Smith.",0
284,"I loved the movie. Basically, I loved every character and performances. I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She nailed it, as expected. Will Smith as Deadshot was awesome. He fits so much into the character... But the thing I liked the most about this film was THE JOKER. What a badass gangsta Joker!!! I loved every second of him. I'm really mad about most of the Joker' scenes were cut (according to Jared Leto).  But the movie as a whole wasn't so good. That was because of a predictible plot and a main villain that I personally thought was lame. Also, I think it would've been better if Rick Flag didn't appear in the movie, The squad felt so limited.... I wanted them to have more freedom! I'm putting a 10 because of all the critics saying this movie deserves a 0. It doesn't. For me it's an 8.Finally, I want to say that I can't wait for the Blu-Ray unlimited edition of this movie to come out. I want to see all the cut scenes because I'm pretty sure the movie will be way better.",1
285,Terrible! Don't watch it! Waste your money on building a fence around your house to lock movies like this one out. I don't even know where to start... a Joker that cares about money... cars and expensive rings? WTF...? Seriously?? Did the director even bother to read one comic?,0
286,"Worst. Joker. Ever.A soulless train wreck of a film that lacks cohesion regarding any aspect of film making: direction, dialogue, style, vision, character development, story arc, wit, etc. Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Will Smith get through it mostly unscathed, but everyone else looks like they were given one take and whatever they produced went in the can. Cara Delevingne is just embarrassingly awkward and unbelievably inept in some scenes; what direction was she being given, if any, is perhaps a question that needs to be asked because in other scenes she's fine.The plot is barely there: Go from A to B and kill a thing. Shoot and kill henchmen who serve no purpose other than to be shot, stabbed and whacked for 30 minutes. There's no menace from them at all, and they're absolutely no theat to any of the leads. If they hadn't been killed by the protagonist they would have stumbled and shot themselves, or slipped and dropped a grenade and taken themselves ought. There's no point to them being in the film at all other than to pad it out.The bad guys. Couldn't care less about them. Something about world domination, everyone suffering, blah blah blah. Honestly.The Joker: A tuneless karaoke version of a character that's supposedly driven by a twisted wit and black humour turns out to be a style-challanged two bit criminal with a dullard's delusion of being relevant. Take him out of the movie and it's essentially the same, he's an unwelcome tangent that has no bearing on anything necessary to drive the plot forward - completely understand why there's allegedly lots of him left on the edit room floor, and if he didn't have one or to scenes with Harley I'd understand why he would be cut completely from the film.Brought our 11 year old boy to see it because we enjoyed Man of Steel and loved BvS. He never wants to see this Joker again, was bored nearly to sleep at points. How these characters fit in tonally with the previous two films isn't clear, and how any of them will fit in with future DC films is really questionable.",0
287,"This movie was a disaster from start to finish. I laughed a lot during this film, and not because it was funny. I am amazed that they paid writers to pen this terribly written cringe-fest of a movie. I rarely leave reviews but really felt compelled in this case. I also really don't care about the whole DC vs Marvel fight, I enjoy superheroes regardless of the company that produces them. Saying that, DC cannot seem to make a decent superhero film on the same level that Marvel is able to. These recent movies from DC really seem like disaster after disaster leading up to the ultimate disaster that will most probably be The Justice League.",0
288,"AMAZING movie. From the fun and hiperactive feeling of the whole movie, the great performances of all the cast and the DREAM accomplished of seeing DC's beloved Villains come to life, this movie is PERFECTION. Let me be clear, IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CRITICS, is a movie made by fans, for fans.",1
289,It is trying hard to be dark but comes across as to light hearted. Making this a PG-13 was mistake.The jokes also fall flat. Harley is a useless with really bad jokes and the movie is all over the place in terms of plot. Do not recommend this movie at all.,0
290,"How do you even describe this movie? There's no beginning, middle, or end, it's a mish mash of random stuff thrown together with no context or story. The dozens of characters are introduced in a matter of minutes and you're expected to care right away. There's no evolution, no arc, no story, no themes. A waste of time that's what it is.",0
291,"There are several things I hate about movies. I hate when the protagonist is revealed to be fraud only to be redeemed. I hate when from the beginning I know by what methods the antagonist will be defeated. And I hate when movies exposition is out of place not even trying. And I hate when I leave cinema and I cannot quote and vivaciously describe my favorite scenes. This move has not let me down on either of these points. I liked most of the characters, not because they were likable per se, but because they were believable. Their main motivations were clear and their personalities more or less remained consistent, which is pleasantly refreshing. I will add here Joker, Jared Leto's Joker will not be remembered as best, but for me he will be the only Joker that I can imagine could exist, which made him extremely intimidating, I applaud that. Effects overall are on the better side, little plagued by the style of man of steal, but that is up to individual tastes. Grittiness - YES YES thousand times yes, finally a movie where the darkness is not represented by momentary weakness of main character. The movie was dark, surprisingly lot and while the grimness of situation was acknowledged, and just like sometimes in real life when kicked down one time too much, you just laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. which brings me to Humor - The humor of the movie comes from absurdity and contrast. Not from forced gags and jokes. This is my kind of humor, I enjoyed it tremendously. This  movie is not for everyone, It is like a AAA budgeted mix of styles somewhere between Pitch Black and Bad Santa with much better actors and plot.",1
292,"Not a perfect movie, but not dead on arrival as the critics would have you believe. Just as good as any other Expendables movie. There were alot of things that could have been done better, and hopefully will be done better when a proper sequel is made.",1
293,"This was one of the funnest CBM's I've watched in years, up there with Deadpool! This film had such an eclectic mix of music, acting and editing that it was always switching up expectations on the fly which I think was fantastic. The plot though cliche at times was refreshing to follow as it had a simple premise which was condensed into 120 mins that was easy to digest. The cast worked together flawlessly, with them embracing each other as a family as the story went on and everyone's acting chops were on point! I also find it great that the DCEU continues to show that there are real consequences in their world with civilians seen hurt/evacuated, military lending support to our villains (or heroes) and an intriguing political view on the rise of the metahumans and others alike (just enriches the universe even more). I really hope they continue the story of the Suicide Squad sometime soon and that this isn't their only time to shine. So much potential, so many more possible squad members, missions and crazy ass situations to see! If you're a fan of action and CBM's, don't let the negative critical views sway you, take the leap and judge for yourself, I think you won't be as disappointed as you expect yourself to be.",1
294,"While the aesthetic and the tone pf the movie is pretty good, the pacing is all over the place. The viewers are thrown introduced to so many arcs in the movie It's hard to know what the movie is trying to do. Nevertheless, it as great casting, awesome action sequences, and fleshed out characters on most of them.",1
295,"I hate when everyone feels they have to bad mouth a film just because they are scared to disagree with the rest of the sheep. Fear of being wrong so must comply.. The film is great fun, watch on my birthday and it didn't let me down. It's a leave your brain at home film, old school fun. Pull your head out you ... and just lighten the hell up a bit. Who cares about the plot.. It's there for quick fun entertainment stop expecting so much from something so basic. Great fun film.",1
296,"This is a good movie! Will Smith (Deadshot) and Margot Robbie (Harley Q) were great! I enjoyed Jared Leto's new take on the Joker. He was more of a gangster/psychopath/mobster. It's so sad, if marvel released this movie it probably would've gotten great reviews. I'm saying this and I love Marvel movies as well. To all of the actors/actresses and people involved with these DC movies keep up the good work! Again, I love Marvel studios but I'm just telling the truth.",1
297,"Snobbish critics furiously string vowels together to pan this movie, calling it a ""mundane"", ""idiosyncratic"" ""gore-fest""... But they don't understand that THAT'S WHAT US AVERAGE LAYMEN AND SIMPLETONS WANT TO SEE!!!",1
298,"WORST JOKER EVER!!, the only favorable thing on this movie is Harley Quinn, I think this story was written in like half day too precitable, the lack of ideas is big in this movie",0
299,"Good: characters, camera work, settingBad: story, director, Leto Really a 4, but since so many people give it 10 to compensate negative reviews, it gets a 0.",0
300,"While the beginning of the movie is a tad choppy, I'm going to go ahead and lay the blame on Warner Bros, and not David Ayer. They just can't let their directors and writers make something without giving in to the reaction to hack it to pieces. (Idiots!) Margot Robbie steals every scene she is in as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto's Joker shines, is completely unique, and leaves you wanting more, partly because of being criminally underused. Will Smith doesn't steamroll over others, despite being the biggest star in the film. Batman is used well, as is Cara Delevingne's Enchantress, even if she could have used more screen time and back story. Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis, is brilliant. Jai Courtney, Joel Kinnaman, and Jay Hernandez also give solid performances. It's a shame we didn't get to see Ayer's version. I'm betting these solid actors would have only given us more awesomeness. Go see it in theaters. It's well worth it. It's not a perfect film, (The music is a tad overdone) but the performances, action, and heart soar.",1
301,"Despite it's flaws, Suicide cast is a great ensemble film, with all round great performances, action, dialogue and comedy. If i was to compare it to anything, i would say it's a mix of Deadpool and Guardians of galaxy, although better than both of those films.  Not as great as the dceu's two previous masterpieces, MoS and BvS, but still a great fun action film, which is destined to become a cut classic. I can't wait for the extended cut, which i hope will fix it's editing issues present at the beginning of the film.",1
302,"After reading all the critical reviews of ""Suicide Squad,"" I'd gone in expecting the movie to be horrible. What I got instead was a comic book brought to life. I enjoyed the pacing of the movie, I loved the characters, and Margot Robbie nailed the Harley Quinn role. It would be utterly impossible to give every character equal screen time, but that's OK. While it is an ensemble cast, the film focuses on two or three characters. It's true that there are multiple members of the squad, but Deadshot, Harley and Diablo get the attention because they have the most to do with the third act. Funny, action-packed and memorable, ""Suicide Squad"" was a damn good time. Anyone who expected a Christopher Nolan-esque dramafest from an action/comedy about a team of bad guys culled from a variety of comic books should maybe lighten up a little.",1
303,"This movie is not perfect, but it's a very fun summer block buster worth seeing. Amanda Waller and Harley Quinn were just a joy to watch, so was the interaction between the squad. This isn't a mind blowing universe building movie, but it did expand on the DCCU, and it did it well. I feel like this did a better job of showing/explaining tensions between the US government and meta humans better than BvS, and I can see this film tying into the future of DC heroes and their relationship with the various governments and people of the world nicely. But the editing was choppy, and although the soundtrack is great there were moments where the music fit the scene perfect, but really the flow of the film. I feel like a lot of this movie was cut, I didn't really notice that much while watching the film but it did hit me thinking back on it how obvious that was that there are pieces missing. The highs in this film are really high, some of the low moments felt off, but they didn't throw me off the high I was on. I have my odd complaints about various characters but nothing that stopped the show for me, mostly just I wanted to see certain things stick a little closer to the comics, but again nothing that stopped my enjoyment of the film. Both the plot and main villain are a very average comic book movie plot and villian, it's not too complicated or mind blowing but it's right for this genre and film. It's the kind of plot and villain you'd likely see in any of the Marvel films, standard comic book movie **** (which is why I can't wait for the solo Batman film, he's got all the good villians in his rouges gallery!). Amanda Wallers characterization was perfect for this universe, so was Harley, Deadshot, and yeah even this version of Joker is perfect for this universe. Though I do question Joker and Harleys relationship in this film, it's again, not a show stopper. I wanted to give this movie an eight or nine because it is such a fun film, and I loved finally seeing Harley on the big screen played by such a talented actress but the editing and missing pieces mean it's an seven for me. I still highly, highly recommend seeing it one of the only films I truly enjoyed seeing this year!",1
304,"The movie was great, I think the people who think it isn't are too old to understand everything.  This movie is a teenager movie, not for adults.  I think all teenagers and young adults should see this movie, is very cool and has cool special effects.",1
305,"Fight Club, Godzilla, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Shining, and Psycho. Do these sound familiar? They are all movies that were hated by critics, but ended up as wonderful even beloved movies, all becoming cult classics. Suicide Squad, in my opinion will fall into this group in the future. It is among my favorite movies, the only real issue I have with the movie is the Joker. He is poorly done, a mix between Heath Ledger, and Jack Nicholson's Joker may sound good on paper but falls lackluster in actual appearances. Although his role in the film is good, the acting, looks, and portrayal of the character is all around poorly done. Also huge plus on diversity in the film , with the White, Asian, Black, Latino, Australian, Psychopathic, Clown, and Crocodile people even if they are portrayed in a poor light (criminals and serial killers).",1
306,"#SuicideSquad is the best film of DC Comics cinematic universe. Thank you from Russia Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Comics for this masterpiece. Спасибо большое!",1
307,"It is a really good movie. It's not amazing like nolans films but it's a fun movie with heart.  All the actors did a good job and some did great.  Villians should of been better but that was the only big issue. I definitely recommend much better than batman vs superman.I don't understand all the hate it is getting as it is a really good movie.  I expect stupidity from critics as they don't act like a normal person but act superior.  Critics also review based on biases such as being liberal or being against superhero films. I believe the hate from people is based in overhyping the film thinking it will be terminator 2 or something.",1
308,love love love the movie Margot Robbie did a awesome job with harley Quinn also will smith did a good job with Deadshot. going to see it again later today,1
309,"Es mala hasta decir basta. Hacía tiempo que no veía una peli tan mala y aburrida. Pensaba que Batman v Superman era mala, pero después de ver Suicide Squad, le daría unos cuantos Oscars.",0
313,"If anything, I went into this with allot of hope. Came out a bit underwhelmed. Robbie really steals the show with spot on portrayal of Harley Quin. Smith does an excellent job as Deadshot, but he is a bit too high profile an actor and its really hard to see past  that, if he had worn the mask more, it would have been perfect. Davis also does a kick@$$ job as Waller. As for the rest of the cast, forgettable. Ultimately the Squad is crowded with too many characters and would have been better with a team of 4 or less. Joker is barely in the movie. Nothing more than a plot device for Quin's backstory. A shame as it clearly shows that Leto was going all out. Understandable why he's upset how much his character was cut from the movie, especially considering all the hype about his Joker. A wasted opportunity since he is given too little time to truly shine. One real flaw was that the plot has barely any buildup. It really just goes straight from introductions to the action with little filler to help build up the characters, relying perhaps too much on familiarity with the characters. However, it does have a few moments that redeem it closer to the end of the movie. Overall:Suicide Squad is a fun movie, and one of the better DCU movies to date. Yet, I feel like it could have done more and should have taken more risks. Side Note:I really hope we see more of Leto's Joker in the Batman solo film. More Harley as well.",1
315,"It's not a great movie but it's very entertaining,  plus:  Harley queen deadshot and the sound track !!!I can't wait to buy the blu Ray and see all the scenes that they cut off !!    You should see it and decide yourself,   There is a lot of bad reviews pasted by the same person ...  Watch out",1
318,"Right off the bat, I went into this having read the dismal reviews and having been majorly disappointed by the **** that was Batman v Superman. I expected a similar disaster..but aside from a shaky start with a few too many flashbacks, I was rewarded with a can of enjoyable blockbuster action with an offbeat superhero movie that actually had a few good comedic moments that genuinely made me laugh out loud. I'm going to say I wasn't really blown away by Leto as the Joker, even though I love him in other roles and when he's singing in his band, but don't get it twisted, this isn't the next Nolan Batman series, but it was never meant to be, it's a fun slightly messy story about misfits who don't really mesh well with everyday society and does well in telling that story.",1
319,"I don't understand the critics and viewer reviewers. This is a great popcorn summer movie. From start to finish the pace was fast. This movie had minimal downtime and felt like a constant action scene. The characters were great, Harley was awesome. Smith made Deadshot a fun character and added the Smith emotion. The Joker, as some complained was not in the film enough, served his purpose. In short, a fun and good film. Much better than Batman VS Superman and does not merit the horrid harsh criticism. Go see this film. You will enjoy it.",1
320,"The movie is not bad, but not great either. It does not quite match the hype from all the media and trailers. Having said that, I quite enjoy watching the movie overall despite a bit of disappointment but that is simply the expectation is too high.Will recommend people to watch it.",1
321,"Just on the pure entertainment value this movie gets a high grade, Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Amanda Waller Steal the show!. The Joker is played very well and factors in the movie very well all the way till the ending. Yes the story is lacking, doesn't make much sense, the ending is stupid as hell with Enchantress but my god what an ENTERTAINING MOVIE!!, those three above were so blew me away and saved this movie big time! We need Deadshot and Harley and Joker back in a sequel!",1
322,"Great fun. Entertaining as a movie like this should be.Could be better? Yes. But it was a great ride with funny moments and dark at the same time. I think that thanks to BVS and this movie DC has now an amazing potential on their hands. Good luck rooting for you as MCU is now kid entertainment. One note though FFS please whoever reads this get rid of the Joker as he is useless without any real character. Boring and stupid.",1
324,Many critics who focus on Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn saying her costume as being too sexy and didn't focus on her acting ability I got to give Margot credit she pull off a very convincing Harley Quinn even Will Smith as Deadshot .Jared Leto he could of done better playing as the Joker the rest of the cast seem alright..Its not the best story ever told but it did what it was intended to do as a comic book movie.,1
328,The movie had a great start and I loved how the characters interacted with each other. Later on it becomes a zombie shoot em up but overall its a fun mess of a movie.,1
329,"For the sake of context I enjoy both DC and Marvel properties. I also think its worth noting that I was disappointed by Batman vs. Superman. (You can find my review for that film here as well). My issues with Batman v Superman was largely the characterization of the characters Batman and Superman. It took itself too seriously that it really was a slog to watch. I am glad to say I enjoyed my time with Suicide Squad. Its not a perfect film by any means but it had a sense of fun about it. The comparisons to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy are inescapable. Both films feature a rag tag band of misfits who have to team up to win the day. While I do think Guardians handled it better given how niche the property is, Suicide Squad manages to handle its larger cast of characters/team fairly well. The film does take its time to set up the backstories for each of the members which is nice to see. The way each member is presented has a nice bit of comic book flair and a distinct visual style. Take Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang for instance. It gives you a rundown of his stats and even lists his 'fetishes' which I won't spoil here. The cast was pretty solid. Will Smith plays a great part as Deadshot and its nice to see how his arc plays out. He certainly has more character development than some of the others though they too feel pretty well fleshed out like Diablo for instance. Margot Robbie is perfect as Harley Quinn. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is great as well. Her performance gives that character a bit of an intimidating presence. Its that presence that sells her as a character you wouldn't want to cross. As seen in the trailers Joker is in the movie though some may be disappointed as his screen-time is somewhat limited. This is a different Joker than we are used to seeing. He is more of a mob boss than Ledger's more psychological take on the character. The film has some pacing issues and the brakes are quickly applied to the plot in the lead up to the final act. This scene does give a bit more exposition and background for certain characters (Diablo in particular). It does serve as a catalyst for bringing the 'team' closer together though. I also had the impression the film relies on music a bit too much. While Guardians used some groovy music effectively, Suicide Squad's music selection felt haphazard. One of the things I disliked is that Suicide Squad continues the trend of using Superman as a plot device rather than a character. Even in the trailers they pose the question ""What if Superman ripped off the roof of the white house?"" I will say I was glad to see that they mentioned his morals. Its just a shame that the previous divisive film BvS painted a different picture. But I digress. I feel Suicide Squad is a step forward for the DCEU and one that DC fans will enjoy (even if critics don't) I know I did.",1
330,"The editing and soft landing ending lets this movie down enough that this is a 7 not an 8 - but the characterisation of Deadshot and Harley Quinn are enough they should both get their own movies, and the joker vs the ageing Affleckman is now a very tantalising prospect.",1
331,"Generally bad movie aside from a few points. Plot - Them going up against who are basically gods is just an awful choice. Their power and what they are able to do with those powers abruptly stop working when they meet their demise. You're expected to suspend more than reality but even your sense of fiction that the movie creates for you to believe the ending.- Deadshot's background story is pretty good and Harley's is ok in some points.- It seems like this joker actually loves harley, personally i like the version that uses her as more of a tool while she keeps crawling back with the sense that he actually does love her back. That said the joker scenes were at times cringeworthy and don't make any sense. It seemed as if the director had an image of a scene in mind (the knives circle part from the trailer) and forced his character to that point instead of having an over arching idea in mind. His actions seem absolutely nonsensical, to which you reply ""BUT MR RANDOM REVIEWER HE'S THE JOKER"" to which i reply the joker always has an end game. Why is he overly flashy and begging attention? why is he killing someone for no reason in public? why the hell does he drive a F&F 1 throw back lambo with purple underglow? Hell even ""the batman"" seems like a second thought to his love for harley... until a few scenes he just leaves her. While this is a lot about someone who wasn't the main focus of the movie he was on the forefront of marketing and had more than an end credits cameo. To say ""he'll be fleshed out later"" isn't a great point because this is what we have now and what we have to judge now is garbage tier. Characters Good (sometimes) - Deadshot/harley... that's it. The characters suffer from the need of the movie to move along fast. It makes the out of no where comments from harley hit home early, but start to fall short quick when they become expected after the 10th time it happens. Garbage - the rest of the cast especially Joel ""i have one emotion"" Kinneman and Cara ""WHAT THE F%$& ARE YOU DOING"" Delevingne. Oh honorable mention for Viola Davis who acted her script well but was written into being the actual worst person in the movie, one scene ruins the character and will have you scratching your head. oh, also! who ever was wardrobe should never get a job again and why were scenes dark even in the day time?",0
332,"this is my first review ever. So lets start.First I gotta say that the main reason for me to go to the movies and watch this film is MARGOT ROBBIE. Second, Im not really a fan of superhero movies, though I know most of the comics, and all that stuff. And third, I Hate Will Smith as an actor. So, the beginning of the film was so damn awful edited, that, to me, it felt like I was watching an extended trailer, WTF???!!Ok we know that the most famous actors in this film were robbie, smith and leto, but man you gotta respect the other characters cuz they're in the squad aswell!!!So WTF with Killer croc!!??Cmon the guy doesnt even talk in the movie, all he tries to do is making roaring faces and walking with ""bad behavior"" like he is some kind of rapper, so stupid, so for me thats not convincing at all. I really liked The Boomerang guy, though he didnt do much either in the film, oohh thank GOD Tom hardy couldnt be in this film, he saved himself from this s**t!!Rick Flag is just a fuc*** imbecil and useless character. The japanese girl,.....WTF!!??she almost got no lines in the film...So whats with the indian lookalike guy that shows up in the middle of the film just to get killed by an APP!!!??When i watched the trailers I though that Joker would get big screen time, since he is Joker, I was lookin for to watch Jared leto performing the joker since, Heath Ledger did an AMAZING JOB at it, for me waaaay better than Nicholson. So when you hear in the news that Jared acting method was really drastic and sh****** and then you watch the movie and he is in it for like 4 min...what's that all about???So much hype about his commitment to the Joker and he barely appear in this film, what a trash!! I know he wanted to create a fresh Joker, but the result for me was s**^^%&$. Lets get quickly to Smith, so he plays the same character over and over again!!!The same face expressions!!His acting range is SO BASIC and POOR!!!Cara delevigne was so embarrasing acting like the witch ......The other villain also WTF!!?? I wonder why screenwriters put POWERFULL villans that destroy cities and when it comes to defeat the Squad, it all comes down to pushing,boxing and kicking,WTF!!!Thats so annoying and its an insult to the audience intelligence!!!why the villains doesnt use their ALL POWER SET and kill the Squad???Its basically gods against humans!!!whats the ability of Killer Croc???!!Ohh I know, just diving....and **** Margot was an 8/10 in performance, there were times that was a little bit stupid, but most of the film she was good, besides its so freshing for me, Ive never seen her play a character like this. The only reason i will get this film is because of Margot, god shes really hot!!!Its a shame,  I really wanted to love this film but I couldnt, its full of cliches, specially in the fnal act. El Diablo was ok but the scene where he says ByE with flames in the air was so childish and dumb!!",0
333,"I had some expectations for this movie, but is really bad. Will Smith is pretty good and Margot Robbie too, but the rest are not and the movie doesn't have any sense",0
334,"This movie is not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. I found it a very enjoyable movie going experience. Albeit the film does have its problems. The editing is very bad at time and the story itself is very cookie cutter superhero blockbuster film. I would have preferred a darker, more alternative take on the Suicide Squad. But all in all it was still very enjoyable. If you're a superhero movie fan of would still recommend seeing it. Also I wish there was more of The Joker in the theatrical release.",1
335,Love This movie really enjoyed it everything about it was really Good favorite character is harley quinn really love her favorite villain of all time.,1
336,An easy to understand introduction leads to the Belle Reve prison and the Suicide Squad formation on the basis of a death of Superman. The squad however was initially tested and from then on a voyage of discovery as to who the real enemy was. Its fun dark and so much a comic book! 9/10,1

338,What kind of TRASH is this? Worst superhero movie ever. And the villain is terrible,0
339,"best movie of the year! the critics are wrong about this movie, in the most part probably because they didnt understand it, or havent actually looked into the source material that it originates from, which could also be said for people who are complaining that the plot has ''holes''  which isnt the case. all the characters dont get a backstory for a reason, they arent all main characters.",1
340,"This movie was AMAZING I only wish I seen more joker,but honestly Cara delivene as Harley Quinn was such a amazing choice! The movie had the craziness of deadpool along with the structure of a classic avengers movie! 100% RECCOMEMED GREAT CHARACTERS!",1
341,"So to start, I don't think this is a 10 movie more like 7 or 8, but when I've read all the hate this movie is getting I had to give it 10. Yeah the villain weren't really good, but this movie wasn't about them. It was about bad guys doing good things, because they are not only the bad guys, but human beings too(more or less). Margot Robbie was great as Harley, Will Smith nailed Deadshot. Even Boomerang was quite enjoyable. And the whole chemistry between ""skwad"". I really liked El Diablo story. Only actor I didn't like was Cara Delevingne, as June Moone, that acting was quite awkward for me. In summary, movie is very enjoyable and I don't get all the hate.",1
342,Suicide squad was AWESOME!!!  Totally blows away all the Marvel meh movies that the Marvel sheep flock too.  MUST see for a TRUE fan of comics!  Will see this many times!  Harley stole the show!,1
343,"Definitely not worth your time. Plot has 0 significance and is not elaborated upon at all, entire movie is character backstory and development. Only really two memorable characters, and Jared Leto's Joker only gets like 10 minutes of screen time. Wish I could have my money back, this movie was a huge dissappointment.",0
344,"I literally just left the theater and I have to say I liked Suicide Squad! I read comics and not just DC or Marvel, but a wide array of titles, I'm not a fanboy. The movie had heart, it was better than BvS in that it didn't take it self to serious, it made you care about people you shouldn't. There were strong performances by the the leads and co-stars, Viola Davis' Amanda Waller was just scary, Jared Leto's Joker was one we haven't seen on screen, a mob boss with real henchmen it reminds me of Brian Azzarello's take on the character. Margo Robbie's Harley Quinn was spot on crazy and capable, her flirting with Will Smith's Deadshot was organic. Will Smith kept Floyd Lawton from being corny, he loves his daughter but is still an assassin. The break out performance came from Jay Hernandez as Diablo, I hope we see more of him. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc didn't get enough lines, but he embodied his role. Katana was a wasted opportunity, she seemed to be just a place holder at times, otherwise decent acting by Karen Fukahara and Jai Courtney was funny as Boomerang. The music and soundtrack were a highlight, the parts that didn't work were Slipknot, some of the interaction between Rick Flagg and Enchantress and one or two other scenes without the stars. I'm glad I didn't listen to the professional critics, their not the regular movie going public.",1
345,"I would give this movie a solid 9 but I'm going with a 10 to counter these negative reviews. First of all, don't listen to the critics. I enjoy Marvel movies but these critics have to be Marvel fanboys. The characters in this film are really good, with great performances by Margot Robbie and Will Smith. The sub-characters do a really good job, as well. You would have to nitpick to find flaws within the film, there are a couple noticeable ones but don't ruin the movie. Go watch this film, you won't be disappointed.",1
346,"Watched the Premiere in Malta and thought it was fantastic - as did the rest of the audience. I felt the movie did a great job at giving you what you went to see, the Suicide Squad, and that it is being unfairly compared based on previous DC works as opposed to what it is offering on its own. Very much looking forward to seeing these characters further progress in this universe DC is creating.",1
347,"too messy, with no logical connection in the plot, the directory is bad, the cutting is awful. it felt like my brain just went through genocide. 10/10 in disappointment. go with no expectations.",0
348,"I want everyone to go watch this movie, because I want there to be legitimate reviews on this site instead of dupe accounts trying to provide positive feedback. A film student could have provided a better cut of scenes than this 'product', I'm appalled that this piece of **** is considered acceptable, by the same studios that brought us the masterpiece that was Harry Potter. I am ashamed to have watched this.",0
349,"First of all, go watch the bloody film for yourself and make up your own goddamn mind. Entertainment is very subjective, so critics serve as nothing but a guide on how to prepare for film. Back to the film itself, I loved Suicide Squad for its humour, characters and action scenes. DC made a compromise with this film by combining both ""Marvel humor"" and ""Snyderverse gloom"" and the final product to me was simply amazing. Loved all the characters and can't wait to see where this universe will go. Proceed, DCEU!",1
350,"TLDR: Great talent (Margot Robbie & Will Smith) wasted on a poor script, and a poor script rendered unwatchable by a confused edit. Once again WB producers have ruined another DC property. I dread to see what they do with Justice League...",0

353,"""Cookie cutter"" plot, uninspired dialogue, bland repetitive action scenes, cringe worthy stereotypes, and too much Will Smith even for a Will Smith movie. It was ridiculously predictable and full of cringe worthy stereotypes and clichés. The new joker is now a petty, materialistic ""gangsta"" who likes to drive sports cars and hang out at strip clubs. God it was bad. The main bad guy is a witch, her mummy brother and an army of golems. It was more irritating and cringe worthy than boring, but there is plenty of boring.",0
354,"As a film, it's as flawed as its characters who are so entertaining I'm willing to forgive those weak points in order to spend time with the crazy bad ass team. The performances are this film's saving grace that had me smiling throughout. Props to Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis who so embody their characters that I'm left wanting more.",1
355,"Critics rip this movie, saying it's slipshod, shoots itself in the foot, and gives villainy a bad name. Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes give it an average score of about 4/10. Audiences say it's fun, escapist fare, that the characters are likeable in their unfriendliness, and that they can't wait to see more. Their scores on MC and RT average about 7/10. What does that tell you? Yes, the movie has problems: In some scenes, too much happens at once, resulting in a dizzying back-and-forth that even the cameras can't keep up with. Others will escape non-fans and result in a ""Huh?"" reaction. The big-bang moments won't hold up well on TV. There's at least one cliche ""Well, we had to prove what we said was actually true"" moment. The climax is a bit of a letdown. But there are highlights: Will Smith (Deadshot), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) are spot-on. Jered Leto (Joker) meshes perfectly with Robbie, setting up a Joker/Harley ""Bonnie & Clyde""-type film. Karen Fukuhara (Katana) looks great with a sword and deserves an origin movie of her own. You actually care about what happens to the gang of expendables, good or bad -- except, maybe, for the lone ""good guy,"" Rick Flag (an underwritten Joel Kinnaman). The movie stays faithful to the original ""Suicide Squad"" comic book of the 1980s. Bottom line, it's your typical lead-in movie. Remember: People weren't thrilled with the first ""X-men"" or original series ""Star Trek"" films, either.",1
356,"I signed up just to 'review' this movie. This film was an incoherent mess from beginning to end. The real joke is on us, I dont think I'll be sitting through a DC or Warner picture for a long time to come.",0
357,"The jokes were hilarious, the casting was so good that you felt a connection with the characters and the action sequences were good. The story was a bit lacking but it was made up for by the fact that each characters individual story was excellent.",1

359,"My expectations after Batman V Superman were pretty low when going to see this film. Even by that, I was still not impressed. The movie is just a mess of plot holes and corny jokes, and worst of all, the Joker wasn't even worth the hype. Batman was cool though.",0
360,"It doesn't deserve the bad reviews. It was enjoyable, however it suffers from the amount of overhype it's had pre-release. It feels like a film of two halves with it trying to introduce all these new characters and their back story which leaves the main event poorly delivered. Solid 7/10 with everyone expecting a worldie.",1
362,"Just dumb. Sometimes dumb can be fun – and parts of this movie are fun, but most of it is stupid and irritating. The premise is completely flawed. Firstly, they are supposed to be the “worst of the worst” – but Deadshot is just not that nasty, he is just Will Smith. Captain Boomerang is just an Australian thug. They are more comical than menacing.Secondly, the team is formed to deal with a Superman-level threat … really? A psycho-girl with a baseball bat? A man who can climb? A man who throws boomerangs? Even Deadshot’s bullets or Diablo’s flames would not give Superman a second’s pause.(And some of them have already been dealt with by other meta-humans – so how are they a credible threat?) So, from the off, this flawed premise bugged me throughout the movie & caused me to pick holes. Yes, Harley Quinn is entertaining – but mostly because Robbie is so cute. Some of her lines are funny, but equally some are forced and predictable.Will Smith is likeable in his role, but that’s kind of the problem. The Joker is not menacing enough – he is creepy, but about as scary as Marilyn Manson. He is an irritating poser. Flagg is wet and awful, Boomerang a joke, Katana a cardboard stereotype. Diablo has some pathos, but it is clumsily handled. Really, none of the characters have time to develop. They just change from supposedly bad guys to heroes without any convincing progression involved. The plot is a mess. Whenever it starts to get going, it cuts away to another flashback or a scene intended to show the characters bonding – but it doesn’t work. It merely interrupts the flow. And when we do get to the Ghostbusters-style climax, it is unengaging. Too much CGI. A depressingly inevitability about how it will pan out. We know Diablo will join the fight.We know Harley is not really selling-out to Enchantress – it is never believable for a moment (especially when there is a meaningful shot of Katana’s sword).Everything thing is telegraphed and drawn-out. So, it was more fun than BvS – but in its own way, just as bad. No logic, poorly plotted, unconvincing characters and motivations. Just a bit funnier. Does any of this matter? It’s just a superhero movie.Yes, it does matter! We know great superhero movies can be made.We know some can be fun, yet coherent.We know others can be serious – and coherent.So why can’t Warner Bros achieve this? So, I’m afraid after “Man of Steel”, “Batman vs Superman” and now “Suicide Squad” I am well and truly done with DC.(“Legends of Tomorrow” really didn’t help either!)",0
365,"The movie is like an good graphic novel. Not a graphic novel as memorable as V for Vendetta or Watchmen per se, but as interesting as Year One of DC's Injustice. Some of the quick pacing and the cuts can be attributed to the panel-by-panel structure of a comic book (or to poor movie-making, though I would advise against the trope of ""a movie should be like this, or that"" while promoting the experience of a different type of motion picture because different styles should be supported and a greater variety is always better in terms of art). Most of the characters were kind of bland (but not bad, just not that great) except a few who were brilliant in a very unique way. Other than this I wouldn't like to spoil. The movie is far from great but I found that it moved me in ways that most other superhero movies don't and also it's not that light of a movie. It was sick when needed, sad when needed, clear when needed, silly, action-y and over the top sometimes but each sequence could have gone longer since the beginning of the movie is like a marathon of different trailers. I liked it and expect to enjoy an extended version if possible. I hope you guys could enjoy it as well.",1
367,"Surely it was better than any Marvel film ever made (I'm not a fan boy of any action movie studios in fact i thought it would be another cliche garbage film). It was funny, unique, original and had a plot twist. Only think that can be complained about is small logic mistakes like firing a gun and not having a kick. I really liked it and I recommend it.",1
368,"No Spoilers...  Just watched the movie and for me it can be summed up in one word.  Dumb.   There were some good elements but overall it felt really dumb.  Probably because of the reshoots and choice in editing. If you're a huge fan of DC or just really dig on comic book movies  then go see it.  You most likely have already.  However if your more a fan of good story telling over action and popcorn, or if you're seriously trying to decide where to spend your money I would recommend you save your money. Without a doubt the best parts of the movie was the acting for the characters Deadshot, Harley Quin, and Amanda Waller.   The effects were fine, the action was ok and over all I didn't find the movie boring the way X-men Apocalypse was. The down side was the repetitive intro sequence, the characters they tossed in without any setup (Slipknot and Katana), overuse of flashback (and side flash) to keep the joker involved in a movie where he didn't really belong, and generally a movie that goes from zero (we're over here) to 60 (now we're over there) without taking any time to really develop a good story to place us there.    There's plenty of other things to nit-pic but I'll refrain from spoilers. My biggest hang up that I noticed during the entire run of the movie were all the moments where the movie tried to make me feel 'bad for' sympathetic towards these anti-heros.  All the time I felt like someone was hammering me over the head with back story or motivations to try to make me like these murderers, gangsters, and thieves.   I'd have rather they been despicable people but maybe give us an even more despicable adversary or event that makes us want to root for them. Unlike a lot of other comic book movies that I could stand to rewatch multiple times, this is one of those that I would have to take a pass on that second time around.",0
370,"This movie is a amazing villain/Super hero movie including all of the favorites, such as Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as Joker, Cara Delevinge as Enchantress, Jai Courtny as Captain Boomerang! And I cant wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD!",1
371,"Bad dialogue, worst of all the Joker's. Poor Leto, had to compensate by overacting. Choppy story line, under utilization of characters. The Joker is not your average gangsta' thug up in da club (almost as bad as the BvS Luthor- who rather than be an evil genius, he was turned into a lunatic).Lastly: Hey, screenplay geniuses, you don't pit super powered villains against regular people- no matter how bad ass they are.",0
372,"Easily one of the most refreshing movies this year and definitely one of the best superhero movies in a long time.  This is an instant cult classic. It is the Super villain ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" of the 21st Century. The story is very easy to follow and it is NOT choppy, cheesy or hard to follow. If you happen to a person that thinks the plot has holes, you're the one with holes; in your brain. The way the music is combined with the characters was inspired and appropro. Director Mayer never spoon fed the viewer; he gave just enough info on the characters to have the viewer enjoy the show and let the superb cast 'act' their angst and backgrounds.  And they did it masterfully. The movie was an adrenaline rush and to top it off, it was loaded with multiple themes on the topics of the nature of good, bad and evil.  There is sooooomuch to love about this movie and I could spend pages describing the genius of the editing and juxtaposing of scene over scene over musical score over comic book Easter egg. An Easy 9/10.",1
373,"Not a perfect movie but not the gutter trash critics seem to think it is. Really a solid 7/10 not the perfect ten i gave it, but i wanted to balance out the scores in some small way. Action: fun and occasionally very memorable like any number of kick-A deadshot scenes. Comedy: admittedly, spoiled by the trailers Cinematography: I'm no expert, but some of it fell flat when it was trying to be flashy and some of it rocked. But too close up sometimes characters: Best part about the movie, nuff said, find out for yourself. Writing: not stellar but certainly not cringe-worthy often enough to matter. Performances: the other best part about the movie. Will smith kills and so does margo robbie. Jered Ledo was ok, i can respect his take even if it's not my favorite. Villains: One wasted villain, one perfect villain and one that surprised me. No spoilers. was this movie amazing? not quiet. Did i have fun? hell yes. Would i see it again? on DVD for sure. should you go see it?  Absolutely. Even if it's not groundbreaking, it's a good time and part of an intriguing new cinematic universe.",1
374,Underrated and overly criticised. Great example of the chasm between critics and the audience. DC films are getting better while Marvel films are droppping in quality (with the exception of the X-men franchise).,1
375,"Its a great movie to have at least more than 7.5 rating, if i compare it with other movies with similar rating. Critics should have rated with objectivity not by comparing. Comparison with Deadpool is the worst funny thing, as it was an R rated movie and has freedom for many things to execute. Being a pg-13 many good scenes were removed which would make more sense of the movie. And Harley Quinn and Joker's chemistry is refreshing and in someway better than animated series. Jokes are funny. The team and Margot Robbie re crafted the character and expressed her emotions better than the series. I love marvel and there's nothing to compare between them on a vertical scale.",1
377,Gave this movie a 10 because it deserves it. Marvel fan boy brigade is out in full force giving 0's and 1's because it's a DC film and they're envious. How much is Marvel paying them?,1
378,"There isn't nothing good, in this film. NOTHING. Harley Quinn is sexy, ok, but very, VERY, V E R Y  annoying character. The actors are good but the scenography is the worst I ever seen. The Suicide Squad aren't superheroes: they are 5 idiot without any type of objective. One of the most bad, annoying, boring,and you can't save    NOTHING in that film.",0
379,"Bad. This movie expects you to care about the plot and the characters, WITHOUT GIVING you a REASON to care about the plot and it's characters. Shaky shaky shaky camera during fight scenes. Humor was not funny. This movie just missed the mark on about everything it set out to do. I am depressed, I was looking forward to this mess.",0
380,"Best DCEU movie so far.The plot is OK,but the editing is terrible.Harley Quinn,Deadshot and Diablo are the stars of this movie along with Rick Flag.The Squad themselves are AWESOME (the chemistry is great,each character has their own personality) but i need more Joker.",1
381,"I did not expect so much from that movie but I had a hope.First at all I want to tell Dc fans that you have to have critical thinking regardless it is your favorite universe. I do understand that everyone have different opinions but that movie has obvious problems in story and in cinematography as well, specially editing.That movie should be all about characters, Of Course it is hard to tell deep story of  every character in that 2 hours movie( should be longer). But they could not nail anyone. Really, look even on joker which is really poorly played by Jared Leto. Leto is playing just thug freak, without any psychological playing.Harley and DeadShot were OK, better than most of the crew. Main villain is most generic thing among comic book movies, without any clear motivation.DISSAPOINTING",0
383,The movie was **** amazing I really want to watch it again. All u critics think the ghost busters(2016) is a great movie but this is **** well I strongly disagree,1
384,"It's almost like the DCEU is falling into a deep dark hole and allowing the Marvel films to take over the superhero genre. Suicide Squad is yet another downfall of the DC films since 'Batman v. Superman.' It has the potential to be something great, but it's treated by director who doesn't exactly know what he's doing. It's meaningless plot makes the film a gigantic mess and it almost felt like I was wasting two hours of my summer. In other words, this film has no purpose what so ever. There are only a few character that possess that characterization they need, but a few is not good enough. These are great comic-book characters with great backstories, they should've been treated with a lot of dedication and care. Like I said, the directional spot may have been the incorrect chose for the Suicide Squad.",0
385,"The movie is really fun and entertaining, Margot Robbie as  Harley Quinn is incredible, loved all the cast and its chemistry! Wish we can see some more of Katana in the future tho!",1
386,"No soy fanático de ninguno de sus personajes, incluido EL GUASON; por ende para mi la película fue muy muy buena. Excelente guión, excelente trama, excelentes actores.  No da pie para quedarse dormido.  Lo admito, NUNCA ME VI BATMAN, no tengo derecho a opinar sobre el guasón, sin embargo me gusta el otro",1
388,Why stress it. Hilarious and dumb. Majorly a waste of you viewing time. A movie just to suit the moment and have a Jibe at the actors. Low to me!!! The definition of aggressive comedy with action to sell,0
389,There's no such thing as perfect: It left me wanting to see much more Joker and Batman (maybe even a stand alone Harley film) in my books this is a win for DC,1
390,Its Amazing/Funny. 10/10 Would See Again. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,1
391,Everything about this movie is great. they did a great job with everything. The music are the best for this movie and Will Smith and Margot Robbie did a terrific job and everybody else but those two were the best to watch mostly Harley because this is the first time I have ever seen her in a movie and they did a great job with it. Hopefully they will make a number 2.,1
392,i loved suicide squad so much if i had the choice i would watch it again i cant wait intill the dvd comes out im so gonna be the first to buy it !!!!!,1
393,"Худшая Харли Квин в истории . Вам знакомо чувство когда : делает кто-то другой , а стыдно тебе .  10фэйспалмов/10 .",0
394,"Pretty sure the critics were bought, this movie was awesome. It had much greater depth than anything marvel had put out. It's characters had real depth, suffering, and purpose. The antagonists were interesting and truly powerful with believable motives. More movies like this please. Forget the critics, they are about as honest as a politician.",1
395,"Ironically, this film about redemption is redeemed in it's third act.  The first act is great.  The second act is so confusing I'm calling it the muddle act.  The third act is great as all the subplots pay-off and the characters show how in this film there's no black & white, only shades of grey.  This film is also a direct sequel to Batman v Superman.  Given the reviews on that one I understand how that wasn't part of the marketing strategy.  This film rewards fans of that film with some great moments that will pay off in the Justice League film.  I think the reviewers who gave Batman v Superman bad reviews felt obligated to do the same for this film since it's part of the shared universe.  I no longer care what the reviewers have to say about the DC films, as a whole they've clearly lost their objectivity and suffer from superhero fatigue.  I think they're afraid that if Marvel and DC both have successful movie universes that they'll be spending most of their time reviewing superhero films.  Well that ship has sailed.  Suicide is going to set box office records and I personally look forward to the Suicide Squad spin-offs and sequels.  Enjoy the film and be sure not to miss the post credits scene.",1
396,"Watched the movie today expecting the worst movie of the year based on what critics were saying. I mean, there were critics saying that it was worse than Fantastic 4 and that movie's top tier garbage let me say, but those critics went way overboard with the criticism on Suicide Squad, like waaay overboard. The movie could of done a little better with the plot and with a little less pop songs with lyrics but it was fun and thus worth a watch. Effects were amazing, especially the Enchantress character, she looked so good. Leto's Joker is not Ledger's, that is for sure, but it was great in its own way and his dynamic with Harley was so interesting I just wanted to see more of those 2 together. Robbie is Harley Quinn, she owns that character and the actress that played Amanda Waller too. Will Smith on the other hand, he wasn't Deadshot, he was Will Smith but it wasn't too distracting. The rest of the cast didn't have much screen time but they all their moment even if was just for an instant. All I hope now is for the next Batman movie the main villains to be the Joker and Harley, I just want more of those 2. I need it!",1
398,"One of the better comics adaptations. Last 4 years, every time all these bought critics downrate a movie, I know I will love it. That's why I value user score far more than professional (bought) critics.",1
399,"Just a really terrible movie. The previews had me fairly excited, but the movie is laughably bad. There is a character who has the special ability to ""climb anything."" Impressive. Another is good at throwing boomerangs... Then you have some other people, a self-righteous Will Smith, faceless waves of monsters, margo robbie getting more screen time than the world should allow, some really bad acting and yes, an embarrassing Joker. The tone changes constantly, the villain is rudderless and ineffective, and the mechanism running the entire plot is an app, on a smartphone. Oh, and a character keeps top secret information in a back-to-school binder labeled ""TOP SECRET,"" and it is not a joke.",0
400,"I'm so disappointed. I had so much expectation. Someone is ruining the DC potential on big screen.Marvel seem to be under better production team. Thumbs down.",0
401,been to watch suicide squad today with all the family and every body loved it i dont know why it got bad reviews and i am not a fanboy i love marvel films aswell as DC.,1
402,"Margot Robbie and Will Smith were fantastic. Honestly a great movie. Joker was great for the short time he was in it. The rest of the cast just brought it in.. Could it have been better? Yea. And I""m still giving it a 10.. DC keeps flipping everything. Superman is now dark and Villains are lighter. SO they need to fix that. But even so. This movie was still extremely fun to watch and I can't wait to buy it and Highly recommend going to watch it. Just a normal family looking for a little comic geek of a movie and got it. Oh. Olivia who plays Amanda Waller. is THE MOST accurate of all. She is down right scary..",1
403,"Had so much fun watching this film, Harley Quinn was fantastic and worked well with the other characters, my only disappointment was that there wasn't more, would of loved an extra hour with some more backstory and more bonding with the squad.",1
404,this movie got a very **** review and i dont think its fear the movie its really god even better that batman vs superman i actually like this joker and i love the crazy and messed up relationship he have with harley,1
405,"This movie is very entertaining and kept me laughing throughout the whole movie even at the very end. This was one of my favorite movies of the year. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone and also, don't listen to the critics. If you do, you won't be able to fully enjoy the movie.",1
406,"Amazing. 1 Question... Critics what you smoke before having looked suicide squad? Cast: 9/10Harley,Deadshot and Joker simply amazing. It is a subjective film.",1
407,"WOW! WHAT UTTER RUBBISH!!! Seriously, this is one of the worst actionhero movies I have ever seen... nope, it is THE worst. An abysmalinsult to the intelligence of an average person. Every move is totallypredictable. It is filled with clichés and has absolutely nothing onecould say in it's favour. The roles played by the villain heroes wereall cardboard cut-outs and you felt you could write their next linebefore they even spoke it, it was THAT BAD. One becomes so conscious ofthe contrived, staged nature of this ""badass team"" that you can almosthear the director/hairstylist/set dresser running around just offcamera. Suspended belief is usually because a story is so fantasticalthat you make allowances for the way laws of physics can be broken, andyou still become enchanted, wrapped up in a movie that has merit. Thismovie has none, and the suspended belief I found myself having toconstantly endure and overcome was the belief that this was a storyworth caring about. So shallow and vacuous is this plot that all youcan see is a movie that fails dismally at drawing you in. I did notcare at all about the characters, their loved ones, their children...1/10 is generous.",0
408,"I really enjoyed the premise of this movie: Bad people do bad things to bad people and the same bad people do good things for the good people who deserve it. Of course, in order for the bad people to do good, they had to be coerced and/or paid, but it's for the greater good, so who cares? People seem to be born a certain way, and we all have to get along. I think this is a movie that shows movie critics are useless. When I go to see movies which are highly rated by critics, I don't get it, but I sure get this movie!",1
409,"I have no freaking idea what the critics didn't like this movie. It was amazing; the action was great, the joke were funny, and the performances were all great. Trust me, if you're a fan of DC< or superhero movies in general, you'll love it.",1
410,"Yet again the incompetent hack writer/director here proves beyond any doubt to be utterly unfit to be directing any kind of feature films.  This wretched, miserably boring mess is an inexcusable masquerade for a motion picture.  It shows a total lack of story craft that is typical of this idiot's sloppy work.  The characters are weak and unmotivated.  The story begins about half a dozen repetitive times and launches into pronounced music video style song over and over ad nauseam.  Talk about a lack of cadence, dynamics, and most importantly structure!As for annoying details, somebody tell the moron that when you flash up a lot of text on screen it needs to stay up at least for a few seconds so some of the audience can read just some of it.  It's annoying as s--- how fast it's cut and shows a lack of perceptual understanding of cinema.  Nor do the jackass producers and no balls monkey studio execs understand this or are asleep at the F------ wheel as is so typical these days!  Worthless dopes.  And tell numb nuts wearing the director hat that when you have only machine guns firing then show lasers everywhere it's not cool, but dumb.  Very dumb.  Tracers do not ever look like that.  He did the same thing in the lousy, unrealistic ""Fury"" which was almost as boring as this junk due to a complete lack of storytelling ability.This thing is so embarrassingly bad, in another era it would have been unreleasable.  The monkeys in charge today not only hire proven incompetents but are so focused on the opening box office which they know the brand will deliver that they don't even bother to question obvious flaws.  We are in the age of mindless auto-manufacture of motion pictures. If you care about movies you should rail against the stream of s--- now becoming par for the course in Hollywood.  It's sad how far the bar has been lowered for today's audience who seem to just go along with what Hollywood dishes out like a flock of grazing sheep.  These zombies ruin the level of quality for the rest of us.  The morons on here who like this movie because they like the comic book should actually be the ones crying foul the loudest that it was utterly ruined by hacks, but instead they stick up for it because... well they're mostly morons. The black light neon bright titles in the movie got me good and are the only element I liked whatsoever.  Too bad they're blown on such a pitiful waste.",0
411,"Honestly, all the ""bad"" reviews are from liberals that give this movie a poor rating just for the the fact that the one character (Harley Quinn) was sexualized. I say f**k that. This movie was amazing. The plot was decent (which is very rare in modern movies), the CGI was on point, and the acting was flawless. You NEED to go see this masterpiece! Keep in mind that the same people giving this a bad review, are the same ones that think Islam is a religion of peace hahha! Those same people are the ones that turned 1st world countries like Germany and France into WAR ZONES! So the point is, disregard the idiotic reviews that are all based around an agenda to enslave humanity, and look to the positive.",1
412,Really enjoyed this movie especially all the cast like Will Smith and Margot Robbie were best performance in whole movie there were some scenes are messy u didn't mind it all,1
413,"I cannot recall seeing such a bad film since Cabin in The Woods, this was a shockingly bad film and I just cannot understand any positive reviews. Margo Robbie almost carries the film but even towards the end she can't do nothing with the awful writing, directing and just plot of the film. Terrible terrible.",0
414,I looooooooooooove that film......................that was like comic books and i  have no idea why some critics have negative ponit of view.and i recommend you  watching this film.,1
415,"The DCEU gets a little bit bigger. Suicide Squad is used to show off a different side of WB's cinematic universe. One with a little more style, humor, and crazy flair than what we've previously seen with the likes of MoS and BvS. This new vibe doesn't wildly change things though. The focus may be on the villains this time around, but this is your standard, save the world from destruction, superhero affair. The plot is incredibly familiar. A big, overpowered baddie is building a world ending device. Only this time it isn't the heroes going in to save the day, it's other bad guys. Naturally, manipulation by politicians is what gets these characters to cooperate. There's some stuff about how these characters are just tools to the people in power. That the politicians are just as heartless as the villains. It adds a little bit more depth and expands the scale of the universe, but it's never used to any great effect here. Nothing is really said. Despite it's plot shortcomings, it's the characters and their action scenes that keep things going. Not all of the villains get the attention they deserve, but the ones that do are brought to life pretty well. Margot Robbie doesn't disappoint as Harley and Will Smith is a good Deadshot even if he doesn't break away from his typical smart aleck role. Joel Kinnaman is equally great as the leader of the group, Rick Flagg. I also have to give special praise to Jai Courtney. I haven't liked that dude since Spartacus. He's just stunk up every movie he's been in. Not here though. He's actually one of the best. Loved his Captain Boomerang. The best character and performance award goes to Jay Hernandez though. He's the heart and soul of the movie. Everyone else is kind of underused. Especially Viola Davis. Such a fantastic actress shouldn't be limited to a supporting role like that. There's also not enough Killer Croc. The only performance that disappointed me here was Jared Leto. Although that might not be entirely his fault. He may actually be a great Joker. He just isn't given much to do here and what he is given to do isn't great. Stylistically he looks to gaudy. The cartoony, yet gangsterish look they gave him doesn't work. His laugh is weak and he does the weird snorting, growl thing that just isn't appealing. I should probably wait to reserve judgment until he's actually really utilized in the universe, but this is not a good introduction to this new interpretation of the Joker. This first impression didn't go well and may be just as controversial with fans as Eisenberg's Lex Luther. The action in the movie is entertaining. A lot of punching, shooting, explosions, and all around villainy action. Each characters abilities are shown off well. Doesn't break any new ground, but is entertaining nonetheless. The style is a big part of the film. At times it's light, bubbly and oh so sadistic with it's visuals and humor. Totally feels like a movie about the bad guys. The soundtrack is awesome and used perfectly. Admittedly some of this stuff can get cheesy and a lot of it ends up ditched early on in favor of standard superhero flick affair, but what's here is mostly likable. It's just a movie about watching the bad guys be bad guys while doing good guy stuff. It doesn't save the DCEU and falls short in a lot of areas. However if you just come for the characters and to have fun then you can still enjoy this. The DCEU might still be in trouble, but I appreciate seeing the style and humor of Suicide Squad attempting to bring something different to it. I may have wanted a better movie, but the cast and their dedication to doing the best darn job they can with the characters pulled me in. It's not perfect, but I still had some fun.",1
417,"Overall a good movie. The villains were about 50/50 on quality. Harley, Deadshot, and Diable were good characters, while Boomerang, Flagg, Croc, and Katana were a little outclassed. The Joker was entirely unneeded in the movie and the version of the character was weak at best. I really like Leto and Jia Courtney, and even Kinnaman so was disappointed. Ike Barinholtz added some great comedy. Plot is a little weak, and it would have been better if they had a bad guy before they made the play to put the team together.  Cameo by Batman was fine. Flash's costume looked weak, hopefully they change it before the Justice League movie.",1
418,"I'll keep it simple because the DCEU has worn me out. This movie is awful. The action is generic, the plot is a barebones hodgepodge, a lot of the dialogue is bad, the villain is silly and many of the music / scene pairings are baffling. It has a few cool characters like Deadshot, although he is more Will Smith then comic Floyd Lawton, Harely, but many of her jokes are flat, and Diablo, who has a strange new power at the end. The Joker is just bad. He has no point in the movie, I hate his look, I hate his laugh, I hate him using his mouth tattoo in front of his own mouth. He's more of a gangbanger with a weird gimmick. Oh, all the conflicts including the finale could have been dealt with by regular soldiers and a rocket launcher. lol",0
419,"Wow, just got back from Suicide Squad and I'm really confused by the critical hammering. Time is going to be kind to this movie. There's so much artistry and fun in SS and it was probably one of the most consistent superhero movies I've ever seen. Beyond the great performances, storytelling, art direction and characters it was just gorgeous to look at – easily the most eye-candied popcorn movie I've seen in a long time.",1
420,"First off, this movie was strictly made for fans and to set up The Justice League. That statement itself proves this movie deserves more recognition. Critics are totally dissecting it, overthinking every scene. This movie may not be ""The Best Superhero Movie"", but if you watch it and soak everything in as a whole, maybe pretend Tarantino directed then this movie is a blast, it's witty, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Just like the comics. Jared Leto even attempting to fill the shoes of Heath Ledger is a MAJOR task all in itself, and I think he did a great job. Watch a batman animated series episode, Leto took all of Joker's essence and amplified it in a twisted mental way, while Ledger was more human and serious. I think all the actors just had fun in the film, as did I watching it. If you expected this to be anything like The Dark Knight or have a serious tone in my opinion it did a better job than Batman V Superman did, and is an all around fun time. This will be a cult classic, and while not the smartest move DC could have made, it sure made a FUN move. This was new territory for DC cinematic universe, and I was pleasantly surprised.",1
421,"Even after hearing the negative reviews, I was still going to give this show the benefit of the doubt and go in with an open mind. Now that I've seen it, I can see where they were coming from. Lots of plot holes, very little of the Joker when he was used in all of the promo stuff, and the extreme focus on Will Smith and Margo Robbie's characters to the point where everyone else was pushed to the side till they were conveniently needed, it made me upset that I had actually paid for this at the end of the day. One thing you can see pretty obviously is where the re-shoots started and ended. That's a very bad thing in my book as it gave the story some disjointed spots that felt extremely out of place. At the end of the day, it's another dud from the DC universe and it's getting very disheartening to see where things are going. This movie franchise doesn't seem to have a direction it wants to go during the movie itself. Just a bad way of trying to tie all the movies together for the Justice League coming next year. While Wonder Woman looks to be the best shot the universe has of finally giving us a decent movie, this one is a bore fest and should be skipped by all but the most dedicated of fans of the title characters.",0
423,"I can see why the professional critics came down so hard on this film. There are plot holes. The pacing is a bit off a times. Some of the ensemble cast doesn't do much. Perhaps the worst sin, a couple of characters get ""reigned in"" for the PG 13 rating. On the other hand, this movie has enough awesome in it to be the 3rd best comic book movie of the year (in my opinion). Behind Deadpool and Captain America 2. There is plenty to enjoy about it, and its a memorable movie. Will Smith is back in fine form. Its not some sedate feel good, oscar bate story this time. He brings the swagger that we haven't seen in a long time. Though he hijacks the deadshot character, its probably worth it, and he gives an enjoyable performance. Margot Robbie does a great Harley Quin, though she gets a bit less crazy towards the end. An almost epic performance on her part. Cara Delevingne does a great job playing the Enchantress+ whatever the human part of that was called.The rest of the cast did a suitably good job.The plot is OK. Hate to say it but the animated suicide squad movies do a better job there. There is a camaraderie and empathy they build at one point is an off-putting stretch. They are bad guys. Not all bad, sure, but worse than that.Jared Leto gave us a different joker from what we've seen before. It fits the hyper stylized universe. Not my favorite. Not bad really either. Just a change. Less menacing, more over the top street thug.Overall I felt like I was watching an early attempt at an awesome film. And it had all the ingredients to be awesome. They just need to work a few bugs out first. Its a big step up for this studio following Batman vs Superman.",1
424,"I went to see this with my brothers and we left utterly disappointed. The word generic comes in to mind in every way. The plot, characters, forced humor, sound track and overall feel of the film was just poorly executed in every way. The characters also made zero sense and didn't follow the comics at all. No spoilers but if you watch it, keep in mind these people are supposed to be the BAD GUYS. They are super villains and psychopaths. Bottom of society sort of people so why do they make so many good choices? Very confusing. The film in my opinion was propped up by very solid performances from Joker and Boomerang.",0
425,"I know this movie had its problems. the pacing was a little weird, storytelling was a bit jarring and the soundtrack seemed to be overcompensating, but the characters really carried this movie for me. I really enjoyed Will Smith as Deadshot. Joker was a little weird, but I did like that he was a fresh take on Joker with the weirdness that was his and Harley's relationship. As flawed as this movie was I found myself thoroughly entertained.",1
427,"This bad boys have TEETH! I would like to begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Deadshot, Harley, Killer Croc, and El Diablo were on point. Their performances were a pleasure to watch, and I felt they really connected with their characters. The flashbacks that introduced each character were short but they surely gave you the pieces you needed to follow the story. As an action movie, I though it was really good. However, there were some minor flaws. The first of these is the Joker's screen time. I really enjoyed Leto's take, but I felt that he wasn't fleshed out as we needed. Still, the little we saw was above average, surpassing Nicholson's but not quite getting to Ledger's. Another flaw, imo, is the small screentime for Katana and the use of Captain Boomerang. If he hadn't been invited, the gang of baddies wouldn't have missed anything. However, these flaws I mentioned do not outweigh, imo, the fact that this is a good action movie. I just hope that they release an extended edition because some scenes felt as if they needed extra screen time. And we all saw the trailers, so I hope they deliver properly when the DVD/BluRay comes out. Overall: 8/10",1
429,"It is an entertaining movie that perfectly suits audiences, consisting of 12-20 year-old teenagers, who want to have a fun time with their friends. The plot is...well it is not awful, it is just the classic story where some guys want to conquer the world by killing people and turning them into their army. That becomes the reason for some other guys to be gathered so that the world could be saved. The movie also has some of those illogical, badly explained moments, or ""holes in the plot"", that you'll see in many superhero and sci-fi movies. Some characters don't get enough attention and screen time. BUT at least the characters don't defeat their enemies too easily as they did in Star Trek: Beyond, and the actors take their roles seriously and play them quite well. The soundtrack of Suicide Squad is nice. The costumes are pretty cool. Even though the plot is not the best, the whole movie is action-packed and is definitely not boring. So overall, an imperfect, but fun to watch movie, especially if you are a teenager, and you came with friends.",1
431,"This movie makes me very annoyed at Warner Bros because this is the second time they have stuck their hands in a movie and made it worse. Suicide Squad is a very fun movie and very entertaining but i couldn't help but feel disappointed. Firstly the acting and characters were amazing especially Amanda Waller, Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Captain Boomerang was also great, Killer Croc, El Diablo, Katana were also good. The Joker was pretty good but needed more screen time. Some of the action was great and some of it was OK, the cameos were fantastic and made me wanting more. There were plenty of funny moments along the way so it never felt dull. The editing was by far the weakest point, everything just felt out of whack, you can tell scenes were cut from the movie (thanks to WB). The story was average and felt generic. The villain was meh and uninteresting. There is an amazing movie in here somewhere but just didn't show up.",1
436,"I loved this movie myself.  There were a lot of great performances by some great actors and it was fun to see the ""bad guys"" come together for the sake of saving humanity.  Stand out performances were the Harley Quinn, Joker and Dead Shot characters.  No, this ain't your mother's superhero movie. The chaotic style of this movie appeared to have been a turn off for a lot of people, and the ratings suffered because of this.  II think this stylistic approach was an intentional attempt to give the viewer a glimpse into the minds of the characters themselves.  Some of them were seriously deranged after all.  I actually liked it myself and it drove that point home for me. Espresso anyone?",1
437,"Suicide Squad is a film that I think is ok.  Not good, not bad, just ok.  I think it had a lot of good points and a lot of bad points though I am not sure which one outweighs the other.  I have very similar thoughts to this as I do to Batman v Superman.  The real strengths, however, are Harley Quinn and Amander Waller who I think were both perfectly captured in this film.  It doesn’t spend too much time building up The Justice League movie and told its own plot in a decent way, it just missed the mark on a few occasions, most notably in the fact that there was not nearly enough of the Joker in this film, despite how he had been built up in trailers.  If you are a fan of the comics, I would say give it a go although I would sooner recommend seeing Batman Assault on Arkham which is a film that did a much better job with the Suicide Squad.  General movie goers and fans of Batman v Superman should probably check it out although I would urge a word of caution, this film is rated 15 for a reason, this is not a film for little kids.  It’s other big weakness is the fact that the film is incredibly slow initially and doesn’t pick up the pace until the last minute mark and it still doesn’t feel like there is much back story to this DC Universe, but I think that will be fixed in time.",1
438,"Definitely going to watch this again! This movie perfectly balanced so many different characters while making a blast of a movie. Forget the critics, they're crazier than Harley. This is what I've wanted out of a DC movie for years! There are some minor things I think could have been improved upon, but overall, a very solid effort from David Ayers.",1
439,"Suicide Squad was great, but nowhere near perfect. There was no boring parts in the film and as a whole, the experience was above satisfying. Margot Robbie fitted the role perfectly and she was hotter than ever. Jared Leto was good as the joker and it was interesting seeing a new joker. Will Smith was surprisingly good as Deadshot and Joel Kinnaman really shined in this movie. Some other great performances were Cara Delevigne and Jai Courtney. The humor really worked in this DC film and some scenes were probably the best I have ever seen in a superhero film. Also, the music was very fitting in this film. However, the film did have some cons that I did notice. First of all, the trailers gave away much of the film's greatness and some of the good scenes. The film overall was a bit too long, although I liked all of the scenes. However my major problem, which I think is everyone's problem, is the anticipation of the Joker. Story-wise, this film was a mess. The Joker felt like an unnecessary character and just a cash grab. He wasn't essential to this film and the film had way too many characters. Now that's not a problem for me, but when they focus on some characters other than others, that's a problem. The ending wasn't surprising and it was insanely guessable. But, it's a fun movie that teens and adult superhero fans would love to see again. Suicide Squad was definitely worth the IMAX 3D price and it was fun, so I'm looking forward to a sequel. For reference, this was on par with Batman Vs. Superman. (94/100)",1
440,"Is it the best movie of all time? No, was it awesome? Yes, but it certainly had some great problems. Suicide Squad is directed David Ayer who directed Fury, Sabotage, and End of Watch, and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Jai Courtney, Viola Davis, Scott Eastwood, Joel Kinnaman, Common, Jay Hernandez, Adam Beach, and Ben Affleck. That cast may look convincing but don't be fooled, half of the cast were great while the other half crashed and burned. My expectations that I had going to see this film was that Will Smith had to be spot on, just like the trailers, there had to be awesome music in it, and Jared Leto had to at least be better than Jack Nicholson. Most of them were met, but one didn't that really became a big problem for me, Jared Leto was so bad, at first I didn't know what to think of him and immediately that meant I had to go see it again to get a better opinion, it only made it worse and I instantly  hated him, Joker may be weird, but Jared Leto really destroyed the role and it felt like he was the wrong choice for the character. The villain of the film Enchantress played by Cara Delevigne was horribly obnoxious, her role as the main villain of the film watered down with a annoying love story with Joel Kinnaman's character which was always trying to get in the way of everything that was happening. On the other side of all this is Will Smith who had the best backstory of the film, which exceeded my expectations, his character is funny, he's right in the middle of the action while at the same time being one of the anchor's of the film that's keeping it afloat. The other anchor of the film who really hit it out of the park was Margot Robbie who played Harley Quinn, her portrayal was obviously spot on as she captured part of Harley's backstory and her recognizable personality was carefully executed and became another one of the things keeping the film afloat. I was really surprised by the performance of Viola Davis for her portrayal  of Amanda Waller because at first at any hopes of getting any knowledge of her character in the beginning of the film was worthless. Her character was at first very mysterious, she felt a little unpredictable until she turned out to be just as cold-blooded as the rest of the squad. I loved the makeup on Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje who played Killer Croc, but I was hoping to see more of him, unlike everyone else in the squad who had even the least amount of backstory to their characters, I never saw anything for Killer Croc. Jai Courtney who portrayed Captain Boomerang was nothing really worth talking about, he was sort of funny, but really barely stood out of the crowd. I was disappointed with the fact that Adam Beach's portrayal of Slipknot was so minuscule and so worthless that I was always hoping that he would have better meaning for being in the film. Karen Fukuhara who portrays Katana was really cool looking buts kind of doesn't fit in with everyone else as she plays a very silent role compared to everyone else. But, the one thing I never saw coming was Jay Hernandaz who portrayed El Diablo, his character was so awesome, his backstory was emotionally deep, that in the end really was worth all the trouble. And finally the soundtrack, I was rocking in my seat in the theater to every song I knew, even to the songs I didn't know, I wouldn't compare it to Guardians of the Galaxy, but it was really great. Suicide Squad may of had a really crappy villain, and a too weird for my standards portrayal of the Joker, Suicide Squad kept me at the edge of my seat.",1
441,"even though it's a bit trashy and has pacing and blancing issues it still has a lot of great style, excellent performances (by viola davis, jared leto,margot Robbie, will smith and jay hernnandez ), fun plot and well directed action sequences. the film got trashed way harder than it deserve.",1
442,"I don't understand where all these bad review source from. I saw this movie and absolutely loved it, did I feel like there could have been a little more character backstory into these villains? Yes. The movie does focus more upon Deadshot and Harley while some characters are hardly seen more then a couple times. Did I want more from the movie? Yes. But in the good way. I wanted to see more and I'd love to see a sequel. Each villain for the most part gets some screen time to be bad ass, even in situations that seem unlikely. Lots of action, humor and overall left me more than satisfied. At first I heard reviews were poor but after seeing the people's review alongside seeing it myself I begin to question whether critics banded together to weigh down this DC gem.",1
443,"Suicide Squad is far from perfect, but in spite of all its flaws, it's a wildly entertaining movie with a great cast and a healthy dose of humour that was missing from previous DCEU films. Margot Robbie is easily the standout of the cast with her energetic, scene-stealing portrayal of Harley Quinn, though Will Smith and Viola Davis deserve credit too. I may be in the minority here, but I also thought that Jared Leto was much better than people give him credit for. The Joker-Harley dynamic was easily my favourite part of the film. Of course, I still had problems. Not all of the squad were terribly memorable (they could have done the whole movie without Katana and Captain Boomarang) and the main antagonist was underwhelming. But Suicide Squad is still a fun movie with enough humour and action to overcome its flaws. A HUGE step-up from Batman v Superman.",1

447,"Little can be saved in the film. Unfortunately. Will behaving like most of his previous characters and with the worst speeches of the film A soundtrack very good but completely disconnected with the scenes presented. Glad we had Joker (some of it) and Margot Robbie. Warner and DC still has a long way to go.",0
448,Not sure what critics are thinking. this is a great movie with a great cast and stellar acting and a great story. Any comic book movie fan should love this movie never a dull moment great pacing and fun to watch. also it never gets to campy and it dances on the line of going to dark but never really goes there its a perfect balance. unfortunately Leto's take on the joker was not great. but overall it's a bad ass movie Will smith and Margot Robbie Nailed it.,1
449,"This was a fun movie. Not sure why people expect Dark Knight styled, complicated stories with deep plots from everything that comes out these days. The story isn't perfect, but it is enjoyable, the soundtrack is amazing and the characters are fun. Margot Robbie was fantastic and Will Smith didn't embarrass himself either. Definitely worth watching, especially when you're in a mood for something action packed, easily digestible and not too complicated.",1
450,"Suicide Squad is fun! Although I believe it didn't live up to the hype especially concerning the almighty villain and the climax, it still has enough funny moments and action to keep anyone, even those not fans of the comics, entertained.",1
452,"И так понятно думаю, что Marvel - как бы на аудиторию в 6-12 лет, а DC - 13+ Основные различия - в социальном реализме. У Marvel всё красочное, эм, мир детский реальные мысли не допускаются - ничего общего с каким-нибудь глухарём, побегом из тюрьмы, или еще сотней бандитских фильмов. Персонажи 2битные, объяснения почему стал героем или зладеем - посмшещищные и вот чисто детские, вот даунские, тупым надо быть чтобы поставить такую хуйню триггером. У ДС жи вполне всё честно: есть травля, несправедливость, учитывается психология реального мира, психология людей и суициды.Это просто психолонические драми с кучей насилия, об обычных грязных людях из того же фильма Грязь. Они - не в маня-мирке. Там объясняется что эти люди хотят иметь семьи, любовь, детей, и я двачер их прекрасно понимаю. Мне тоже не место в этом мире, меня тоже ненавидят и я хочу убивать. Это драматические фильмы о нас, настоящих людях Маварл - это не боевики, а просто игрушечные айрон мэны в тонах комедий на Малибу, пальмы и красные крутые тачки, блондинки в красных бикини, это некий свой жанр. Детская комдеия-боевик, вот. Простите что постоянно аппелирую к детскости, просто я считаю что это именно жанр этих фильмов. Например ""фильмы для детей, музыка для детей, мультики для детей"".Понятно да, что они уступают на голову обычной фантастике. DC же по сути -обычные боевики. Вот смотришшь - брутальность, кровища, реальная структура мира. Это те же самые Крепкий Орешек, Миссия Невыполнима или Петля Времени. Просто на еще более ахуенном уровне. Из-за хауненый персонажей. Это просто бомжежка для индустрии. Это сумасшедшая разница. Есть просто целая гора харизматичнейших персонажей на десятилетия вперед, чьи истоии можно расскзаать. И разумеется. все вот эти пидер-мены, хищники и рэмбо отсосут рядом с уже легендарным Бэтменом, Джокером, Харли Квин, Эль Диабло Во-первых хочу отметить глубину персонажей и их эпичность,Целостность вселенной - это то как должна была сделат марвел, вот при просмотре у меня постоянно возникали такие вопросы ""а где этот блядь хули он не в этом фильмеп"" Проблема еще в том, что в марвел все картонные и как цирк просто с конями, вне фильмов эти персонажи не живые и не живут. Ибо они РАСКРЫВАЮТ ВСЕ СВОИ КАРТЫ И ЧЕРТЫ ХАРАКТЕРА КАК В ПЕРВЫЙ РАЗ в своей жизни, как на сцене, что выдают все свои приемчики и пытаются всех поразить, а не живут своей жизнью В отряде самоубийц чувтсвовалось что персонажей просто выдернули из их повседневки, сняли отрывок про этот эпизод их жизни, после чего отпустили жить своей жизнью дальше. Все гармонично, я уверен харли сейчас грабит что-то со своим ебырем. Впервые, Джокера кстати, показали не бесполым тупорылым старпером. Интересно, что же его так разъело... Эти фильмы - просто перенеснные из вот Аркхэм серии на большой и экран и с реальными аткерами видосы. Просто ахуенно смотреть на всех этих уже дохуя глубоких и харизматичных персонажей. У марвел такого нет и не будет, - это комедия ебаная, сериал друзья. Ох блядь как эпично блядь их всех видеть вместе аж невериться.Бэтмен к которому мы привыкли видеть только в своих фильмах, про которого посмотрели уже 3 фильма и 4 игры - теперь стал каноничнее и появляется в каждом фильме как ему и положено. Фильмы теперь не кастраты, а полноценны как и видеоигры ,где всё логично. Во-первых хочу отметить актёров DC. Ткаим жестом они как бы утвердились как короли фильмов те, кто стоят на порядок выше всех и нанимают топовых актеров.Это Джаред Лето, о боги как я его обажаю. Он получил Оскара за роль пидора в Далласком Клубе, у него пиздецки ахуенная группа, он играл в Господине НиктоЭто Клах Дрого, второй чувак на которого я равняюсь.Это Вилл Смит, Бэн Аффлек Эль Диабло получился в Отряде - уберканоничном, прямо из Arkham вытащили.Остальные - ну, Харли збс, Джокер... уверен раскроется в Бэтмене 2018.Уилл Смит не понравился. Дэдшот должен быть1. Здоровее и брутальнее2. БелееКиллер крок показался закомплексованным по поводу своего уродства и слабоватым физически.

454,"Critics, you have **** for brains, great movie with great actors, despite the weak story badly told and the film manages to remain interesting and funny, great movie, reached my expectations, unfair criticism once again will take in the ass",1
455,"Suicide Squad is pure garbage in every department.Jared Leto's The Joker is reduced to some tattooed guy with golden teeth and cadenas, at least he is a psychopath and maniac as always but is mostly absent from this movie. Will Smith's Deadshot is a decent and grounded character. Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn is better than I expected, but still not great. Everything and everyone else though is garbage.Who on their right mind, let alone a government, would recruit a band of sentenced criminals, murderers and super villains as disposable assets to conduct black ops and save the world? Yep, that's the idea, even in the comics. As for the movie's plot, don't bother. It's by far the silliest movie plot I have ever experienced.",0
456,"Escuadrón suicida es una de las peliculas mas esperadas de este verano del universo DC, basada en los comics con el mismo nombre, donde un grupo de indeseables criminales , son reclutados por Amanda Waller, una agente sin escrupulos y fria como el hielo, para hacer misiones peligrosas o para hacer el trabajo sucio del país sin implicarse ella o el gobierno de los Estados Unidos. Y como siempre, las criticas contra ella por ser de DC, no han sorprendido, desde el punto de vista de quien escribe, sabia que hiciesen lo que hiciesen le caerian leches, la gran pregunta es...esas leches además recibidas por dicha web, ¿son merecidas?, la respuesta corta es NO. La larga es NO, pero.... Para empezar, el resultado no deja de ser una película de entretenimiento veraniego o blockbuster simplón, como cualquier película de este tipo de superheroes, algo que creo que Ayer se dió cuenta, que debía utilizar la formula Marvel, es decir, película comercial con guión sencillito, pero usando el tono ese mas oscuro y lo utilizó con un resultado, que se podría definir con un “progresa adecuadamente” rozando el “necesita mejorar”. Un guión sencillito como el solo, pocos giros de guión, cameos de rigor, escenas de acción buenas y algún gag resultón, en ese aspecto, la película lo hace bien, pero no lo remata y se queda el film en algo mediocre, anodino y olvidable al salir del cine, como todas estas pelis de superheroes. Antes de empezar a leerle la cartilla primero destacamos lo positivo del film, los personajes principales me han gustado, los protagonistas del film son Deadshot y Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller y el Joker en sus pocas escenas,son los amos de la función y Will Smith emana carisma por todos sus poros, sorprende el tono y el respeto al material hasta cierto momento del film, sorprende la acción del film, muy bien hecha y elaborada, y chapó el guiño a Alex Ross, esos matices hacen a la película encantadora. Pero, la película tiene una serie de defectos, uno de los que mas me tocaba la narices es el doblaje del Joker...ES UNA PUTISIMA MIERDA, Habla como el de ESH UNA FIESHTA, ¿en serio? Os habéis cargado al Joker con ese doblaje de mierda. Y los personajes, restantes muy desdibujados y desarrollados pobremente, Capitán Boomerang esta fatal metido y muy precipitado y Slipknot para lo que hace, podíais haberoslo ahorrado. El cacareado montaje, es el gran problema del film, a ver entiendo el rollo Snatch para darle ese tono “malote” o gamberril, Snatch o los films de Ritchie son un referente de ese tipo de ideas y movidas visuales, ese tipo de rollo de montaje con Flashbacks y escenas potentes, no le veo mal ahí. Pero al igual que le pasaba a Batman v Superman, el montaje se nota, muchos saltos, algunos momentos se toman su tiempo y de repente, se pone a toda leche, todo precipitado y no sabes que ha pasado, un problema bastante critico, que de ahí han venido las leches. Recomendaría muchisimo que los señores de Warner dejen un poco de libertad o se aclaren, porque así lo que hacen es fastidiar películas, con mucho potencial en productos mediocres o fallidos. En conclusión, un film con mucho potencial, desaprovechado y caído a las garras de la mediocridad, mas absoluta. Esperemos que saquen un directors cut, con la versión de Ayer, y podamos ver su verdadera visión y ver...quien tenía razón, si Ayer o Warner.",1
457,"I really loved this movie. But I've seen another case of persecution against DC movies... Characters are great, music is amazing, the battle scenes are breathtaking! Plot failures do exists, but what movie is perfect?Of course BvS is too way better!",1

459,"It's not as bad as everyone's saying. But there are some real errors in the movie, the reason why the witch decided to become a villain and destroy humans is just dumb. The way El Diablo dies is super what the F****, and the way the witch's brother gets killed is the dumbest thing ever.",1
463,"Not like the comic-book at all.IF your going into this movie, thinking your going to get what you've seen in the comic books? Boy! will you will be disappointed. But IF you go in, with very low expectations, however. You'll be pleasantly surprised:) Will Smith was really good as DeadShot and Margot Robbie was good as Harley Quinn. And Viola Davis was really good as Amanda Waller. Now it was recently learned , that this movie was edited together horribly. And yes that can make world of difference, In the final movie.  I have listened to a lot of people complain as to what they hated? But I have yet to hear , what they liked about Suicide Squad. Besides , the actors. It was loud and it was dumb , and it was fun:) Kinda like the first TMNT.  DC doesn't have the best track record , when it comes to comic book movies either. No, Marvel owns that title. But DC is best on the small screen, from the DC TV shows to movies like Batman Assault on Arkham. But at the same time, Marvel could make a bad live action movie and, it could easily be flipped.  So IF you go into Suicide Squad , not over hyped? Then you'll enjoy it , for what it is. A Will Smith movie;) Peace Out!",1
464,"It is really not a great movie that changes the industry, but it is so fun to watch! Yeah, there are a lot of strange moments, but where you are watching movie you don't really see them. Also, there is many beautiful and interesting scenes, especially good is the scene at the bar, and what happened after it. About characters, i think film crew tried to tell us more about each character, but they did not have much time. Croc, Slipknot and Boomerang was like - ""i do not know why i am here!"". To my mind Deadshot, Harley and El Diablo are very cool, all of them surprised me. Action scenes are simple and nice, final fight was a little bit stupid, but it's so impressing. The music was very good too! I was just delighted. Eventually, it is very cool and funny movie, tht you won't forget a very long time!",1
466,"Ok, So im not a arthouse student and i dont know the first thing about anything involving film making. Yet I dont understand why this movie gets the hate that its been getting. Its not a brillant movie its no inception or citzen cain. Yet its an enjoyable comic book movie. Every actor hits their role with perfection (1 exception I will get to it) Margot Robbie is a amazing Harleyquinn,Will smith plays a very good grounded character as Deadshot and the entire supporting cast is good ( I have fun quoting killer croc in this movie dont judge). Now the one actor that i didint A. See enough of. And B. Dont like the way his character is written. Is Jared Letos Joker. Im not a big fan of gangbanger joker and honestly he seems like he is a bit obsessed with harley ( hes not this way in the comics its more of a domestic abuse story in the comics) but i dont hate it im just not a massive fan of it. On another note the humor hit me and my buddy i was watching the movie with quite well. Without spoiling the plot the tension was pretty high with the big baddie of the film. All and all if you like comic books and the batman comic villans you will most likely enjoy this movie i give it a 8/10",1
467,"Suicide Squad plays like a comic book in motion, which interestingly enough makes it the most unique out of all other comic book movies that came before it. The presentation of the characters and their interactions are what make this film work in an plot which we have seen again and again (Bad guy goes to a place to build a weapon and take over the world) but following the characters overwhelms any negative feeling I have over a very familiar plot. Unquestionably Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot are the main focus of this ensemble cast. However the other members of the Suicide Squad have chances to shine as well. The performances for the this movie are top notch, proving entertaining, heart breaking, and badass fun. While this film certainly isn't one of the best Comic book movies ever, it a far cry from deserving the negative criticism it has gotten. Here's to hopefully a sequel.",1
468,"This movie is by no means perfect. If the editing in Batman V Superman looked like it was done by someone in a Film 1010 class, than this movie looks like it was edited by someone who passed Film 1530. So the editing is better but it's still cringe worthy. Between the strange tone changes that are awkward this movie is a lot of fun. Deadshot is awesome, Harley is a blast (the source of the tone changes), Waller is terrifying, and all of the other characters have very small moments and are kind of just there with some pizzazz. I don't think that this should have been a save the world movie, I think that they should have been sent on a shady government job under the radar. This movie is rough and no that great, but it's a lot of fun!",1
469,"Good film, thoughroughly enjoyed it. A lot of back stories to be told, and explained well. So many parts of this film could have been elaborated on in their own films, but that would have required 20 hours worth of films to get to this point, this could launch spin offs for other characters, but as they don't know each other at this point, I thought it worked that we just had an brief history of each character so far",1
470,"With the all the crazy ""controversy"" about about the ratings/reviews of this movie I decided to watch Suicide Squad and guess what? The movie is great! For a movie that introduced so many characters, I liked all of them. The one actress who surprised me the most was Cara Delevingne as The Enchantress. Cara may be new to the acting scene, but she actually looked and acted terrifyingly well. Despite this movie being about villains teaming up to be heroes, it does have a fair amount of heartfelt moments. It shows that even criminals have emotions and heart. This movie is by no means perfect. It has a few flaws but they don't take away too much from the experience. I got my moneys worth seeing Suicide Squad. If you're a comic book fan, go see it. It shows that when the world is in danger, even bad guys can put their differences and egos aside to work for a good cause.",1
471,I loved it. It was a new and unique and not recycled garbage that has been going on lately. Margot Robbie was awesome and i would highly recommend this to anyone,1
472,"Whilst not being the greatest movie of all time this movie had some decent moments. The action scenes and comedic elements were when the movie was at its best. That said i feel like the following things detracted from the overall presentation.-The Joker - yes the Joker - he's little more than a supporting character and ultimately the performance was not as great as the hype around it. I feel like he could have just had a role in a couple of scenes as the rest of the performance and the narrative elements with him in are just weak elsewhere - he needed to be in there somewhere but he never truly finds a place in this movie.- Captain Boomerang - Weak - ultimately his character does little and he could have just as easily been cut if it wasn't for the minor cameo to help build up the DC universe. Every second he was on screen i was bored.-Killer Croc - not enough of him, his character was great at points and i would love to see him have seen some more skull cracking moments.-The bad guys - What even happened to the army of them in the end did they all just give up did they return to normal lives - it could easily have been anything else other than what it was. - I'd take aliens over this.- Navy seal guy gets a pass just barely from me as his character wasn't notable for much but filled his role adequately and got out of the way to see the characters just enough to avoid detracting from the film. The acting itself was fine but as a character him and katana are just kinda there. But there was some good moments and if you ignore what narrative there is and focus on the action and the more notable performances it'll be more enjoyable all around.",1
473,"Seriously the hells wrong with you critics.This movie was so much fun from start to end.Margot Robbie was born to play Harley Quinn.I liked every single one of the characters except for one which I will mention later.Although all members of the squad didn't had as much screen time as Harley or Deadshot, each one had their moments and each made me laugh in their own scenes.Jared Leto is so good as the Joker.I wish Warner Bros didn't cut his scenes out of the final product.I think that if we see more of him in the future he will become my favorite Joker actor.Now for a list of Pros and Cons:PROS:-The Suicide Squad itself.Every member has a purpose and personality-Rick flags relation with Deadshot-Amanda Waller-The Joker-The soundtrack-The visuals-The cameos of Batman and ??(don't want to spoil it)-The jokes.This movie made me laugh so may times CONS:-The villain.While the character is interesting it is not memorable.There are two villains one directly doesn't speak and the other only dances to create a machine or something.-The cut scenes.It is obvious that some scenes are missing, mostly of the Joker.I would want to see them in a special blu ray but for now it makes me angry that they decided to cut some scenes that may have changed some aspects of the movie.Who knows-The bar scene.It is a good scene, especially because we see the squad defeated and are ready to give up.We have the backstory of one of the members and some funny jokes(especially Killer Croc).The problem is that this scenes seems so rushed.The members change their mind of ending the mission just like that.I don't now I liked it but I thing it was rushed i don't know. Overall i think that Suicide Squad doesn't deserve all the ate its getting.It is the most fun I had with a movie this year and I can't wait to see whats next.I just hope there is a sequel and that Warner Bros doesn't decide to stop  with this just because of bad critics.We will have a Harley Quinn solo film so I guess they still want to continue with villain movies.And to end this I just want to say to Mick Lasalle a special **** you.How can you give this a 0.I respect your decision if you didn't like this movie but you are telling me that you didn't like anything?Wow.What kind of person put a 0 score to a movie?",1
474,"This is the first superhero movie (eh...villiain?) that I dozed off.The plot is very messy in my oponion. The characters are indeed interesting and have room to develop but they were not explored and soon faded into the background. The antagonist choice is also weird. Why do you have a group full of mortals that have only super skills like throwing or shooting but doesn't have any superpower (except Diablo, his power is pretty cool) going up against a powerful, full of magic villian? Don't you need at least a few of those who have superpower to deal with that? I think it will be more interesting if they busting the whole org of mafia or some underworld gangs in my oponion. The humour is quite alright I guess. But some are a little bit cringy. And again, the plot is very messy. After watching this movie, I feel very conflicted whether it is meh or just bad. But one thing I would admit though, DC's PR team is incredibly good. They already sold out the movie even before it released. They made awesome trailers, tons of promotion works and successfully make everyone hype as f. Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, even Marvel's PR team seems useless compared to them. So +1 to DC's PR team.",0
475,"I loved this movie. It was really fun to watch and I never felt like it was slow anywhere. Sure it did have its ridiculous moments and Heath Ledger still carries Joker the best. But all in all, this is a great movie sans some bits which can be overlooked really.",1
477,"Within the first five minutes of this movie you can already tell that it is going to be a shambled mess, which is disheartening, because I had high hopes for this movie at one point. For me, the most glaring problem with this film is its abundance of characters juxtaposed with little to no characterization for much of the cast.",0
478,"This is the classic ""the other guys"" storyline, which also does a fantastic job in establishing character relationships which will undoubtedly prove to be hugely important later on down the line.  I thought they did a fantastic job introducing the new Joker and HQ, filming from the villains point of view, and showing glimpses into character motivation and back stories. This Suicide Squad placement in this DC series is important in that it clearly establishes the ""failed attempt"" by the government to provide a solution to what Waller terms as the ""Metahuman"" problem.  At the end of it all, the operation was a huge failure (in which they must clean up a mess made by the government (Waller/Flagg) and successfully sets up a need for a good guy team instead...enter Justice League. Now, this movie was by no means meant to be a standalone, and where I see the critics failing miserably in their critiques is by judging this movie by the main plot line itself, and not feeling satisfied with the individual character developments.  Its crazy I know, why would anyone care so much about a movie plots and robust character development?  Wait, just hear me out on this one.... The main plot in Suicide Squad was not as important to the whole progression of the movie, or to the DC universe expansion; rather was meant to serve as merely a vehicle to give a reason for these particular characters to be forced to work together in a world where they normally would not have.  The more important aspects to this movie were the introduction of characters and their interactions, their motivations, back-stories, struggles, character alignment (i.e. Flagg/Lawton) and to setup additional DC films and not to spend too much time concentrating on anyone specifically - I somehow don't think that DeadShot and Batman are finished as Lawton (DeadShot) states he has unfinished business in Gotham, and if anyone thinks that the relationship between HQ and the Joker isn't hugely important, whether it shows his/her fatal flaw or his motivation for actions (or reasons for a potential huge fall in later movies) must have fallen asleep during the film.  How the main plot holds together or even the storyline of the main plot itself in this instance doesn't matter...I mean even though I'm a huge fan I quickly recognized the main plot to be weak (the Witch and her bro) until I saw what I believed the movie makers were trying to accomplish.  The important aspects were to show what makes these guys tick, recognize the individual motivations pushing characters to make certain decisions as well as certain mistakes...love was a huge motivator in this movie (HQ/Joker - Flagg/Moon - DeadShot/daughter), and to setup for other installments. By no way am I likening this movie to Shakespeare, but have you read his storylines...they're ridiculous if you try to apply them to real life.  However, Shakespeare wasn't trying to write Danielle Steele love novels nor Michael Creighton action novels.  his art captured the complexity of the human condition, motivations, humor, strengths and weaknesses and the plot by itself was less important than the character interactions and underlying theme (i.e. greed, ambition, love, jealousy, revenge, honor, loyalty, etc.). Things are not black/white and perspectives will vary depending on where you are standing...or being forced to stand in the case of these ""bad guys"".  This perspective given from the bad guys point of view was perfect and everyone in the audience was empathetic to their struggles/past histories and wanted these guys to win by the end of the movie...even though we have grown up with the comics only seeing these characters as only villians.",1
479,"I have had a bone to pick with DC regarding Man of Steel and BvS. There is something about their interpretation of Superman that makes my blood boil. So, I was actually looking forward to Suicide Squad. It promised to be irreverent, mad and fun. My heart sank reading the critic reviews, but being a DC fan, sent up a prayer and went ahead to see the movie anyway. Boy, am I glad, I did.First off, it isn't art. It isn't a ""good"" movie with all the right words, with all the right camera and editing techniques and a brilliant script.It is, what we would in India call, a good, old-fashioned 'masala' film. It is made for the fan. So it is fun, thrilling with some fabulous laugh-out-loud moments. I loved the soundtrack. It was great seeing characters you had read as a child, come alive on screen. And I was surprised, considering DC has done a complete number on Supe (Boy Scout no more!). It was a roller coaster. Margot Robbie and Will Smith were great (I admit, I squealed a bit when Deadshot came on screen), as I did with Diablo towards the end (and with the Flash cameo). I hated Amanda Waller (read Viola Davis was brilliant) and Jared Leto did fab as the Joker. In all, a great film to unwind to and enjoy. Sure there is a lot that could have been better, especially the big bad. Waller seemed a far more formidable big bad than Enchantress. Oh well.In all, a great kick-off point, I think, to what could (with a solid storyline) lead to a solid sequel.A good time to address the whole critics vs fans bit maybe: The critics have set the bar really high, which is great. That means WB and DC will have to work far, far harder now to give us truly fabulous films. As fans we deserve the best. Suicide Squad wasn't the best. What it was though was good fun that kept me glued to my chair.",1
480,"Что мы ждпли от отряда самоубийц? Мы ждали интересного и динамичного фильма который должен был стать фильмом года! Но а получили менее интересный, но все равно хороший фильм. К сожалению в фильме показали не все крутые моменты, ну а персонажи вообще иногда говорят много ненужного.. В целом фильм довольно интересный, и после его просмотра у вас останутся смешаные впечатления..",1
481,"I love these dolts on here who say their was no plot or holes in the plot.The plot was very clear from the beginning.In fact you know the plot before you even go see it...How hard is it to understand they get bad guys to fight with them to vanquish the worse bad guys..Not that difficult...I just watched the movie this afternoon.I thought it was quite good and MOSTLY ..it was entertaining...IT IS A MARVEL comic book movie.If you are looking for War and Peace or a romantic comedy then stay home.If you enjoy movies like ""SIN CITY""..you will enjoy this.........",1
482,"The critics prepared me for disappointment with this movie, but I actually really enjoyed it. Will Smith killed it (pun intended) as Deadshot. The only complaints I have are A.) I didn't like Jared Leto as the Joker, and B.) They played up Joker as an important part of the story, but he only had about 7 minutes of screentime.",1
483,"Honestly, This movie isn't bad as people make it out to be. Some may say it's okay, or others say it's good, but I wouldn't say it was a masterpiece. It was GREAT. Great being more positive than good, I don't see why others hate it so much including the critics. Here's my review: Suicide Squad has an decent introduction. It introduces the cast and their profiles. It was great to see their backstories and how their prison life is which is very realistic. I loved every moment of it, But I had to cringe a bit at some lines. Here is the delivery, it's a PG-13 movie so of course some lines weren't that strong. I really have to crook my head to the side at this one line... ""Lady, you're evil!"" - Deadshot. That's odd, couldn't it have been written a little more interesting? The characters come off as very fun people but hesitant of doing bad things when they are criminals we are watching from criminals point of view. Not Batman. Seeing as to how Deadshot could of killed Harley to see his daughter again, He would of done it. But actually he didn't. Neither of them established they were friends before that point either, Meaning he had no reason or hesitance to shoot. He's a hitman right? The pacing and the scenes were structured out of place. Not saying there was no story at all though, The story was interesting unlike many others viewed. Generic? It was still likeable. The squad are fighting against the enchantress army which is actually nice to watch. The Action was decent, but nothing over the top. I think if we seen more fighting it'd be great. But... The other characters aside from Deadshot, Harley Quinn, El Diablo don't get many lines or backstory or scenes which I'd like to see. Of course you can't fit that in one movie. I think if they just stuck with Deadshot's story with minor references from the other villians and less flashbacky more story focused with action many people will like this movie more. The movie could of had more time to focus on pacing as well if they weren't trying to crush every person's backstory in which didn't fit at all. But overall. It's a likeable fun summer movie. Why does it deserve any lower than a 5? It's not that bad at all. The directors cut will be a thing to see as well which you may like better.",1
484,"I loved this movie. Apart from Dead Pool, this was the best comic book movie since the Bat Man trilogy in my opinion. Did a good job explaining who the characters are, so anyone not in the loop with DC shouldn't have been lost. The plot was fine, a little corny, but perfectly acceptable. Special effects on point. Acting, for the most part, on point. Costumes on point.  Only thing that bothered me was the watering down the Harley/Joker relationship. Real shame the political correctness of Hollywood made them cut out the abuse scenes, because that's a huge aspect of their twisted relationship. Hurry and go see this on the big screen. I've seen it twice and loved every minute.",1
485,Don't be discouraged by critic reviews. Its not that bad. Its much better than Deadpool in terms  character development and story telling. Of course there a lot could be inproved but considering the running time there is only so much you can cram in. The main disappointing aspect was Joker was barely in the film. He is almost irrelevant. Boss character was also cliche. But fun and funny overall. Will and Margot did fantastic job. Ts not a film to watch if you are looking for a complex story.,1
486,"Overall, The movie its Great, Its a **** YOU to Heroes Movies + Casting was Great, also Mr Leto did an amazing job as Joker, for those who don't know that was the GANGSTER JOKER ! Not the Sociopath (Heath's Joker) Nice movie  !",1
487,it was one of the best movies in dc extended universe the only thing that was bad that the joker appear for a short time jared leto was amazing he cant compare to heath but that unfair to leto he dosent appear in the movie only for 4 minutes,1
488,"A step in the right direction for DC movies with fun characters, an interesting plot, a great performances by A grade actors. Definitely better than Batman v Superman.",1
489,"This movie made me pee my pants. Twice. Not saying this is a good thing or a bad thing, but they both happened within five minutes of one another. Maybe it was because I didn't go before I went to the theaters, or maybe because I consumed too much sprite. I cried during the movie when a giant scorpion came out of the sky and killed my entire family. Those were tears of joy. It started out slow, but really picked up as soon as Super Mario showed up and gave me a pizza. That made me really like the movie. I give it 2 bagels;",1
490,"Well.... it ain't great. There are too many flashbacks, too many unearned character about-faces and too little that is original or interesting in the final battle. But while it may not be the superhero film we deserve, Suicide Squad is the superhero film we need right now. Mainly this is because of the characters are just so different from the well worn superhero stereotypes we have all seen too many times. There are no Amazon princesses in Suicide Squad, no superpowered aliens, no billionaire playboy philanthropists. There are just a bunch of hard-working, down to earth gangstas, assassins and crazy people. Their idea of high style is a pimp hat or pair of eight inch heels. This group probably could not even get to Midway City without government help----- which consists, appropriately, of an ancient helicopter with one of the dumbest pilots in the world. These characters---and the good performances by the main cast---- carry the film pretty well up to the final fight which, honestly, was underwhelming. But before that, the film is entertaining and perfectly watchable. I don't understand complaints about Suicide Squad being ""choppy"" or ""a mess"". I found it a perfectly lucid story. It's not a *great* story, for reasons I have stated above. But it is perfectly understandable. Complaints about the Joker not being in the movie enough are misplaced------ this is not a story about him. Suicide Squad is about Harley Quinn and the other members of the Squad. The Joker appears only as her boyfriend. He is not a villain here or even a Shakespearean jester. He is Harley's Byronic hero. For that, his screen time is perfect. I did not care for the songs, which are too on-the-nose.",1
491,"This movie is the most fun waste of potential I've ever seen. On the one hand, it is noticeable that the former idea of this movie was dumbed down to reach a wider audience, trying so hard to make us sympathise with the ""bad guys"" that they never felt like bad guys at all. What's also a real shame is how little of Jared Leto's Joker we get after all the hype he was getting, having most of his scenes cut to make him more of a Prince Charming than the Clown Prince of Crime we expected (and Jared Leto seems to be the one that's most pissed about it). But, with all it's problems, I'd be lying if I didn't admit I had a great time watching this film. What you get in the end is a very exciting movie with an amazing cast. We have the best Will Smith role in years and Margot Robbie steals the show on every scene she is in. It's the interaction between the characters that make this movie work and had me wanting to watch more of each individual. So despise my cold mind reminding me of it's many structural problems and missed opportunities, I have to go with my heart and recommend this movie as a very entertaining experience that will have you hoping to see this characters back on the screen.",1
492,"The film was entertaining but wasn't what I expected from such a great cast,  just like batman vs superman,  this film was just a setup for the justice league film",1
493,"Everyone is a critic..hey even me.  This movie was more of an origin movie for Harley Quinn than a team based movie, and hey I am ok with that.  I think Margot Robbie deserved even more screen time than she received.  She steals the show.  Jared Leto's Joker would be asked by Heath Ledger's Joker ""Why So Serious?""!  I think he was more psycho and not enough Play with his food kind of guy.  I would have enjoyed it so much more if instead of just shooting or blowing up people he played with their minds first and when they thought he was joking about killing them, he then kills them...paying off with the killing joke.  Watch this movie it is good.  Don't listen to the Haters, they had bad childhoods.",1
494,"The critics have got this wrong! How can this movie be worse than Sausage Party I have no idea.Yes, DC is rushing as fast as possible to Justice League withouttaking the time that Marvel did to make their mistakes and thenlearn to get things right. But this films is a step in the rightdirection. Suicide Squad brings back the Comic in the DC films universe. Whilethe Christopher Nolan Dark Knight films did an excellent job bringthe Batman story back for adults, not everything has to be dark andbrooding. Jared Leto's performance as the Joker brings that characterto life as a modern day gangster. Sinister drips off of his portrayalwhenever he is on screen. The colors, sound editing, and cinematographygive you an exhilarating ride through the pages of some of DC's mostunderplayed characters. If you are a comics fan go see this film. Hopefully DC films willcontinue to adjust their formula going toward Justice League, but thismovie moves in the right direction.",1
495,"Do we really needed another ""the critic doesn't know what they are talking about"" moment?Apparently we did. The movie is far from perfect, as almost any movie is anyway, but it is as enjoyable as I expected stepping in the theatre! Margot Robbie was AWESOME, the real MVP of the movie, she brought Harley to life! Will Smith was also fantastic as Deadshot and El Diablo also work'd imho, loved the character. Last but not least, Jared Leto! I had some serious doubts about him but man, I was so wrong. He gave us a different, modernized, Joker and yeah, in my opinion it worked out! Do you honestly see the awesomely serious Heath Ledger Joker is this funny mess? Nope. This Joker instead is cohesive with the movie tone! I also liked that he didn't steal the movie, this wasn't supposed to be a Joker movie after all, those 15 minutes felt exactly right. Honorable mention goes to Enchantress and Batman. I honestly didn't know much about Cara Delevigne character but it intrigued me: the origin story, the art, the powers, the rendering .... Really well done! Batman appearences were short but spectacular, the first one was just awesome, you could feel the 'Ohhh's in the audience. Now the ""meh"" parts:- The pacing felt strange at times and some scenes were too blacked out.- Some characters felt underdeveloped, Cpt. Boomerang and Katana got thier moments but they could have been better, Killer Croc wasn't really funny even when he tried. Slipknot? Rofl.- Joel Kinnaman character was forgettable. Probably not the correct actor choice?- Viola Davis .... Yeah, meh. I didn't feel neither her or her character. Bad.- The brotherly thing was avoidable and the ending was a bit disappointing. One last note. My wife, who usually dislikes superhero movies, really liked this one. Thanks WB :D",1
496,What do you expect from a comic book movie? Suicide Squad meets all these expectations. Have fun watching the film with critics saying not empty    Tell the film to the cinema to watch it,1
497,"I seriously feel like I was watching a different movie than these ""critics"", I guess Disney's money goes far in the ratings business. Amazing cast and great performances by Margot Robbie, Will Smith and especially Jarred Leto, I guess everyone forgot what kind of shoes he had to fill and keep in mind this DC Universe needs a vibrant Joker with chemistry with Harley and energy to keep ""Bats"" on his tail. Crybabies go watch your boring Avengers movies, I fell asleep through the last one.",1
498,"I really enjoyed this film.  It was fun, engaging and Will Smith was as always brilliant, as were the vast majority of the cast.  I understand why it was changed because Batman v Superman sucked to a whole new level of suckiness but I would have loved to have seen it before it was edited to this version.  I loved the characters, the way it was presented and the tie-ins and I suppose really my only negatives are that there was never any real suspense or tension built and the characters switched to 'traditional' good guys all to quickly without any major conflict between them.  I'd have been happy to have this whole film an hou longer with this content in but it was still a kick ass film and I will be watching it again.  And hoping for a directors cut version!",1
499,"This rating is on the basis of having not seen the trailers. If you are annoyed with trailers showing you the best parts of a movie, then Suicide Squad will be annoying. This film is carried by Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis. Joker is barely in the film. He's okay when he's in the movie, but not at all worth the hype. There is an interesting choice in this movie with a Batman and Harley Quinn scene that I think was genius and changes the dynamic of both characters. Enchantress was okay, until there is a scene where she is club dancing in front of flashy lights.  Even with that laughable villain, this movie works, so that's saying something.",1
500,just greattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt,1
501,"Besides the thin plot and plot holes, the move is great. The soundtrack is awesome and the comic book-like aesthetic (especially at the beginning) is whimsical and fun. I enjoyed the actors' performances, especially those of Will Smith and Margot Robbie. I thought that Robbie acted out Harley Quinn's histrionic-esque personality very well and Smith, who I wasn't expecting much from, made for a pretty hard-core Deadshot. Despite what some may say, I found that I quite like Jared Leto's take on the Joker and his romance with Harley Quinn.",1
502,"this film was very intriguing it had a comedic and interesting array of iconic characters. The best aspect of this film was Margot Robbie's depiction and overall performance of Harley quinn was very memorable, humorerss  and physoctic which is heavily necessary when your performing this category of character. This is pure evidence that Robbie is expendable and is adapted to her character swiftly. Will smith provided a unexpected satisfactory perfomance of the merciless hitman Deadshot. a questionable character in this film was the joker ( This is my own personal opinion),Jared Leto evidently gave a satisfactory depiction of the joker but the impression i received which i found disappointing was that Leto's joker was relatable to a organized crime boss(such as the mafia).Instead of typically being the frenzied madman that we all(im assuming 'all') know and love, we were provided an intimidating, intense joker. This entire statement  is highly evident as The joker(IM NOT SPOILING) owns a strip club and has a loyal gang of henchman.My entire statement could potentially be false as there is a highly irritating and popular flaw ..... Jared leto's deleted scenes( The flaw lies about the quantity of them!!!!!!! The plot was very simplistic and disappointing. But the soundtrack was partly good. overall a mediocre film with plenty of improvements to be made in a (unfortunately) lot of aspects..",1
503,"Really enjoyable Movie. Some little gaps between here and there, but its definitely not the worst movie of the year, either the best. Suicide Squad is not the best movie from Dc, but they can do something with it.",1
504,"I have to say many people and critics are being silly! This movie was great. Many say that none could beat the joker and batman of Christopher Nolan's Trilogy. I myself love The Dark Knight, but I gotta say you can't say this was bad. It had more in common with the comics than Nolan's batman and joker. Jared Leto, Margot Robbie and Will Smith were exquisite. Some others complain that the movie was clumsy and messy. That was intentional; the director was pointing out how messy and mixed up the squad was.",1
506,"A fun and colorful superhero film that turns villains into heroes, with a unique cast of characters and the movie overall has it's ups and downs. One of the downs was the Joker: despite the psychotic tattooed clown having the stylish look and insane personality, he didn't get as much screen time as he deserves despite Jared Leto putting a lot of effort into the role. Though, characters like Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) were well portrayed.",1
507,"Suicide Squad is a beacon of light shining through the dumpster fire of a year that 2016 was. In a movie industry filled with dozens of superhero movies competing to be the summer blockbuster, it is refreshing to finally get a movie about the villains. Although they do bad stuff, they are people with stories that deserve to be explored. But this movie was not some mediocre first attempt at exploring a villain’s story, it was a beautifully executed film about a whole cast of characters. This movie had a lot it was trying to balance in its fairly short 2 hour runtime. It had to develop a history for all of characters, start and resolve the conflict with Enchantress, while trying to balance elements of being both a drama and a comedy. Starting with character development, DC chooses to emphasize two of the villains, Deadshot and Harley. Harley Quinn is fully developed from how she meets the Joker, how they get separated because of “Batsy”, and how they get reunited later in the movie. An additional bonus is how hot Margot Robbie is as Harley Quinn. There is no shortage of sex appeal in this movie from Harley to Enchantress, to even Katana (can we take a moment to appreciate this win for diversity in Hollywood). Almost every frame is filled with some serious eye candy, not to mention the great shots of Harley throughout the movie. Deadshot is also well developed in this movie, with DC choosing to focus on his relationship with his daughter and uses it to explain why he does what he does (assassinate people). He wants to provide for his daughter in whatever way he can, but he also feels the regret of doing such villainous acts while trying to be a good example for his daughter. While these two characters are the main focus, everyone else has a rich history that is told throughout the story. For instance El Diablo who is scared to use his abilities to harm anyone. That is, until my favorite scene [MINOR SPOILER ALERT] a bar scene where all the characters feel disheartened and stop at a bar that is on their way to Enchantress. They sit and discuss what's on their mind; El Diablo explains his fear, and is liberated allowing him to get past his fear. This scene is an excellent way to develop all the characters and grow their bond. Captain Boomerang is another character who is just all around hilarious. From his recurring Pink Unicorn fetish joke to his constant failed attempts to hit on Katana, his comic relief gives me life. All this is not to mention the Batman and Flash cameos that are hype af. We can’t talk about the characters without talking about the soundtrack of this film. It is literally fantastic. Every pre-existing song that is used just fits with the scene so well. But where the soundtrack really shines is all the original songs recorded. Sucker for Pain is an absolute banger, Bohemian Rhapsody is haunting, and Heathens is actually Grammy nominated (https: // goo. gl / SRV0Sq). The plot is great as we watch this dysfunctional team of misfits grow together. It is filled with great running jokes and funny one-liners. And the ending is great, when they stop Enchantress, while leaving June Moone alive for her husband, and they all go back to prison waiting for their next assignment, but Joker comes to break Harley out. Suicide Squad 2 honestly can not come fast enough. I am waiting on the edge of my seat for where this wiley crew will go next.",1
508,"I had such an amazing time with Suicide Squad. An amazing 2 hours of action packed mayhem. The movie can be a mess, at times but its ultimately a popcorn film and it succeeds in being a popcorn film.",1
509,"This movie is one of the worst pieces of **** I've seen in my life. People who liked it are either blind or just stupid fanboys. We shouldn't accept this kind of horrible mess of a movie, because it's an insult and a disgrace to human evolution. For that, I give this movie a solid 10/10. BTW it's a joke ;)",1
510,"Suicide isn't bad, people just overhyped it. I went in looking at reviews, thinking it would be bad, i was wrong, so wrong. IT is actually a pretty decent movie.",1
511,I loved it because its a great film with many correct Dc Comics mentions.I Have watched it many times without getting bored. Whoever didn't give this movie a 10/10 will rot in Hell,1
512,"Not so good film as I wanted. The plot is quite boring and clichéd, locations shown are only a few. But, damn, these actors are cool (or almost all). Acting is one of the best among those films that I watched. No doubt the process was enjoyable for them.",1
513,The movie was amazing im a huge fan of the joker and harley quinn and will smith is the greatest actor ever. I do believe however that if you decided to make a #2 Johnny Depp is a amazing actor that perfects every movie he is in. It would be a award winning movie,1
514,"Besides from a couple good performances, Suicide Squad was a disaster! David Ayer is about as horrible as a person as he is a filmmaker. The movie is poorly shot, and the action scenes are all bland. There are a lot of useless characters, and arcs that are underdeveloped. I admire Jared Leto for not being like Heath Ledger, because that would be really easy. He gets almost no screen time, and isn't even the main villain, and his dialog is horrible. Suicide Squad is one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen.",0
515,"TBH, there is stuff to like about Suicide Squad. Jared Leto's Joker is flat-out awesome - he absolutely kills it during the few minutes he's on screen. The beginning where we seen information about each member of the squad was really cool, and really got my hopes up for the rest of the movie. Will Smith was good, (is he ever not good?) but had some really stupid lines. I don't know why, but I really like Captain Boomerang - another good character who doesn't have enough screen time  Pretty much everything else about this movie was either meh or terrible. I hated Harley Quin and the flame guy - can't really pinpoint a specific reason. The villain was terrible, with a laughably terrible line near the climax of the movie. All in all, a weak movie with too few redeeming properties.",0
517,"What an absolute waste of time.  You are better off watching something else.   There are only two things good about this movie, Will Smiths acting and Margot Robbie's looks.   Everything else is pure drivel.",0
519,Suicide Squad was a fun movie. It wasn't perfect and had a pretty rote villain but entertained well through it's run time. Harley Quinn and the Joker were particularly fun. Mercifully better than Superman VS Batman.,1
520,"Given all the negative reviews, I went into watching this thinking it would be a below average superhero movie.  I thought it fun, well-paced, well-cast, and well-acted.  Will Smith and Marot Robbie were great.",1
524,"The movie is tailor made so incredibly manipulative so that people want to like it, despite it being nothing but an empty shell of broken promises and lies. So much that once you see through the veil, the whole thing is nothing but a disgusting travesty and a ridiculous shadow of all the parts it is made from. Since the only good things about it have nothing to do with the movie itself, the result is just a waste of time.",0
525,"The first 30 mins of the movie was actually good! it introduced all the characters, made a good intro for the story and then the movie goes bad. It gets boring and long and when you watch the ending? You cant  believe how bad the movie really is!",0
529,"From the very beginning of the film, the movie Suicide Squad feels very rushed, not leaving enough time for the Character development we so desperately craved, and this rushed tempo continues throughout. Suicide Squad also faces many tone issues, seemingly having no clue how to take itself. On top of this, you can tell that there were many scenes that were cut from the film, leaving parts of it feeling quite choppy, and leaving the audience in a state of confusion. All of that being said, I still found myself enjoying the film quite a bit. The characters were all very likeable and were all very well portrayed, most notably Will Smith as Dead Shot, and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, making it almost impossible to imagine anyone else filling their roles. On top of that, the movie was fun, and I never found myself bored or wanting to leave the theater - much unlike Batman v. Superman. I promise you, if you go into this movie hoping to have fun, and not looking for flaws, you will enjoy it.",1
532,"I found the characters quite boring, to be honest. Harley Quinn really doesn't do anything in this movie aside from undressing and showing off her body. I would have loved to get more backstory on Katana and the crocodile guy, but apparently Harley's **** were more important",0
535,"With ""Suicide Squad,"" you're delivered a film with wonky pacing, a lackluster villain, an overemphasis on soundtrack over score, and some honestly imperfect storytelling throughout. . .and yet I still enjoyed almost every minute of it. Yes, the movie is undeniably rough around the edges, but, y'see, it's the performers, their characters, and their interactions that makes this movie - forgive me - pretty friggin' dope to watch. Again, it's an inarguably imperfect film, but a film that's ultimately rendered watchable -- nay, lovable -- infectiously effective humor, enthralling action scenes, and a commendable emphasis on using dynamic characters to smooth out a fairly messy story.",1
536,"There are just sooooo many **** things I could say about this film, but in the interest of time and energy I will sum up.  David Ayer had a vision that we wanted to create, and he didn't care who's intellectual property he had to **** all over to make it.  This is worse the Wolverine Origins, words I thought i would never hear myself say.",0
539,"I enjoyed this movie. It had some plot holes but overall deserves a watch. Now the Joker's character is absolutely pathetic! Jared Leto's version of one of the most iconic villians in history..is just hilarious. Not in a good way. He was way too calm for this role, and his acting was one of the fakest i've ever seen. What i'm asking is - where were all the heroes during all that **** that was going on? Also - what is all this **** with samsung? So Deadshot can hit a fly with his gun, but can't take away a **** phone from a lady? Also whats up with all that rich and immortal Joker? How the hell he survived? Slipknot's death was also hilarious. Okay, enough. I liked it.",1
540,"The script wasn't finished for this film. Its just a bunch of sequences played one after the other, trying to mimic the effect of a film. But in actual fact, this is not a film. Its a waste of time",0
541,"Not a bad movie in any way, but has a really weak plot that detracts from the overall experience. I felt that the acting was splendid, particularly with Will Smith, Margot Robbie (wow!), and Jay Hernandez. The action was pretty good but a bit repetitive cause there isn't much of a difference between the fights. The antagonist was a surprise but also not very strong in character. I felt that the first part of the movie would cover the issue raised and the second part would have an even strong or more dangerous antagonist, but the story dragged on for an unnecessary amount of time, so that was a disappointment. The music was great and I absolutely loved the color introductions used for each character; it really displays the craziness found inside the minds of these characters. Joker was done well too, even if it was quite a change.",1
542,"Suicide Squad is enjoyable for what it is, a pop corn superhero movie. It's not a masterpiece, nor is it intended to be. It's an action movie, expecting this to live up to some standard no superhero movie has achieved is like watching a Pixar movie and complaining there was no grand plot.The movie has some cool moments - I especially liked the transformation of Enchantress - and funny moments with Harley involving herself in most of those. Harley and Deadshot which were both portrayed very well by both actors. I had my doubts about casting Smith for Deadshot, but he did an excellent job. And Margot Robbie was the perfect Harley Quinn, being a blend of both the cartoon and the comics in one.My only gripe is where the team got mad at Flag when they read some top secret documents, as if that was somehow worse than getting sent on a suicide mission. Moreso that Katana would be mad as well, which makes little sense. Apart from that I enjoyed the movie, and would easily recommend it to anybody looking for some light entertainment.",1
546,"For me, this movie is really well thought out. It's not like the other superhero movies. Although it was cliche with the storyline at times, there were a fair bit of funny parts, good action and of course, Harley Quinn.",1
547,"This movie was ah incoherent mess, with poor action, unfunny one liners and an incoherent plot. Margot Robbie was the only good thing.",0
549,This film is a different take on the super hero genres for starts its because there not super heroes whitch makes this a unique thing and the rest of the film is stole by will smith and margo Robbie and some pretty cool action and a simple enough script to keep you on board not a terible spin of from our new DC based franchise but had potential to aim higher,0
556,"Just saw this on HBO. Bad dialogue, nonsensical soundtrack, erratic pacing, and boring action consisting of people shooting CG poop monsters. Funniest part, jokers laugh which he ripped from sesame streets The Count. I give it a 1, a 2 stars! Ah ah ahh!",0
557,"This film is like a goldplated Maybach 62:Overpriced, overhyped piece of sh1t for people without taste who like loud and unclever things... mainly 12Yold boys with daddy issues.Wasted 58 minutes of my life - I could bare this crap only so far.",0
560,"This movie is a collection of short clips, it not appears to have a storyline, the plot is non existant, things are just thrown at the screen, you jump from one point to another with no explanation whatsoever, and when you should not need it, it is explained at fullest making very annoying and it took 2 hours of my life...",0
566,"The Joker (Jared Leto) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) scenes are perfect and some are straight from the comics. It's just unfortunate that some actors even at their best have such a weak plot to work with.The villain is like something from a Mummy movie. While the heroes/villains feel out of place fighting her zombie like minions. Even Jai Courtney showing he can do more than play a stiff hero in Die Hard 5 or Terminator Genisys is wasted in this movie.I mean the actors make a lot of effort to be entertaining and are in good form. They deserved better than shooting at supernatural creatures or in Harley's case hitting them with bats. Then drinking at a bar just because the script called for a scene where they all bond and learn about each other more.When you finally get to hear Harley Quinn saying Mr. J. or Pudding on the big screen for the first time. The movie really deserved a better story than Suicide Squad: Zombie Hunters. They can skip the sequel and just give us hopefully Harley Quinn and Joker in a good Batman film together.Speaking of Batman, Suicide Squad could have used more Batman with Joker as the villain. Which is what actually makes the animated film Batman: Assault on Gotham much superior to this film. You had Suicide Squad assembled to stop the Joker from detonating a bomb. With much more Batman as well. Now that's a live action Suicide Squad film I wish this was.",1
567,"If you loved Deadpool you will really like this. Not more to say.Cons -Characters are made too likeable, Will Smith particularly-The girl with the bat is the only fleshed out character -OK use of music -Acting is believable -OK, but brother which is too little explained, as well as the so-called machine-The plot is ok",1
568,"The arrival of these bad-asses have boosted a transformation effort ofDC universe in term of a bit lighter tone at the very beginning but theentire film still leaves an impression of being darker compared toother Marvels production, which is a bit let down from what it ismarketed. Trying to expand just like Guardians of the Galaxy, unevenplot and character development are the main issues of Ayer'sscreenplay. The movie sets up after the death of Superman and rushestowards the event hosted by the main antagonist, affecting the overallfluidity of the story. Assuming that audiences are already familiarwith the comics, all the characters are briefly introduced and it worksless effectively especially when the Squad itself is not well knownlike Batman or Superman. Will Smith and Margot Robbie perform decentlyas Deadshot and Quinn, emotional engagement does exist among all butlack in depth for featuring too many characters at one shot especiallyJoker. Despite these main problems, action sequences are packed enoughand fun to follow while the visual effects are more colorful comparedto the other DC films; Retaining the rhythm of Zimmer's BvS theme,Steven Price has composed the scores in a different tunes, combiningsome rock musics that suit well the film and a sense of DC universe'scontinuity. While it misfires at plot and those super villains are notshown to be doing anything too evil, it does not aim to be like othersuperheroes films, it is still amusing and it gives a new life to DC'sbig-screen universe.",1
571,"Wow, I watched this pure steamer right till the end, and I didnt get anything for it!  No indurance prize, no recognition, I just sat blank faced wondering how WB manage to release such a crock of ship without anyone really saying at anypoint in production ""hangon, are we not making a terrible movie?"" or ""Surely the audience won't swallow this hack of a film after enduring BatmanVSSuperman would they?"" There's an undertone in the set up of this film of propoganda.  The less than subtle approach of America to say ""Hey, we can use terrorists to defend our country""  whilst America is funding Saudi war on Yemen, funding terrorists they were fighting against in Afghanastan, and funding ISIS in Syria vs Assad. Sorry - I don't mean to get political, but the obvious propaganda is strong in this one",0
575,"What a crappy production work, all the scenes cut on the wrong moment and the wrong order, the main plot didn't make much sense, they picked great songs are used it horrible wrong.The neon graffity thing ended up being out of place because only appeared at the beggining, like if it were part of another film or added in the middle of the production, personally wouldn't use it in a movie but would look great on a video game.Most of the characters were underdeveloped because lack of ""participation"" and the ones that got time were not even close of the animated version, the writing was avarage but of the time was plain bad and hard to care about.The actors did a respetable job nothing to complain but the material didn't give them much to work with. Except Cara Delevingne, she shouldn't keep acting.I'm giving a extra point because the credit scene was awesome.",0
576,"To be perfectly honest I am a huge DC fanboy, I love these characters and you cant imagine how hyped I was about this movie, the trailers made it look so good and fresh, so I was pretty disappointed after the movie ended that it was simply okay. This movie is definitely not a bad one, it has some strong points like the performances of the actors, the great chemistry between them, the character development and some great action sequences. But it has also many bad points like the all over the place plot, some terrible CGI, a very bad villain and false marketing about how important the Joker actually was and the role he played. Overall, it is enjoyable, it is fun to see these beloved characters on the big screen and shoot up some sh-t, but as BvS it kinda feels like a disappointment because it had so much potential and it was not nearly exploited enough.",1
577,"All in this **** mess of a movie (the junkyard, razzie-worthy editing and storytelling) makes it feel just wrong. The colorfoul palette and performances make it watchable, though.",0
582,"Just like a lot of people i was looking forward to this movie. The cast was fantastic, and with David Ayer this was shaping up to be amazing. Well I can say the movie is better than BvS. Recent reports are that David wrote the script in 6 weeks and it shows. The story isn't that good. But the action and the performances make up for some of it. Especially Margot Robbie who perfectly captures Harley Quinn and Will Smith who steal the show. And of course the always brilliant Jared Leto. I personally loved Jared's performance but there was so little of him and it pains me because they really missed out here with him. I really liked it had humor, which is something DC has forgotten to put in there movies. All in all I can I'm not extremely disappointed like how I was in BvS. But the meh plot, generic villain and not enough joker hold it back from being good.",0
583,"My beautiful puddin', this was a fun but safe film that should have been better but is a generally successful introduction to our new Joker and the DC favourites, including the delightfully unhinged Harley Quinn. Whilst all the performances were solid, Robbie and Davis are exceptional, and the storyline is just coherent enough for the audience to be invested in the outcome. The action sequences were nicely choreographed, the cinematography was solid (and a lesson in 'the male gaze'), and the pacing is steady and fast enough to hold the tension. Expectations were initially high, then tempered by early reviews, but overall this was an enjoyable experience. 7.23/10",1
587,"Who: Will Smith, Jordan Belfort's hot wife, 30 Seconds to Mars, and several B Actors as everyone else in the movieWhat: 2 hours of nonsense more pointless than Ghost RiderWhere: The unforgivably boring DC Cinematic UniverseWhen (Can I watch this again): Never. Never watch this again. I would sooner join a real life squad where the members actually killed themselves.Why: If you thought Batman Vs. Superman was bad, just wait until you're exposed to pointless cameos, cliche action sequences, and the most anticlimactic Joker storyline ever fathomed.",0
588,"A fun movie to watch with your friends, nothing more nothing less. It has great visuals, sound (amazing songs btw, i still listen to them) and acting. The thing that this movie lacks is good scenario, but still is enjoyable.",1
592,"Margot Robbie gives a nuanced character performance. Nothing else about this scrapheap of a film is worth your time or your dollar. The incoherent and nonsensical story is badly directed and poorly edited, and aside from Robbie all the cast are phoning it in. The film-makers are insulting the intelligence of the audience in almost every scene.",0
593,"A super fun movie with awesome action scenes bogged down by a confusing plot. At times the movie takes itself very seriously, other times not so much. Because of this, it's a little bit of a mess... Nevertheless, this movie has a soundtrack that is totally on point and is a good movie if you're going to the theater to see something fun instead of the next oscar winning performance.",1
598,"Suicide Squad is a very unique movie. Suicide squad delivers a fresh new formula. It's action packed. Robbie, Leto, and Smith were astounding. There's plotholes here and there and the last part of the movie wasn't as good as it could've been.",1
599,"What a waste of characters. Bad casting,  horribly edited, and a villain just as bad as what we got in BvS. Not to mention a story that was written in about 5 minutes.  Suicide Squad is a how not to make a team up movie. Will Smith is NOT Deadshot period. Three films into their cinematic universe and DC has STUNK up the theater each and every time. At least fans will always have the source material to take the bad taste from their mouth. WB reboot this so called DCEU as soon as possible, PLEASE.",0
600,"Overall, a decent movie with a few poor choices but awesome characters. The plot was a mess, and even though the trailers made Harley Quinn out to be the main character, the movie seemed to revolve around Deadshot more, despite all of the Joker sections. I'm totally down for that, since I personally hate kooky characters who are kooky for no other reason than being kooky (my least favourite character in the new Ghostbusters was Kate McKinnon's character), but I can't hate Harley Quinn for that, because that's kind of her shtick. However, the best part of it was not Harley Quinn, or Deadshot, or even The Joker, but Diablo. He's a character that no one going into the theatre gave two **** about. Even my friends made a bet as to who'd die in it, and one of them betting on him, just based on his lack of comic book cred (Mind you, the other actually read the Suicide Squad comic and bet on Slipknot, so none of them lost or gained money). But then, when it came to his backstory, you're given a character who hates himself and his powers, despite being the most physically powerful of the whole squad. You later realize why he is trying to repent for his sins, so when he . And when you get to the finale, he turns into a **** 8' foot tall flaming Tiki skeleton demon who nearly destroys a thousand-year old being. Additionally, Captain Boomerang was everything I could ever ask for and more. He started off as the weakest member of the team, seen as a pitiful bank robber who has no respect and has probably the stupidest weapon. He had a Unicorn fetish. Even though he had two lines, Slipknot seemed like a more legit member than he was. But then, every time Capt. did something, he was just as useless as you thought he'd be. He loved Guiness beer; when the battle was done, he made sure he had his unicorn plushie with him; when Deadshot gave up and went to the bar, he didn't look defeated, but relieved that he could have a drink (finally); when he actually did something, his boomerang got destroyed and you could see the emotions going through his head **** I'm going to need to buy/make ANOTHER one of those! You know how hard they're to come around?!""). I kind of wish Killer Croc and Katana had more to contribute. They were kind of just there and played no real role, other than just being there. When leaving the theatre, none of us were talking about Harley Quinn or Deadshot, but about whether Diablo's actually dead or not. We were talking about how awesomely worthless Captain Boomerang was. The movie does feel like a rip-off of Guardians of the Galaxy, considering the upbeat take on generally villainous people, the 80s soundtrack, and the fact that it's a movie mostly about second-rate characters (even though Harley Quinn's relatively famous, she's still second to the Joker). Even Killer Croc felt like a copy of Groot, considering his lack of lines and 'not-being-a-human'-ness. However, I'm always down to re-watch GotG, and if this is just more of it, then bring it on!",1
601,"I liked a lot Cara Delevingne's verison of Enchantress and some of the costumes but overall is a disappointing movie. Childish humor...too many characters (7 protagonists,2 villains,at least 2 supporting cast,some cameos) so there isn't enough time to give proper screentime to all of them or even a useful role in the plot....confused storyboard....fanservices...anonimous enemy minions...silly plot...boring action scene.....out of place soundtrack. Add to all that one of the worst interpretation of Killer Croc & Joker that I have seen in dc based media (cartoons,films,videogames) and you'll end up with a bad movie",0
602,"One of the better comic to movie films I've seen.  Loved Jared Leto's Joker. He really did the character justice, but Harley Quinn really steals the show!",1
605,"Suicide Squad boasts has undeniably talented cast, but it's foolishly written characters, unoverwhelming direction and dissapointing end sinks it in company of DC's cinematographic universe's worst productions.",0
606,"Una idea original con protagonistas excelentes, rodeados de personajes inútiles que además tienen una historia pésimamente desarrollada y unos enemigos horribles, pero divertida.",1
607,"The Joker is a joke and a mockery of Heath Ledger's genius. Deadshot is one of the saving graces of this movie, along with Harley Quinn, and as for the rest, they are as forgettable as the dumb plot. Why did DC even bother with this one? Let's pray they don't make a sequel and waste our time and money hoping that it will be any better, only to disappoint us. Buck up, DC!",0
608,"DC, please, they are vilains not heroes, don't try to make the oposite because this is the result. Lack of a good story, characters that you should hate but respect and some other stuff.

612,"bad acting but great costume design, good Joker and cringeworthy VFX in the movie, ok plot and a mess script, oddly entertaining otherwise with best performances from Margot Robbie and Will Smith. rating: 7 / 10",1
617,"I don't understand why these critics are bashing this film, its absolutely absurd. This movie is enjoyable from beginning to end. Comedy is brilliant , action is decent. The squad has an amazing chemistry. Characters are very entertaining to watch. **** THE CRITICS",1
618,"The first half felt more like a giant trailer / compilation for other films that we're not actually watching. Very bizarre. The second half was confusing as to what the villains plan was. Maybe there's a good movie in there somewhere, but this isn't that version. Plus, the Joker was both underused and also a horrible performance, which may have prompted it being mostly cut out.",0
619,"Suicide Squad isn't a perfect movie but in general terms is good, enjoyable, amusing and entertaining, The cast performances were excellent, each character showed a unique story, the settings were consistent with the story of the movie but there were some mistakes the plot was unclear and not really structured and the Joker should be more involved  in the movie, because is a great character. Suicide Squad is NOT a bad movie, just they could have done it better!",1
620,"Suicide Squad was a very poor film to say the least. Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller were the lone bright spots. The other remaining characters, including the villain, were uninteresting. Jared Leto's Joker was completely forgettable. The plot was silly at best and outright stupid at worst. This movie was a dreadful experience.",0

623,"Hot garbage. There's very little enjoyment to gain from this film. The characters sucked, the story was kinda non-sense and I have no idea what Jared Leto was trying to do as the Joker, normally I really like him both in film and music, but he was just BAD. The only good in Suicide Squad is Margot Robbie as Harley (perfect casting) and maybe Will Smith, kinda playing himself. That's it.",0
624,"The movies was OK! .... not the expected action packed DC movie that was expected ... but some solid performances, specially by Margot Robbie.Funny and dark .... average when compared with Batman movies or Superman flick",1
626,"Really enjoyed this movie! What a ride! This is just a perfect example how a comic book movie should look like, simply amazing. SS has silly and funny moments packed with a lot of action, while being supported by a brilliant cast. Exceptional performances from Jared and Robbie.",1
627,"5/5. I have truly enjoyed this movie! The plot is bit quirky, I would do it differently by focusing on Joker more, but despise this the plot is still enjoyable. The critics can say what they want, but lets be honest most of probably never read a comic book or just simply don't understand comic book movies. But like I was saying the plot is debatable but I liked it. The performances were great especially Jokers and Harley's. Being a fan of Joker and Harley this was exactly what I wanted. Leto's Joker is just pure brilliant...Yes I said it! But the main thing that steals the movie for me is the whooping soundtrack, which makes you feel like you are using iPod shuffle because the songs are random and that's what makes it excellent. Final verdict...Suicide Squad is one of my favorite films.",1
629,"Amazing that there was a petition from a huge fanbase that enjoyed this ""movie"" to remove rotten tomatoes as a website, when it is simply a medium for critics and people to express their opinion, showing nothing but ignorance. The movie indeed sucks, it is an attrocious piece of garbage unfortunately. Still, if you wanna watch it go ahead, but that does not change the fact that it is trash. Had never seen such bad editing, although it is no suprise, they hired a trailer company to edit this movie. The script is ridiculous and inconsistent, and despite good casting, none of the actors involved had anything to work with. Jared Leto even let me down. No doubt he has proven he is a great actor, but he tried too hard in this one, and the joker simply became a joke, consistently generating unintentional laughs due to the ridiculousness of the script and the exaggerated acting from Leto. The plot does not even make sense, and Cara Delevingne as always has proven to all of us that she cannot act, not to mention the fact that her character was laughably awful. Try to not waste your money on this.",0

Glad most of the public didn't listen to the gormless critics! I've pre-ordered this dvd just to show my support and stick my two fingers up at the haters. Plus I'd watch again and again. Loved it. Love Will Smith and Margot Robbie. All the characters were super amazing.",1
634,watched this the other night ..... enjoyable but over hyped...... plots lines very thin they dont give enough of an intro to some of the characters there are unnecessary characters in there ..... joker  ......one of the most noted members and hes not even on the team  and the baddest team member or the most interesting in my opinion el diablo  isn't given enough time    ....and will smith ... not a dead shot for me...hes good but hes too likable.... hitch meets dead shot .....  for a team of villains...they came across too nice........but if you see it for nothing else ...see it for Margot Robbie .... steals the show,1
635,People are being hard on this movie. This is not a bad movie. They are right about the fact that the story plot is too simple. I enjoy watching Suicide Squad. I think this movie is the best of the DC EXTENDED UNIVERSE until now. Suicide Squad is a good movie.,1
644,"A very messy film with some questionable choices, however the film is still enjoyable mainly for the Joker and Harley Quinn.",1
653,"Ew. This movie is plain out bad and an absolute mess. Jared Leto is great as the Joker but not given any time to shine. The best character was El Diablo because he was played very down to earth by Jay Hernandez and actually HAD a story arc. Most of the cast did well in their roles, especially Viola Davis, Will Smith, and Jai Courtney. However they couldn't even save this movie. It was chopped to all but pieces, had weird infused acid trips which suddenly died out after the first forty five minutes, and over all almost no character chemistry nor arcs in the entire thing. Though I did enjoy some scenes, it still wasn't enough to save this movie.",0
654,"Forgetting the fact that i am a complete nerd in comics and know every character, but judging the movie as an independent story... it is still pretty bad.Half of the movie was just plain stalling the viewers, with awful and useless characters such as ""captain boomerang"" or ""killer croc"" who just stood there looking while people got killed, viewers didnt get to know anything about most of the characters, deadshot was the only character that i felt was good, i would say harley quinn, but that ending scene when she says ""dont hurt my friends"" was just cringy so i cant give a goood score with that in mind...The villain (enchantress) felt just like a filler, just a bad guy so they can kill and get together as the suicide squad...Neverminding the fact that its an action and superhero movie, its still pretty terrible... 3/10",0
655,"I'm not sure why Hollywood likes to put all it's effort into special effects over story. This was the biggest pile of crap I've seen in a long time. The story was paper-thin and the special effects made me yawn. With one bullet from her pistol, Harley was killing monsters that had entire assault rifles emptied into them with no effect. Come on WB, we're more intelligent than that. Take a page from Luc Besson and the Fifth Element. You can have a high-adrenalin special effects movie that does have a storyline.",0
657,"It feels bad to be sad.. Bad aspects: - The Joker is a well loved and extremely difficult character to portray on screen. I noticed how much energy Leto has given to this character and it really shows off so I have to give him props for it. That being said, this film would be exactly the same if he didn't appear in it, there would be no noticeable difference to the plot. Which means that this character was a complete waste and has no business being in this film. - Will Smith just plays himself during the entirety of this film and if you have watched any other Will Smith film you know what I am talking about. He just plays himself in every movie he's been in and it really is getting tedious at this point. - Pacing: Suicide Squad is a little over 2 hours and it felt like I was already watching it for a full 2 hours halfway into the movie. - Rick Flag portrayed by Joel Kinnaman was rather poorly by my taste. I didn’t buy the ‘can do anything soldier’ attitude and his acting was also mediocre at best. The romance between him and Cara Delevingne’s Enchantress was also way too forced and quite poorly portrayed. The pair had no chemistry between them and left much to be desired. - Generic antagonist plot. The main villain is Enchantress played by Cara Delevingne who wants total world domination by turning every citizen into a generic monsteresque minion which can’t think for itself. That has never been done before. Good aspects: - Viola Davis as Amanda Waller offers a spot on portrayal of the character and is true to the comics. I was very pleased to see a portrayal that wasn’t complete bollocks, yes, I am referring to ‘Arrow’. - El Diablo played by Jay Hernandez has a well thought out origin of why he is afraid to use his powers. But however it doesn’t explain how he got his powers. He was one of the better things the movie had to offer. - Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is a must see portrayal and it is honestly one of the few pillars that can barely keep the movie from falling into an abyss of awful. Her character keeps true to it’s source material and is an overall great performance. So Suide Squad had major flaws that can not be overlooked but it also has some good elements. So my final verdict on this movie is that it was a complete waste of my time and money and I do not recommend it.",0
658,"Suicide Squad was another highly anticipated superhero movie (alongside Batman v Superman, Deadpool, Captain America: Civil War and X-Men: Apocalypse) and, in short, it's about a group of bad-guys who are sent to defeat a threatening enemy. There's one catch though: This is seriously the most disappointing thing I've seen all year.Let's begin with the trailers, which were tonally misleading, that excited everyone for this movie, including me. While watching the movie, it seems as if the studio was rushing to put this thing together. In fact, pretty much all the movie's problems can be linked to the hurried creation of this movie. I'll elaborate on the problems below.The first 40 minutes is all exposition, but it is so clumsy, I could have sworn the movie should have started with the helicopter crashing. I would rather have scenes of the characters discussing their past and the time spent in maximum security rather than this extra long opening narration. The characters are near life-less with a tiny character arc that comes off as cliché more than anything else. I haven't even gotten to all the confusing plot points in this movie, but that's how poorly constructed it is.Even with bits of humor, good acting, and some good action, one can only glimpse at the potential that this movie had to succeed. Everything went wrong way too fast, resulting in a sloppy mess that warrants a seal of expendability.",0
661,"One of the best ""hero"" films out there.Granted, it isn't perfect. The editing seems lazy at times and the plot is a bit crazy but it has a charm about it that I can watch over and over again. It's finally nice to see Harley Quinn make her movie debut and Margot Robbie did an amazing job portraying her. The relationship between her and the Joker was a bit odd as the movie was trying to be their ""love story"" and it didn't need to be like that.It has a great soundtrack to it. I highly recommend the song ""Heathens"".",1
662,"I'll say from the outset, I'm a lifelong comic book fan. During my teenage years back in the 80's I collected John Ostrander's Suicide Squad title and absolutely loved it. It was always a given for me therefore that I would jump at the prospect of a movie based on my favourite title. I should also add that I fall into the category of those that loved Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice (the Ultimate Edition ranks amongst one of my all time favourite movies). This should give you an indication of where this review is heading!Absolutely loved it! What do critics know eh?You know the synopsis I'm guessing (if you're reading this review) - government official Amanda Waller assembles a group of the baddest incarcerated criminals to go up against the potential of a metahuman crisis should the 'next' Superman not share our values. This is deemed more relevant following the demise of the man of steel himself at the climax of Dawn Of Justice. Amongst those villains are Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Enchantress/Dr June Moone (Carla Delevigne). Heading up the group is Colonel Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman), albeit reluctantly.The story essentially revolves around Enchantress going rogue and converting a subway station in Midway City into a warzone as she resurrects her brother Incubus and the two attempt to destroy the world. The only criticism I have with the movie concerns the simplicity within which Enchantress 'turns' on the group shortly after it is her actions that cause the senate committee to approve the founding of Task Force X only a couple of scenes earlier in the movie. It just feels a bit rushed. It's also interesting to note that the events of the movie would never have taken place had Waller not established her little 'pet project' to begin with!The dialogue is witty and sharp and the characters are highly likeable (despite them being arch-villains and - in some cases, murderers). Will Smith is the core of the group as Deadshot and his cold-bloodedness as an assassin is softened by the connection he has to his daughter (how the audience is expected no doubt to warm to him?). Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flagg is also key to the story's heart with his flawed relationship with Dr June Moone - Enchantress's alter ego. Margot Robbie is superb as Harley Quinn and a scene stealer in herself (not to mention the sex appeal she ozes!) although her rear steals equally as many scenes as she does!What do I need to say about Jared Leto that hasn't been said before? You'll either love or hate his portrayal of Mr.J! Think more 'gangsta'.Fantastic soundtrack, great action sequences - the DCEU is shaping up just nicely with this third entry!!",1
663,Don't believe the haters. This is a great action movie!Margot Robbie is super sexy and Will Smith is excellent in this movie. Jared Leto is an excellent Joker just a shame we don't see more of him.This film is never going to win any Oscars but if you like action movies then I would highly recommend it. I saw it in 3D and I would say it is worth getting the 3D version of the movie when it is released.,1
664,"I confess that I originally decided to check out this Suicide Squad film due to previously being familiar and liking some of the music of Thirty Seconds To Mars (Jared Leto as the Joker), seeing Margot Robbie’s (Harley Quinn)excellent performance in the Wolf of Wall Street back in 2013, and being aware of my husband’s interest in the Men In Black films starring Will Smith (Deadshot). Of course, there are other actors/actresses who put out good performances in this movie as well (Cara Delevingne as June Moone/Enchantress, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, etc. and more actors featured in this film). The film shows how each character came to be who they were and there are even cameo appearances from some of the actors in the film(Common, Ben Affleck etc.) The film shows some of the characters achille heels such as how Will Smith’s Deadshot character was eventually captured and the pivotal moment when the Joker and Harley Quinn were captured. There are some love stories and an interesting mix of music thrown in for good measure (Heathens by Twenty One Pilots, a song by K7, Bohemian Rhapsody, etc.)",1
665,"I´ve red bad reviews about it but did not mind a because I love comic book movies and the trailers looked awesome, like a lot of fun. Well, I´ve watched the movie and found it to be an awful movie. No fun at all, no coherence story. Just a few nice moments of Harley Queen is the best of it. The Joker... this is the most unfunny Joker ever. What a waste of time!",0
666,"I was incredibly hyped for this movie- and I was incredibly let down. This movie is a gimmick. The fact that will smith gets more screen time than the joker is absurd. I kid you not, the Joker gets a maximum of twelve, maybe fifteen minutes of screen time in this movie. Acting was decent, I'll give it that. But nothing really happened in the entire movie. They killed some people, defeated an evil being. WOOOOO. Guess that passes off as a triple A title now, does it. Its not a bad movie on its own- but with the hype and info surrounding the movie, and how big of a let down it was to so many people, I give it a failing score. Not even its gimmicky soundtrack could save it. Their use of songs like ""Seven Nation Army"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" were poor attempts to capture the young audiences, which failed miserably. I was incredibly let down by this movie, and if they make a sequel, I cannot justify spending money to go see it.",0
669,"Suicide Squad gives a fresh take on classic characters and takes minor characters (El Diablo) and makes them key parts of the story. Despite a predictable third act and certain characters not being as crucial as expected ,or effecting the plot in any way,it still entertains. Every member of the cast from Margot Robbie to Jay Hernandez plays their character perfectly and despite peoples views of Jared Letos Joker his clown prince of crime is certainly memorable. Portraying the Joker as a ruthless ""gangsta"" is controversial but unique and, with a more central part, could be a worthy villain. The films only downfall is its story that fails to engage in the later parts and fails to provide any reason for Joker to be there. However this is overshadowed by comic accurate portrayals of the majority of characters and a colour palette that respects its heritage aswell as gritty and grounded combat.Overall well worth the time, Suicide Squad is funny and engaging and deserves all the praise given by this reviewer.",1
670,"Never being a fan of DC cinematic universe, I can say after watching this  movie that I will  never hurt my eyes again. It was very misleading especially as the it had a great cast but I was left thoroughly disappointed. Not to mention the flashing lights and the confusing story line made it seem like there was no effort put into this big budget film. What happened? Only one positive I can think of was that the Joker was Jared Leto who had a brief cameo like  appearance.",0
673,"When the first trailer dropped for Suicide Squad, it looked like DC were making their very own version of Guardians of the Galaxy, with a quippy band of thieves and killers being sent on a mission to defeat a world-destroying threat. This led us to believe the movie would be as fun and enjoyable as Guardians. Unfortunately, we were wrong, as the finished product is the messiest, most inconsistent and poorly paced DCEU movie yet.I’ll start with my two major issues with this movie, which are tone and pacing. The movie goes from being dark and gritty to being fun and colourful, and feels like two completely different versions of the same movie mashed into one. The first trailer was even a lot darker then the ones to come, with a more sinister feel, while the second and third trailers were bright, colourful, and more like Guardians of the Galaxy. So you can tell DC weren’t sure which to go for, so to please both audiences they crammed both versions into one, which was a huge mistake. And as for pacing, this movie tries to tell about five different stories at once, from the Joker-Harley dynamic to Deadshot’s relationship with his daughter to the Squad’s mission itself. The movie goes from randomly inserted flashbacks to over-the-top action sequences to pop-song montages, while also trying to introduce us to all the characters and what crimes they’ve committed and all their personal vendettas, and so on. For instance, the character of Katana has a sword that traps the souls pf her victims, and her husband is imprisoned in it because her enemies killed him with it. I mean, WTF?! That’s an entire movie worth of material Warner Bros. could have made, but instead crammed it into a movie alongside the Joker-Harley dynamic, Rick Flag’s romance with Enchantress, Deadshot’s vendetta with Batman, and so many more unnecessary side-stories. And if a movie is all over the place like that, I can’t enjoy it and it ruins the film-going experience for me. There are also too many conveniences in the plot, and details the studio gloss over, which just frustrates me even more.And now, before I get into what I like about this movie, I just have to say a few words about Enchantress and the Joker. Enchantress can be grouped up with all those disposable Marvel villains in the sense that she is a forgettable, one-dimensional threat who can be disposed of after one movie. Cara Delevigne’s performance was awful, as she danced in front of a massive beam of energy shooting into the sky (seriously, how many times have we seen that in superhero movies?) with a ridiculous booming voice. And her brother was just the most one-dimensional, poorly rendered CGI monstrosity in recent memory. And as for the Joker, Jared Leto destroyed what the Joker stands for. Instead of wanting chaos and carnage, this Joker is all about bling and power. It didn’t help that he had nothing to do with the movie, and could have been cut out without effecting the movie at all. The fact that this is our Joker for the next many years makes me lose faith in DC.But now that I’ve gotten the cons out of the way, may I just say that the only two things about this movie that make it watchable are Margot Robbie and Will Smith as Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively. These characters were the only two DC bothered to flesh out, with the best performances and scenes. Viola Davis also did a good job as Amanda Waller, but she wasn’t in enough of the movie as I would have liked.Suicide Squad is the worst movie in the DCEU to date, with a mostly forgettable cast of characters, an inconsistent tone and an even worse structure than Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.",0
674,"this movie was the biggest disappointment of the year, there, i said it. The villain was total crap, it had huge plot holes, the jared leto joker was one of the worst adaptations of the joker i've ever seen and the whole movie felt like a huge mistake, the only thing i liked about this movie was the soundtrack, and i also liked two characters: Deadshot and Amanda Waller, but other than that i think that the movie was total crap.",0
677,Just a horrible movie. Stupid but not in a likeable way. It's really saying something when Jai Courteney is the most likeable thing in your film.could of been redeemed as at least mindless fun with a bada$$ ending....but we all know how that turned out.....,0
678,"watched this at the cinema and would probably give it a 5. It's significantly worse at home. Reasons: Harley Quinn's voice is irritating AF. The story is dreadful, zero tension, zero cohesion and lame conclusion. Batman is shoehorned in with no purpose at all. Affleck looked embarrassed. The baddies look like they belong in Gods of Egypt if it was made in 1999. The songs are glaringly obvious and distracting. And to top it all - I actually enjoyed Leto's Joker in the cinema but watching at home he was actually making me feel physically ill. Just an awful, awful performance. He was obviously cut from the film because he was so awful. Ultimately though it fails, as usual, because of its pathetic script. 1 point for Jai Courtney.",0
679,"Mes 3 points sont surtout pour Margot Robbie alias Harley Quinn qui incarne à merveille une nana déjantée, maquillée comme une voiture volée, frappadingue et très digne compagne du Joker... le Joker de Jack Nicholson, pas le pâlot ersatz qu'on a vu dans les itérations diverses de la galaxie DC et a fortiori ici dans ce Suicide Squad de pacotille, même si j'apprécie l'acteur Jared Leto par ailleurs.Bref, pas seulement une blonde bombasse affriolante mais aussi une personnalité vilainement attachante et sournoise. En fait, la seule personnalité de tout le lot, de cette pitoyable bande de ""12 salopards"", car le reste n'est qu'une triste bande de cons, de vilains dont on ne voudrait même pas à la fête foraine du coin.Le ""chef"" naturel est bien entendu le plus con d'entre eux, à savoir Will Smith qui joue les mi-durs mi-mous, fait le grand écart entre les vannes à deux balles et la guimauve de sa petite pisseuse. Ce glandu est insupportable de beauferie et de prétention et tire inéluctablement vers le bas ce qui ne volait déjà pas bien haut.Le scénario a été boulotté par des abrutis pas bien réveillés et seul le début, bien rythmé, arrive à faire illusion... ensuite, c'est à peine digne d'un téléfilm à la mords-moi-le-noeud avec psychologie à la petite semaine incluse. Il reste quelques scènes d'action plus ou moins correctes et de jolis effets badaboum mais la réalisation ne casse pas trois pattes à un canard : il faut croire que tout le pognon n'est pas forcément bien réparti...On ne s'ennuie pas trop mais on souffle beaucoup, on lève les yeux au plafond... surtout vers la fin qui n'a rien d""épique : on serait davantage dans le grotesque, hélas même pas drôle au 3ème degré... c'est à se suicider de dépit. Heureusement qu'Harley est là sinon j'aurais taillé la route !",0
680,"It really shows the potential messes a movie can have in every process it goes through. Start with a script that was a rushed in, record those scenes without much good insight over whether those scenes will serve well to the movie's potential success, add awful CGI in, edit the film (who knows how it was at this point), release a trailer that does not match the tone of the film, reshoot scenes to fit the tone of the trailer, add more (possibly worse) awful CGI,  and re-edit the film through a trailer house (a TRAILER HOUSE), make two possibly very different versions of a movie, mush those two versions with two different tones, and finally, release the film, which at this point, somehow sounds implausible.It really sucks; this movie could have been awesome. Instead, it's a small portion of what makes a good movie (three tenths, to be exact :P).",0
681,"Complete garbage, they ruined The Joker and Harley by cramming everything in like adding in extra useless characters such as batman and others, they didn't fit it in and didn't feel like it was any kind of sub-plot as mentioned in other reviews. I did like Will Smiths performance as Dead-shot which fit in well with the plot and improved things for Enchantress vs the team but the cut/editing was just awful. The extended version should've just been released as normal but they have to charge extra for correcting their mistakes...and don't get me started on the soundtrackP.s. The endings felt lazily slapped up as well (Not a spoiler)",0
682,"Go to see Suicide Squad they said. It will be fun they said.  This movie was a mess.  Summary:  We are bad guys, but maybe we're misunderstood good guys, but the government is bad so to fight the common enemy we will team up, I guess.The story telling was all over the map and the characters not very believable.  The characters had no depth, they were not ""complicated"" they were confusing. This was a Sci-Fi channel movie with a larger budget.  How was this fun?  Will Smith just plays Will Smith, seen that million times.  Jared Leto is a terrible Joker, I laughed at him, but not in the good way.  Margot Robbie was ok. Not great, but ok.I wanted this to be better, I really did.  But please, have some respect for yourself and skip Suicide Squad.",0
684,"Empezando por el peor joker hasta ahora, los jokers con merito son los de la serie animada o los de los juegos Arkham, el joker es un personaje carismatico con mucho sentido del humor, macabro si, pero siempre con un plan; es metodico, calculador y manipulador. El joker de esta pelicula es un personaje secundario, un mafioso de poca monta, no se puede conectar con el, no hay empatia, no tiene objetivos no tiene nada, salvo dinero y que joyas.Ahora de cuando aqui Harley Queen empezo a ser protagonista, Harley es una sidekick, ni siquiera le importa al Joker, sexo es lo unico que vende, no pudieron ponerla mas ligera de ropa, por que las delanteras de la señora no aguantan, aunque preferencia personal el mejor traje de Harley es el del DLC de batman arkham knight y la personalidad de harley es vacia es superficial, cuando que se sabe que harley tiene es mas un desorden de personalidad con abandono paterno,deberia actuar como la niña de papa y aqui es como que la novia.Escasamente las actuaciones de will smith y otros personajes masculinos hacen aguantable la pelicula, cocodrilo se queda corto la verdad, literalmente el original es gigante y mucho mas aterrador, mucho mas animal, y de cuando aqui necesita la aprobacion de alguien, el cast de mujeres definitivamente deja mucho que desear y practicamente de todas.la seudo vision del mundo de los comics mas madura se queda solo en una burla para los verdaderos fanaticos, preferible leer los comics mil veces, el unico que salva esta gama de peliculas hasta el momento es batman y algo superman pero hay es por que lo han desaprovechado mucho",0

The story as much as you care to pick at it is good fun from beginning to end, plenty of brilliant character building and background along with a blend of great action and comedy moments too, classic memorable dialogue, the cast is top notch all round, especially to note Will Smith as on top form, Margot Robbie is absolutely on top form and is a fantastic colourful and unforgettable Harley Quinn, and not forgetting the most perfect on screen Joker ever Jared Leto, I really hope this guy gets his own movie, even though he's not the main focus of suicide squad he still steals every scene he's in. The effects are cool, the soundtrack is quality and its just overall the perfect example of a fun comic book movie, I hope for a sequel for sure, be sure to check this movie out for something a bit more original than usual.The Blu-ray has a great HD picture3-Discs including the 3D version (Theatrical version only) 2D theatrical version, Extended 2D version.Features are plentiful with lots of mini featurettes on the making of 69-mins total plus gag reel and more.Region FREE, Theatrical version 123-mins, Extended version 134-mins. 2016.Multiple language and subtitle option on the Theatrical versions 2D-3D, Extended only multiple subtitle options.Incudes UV digital code, comes with slipcase.",1

688,ConsNothing happens the entire movieThe movie was edited by a trailer house10-second batman and flash cameoThe Joker is only there for 10 minutesThe characters lack any substanceThe only character with a real arc is barely in the movie.The soundtrack doesn't work well with the movie.Pros:Will SmithHarley is hot igthere was a kanye song,0
690,Great Movie! The Visually stunning! The Characters were Badass! The Batman and Batmobile cameo were truly Amazing! F*** rotten tomatoes rating for this film! And non-comic book fans! Brilliant movie from beginning to end! Buying this the frist day it is available! DC Extended Universe is on the right Track!,1
691,The movie gets better the more times you watch it. The first time I was the movie was in theaters and I liked it but the second time was even better. I liked being ale to stop the movie rewind certain parts to see the details. I hear the deleted scenes are really good too. Lots of Joker and Harley footage that did not make the theater cut.,1
692,All the haters are so butthurt about Suicide Squads Oscar win and Deadpool did not. Once again critics are just to in love with Marvel which in reality is just as flawed as DC. Because BVS and SS is not perfect and neither is MCU.,1

698,"I had great fun watching this movie, and I don't think there's anything else to be said, the cast was awesome and it was as good as expected. Anyone saying that the trailer showed too much Joker compared to how long you see him in the movie clearly didn't read the title and doesn't understand how fun works as well as basic advertising.",1
699,"So bad it hurts. Period.I can't remember any other movie that has caused me so much suffering. Thank God it's over. If you want to watch a decent DC movie, I recommend The Dark Knight, which is about as far in quality from this undescripable piece of filth as the other side of a wormhole.",0
700,This is more like it from DC.It has a good level of humour and Margot Robbie was exceptional as Harley Quinn.Let's hope her own movie is at a similar quality level.The stories (or even acting) in these types of films do not need to be critically acclaimed. It does exactly what it says on the tin.Ignore the critics - they always give superhero movies a bad rap. It's sci-fi fantasy for crying out loud.,1

705,"Well, It's not a Masterpiece, but it's still a pretty enjoyable movie to watch when I have nothing better to do. I did consider giving this an 8/10, but the problem is the more I watched it out of the theater, I sort of lost my vibe with it a bit. But I still consider it to be a bit of an above average movie. Will Smith had quite a strong role in this movie, which I for sure dig. And the rest of the squad is pretty sweet, too. But even then I still feel like there were a few disappointments in the movie. But personally, they weren't that bad of disappointments. Trying to keep away from spoilers is challenging, because it seems anything in this movie can be a spoiler. I found that to be quite unfortunate, too. Because it's hard to keep a dedicated conversation in a movie like this. Even giving somebody that hasn't seen the movie a summary seems to be too much, too. Which does give off a bit of a blank slate in this movie. But hey, at least it got an Academy Award for Best Makeup.TL:DR: 8/10 Worthy, but a few obstacles brought it down one.",1
706,"The title of the film is SUCIDE SQUAD, which also disrupts the saga of comics on which it is based, the so-called LEAGUE OF INJUSTICE, or just INJUSTICE. In addition to the title change that may be better or worse, as you can see, the thing that touches me the most, speaking of course, is the **** character characterization crap. Where the **** has seen a hipster joker, with **** tattoos and he looks like he just came out of a **** sturbucks instead of Arkham. Not to mention that today has revealed the appearance that will have Harley Quinzel, and is anything but a harlequin. She is painted as a horny nurse substitute, so her hammer / bat does not even glue. Also the high is already the damn design of the car of the joker, nothing more and nothing less than a **** PINK lamborghini . The directors surely thought that a character that in their personality does not care about what material the best they could do was to put a **** LAMBO! To conclude a conclusion; Do not follow the comics, the characters do not have the personality or the original look, etc ... so the movie is a **** ****",0

Deadshot is the best part of the movie while everything else is either confusing or bland. i couldn't see anything for a certain amount of time because of the dark colours.

710,"Though the horrific editing was immediately evident, I'll admit this initially entertained me. This isn't that type of bad film.

An overwhelming amount of iconic pop songs are shoved in your face to make the movie’s uninspired fight scenes seem more exciting than they really are. This is all really a shame though, as a fantastic cast is laid to waste, having to muster up the energy to make dialogue, entirely comprised of cheesy one liners, work. As this movie feels like one giant distraction, this movie is perfect for you if you need to get your mind off the fact that (A) Your wife is cheating on you, or (B) Your aforementioned step child is getting bullied at school, or (C) Your wife is cheating on you with your son’s bully. Suck on that Rotten Tomatoes petitioners.",0
714,"Cutting straight to the chase, Suicide Squad is one of the very worst comic book films in recent memory.

719,"I really wanted to like this movie. The trailer looked amazing and tricked me into believing the DCEU finally brought us a good film. Here's the thing, I didn't hate all of it. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn? Amazing. Leto as the Joker? Ridiculously underused, but other than that pretty good. Viola Davis, is, well, Viola Davis, so she is obviously a big plus. However, the 'Suicide Squad' feels less like a squad and more like a group of angry children with no personalities (except for Harley Quinn, although she had a little bit too much personality sometimes). Every attempt at an emotional scene fails miserably, because the characters are not developed in any way. You know their names and what they can do, but that's about it. The action is so bad, it's laughable and the villain almost bores you to death. It is obvious the reshoots destroyed this film and the amazing marketing is the only thing that saved this mess from also failing at the box office. I won't give it an 'Emoji Movie'-bad rating, because I didn't fall asleep, laughed at some jokes and liked the visual of the film, mostly the costumes and make-up. But oh my god, I don't know if I can sit through this again. What. a. flop.",0
720,"What a total flop this Suicide Squad, and how much potential wasted, how many expectations destroyed. A totally empty film, full of plot holes and above all silly characters. Will Smith probably believed he was still playing Chris Gardner of The Pursuit of Happyness given his melancholy attachment to his daughter, Margot Robbie succeeds in his intent (that is to make horny all the teens in the room) and Jared Leto, poor man, despite the efforts give us the worst Joker of this century and probably also of the next.I will not waste time describing the other characters, or the plot because they simply do not exist, just as there is no good reason to talk excessively well about this film.",0
721,Over-the-top corny action film that relies too heavily on CGI. Weak plot with poor dialogue. A movie to avoid even for fans of the genre.,0
723,Margo Robbie is awesome as Haley Quinn and the actor who played captain boomerang did a good job too but the rest suck this movie has bad CJI and bad writing,0
726,"Suicide Squad is a dope movie. I love the action scenes, the chemistry between the characters, and I love how they changed the tone in my opinion. I highly recommended it!",1
729,"Even if everyone did their best to put this movie under a bad light i'm sorry but i want to disagree. Yes the story is really simple and flat but the actors were really good and also the scenography and the soundtrack. So for me overall is a nice movie not a masterpiece but still nice to watch, still better then other DC movies i saw by the way. And, since i really liked the soundtrack, i did this cover of one of the main songs of the movie. If you want check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_5gx3gPpUs",1
730,"""Horrible directed s**t"" is the only phrase that i described about Suicide Squad when i first saw it, eventhough DC films have been quite good lately, namely Wonder Woman which i still quite enjoyed tho the third act was kind of flat, Aquaman and Shazam which i pretty much love, i thought Man of Steel and BvS are two of the most underrated comic book films of all time and Justice League is really underwhelming but i think SS really make them drop the balls. This movie is just pure cringe, the directing was just utterly trash, the cinematography too, it is literally too dark and murky. About the acting, Will Smith is Will Smith, Jai Courtney did a pretty good job thank god, Margot Robbie did her best in a horrible script, because her dialogues are so cringy and unfunny eventhough 80% of her screen time was aimed for comedic timing. And Jared Leto, look, i know this guy is talented, he is very good actor but everything he did here, NOOO.",0
731,There is absolutely nothing I liked about this movie. Nothing. And I had such high hopes.,0
732,"I don't like to give lower than 3/10, but this film was the worst DC movie I've ever seen. They really looked like that they were actually going to suicide. I liked Will Smith, I liked Harley Quinn, and I hated all others. I didn't like Joker because he seemed like some cat, and all others were just trash. Even though Will Smith and Harley Quinn was good, the plot was simply a mess. I have no idea how this movie can get so many positive ratings.",0
733,Suicide Squad has good characters but are not given a good movie to be in. With the biggest problem being the first 30 minutes being a music video.,0
737,"Suicide Squad is the title, huh? Well, it did make me consider suicide after watching it. Thank god I watched a free version on Youtube because this movie sucked.Pros: (Haha, this movie actually has pros. Hard to believe, right?)- Margot Robbie was solid in her performance. It is clear after watching interviews with her and this movie she loved 'down to her heart' playing Harley Quinn.- Some of the soundtracks worked well. Keyword though, some.- The destroyed city at night provided a neat setting for the DC movie.Cons:- The movie never explains why these specific criminals (later named Suicide Squad) are needed with this mission. First of all, they are useless. A girl with a baseball bat. A guy with some boomerangs. A guy who can shoot fire but doesn't until 75 % way through the film. A guy who can apparently snipe well but has a gun that appears to do all the sniping work for him. A girl with a sword that so happens to trap the souls of its victims. And a few others. Like, how are these people supposed to fight an army? The only reason why they beat the CGI army every time is that they are guided by Navy Seals on their mission. These people are criminals, remember. They don't have anything truly special that makes them needed for the threat of Enchantress. Logically, the government would just send Batman and/or a lot of Navy Seals/Military in general. Second, again these people are criminals (except Katana). Even though they have they have these bombs attached to their necks that can be easily detonated, I'm quite surprised they even want to help the Navy Seals after the majority of the Navy Seals get killed. It gets to the point where there are the Squad and just Rick Flag alive to monitor them. Can't they just overpower him and take that bomb device away from him at that point?- The plot was 99 % stupid. It was so cringeworthy.- The script, in general, felt like some 8-year-old fanboy wrote it.- CGI was what I like to call ""very, very poorly done"".- One of the worst ideas I have seen regarding ""the heroes are the 'bad' guys, Amanda Waller is definitely evil, and the Enchantress and her army are even more bad guys than them."" I was so dumbfounded.- Why was the Joker in this movie? Had they removed him, it wouldn't make a difference since he had no impact on the plot at all. Actually, change that. Had they removed him, it would've made the movie better. He was so cringy. Furthermore, Jared Leto's performance made me question who his Joker character was even supposed to be.- Jai Courtney kinda misinterpreted who Boomerang is I think. He felt too carefree in this film.- Will Smith played Will Smith. Not Deadshot, sadly.- Cara Delevigne was so bad they could've literally picked anyone else randomly to play Enchantress and they'd have a 90 % that person would play her better.- Because the story was 99 % stupid as I said earlier, it made me forget basically all of it. I had to go to Wikipedia to remind myself what the plot was.- So, Enchantress can kiss any person and they become a minion of hers. She kisses so many and eventually has an army of them. Great, another CGI army no one cares about. I might overlook a CGI army if they actually cause legit havoc towards the protagonists, but the Suicide Squad and Navy Seals took them out with little effort whatsoever.- The majority of the soundtracks were bland, poorly made, dumb, lifeless, and/or contradictory to where the story was at any given point.",0
738,GARBAGE.This movie had to have been written by a teenager. David Ayer sucked it up royally.  So scattered and poorly done.  Terrible.  Awful.  Not even worth a redbox.,0
742,"Terrible script, the story is confusing and boring, acting was bad from most of the cast,90% of the characters were bad devoloped. One of the worst comic book movie ever made.",0
746,This movie was everything I waited for and more.The effects were amazing.Not to talk about the costumes and amazing actor choices.This is an must watch movie.To thin even villains can do a little good but only if they get what they want.Harley Quinn was my favorite one.I highly recommend this movie.,1
748,"As a fan of DC, I was disappointed a little. The reason of making the squad was completely sucks. The cast was brilliant, except for Jared Leto. It wasn't that bad, but it's not The Joker we deserve! It was really comedy and fun. And the CGI worked very well for me. The action scenes was really good too. So I liked it, but not what I expected!",1
749,"La peor película de DC hasta la fecha, los fallos están presentes en la columna estructural de la película: historia y edición. Puede gustarte el elenco o los cambios argumentales sobre los personajes pero para ser un largometraje, de cualquier tipo, es atroz.Tras la muerte de Superman el Gobierno decide crear un equipo élite para futuros eventos sobrehumanos, la idea juntar a un grupo de villanos con habilidades especificas ya que los héroes se mantienen reticentes de cooperar con el Estado. Parece una plan interesante pero al final resulta que el equipo debe detener a un compañero de equipo que no pudo ser contenido.El principal problema es la edición, que causa enormes fallos argumentales, un personaje que se dice fue dañado por los recortes de escenas es el Joker, quien termina siendo un incomprendido o un odiado por los fans del archienemigo de Batman. Otro gran problema es la producción, a pesar de que los enemigos son muy genéricos uno quiere ver escenas de acción, pero la cámara está sacudiéndose, siempre a oscuras por lo que apenas se pueden apreciar los combates.Lo único que yo puedo destacar del film es a Batman, apenas aparece, pero tiene mucha presencia y lo poco que hace es satisfactorio.En general si no la viste aprovecha que no has perdido tu tiempo, sencillamente el resultado es mediocre para lo que uno espera, hoy en día hay muchas alternativas de películas de super héroes, y ""Suicide Squad"" es una opción que conviene pasar de largo.",0
750,"Suicide Squad is a hodgepodge of ill-fated attempts to create a unique film that breaks the mold of the modern superhero movie formula. The writing is horrendous, several characters are brought in for no apparent reason (Katana and Killer Croc come to mind as both serve very little relevance to the plot), and the general plot of this movie has me questioning why I should care about it.While Smith and Robbie shine as making the most of their characters and delivering performances that have me excited for the future of their characters, the rest of the cast falls prey to poor writing and does little to try to make the most of it. In addition the third act of this film is a sequence of CGI fights that are immediately forgettable and nothing short of sheer disappointing.Following the criticism of Batman v Superman and Man of Steel for being ""too dark"", the producers of this film attempted to mimic Marvel's style of superhero film that is full of action and quips, but ultimately falls flat on its face. If any film in the DCEU is supposed to have a dark, grim tone, this is it, but reshoots and creative differences amongst the producers of this film create an inconsistent tone that makes it hard to follow.The soundtrack is random and rarely appropriate for the scene its matched with while the film feels like it is more about setting up the future of the DCEU (a future that is now just as muddy as the plot of this film) rather than telling a coherent story.Now to address the elephant in the room: the Joker. Jared Leto's Joker is far from the best representation of the Joker that we have seen on the screen and it might quite possibly be the worst. However I do believe that his iteration of the character is not complete trash as others would have you believe. Drawing from Golden Age source material (as opposed to Ledger's bronze/modern age interpretation), Leto's performance successfully portrays the ""gangster"" archetype of the Joker from that period. Nevertheless, this is not the correct version of the Joker and Leto does fail to deliver a praiseworthy performance.Suicide Squad is a mess. The DCEU is a mess. You're better off investing time in the MCU or rewatching the Dark Knight trilogy until the mess is cleaned up.",0
751,"An absolute mess of a film. Terrible script, terrible acting, inconsistent tone, a completely out of place soundtrack which is just trying to gain brownie points for throwing popular songs so the viewer goes ""Oh hey! I like that song!"" so that they may associate the god-awful scene with the good song. It only makes the scenes worse as the tone is all over the place and the song doesn't even come close to fitting the scene. And by some sort of otherworldly intervention, this is an Oscar-winning film. We are truly in a dark age of cinema.",0
752,"The movie tries to accomplish too many things at once. It tries to be both lighthearted, funny and at the same time serious, and emotional. It only comes off as a ridiculous collection of horrible cliches.The writing is bad, the directing is bad, and when these two things are bad - the actors, as good as they are, can't fix it. There is some pretty good acting - but their lines are horrible.The characters are so hollow and empty - at no point in the movie was I ever convinced, even for a minute, than any character was genuine. They all behaved shifting irregularly between overdoses of eccentricity, and overdoses of seriousness.The plot was mellow, to say the least.The ending was so bad, so cliched, I found myself grimacing, cringing, and actually fast-forwarding an overly-smeared moment of undeserved slow-motion.Nothing can fix bad writing combined with bad directing.I felt genuinely sad for the actors that agreed to take part in this ridiculous creation.I find it very sad, that managers in charge of such magnificent intellectual property characters can't find it in their minds to be original.I kept remembering how brilliant, deep, and incredibly convincing The Dark Knight movie was, and I believe a good writer, with a good director, and obviously all this needs a competent producer - could come up with a movie to blow the audience's minds and last for years and years. The Batman proved it possible.Suicide Squad feels like the production didn't even aim high, honestly - they knew people would pay money to see a high-budget super-villain movie, so nobody really cared if the movie itself was a complete disaster.And this is exactly what Suicide Squad is: an unimpressive disaster of the worst kind: the boring, cliched, daddy-jokes kind.No need to even begin to watch this - just go watch clips of the Joker & Harley on youtube - because those moments are as good as the movie gets. The rest is unnecessary garbage.",0
753,"unlike Batman v Superman, which was a borefest, this is a fun, action packed movie from start to finish with a few comedic moments to balance it out. Harley Quinn definatly steals the show, but the one misfire would be Will Smith as Deadshot, who is miscast and as usual just plays himself",1
754,"I loved the concept of the movie and the casting was quite good I'm surprised that I enjoyed Will Smith in this role, must say I think Cara wasn't a great choice as Villain, Margot Robbie WOW excellent casting and a very good portrayal.",1
756,"An absolutely terrible movie that could've been actually good but no, it has a non-sensical, illogical plot, terrible writing, terrible pacing, horrible editing (well, it's kind of expected as this was edited by a trailer studio), terrible cinematography, zero character development, bland performances, however we have a great performance of Will Smith as Will Smith. This is kind of an attempt of DC trying to have their own Guardians of the Galaxy (you know, a group of antiheroes united to defeat a bad guy), except it's not as funny, as well-written, it doesn't have a plot that makes sense and it doesn't have any style like Guardians did. Even if I don't make comparisons to GOTG, it's still an awful movie.",0
758,If I could say one good thing about this movie it lives up to its title. It makes me want to die,0
759,this is a very entertaining movie. i really liked jared leto . i think he has lots of potential,1
760,"Looking back on this film, almost four years after its release, I thank it. I thank it because this film taught me that sometimes, movies are bad.",0
761,"this film is horrible, nothing here is good, except Arlerquina and Amanda Waler, both have strong personalities and great highlights, but the film itself is very bad.",0
762,"This movies is...just **** awful. The history is so **** dumb, the action is just plain boring, the villain and it motivations is just so **** stupid, and the way they present the concept of the suicide squad in the movie is so **** dumb!!!!!!. The acting is good tho but not even Will Smith and Margot Robbie could safe this failure. In conclusion, is so **** bad, don't watch it!!!!!",0
763,"It's a pretty good film. I liked all the characters, except joker. It also has a good soundtrack.",1
764,"By far the most underrated DC movie. It’s not great, but It’s really fun And has lots of memorable characters",1
765,This movie is terrible. I would be more interested in watching a documentary on the disaster of its production than the actually movie again. It feels like a bunch of actors and their agents who have never read the comic or at least spent time to learn the characters forcing decisions on the movie.,0
767,"this movie **** sucks ass, i hate this new DC cinematic universe all the characters are **** and the joker omfg kill me.",0
768,"This is an underrated DC film. Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn is funny, Jared Leto as Joker was great, and this film had some nice action and humor. 7/10",1
769,"A film that relies on pure action and a good soundtrack only became popular because of the DC characters featured in this joke of a movie. The movie fails to make me care about the characters, even with backstories, the attempt of making me feel bad for the villains and making them all appear to be ""good"" dulled down the tone for me. Character casting and costume/makeup were the shining stars of this film and made the trip to the theaters somewhat worth it. I noticed many unnecessary parts of this film especially the inclusion of The Joker who added nothing but filler to this film. The main ""villain"" of this film was so forgettable that all I truly remember of her is how she looked, I felt no need to root for either side in the battles. A pointless movie for the plot of DC and only happened because of Superman's ""death"" in Batman vs Superman. A dead-end movie that only worsens DC's name and makes viewers feel embarrassed as they walk out of the theater. I feel truly sorry for anyone who was introduced to DC through this movie and I hope DC forgets about this failed attempt.",0
771,Wow I don't understand how this movie isn't named as one of the greatest movies of all time ever in a million years. I loved Banjo the movie,1
