0,"What does it matter if a film stays close to the book if some people haven't even read the book. Anyone could make an exact rendering of the book, but it's the originality and creativity that is put into adaptations (though not this one) that make it exciting and worthwhile. This films was incredibly boring and almost corny at times. Lautner can't act to save his life sadly, and most of the time when he's trying to be dramatic, he is actually funny. What a poorly made film.",0
2,"I felt that by watching this movie I had opened the door of judgment on tween-girl fandom, and my exclusion hit as I felt the cold abyss stared back at me, daring me to defy it. Yes, I had entered the Twilight zone, and I had no place being there (nor would anyone with any critical sense)",0
3," This movie was awful. I went in to see it with my girlfriend as she's somehow interested in these fake vampire movies. This movie is nothing more than softcore porn for women. If you've seen this, you'll know what I mean by that. About the characters, the two main characters are just plain dumb, Bella's just a self-absorbed bitch who teases other guys, but in the end just mopes about the seemingly autistic ""vampire."" Since when could vampires be in sunlight? And when did they start to sparkle? Jesus, I think I'll need a bottle of whiskey to down this god-awful movie with. A fun after-movie fact was, that when I asked my GF about the movie's plot, she actually was like: ""What plot?"" Anyway, I've got a bottle of whiskey to drink. Cheers!",0
4,"While the first one gave us the ridiculous idea that vampires sparkle, this one implies that werewolves are really creatures that shapeshift whenever they want. Is Stephanie Meyer trying to ridicule the horror genre?",0
5,A seriously dumb movie.  Even the special effects are wimpy.  I had hoped to find some thrill in all the beefcake noted in the trailers.  But even that is wasted.,0
6, This movie rocks if you're a 14 year old girl who just had her first period. Seriously.,0
7, Garbage!,0
8," One of the worst movies I've seen on my life of my life with Gigli, Saw VI, one missed call and the first one too! pure vampire and werewolf incoherence!",0
9,"This has to be the worst sequel that I've ever seen. It's dull,I mean it is SO BORING! Very disappointment! You know why this film so bad? Because of those lovey dovey cast and some lovey dovey dopey story,nothing else. It's almost bas as the first one,just the same logic of the sequel. WHAT A RIP-OFF! No other Box-Office Hit couldn't be good like this. I guess that the Twilight franchise wasn't too memorable and not even too good for the series. It's just downhill from there. Even of course it's a viewers flop and of course there's nothing creativity about this movie,it's just the romantic movie with too many cliches and putting into a vampire of crap,that's all I have. But it's bad,it's really,really bad!",0
10," The movie sucked. I almost fell asleep in some parts because it's so boring. It's always cheap lines to make the audience laugh, and stupid 16 year old girls distracting in the row behind you. Worst film of all time.",0
12,"There's nothing good about this movie. And you're only gonna embarrass yourself by trying to explain why it's so good. Actually, I'm mistaken- That awkward elevator scene was hilarious! If you were going to watch this movie just for the laughs, don't even bother. Just youtube that elevator scene. It's amazing.",0
13,"Bad performances, and some terribly written dialogue, not to mention its long running time, which makes it unentertaining, this film does have some great romance and an impressive budget though, but it fails to impress. I give this film a 25% of a good movie.",0
14, I thought this movie was pure garbage. it was 2 hours of a confused.,0
16,"When you have a new True Blood airing every Sunday on HBO, this sexless, bloodless Twilight follow-up stings sour and is only worsened by some really terrible acting.",0
17," The film New Moon is a film that calls us, we can not release the film before the end. Is perfect.",1
18," I am 37 year male fan of Twilight Books. I have also been with my wife in Montepulciano, Italy when New Moon was filming. That, by the way, was really interesting experience. We visited Voltera, too. And compared it to filming location. We have seen New Moon 1st time yesterday and was bit confused - it seemed rushed and chunky - good but not satisfying. But after 2nd viewing today - I must say that rhythm is very good and anything clicked. So, if you are really interested in Saga - I strongly recommend to watch it at least two times. Enjoy",1
19," The film New Moon is a film that calls us, we can not release the film before the end.",1
20," The film remained true to the book, and it's the most important thing. Amazing soundtrack. Big plus to the director for pulling out some of those funny moments - it's refreshing and gives more space to breathe (sort of).",1
21,"This movie is a disgrace to Twilight fans. I was surprisingly impresssed with the first one, but I was extremely disappointed with this one.  I was not at all impressed with the over all feel of the movie. I blame that on the director switch.  I felt that in the first one all of the actors did an outstanding job of bringing their characters to life, but that dropped with NewMoon. If it wasn't for the fact that every girl/woman in the country can't keep their eyes off him, I'm pretty sure Lautner would be fired - his acting is almost amusing. Overall the whole movie is pretty cheesy, I felt like I was watching one of those online spoofs, rather than the real thing. Don't waste your time with this film.",1
22," This movie was fabulous. I went in with really high expectations, which usually lets me down... but not today. It was just as good as I thought it was going to be.",1
23," The film New Moon is a film that calls us, we can not release the film before the end of history than others, but especially, every action, every scene that is passing the film gets better, begins and ends perfect perfect.",1
24," The film New Moon is a film that calls us, we can not release the film before the end of history than others, but especially, every action, every scene that is passing the film gets better, begins and ends perfect perfect.",1
25," No words needed!! Loved it all the way, looking forward to Eclipse.",1
26," Love it...great movie, want to see it again.",1
27, New Moon is better than Twilight as it is more faithful to the book and also has used CGI and action scenes nicely.It captures the gist of the book very effectively and is entertaining with a slight touch of humor.It also interprets the characters in a more detailed way than Tilight did.,1
29," 100% perfection. True to book. Strong acting. Great CGI. Great Soundtrack and song placement. Amazing visually. Brought on the tears and giggles with effortless ease. Flowed well. Was everything I waited a year for hoping it would be. Thank you Mr. Weitz, you made my visions come true and bettered them with much style and grace. This is the real thing next to Twilight. Makes Twilight look like a joke. New Moon is first class directing, acting, and a movie lovers kinda movie. I say see it in the theaters people!",1
30, I loved this movie! my friend found most of it at www.watchfreelinks.com check it out!,1
31," new moon is too much,. the actors are beautiful,. I liked a lot, how is it that a movie that has the tickets out and about to have that note?! this can only be Marxist thing these men do not admit that the movie is good, because it is your nature to be so stubborn, stupid and unbearable. I do not emporte with these criticisms, because I know there are many people out there who also liked the film, and he thinks too much, ah who did not like FUCK.",1
32," Not as bad as they want you to believe. Sure, some cheesy dialogue and over acting, but overall, a really good movie. Don't listen to the whiners, see it for yourself.",1
33," this movie was GREAT.. Chris really does know how to coordinate everything... the wolfs were just amaaaazing, and the score, by Alexandre Desplat, is so emotional and touching... a brilliant movie, 1000000 times better that TWI-shit.",1
34," I fell in love with this movie from the moment it began to the end; of course no movie is as good as the books. But there was action, fantasy, drama, and adventure!! If you haven",1
35,"not an excellent movie, but its perfect and it beats the first movie in just one shot.",1
38,"I have to say...way better than the first movie!  I was just obset when I found out that Bella was going to go save Edward after he hurt her like that. What the hell is wrong with her?   This movie had more action,the script was not as slow,and the actors were great! They really did improve from the last movie!  I was so excited when Jacob (Taylor Lautner) did not have his wig on anymore!!! He looks so much better without his wig!!! That Tattoo just makes him look so f***ing sexy and his abs...his abs are just wow!  I am the future Ms.Lautner!",1
39," What do you call a vampire movie with no action/horror and what do you call a romance with no chemistry/sex? Apparently you call it NEW MOON, but to anyone who actually can tell the difference between a good story from a bad one, you'll just call it BORING. The werewolves (if you can even call them that) have really bland FX, and they may look good compared to Twilight's FX, but that's because the FX found in Twilight were the quality of a Syfy Original. I won't get into the whole vampire glitter thing, either, nor will I bother trying to debate the logic of a 100 year old male going to high school over and over (I guess home schooling doesn't exist in Forks?) to score with 16 year old tail - in particular, the 16 year old tail of a brooding, angsty, emo girl who really needs to be put on medication. Wow, what a match made in Heaven. The 2 in my score is entirely for Taylor Lautner's abs. The dude hit the gym HARD for this movie, I respect that.",0
40, Indisputable proof that our culture is intellectually bankrupt!,0
41," Hated the first movie, but tried to go into this one with an open mind. Some parts were corny, and sappy, and made me want to vomit up my plastic special edition tub of twilight popcorn, but there were some scenes that were quite intense and very well done. It followed the book almost perfectly...except I thought the movie was better than the book... sorry Meyer.",1
42, I loved this movie. So not a disappointment!,1
43," Awful film. Bad books made into worse movies. Awful acting, god-awful script, hideous CGI. Jacob is the only character who actually has character but thats like saying he is as charming as a brick. The plot is freakin stupid. Edward leaves because Bella gets a papercut? It just proves he doesn't even care about her dispite the fact that this is a love movie. I can see why he doesn't care about her because Bella is one of the worse teenager in recent memory. ",0
44," This movie was much better than Twilight. I solid addition to the saga. Had some funny cheesy parts that could not be avoided. Be sure to read the book, some parts of the plot were overlooked due to the assumption that the audience knows how they got there. It isn't a masterpiece, but for what it is, they did a great job, however, I was excited to see it. I knew I would like it, but from as close to an objective standpoint as I can be, if you liked the books, go see the movie. If you didn't read/like the books, don't see it.",1
45, Maybe would have been better with different actors but with these emotionless stalefaces I just wanted to walk out.,0
46, New Moon handily wins WMOTY wost movie of the year!,0
49," Being a middle-aged man who writes screenplays i like to stay abreast of what is successful. I was pleasantly surprised by the first twilight movie. It had tension as Bella puzzled about Edward, then after realizing what he is, the tension became over the consummation question. Becoming a vampire is the metaphorical equivalent of sex and the tension and chemistry between the actors held my interest. Not the case with the new one. I found it interminably boring. I've seen Kristen Stewart in 4 films and the only one she has believable romantic chemistry is Twilight. Perhaps she has authentic off-screen feelings for Pattinson so she showed that in the first film. But there's no chemistry between her and Lautner, her and Eisenberg in Adventureland or her and Sanford in some crappy indie. She has much appeal in many ways and is not nearly as bad as Scarlett Johansen, but she has to grow. The film as a whole was overlong, boring and weak. It repeated the same plot devices as the first film, this time it's lautner with a secret. And how many solemn promises can these guys break? If you aren't a die-hard twilight fan - skip it.",0
50," I've would likely give this a 0, but the cinematography (which is grand) makes up for that. Also New Moon is a slow-moving movie unlike Twilight (which was straightforward and easy to understand). And I slightly think Robert Pattinson had bad acting throughout the Twilight Saga. Lastly, I highly recommend to read the book first, then see the movie.",0
51," The film was good, not extremely good. It pleased me. It was cool to see. I have fun.",1
52," The movie overall was very dull, the so called ""thrilling action"" parts put me to sleep. Plus for the most part you see Bella weeping and screaming for her Edward, give me a break and cry me a river. The story was good but the really bad acting by Stewart ruined the whole movie, her face looked a rock, pale and emotionless. Overall this movie was a complete waste of my time and my money,and doesn't even deserve to be called a movie anymore.",0
53," I did not see this movie for fear of adding to the already appalling figures it has managed to garner, but after seeing the original I can safely say that no film bearing the twilight name could possibly be meritorious of anything higher.",0
54, This movie was offensive to me as someone who likes good movies and literature.,0
55," A bunch of mopey teens standing around (literally, they DO just stand around for the entire film) as some soon-to-be-dated pop songs play in the background. People actually like this??",0
56, The first vampire film I've ever seen that is boring... maybe boring is too kind of a word.,0
57," Not worth the price of admission to me, but if your a teenage girl it presses all the right buttons. I liked it better than the first one, better special effects.",0
58," I thought nothing was worse than the original ""Twilight"" movie. I was wrong.",0
59, UGGHHH...they're not even real vampires! If you are love this movie and your not in high school you have issues.,0
60," If you're a fan of the Twilight books then you will more then likely enjoy New Moon. It follows the book VERY closely and it is definitely better then Twilight. Some scenes are corny, but it is a romance after all. My boyfriend, who is by no means a fan, enjoyed it as well. He was a fan of the wolves as compared to the vampires. New Moon the movie = Extreme fast forward of New Moon book.",1
62," Just another excuse for girls to keep making fun of anyone who they think is beneath their status (I'll include parents, because they have to put up with this 24/7), and prefer image over what's beneath. But in a vampire movie? Well, fear no more, vampire fans who are still out there. Daybreakers.",0
63, Bashing my head against a wall would be less painful then this.,0
64, A lot of style. No substance.,0
65," Poor acting and poor story. Absolute garbage! Yeah, a bunch of ugly guys with abs, TOP WRITING THERE! This is the dumbest series.",0
66, The love triangle is really compelling and this movie is much better than Twilight.,1
67,"An absolutely fantastic film, i enjoyed every second of it. it is an amazing novel to film adaptation and captured the feelings that bella felt for edward when he left and her new feelings for jacob. the depression was done well but the action scenes were top notch with an excellent cliff hanger that left people literally begging for the sequal",1
68," This movie is the worst movie i have ever watched, i can not believe i wasted my money on a movie that has horrible actors and a extremely bad story line. In my opinion the Twilight saga itself should not exist.",0
69," I'm a long time horror movie fan (I even know the people who did the FX for Sleep Away Camp & C.H.U.D.) so don't try to feed me crap about most positive reviewers being women. For me there can never be enough female nudity in ""men oriented"" movies, so if women want to see topless guys then more power to them. I expected to hate both of these movies when my wife forced me to see them and ended up thinking they were both ok for what they are. More along the lines of Lost Boys for this generation than a true vampire or werewolf movie.",1
70," If you liked Twilight, New Moon was even better! I highly recommend it!! The movie was over 2 hours but it seemed like 20 min. Loved it....",1
71, Another drone of a movie that is going to be wildly popular with the masses of sheep despite shoddy plot loaded with holes and weak acting. Not to mention further killing the traditional vampire in this mtv society.,0
72," Poorly acted, poorly written, dreadfully slow and horribly shot.",0
73," Please, stop that shit! We´re destroying our kids, our books, our movies, we are hitting culture in the fucking balls! New Moon sucks, like Twilight. It´a product, not a movie. The books are teen´s minds-controllers, not books. Please, see M-O-V-I-E-S (Agora, Diary of Noa) and read B-O-O-K-S (Harry Potter, Pilars of Earth, A World Without End, Fatima´s Hand) but not this, please. NOT THIS.",0
75," This was a movie made for the fans, not to please everybody else. The movie was extremely close to how the book played out and if you haven't read the books then honestly you will NOT get it.",1
76," Only those interested in the books and previous film will be happy with this. Everyone else will regard it as a junk film. The bad acting, overuse of male topless nudity and terrible lines are only just watchable if you turn your brain off, but anyone who has no interest in this will be unable to watch for more than a few seconds. I give it a 1, and that's being extremely generous.",0
77," Acting is terrible, dialog is straight from mtv. I dont get how people can enjoy this junk.",0
78," If only actors could be better than them. The worst of all is beautiful Kirsten Steward. I'm sad for her because the succes of Twilight movies will keep her far from learning acting skills, she will be like Jennifer Lopez. She don't even know how to speak to be listen. I had never read the books but I feel that New Moon is more in feelings than in images, and that's why the film is so boring. I don't think this film is better than the first, at least the other one was cheap and unpretencious, but I still remember the music and the baseball play. It was more rock and roll, which means more romantic. This one is a ""mexican telenovela"" with more investment in special effects but no invest in best make up. I really believe the film had to start with Bella's jumping the cliff and then explain whatever they want to explain about the risk of being a human sorrounded by vampires, and wolfs, which is not bad concept at all.",0
79," Bella, Edward a love story for the ages. Yeah, right. Teenage girls believe this sorry excuse of a movie which doesn",0
80," I'm not a fan of Twilight Saga, although I did enjoy the books. The movie, hoverer, is a disaster. The worst is of course Stewart. Her acting is horrible, she looks emotionless, is unable to potray any deeper emotions, has one facial expression during the whole movie (and open mouth, as a bonus). The crucial scene when Edward was leaving Bella in the forest was not only dull and boring but I would even say hiliarious in it's trying-so-hard-to-be-hearbreaking form that reminds us all of low quality romances and old cheap movies. The dialogues can be good for a trailer but while watching the whole movie they seem unfinished, what makes them sometimes hard to understand for people who hadn't read the book. The ending also is sort of confusing and I got the impression of missing scenes that should be there. I also don't appreciate the look of Edward who is supposed to be an 18 year old and still is dressed in suits, not casual clothes teenagers wear. Not loving the books, I still felt someting while reading them, the plot was gripping, I read them all in few days. The movie I found annoying and because I didn't want to wast the money for a ticked I forced myslelf to think it's funny.",0
81," utterly boring, soppy, drags like a cat with no back legs, just another flick for the ugly 14 year old goth girls out there that nothing ever goes right for. completely boring, it doesn't even make you think you just sit and wait for the next cheesy line to come along and believe me there are plenty, i wouldn't even call it a love story as they've gone past that, they've taken it to the extreme of a massively long soap opera x10! disgraceful.",0
83, It,0
84," The books were okay...I would give the BOOK at 5, but this movies just turned into a JOKE! Sorry Twilight fans out there.",0
85," Great sound track. Director is really good but its let down by crappy acting. Though I don't really have a problem with all these reviews, I think, if you're a teen or a pre-teen, don't take the words of the majority of these reviewers. It's not reviewed by you or for you, but rather for an adult audience. You'll probably love the movie if your in the 13-17 age range.",1
86," Soon to be one of the most overrated movies of the decade.The acting was less than average, the comedy was deadpan, and the dialogue, dear god, the dialogue was like some overlong text message. I went and saw this with a bunch of girls and they all loved it cause Taylor whatshisface takes off his shirt for no reason. Let me put it this way, This is a straight guy's worst nightmare!",0
87," I have never read any of the books, nor seen either movie. But just looking at the movie characters, then the fans makes me want to rip my eyes and ears completely off. Anyone who enjoys this crap needs to read...lets see...ANYTHING EVER WRITTEN to see how real people enjoy real literature and cinema And hes, ii am saying your not real people. LET THE CRYING BEGIN!!!",0
88," Yes, okay, it is a bit sloppy and very 'teen'...the plot isn't the one that critics most like but...people...the book was a HUGE best seller and trust me...this one does SOOO much justice to the book...in fact it's better. For the ones who missed edward in the book...well, you don't get to miss him...and, for the ones who go on team jacob...you defenately will be satisfied. It's NOT a bad movie, or a bad script...the thing is that critics are really critisising the book because, this movie is better than twilight and, man, is it good. I don't think that many people could really dislike it if they sat down and decided to have some fun for a while. Great soundtrack, btw.",1
89," I like Catherine Hardwicke better as a director, but there was still a lot that was good in New Moon. It's true that the two hours flew by like twenty minutes. I almost wish it were longer so that some of the emotion could have been built up more.",1
90," I didn't have the greatest expectations for this film but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a really beautifully crafted film and very true to the book. They captured the highs and lows of teenage love very accurately and it was great to see Jacob's character developed. I'm sorry to see all the very low scores by people, clearly a tepid attempt at lowering the over all user rating. I think most people who have read the book will be happy with the result.",1
91," Abysmal acting, writing, editing, screenplay. Just abysmal, this film hasn't a sliver of quality in it. And having to listen the fans going ""Oh my God I'm gonna cry!"" when the film begins is more than enough to make you leave the theater.",0
92," This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Like an atmospheric episode of 90210 expanded to a mind-numbing 2+ hours. Mind you, this is a vampire movie with no blood. No fangs. No sex. No plot ... utter trash. The theater was packed. There were police outside. Giant lines around the block. The crowd was SO PUMPED they screamed at the opening titles in frenzied anticipation. I thought, ""This movie is going to be nuts with audience reaction/participation."" I've been to those action flix in downtown Bklyn where the crowd is SHOUTING at the actors (""DON'T GO IN THAT ROOM, MONTEL!!""). This was going to be a similar phenomenon. ... then for 2+ hours the audience sat there almost completely silent (stunned? stupefied? bored?), save for a few twitters and giggles when the male actors took their shirts off (?!) that joint should have been ROCKING!!",0
93," When you're trying to make a long movie, you need to keep the audience gripped. New Moon fails to even keep you gripped for the first 5 minutes. It also seems like anti feminist propaganda with girls effectively being told to be doting to your boyfriends, even if they are jerks.",0
94," Loved it, followed the book very well. Could not expect more from a ficton, fantasy aspect. To all the critis giving this movie a F, what were you thinking your were going to see in a film with a Vampire and a Warewolf as its' main leads? This could never be a Titanic or Apollo 13. I think we all could use two hours of enjoying a world of anything is possible. We just might smile more.",1
95, Only someone incapable of mature thought could enjoy this movie.,0
96," The worst vampire movie ever, totally boring. Fell asleep more than once.",0
97," It's OK, little boring but there are some scenes very spectacular. I love Jane, so evil.",1
98, A horrible movie the stars in it including that robert person and that one guy taylor should die.,0
99, A tedious movie that manages to wring the life out of every second of its 130 minute running time. ..130 minutes of life I'd like back.,0
100," I enjoyed the first movie and have watched it many times on dvd. By comparison, this movie lost the wider community interaction, fun spirit, and sense of existance. New Moon was just a bunch of wind sweap scenes of moaning over the next untouchable, yet 'promising to protect you and be yours forever"" guy. I know there was a lot to get covered, but the movie was just dull. The slo mo action scenes (carpet blood flight, fighting wolves) just made me think of computers and think at least about the better direcion in Buffy/ Angel. I thought Hardwicke and team's music choices really blended well and added, while NM music was just tv-inspired mood backdrop. I did enjoy the boy flesh (go Team Jacob!). NM made me just wish Edward would go away.",0
101," Terrible, i can't believe how popular this series is! The story seemed over dramatic and the characters where depressed the whole time. The special effects weren't very good, and the dialogue wasn't good either. Although I must say that there is a lot of eye-candy, but that's not the point. This movie is only for girls 13-16 years old. Anyone else, stay away!!!",0
102," Worst piece of crap I have ever seen. It didn't help that I had to be dragged to the theatre to even see it. The Twilight Saga in general is a complete and utter disappointment to literature and cinema, it needs to be put down like a suffering dog.",0
103, Garbage!,0
105," Much more faithfull to the book, great acting (specially Dakota F., Taylor L., Billy B.), much better directing. Overall the history was way more interesting and appealing than the first movie. Congrats Chris Weitz.",1
106," What are vampires that don't drink human blood, don't have fangs and don't parish in the sunlight? Super-heroes without a gimick? You tell me. Both this and the first movie were AWFUL. I love my niece but I will never forgive her for making me sit through both of these. Poorly written, poorly acted, no actual plot and far too much dialogue for you to consider this anything other than a some sort of Lifetime made-for-tv movie with ""vampires"". People on here comparing this to Romeo and Juliet have clearly never read Romeo and Juliet. And the other thing I've notice, and clearly I am not the first, is that all of the positive comments are female composed. Oh well. I guess we get 300 and Troy and a bunch of other cheesey brutish flicks and they get Twilight. Maybe some day they'll actually start producing good, substantial movies again.",0
107, This was the worst movie I've seen in over a decade.,0
108," The movie is much better understood if you have read the book first. Hopefully in the next movie it will be made for ""adults"" and not hold back on some major plot issues.",1
109, That was the worst piece of crap I have ever watched. Pootie Tang is a better movie.,0
110, I should almost give it a 1 because it certainly does exist. But it is just so shamelessly horrible and a disgrace to good film making across the world. Please enjoy the absurd amount of money you've made stephanie meyer and do us all a favor: NEVER WRITE ANYTHING ELSE AGAIN.,0
111," And I thought Disney's 'The Rocketeer' was the worst alltime, but this movie has now joined it!! How many times can Bella get hurt and somehow be saved?! How many times can they show Werewolf boy Jacob with his shirt off?! Give me a break, I've seen better plots, acting, and action from movies made in the 1950's. Stop being so rigid and entertain the rest of us!!!",0
112," This is probably the worst movie I've seen all Year. If you are a 13 - 16 year old girl, then it's just a phase. Otherwise, there's nothing that redeems this movie's torturously slow pace, Unbroken depressive moodiness, and complelete failure to feature satisfying action in such a super-hyped blockbuster. The female lead grates on the nerves the whole movie, and the male lead is non-existent. It gets a grudging one point from me because for a whole 7-8 minutes in that entire movie there was an actual vampire fight that gave insight into the relative strengths, powers, and weaknesses of the vampires in this world. Also, for the first time ever, at the end of these seven minutes, it turns out that Bella might not be completely worthless and defenseless. In summary, the entire film could be reduced to the audience with the Elder Italian Vampire Clan, and the audience would have seen everything worth seeing, regarding the male and female leads. Except that her friend is a werewolf, but she ditches him , so it doesn't really matter. I encourage others to vote this down so low that it winds up on the worst movies top 200.",0
113, I just can't describe how terrible this film was.,0
114," It's a movie for the fans of the twilight books, if you don't like the books, don't bother at all. I really love the twilight universe and enjoyed this movie a lot. A lot of details came straight out of the book and the actors did a great job, giving the fans the characters they love. The werewolves were anlmated in an amazing way and the action was better then in the first movie. Cant' wait for the next one!!",1
115, It,0
116," This series won't hold up over the long run (like Harry Potter and LOTR) unless it improves with the next film. Many things that happened weren't explained very well - you know, not everyone read the books. And it was definitely slow in some parts. On it's own, the film was entertaining enough but I liked the first one better.",1
117, If I'd wanted to see depressed high school kids standing around moping for two hours I'd have a better time going to the mall to hang out with the emo kids.,0
118," WOW was this movie bad. Bad acting, laughable dialogue, bad music, and LONG! I must have looked at my watch 4 times wondering if the torture would EVER end. I am giving it a ""1"" because Michael Sheen was good in his very brief moment. It was amazing when someone who could actually ACT came on the screen. Otherwise a zero for sure.",0
119, This installment is actually an upgrade from the Twilight given its comparative lack of sappy romance and more action driven acting. I still cant stand Kristen's portrayal of bella. you would think some form of variation to her facial expression would be beneficial to overall definition of happy and sad times.,1
120," I am only giving this a 2 because of Taylor Lautner's amazing body, talent and good sense of humor in the midst of such otherwise poor acting ability and a terribly pathetic WB-esque series of films. I gave this film a chance because I thought the books were decent, albeit ridiculous, though after all this sick, childish mania I've even turned from those. The only thing that saves this film is the man-candy that are the La Push werewolves. But Sparkles and Pathetic Swan could be killed off and these films still wouldn't have a prayer. It's painful to see what this ridiculous series has reduced vampires to. I sincerely hope this is forgotten as quickly as it began so Hollywood can make room for some real vampire films. This crap can stick to television and sad, emo teenagers who have no concept of the level of awesomeness required to make a real vampire film. No more of this vampire literature blasphemy.",0
121," Moronic and mind-numbing. Is the female youth of today really this undemanding? No wonder the divorce rate is so high. A bunch of vapid characters glaring at each other and muttering lines that are sappier than a maple tree. This is what constitutes entertainment today for this age group? At least 300 taught boys some history. The saddest part is, Romeo and Juliet (which this story weakly alludes to) is 1000% better (and more romantic), yet it's next to impossible to interest young girls in Shakespeare because we've replaced the teaching of Classics in our schools with doo-doo like this. When are we going to see movies where young girls are intelligent, capable, determined, and set on forging their own destinies. Somebody please give Joss Whedon $200 million dollars. PLEASE.",0
124," It's not as bad as everyone thinks it is. Solid storyline, some moments of action, and much better than the first one. I feel Chris Weitz did a pretty good job, but no one gives him credit.",1
125," I haven't seen this movie, and I don't have to in order to understand what type of stunted psyche would enjoy this crap. It would take a complete moron to enjoy literary and cinematic drivel such as this. Either that or a teenager. The death of cinema beckons, oh Twilight. Answer its call.",0
126," Despite having to much melodrama senses, good enough to see again.",1
127," I gave the books a try, wasn't all impressed with the preteen angst romance thing. Gave the first movie a chance. Something about sparkly indecisive vampires isn't too impressive. Anne Rice got it right. Not twilight. This movie is FOR preteen girls hoping to see a bare chest. My opinion? Kristin Stewart's acting is HORRIBLE. She's emotionless and bland and just not the right person to play the role of a love sick teenager. The hospital scene in the first one was retarded, her deadpan voice was not at all convincing. All in all, she ruins the movies. Robert Patterson isn't any better. I think the two 'main stars' of the movie are the worst things about it. The rest of the actors at least know how to portray a character.",0
128," I really enjoyed this movie, for a person who thought the first one was pretty bad. I havent read the books, so I'm judging this movie only. The dialog was still perty weak, but the action made up tenfolds. Yes, Bella's bitchy, but what can you do? Overall, solid movie, in my opinion. Hopefully this helped.",1
129," Just another MTV mess with no real acting, campy dialogue, and shoddy semi-existent plot. The only reason I'll give it a one is because of the mass of shirtless hot dudes.",0
130," Look...if you don't like the books, or if you haven't read the books...don't watch the movie. These movies are meant to be fun for the fans, nothing more, nothing less. I'm sick of all the f**ktards that hate on this franchise without reading the books just because they think it makes them look ""cool"" or just because the franchise is popular. For what this movie is, I thought it was pretty well-done. The acting and dialogue were a bit spotty at some points, but it was very faithful to the book and pretty cool to look at. If you like the books or if you liked the first film (or both), you will love the hell out of this. If you don't like the franchise, DON'T F**KING WATCH THE MOVIE JUST SO YOU CAN BITCH ABOUT IT. I rest my case.",1
131, This movie is slower than tar in winter. The first action of the movie is at 1hr 15min and that lasts for 2 minutes. I like Kristen Stewart but the bad dream scenes with her screaming in agony in bed almost made me leave the movie THREE times... I wish someone sucked the life force out of me before this movie did. The sad thing is the movie will make millions says a lot about our over hyped and mind numbing standards.,0
132," Was sooo excited to see this movie and was glad that it wasn't as chessy as the 1st. thought I was watching a after school special with twilight. thought new moon was much better, felt they had a couple silly parts i could have done w/out but it, for the most part it flowed nicely and was what every girl wants in a movie.",1
134," Since this was not my favorite book of the series, I went in with low expectations. This is was a movie with no plot, poorly acted, there was no flow and it was very disjointed and slow. It was surprisingly far worse then I could have expected. I bumped it up to a 1 because there were a few lines I enjoyed even if poorly delivered.",0
135," I don't get why critics are giving this bad reviews, I thought it was all around a good movie with little errors. It wasn't perfect, but it was well made.",1
136," I do not understand why critics are giving this movie bad ratings, i think its great, it was well made with good effects and a great adaption. People need to change their votes.",1
138," I thought the movie followed the book pretty closely. My daughter and I really enjoyed the movie. I did not think it was boring or overly long. Out of all of the books in this series, New Moon was the slowest, so perhaps that's why people are disappointed. I think the next movie will be even better because the book is so full of action. I thought the actors were really good and had great chemistry. This movie basically sets the scene and characters for the next two movies so some of the slow stuff was necessary. I think Kristen Stewart is the perfect Bella and Taylor Lautner was a great Jacob. Robert Pattinson is OK as Edward though; not my favorite. I liked this movie a lot better than the first.",1
139," What's most important in a love story? Two completely likable characters. Unfortunately, Bella and Edward do not qualify. Bella is a co-dependent, selfish, teasing, manipulative, emotionless hack of a character that nobody can, and shouldn't, relate to. When she gets dumped by Edward, she rides with bikers, throws herself off a cliff, and crashes a motorcycle that results in a bad head injury solely just to fuel her adrenaline-induced hallucinations of Edward. Edward, on the other hand, is nothing more than physically dangerous and emotionally abusive. The highlight of his character happens not too far into the movie where he tries to 'protect' Bella from a fellow vampire set off by her blood. His first instinct is to push her out of the way and into a plate glass table while running at mach 5. After that, he dumps her. New Moon, much like Twilight, just serves as eye candy to underage girls and single women. There's not a hint of a true romance here. Titanic and Beauty and the Beast still stand as my favorite romance movies because I could relate to the characters, and I wanted them to get together. Anybody that relates to either of these characters needs some serious help.",0
140," Worst movie ever! Although I should give it a star for making me laugh so often at the horrible acting, awful screenplay, and giggling girls and grown women. Every time Edward opened his mouth, i could not stop from laughing . Waste of time and money, unless you want to laugh at a movie not intended to be funny. Stay away!",0
142, Ass. Pure ass. Never have I seen such a piece of crap. Oh wait. Never have I WATCHED a piece of crap.,0
143," Not as bad as they want you to believe. Better than the cheesy, sappy, and relatively useless book that is New Moon.",1
144, I wished I was dead...and not in a good way.,0
145," I love how many of the reviews basically boil down to ""if your a fan of the books than you'll love this movie!"" Wouldn't it be easier to just say ""if your a mindless idiot with no taste you will love these movies!"" Of course if you love the books you'll love the movies. The books are perhaps one of the worst written novels of all time. Terrible plot, terrible grammar, vapid shallow characters, and a horrible of example of what love should be. The movie mirrors all of this perfect. You watch the movie almost thinking they intended to parody themselves.",0
146,"Crap personified. A sequel for the brain dead bunch, who believe Twilight is vampires at their perfection. Well guess what? IT'S FAR FROM IT! Allow me to sum up Twilight in 10 words! ""I'm brooding!"" ""I love you"" Sparkle, Fight, Shine, Crap, End! If there is a god, he'll/she'll immediatley cancel the two sequels, burn all footage of all 4 films and erase this pathetic excuse for a vampire saga from everybody's memories.",0
147,"I'll admit it I actually liked the first one, but this was a terribly boring piece of crap, it took nothing that made the first one enjoyable, I highly recommend on not watching this.",0
153,"Uhhh WTF did I just watch. I haven't read the book but the entire film seems so unrealistic as in the situations will just never happen some of you may say ""well thats coz its a fantasy film noob"" well LOTR was a fantasy film and it was more realistic than this pile of garbage I mean wtf.",0
154,"The sequel to one of the worst films ever made takes the crown of being the actual worst film ever made. At what point in the film is anything interesting, and when is the plot anything more than tedious? This really is a film franchise that needs to end, and it wont be missed by the film-going community when it does, that can be said.",0
159,"Well what can be said for this ridiculous, sopey un emotionally romantic movie that hasn't already been said. Well i only just watched these films and let me tell you this it felt like someone stuck my testicles into a blender and put it on the slowest speed possible. these films are terrible.",0
160,"I am unable to criticize too much a film but in this case, yes. New Moon is certainly one of the most morally harmful to the film world. I still can not believe that the is love between Edward and Belle. Edward that moves away from Belle so as not to hurt (which, however, the wounds). Belle gets depressed and is four months without doing anything to fight back, then he consoles himself with Jacob and then it happens here in the chaos. I do not understand how can people like this saga.",0
161,"I liked it a lot more then the first film. The only real flaws about it though is that the acting is a little disapointing, Besides that it was actually pretty good, I enjoyed it.",1
163,"Absolutely horrible. ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is a dull, slow-paced sequel, which has terrible and cheesy dialogue and acting. I have no further interest in checking out the rest of the series after watching this junk.",0
165,"I am not the kind of person to dismiss a film purely based on the franchise (see my other Twilight reviews some of which are positive/mixed) from which it comes from no matter how annoying the fans may be. New Moon is simply put one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was slow, with no tension and no emotion portrayed in an awful performance by Kristen Stewart. How anyone could think this to be a good film is beyond me.",0
167,"Secretly, this film has to be a COMEDY. It is hilariously God-awful. Effects are crap, and the plot (based on the equally dull and mudane books- are in some ways classically awful.) Anyways, I am a teenage girl and find the whole thing a giant manipulation of those who can't think. It's not about intelligence, this is supposed to be ENJOYED. When something is successful, people like to complain about it; which is natural. However, Twilight and the whole saga deserve the **** it gets. It's horrendously awful. BOO, you whore!",0
169,One of the worst sagas ever made.,0
170,"I have seen the first movie, and then this, what is this, I asked to my self. The action is not good, the acting can be better and the story is not good. Than there are the parts where the actors say nothing and do nothing. Worst movie of the saga.",0
171,"Não acho que sequências são ruins mas no caso de crepúsculo o primeiro já foi ruim,e o segundo se superou chato pra c***lho,sem emoção sem vida chato pra c***lho",0
173,"A HUGE improvement over the first film and a better acted and more entertaining film that the first one.  Plus, the music is beautiful, the cinematography is beautiful, the story is more interesting, the visuals vastly improved from the first film.  I enjoyed this film and find it entertaining and it is a good film in terms of films.",1
174,"Boasting unintentionally humorful acting performances and an embarrassingly terrible screenplay, 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' is the worst fantasy film in recent memory.",0
175,"The first Twilight film  was decent now this one is just the same as the first one but way way way more melodramatic, it's a cheesy cornball opera with cliche's. The way that vampire movies are made it's almost feels like a cheesy terrible play, the only film that works as the best vampire film  adaptation is Anne Rice's movies. Kristen Stewart does have talent but in the same movie, she is terrible and I think really hates being in this sequel and her chemistry between Robert Pattinson is fake and Launter is a terrible actor. The script is so bad get a different screenwriter! Grade C-",0
177,"What I was just asking for is an improvement over its predecessor, but NO. ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is a boring, joyless and slow paced flick which is directed by the most incompetent person in the world of cinema. The acting is utterly horrible and none of the action sequences can't help this preposterous movie overcome an excessive length and an absence script.",0
178,"A pesar de que la primera parte es ridícula en todo sentido, era entretenida. Pero ""New Moon"" es absurda, estúpida, boba, sonsa, ridícula, pésima, asquerosa, repulsiva, una bazofia. ¿Que es lo que les deja de enseñanza a las niñas adictas a esta saga? Si tu novio no te hace caso: hazte daño, intenta suicidarte, has cosas que pongan en riesgo tu vida y veras que con eso el volverá. Y si no es así, puedes cambiar de pareja las veces que quieras. Eso es lo que deja New Moon, situaciones estúpidas, diálogos ridículos y un guion horrible y asqueroso, actuaciones mediocres y una trama aburrida. New Moon no es solo la peor de la saga, sino también es una de las peores películas que eh visto en toda mi existencia. No gasten su tiempo en esta bazofia...",0
180,"Tedious, dull, slow-paced an all above awful. 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' is an excruciating exercise in filmmaking and overall film entertainment. One must wonder what the filmmakers were thinking when they finished making this and probably thought, ""We did a good job, here!"". The film continues more or less where the first film left off. In that we see Bella (Kristen Stewart) still living with her father and is having nightmares about being old and the fact that her vampire lover, Edward (Robert Pattinson) will never age, and hasn't done so since he was 17. Later on, we see that Edward doesn't want to risk Bella's life by having himself in it, so he tells her that he's going away, and that she must not do anything erratic. Despite his leaving being the best for both of them, she cannot seem to function without him, nor can he stop concerning himself over her. Bella decides to bond even more closely with Jacob Black (an often topless Taylor Lautner), in which she soon discovers that werewolves become a part of his life, and how they are not so keen on vampires. This then leads to a constant conflict as to whether or not Bella is attracted to Edward or Jacob, not only is she facing the difficult decision over which bland boyfriend she wants, but they could not be more opposite if they tried. It's almost like choosing between a PC or a Mac...they're rivals in every way, but you cannot make the decision over which is best for you. The film moves at a frustratingly slow pace, it doesn't help as well that the characters presented to us are no more interesting either. Kristen Stewart lacks the ability to show enthusiasm in her performance, unless that is how Stephanie Meyer (the writer of these books) wanted the character to be. It makes me wonder why two guys like Edward and Jacob are so fascinated by Bella...there is nothing about her character that seems so special. I'm not sure if I should blame Stewart's performance, or if I should blame the direction by Chris Weitz, or if I should blame the screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg. ""New Moon"" is absolutely devoid of interest, devoid of fun, devoid of a compelling execution for a story. It doesn't hook you in like most ""sagas"" are supposed to...instead it leaves you hungry, impatient, and overall, dissatisfied.",0
181,"Except for the last half hour or so of this movie, it has no plot whatsoever.  It is literally two hours of Bella moping that Edward left, and NOTHING else",0
182,"Twilight New MoonDieser Film suckt, er ist genauso unbedeutend und schlecht wie der erste, also es gibt irgendein Vampirgericht , Stewart und Vampir haben Stress, anscheinend verlässt er sie, wegen einem Vampirproblem, alles klar amk. Am Ende musst er es für sie tun und liebt sie immer noch, indem er sie anstarrt",0
183,"Twilight: New Moon is better than the first Twilight but that doesn't really say much at all. This is an amazingly terrible movie. It's an unwanted sequel that ends setting up another unwanted sequel. The dialogue isn't as bad, but it's still bad. The CGI isn't as bad, but it's still bad. The stunts are absolutely awful. The pacing is even worse than in the first. We get these new characters who can turn into wolves - But they're always topless. I wonder why? Maybe it's because this film is made for teenage girls. We also get an unnecessary, unconvincing love triangle, about as unnecessary as Twilight: New Moon and i'm going to give it a 3/10.",0
186,"And just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, along comes this dreadful sequel, crammed with excruciatingly slow pacing and the same cheesy romance and acting.",0
187,"A bunch of mopey teens standing around (literally, they DO just stand around for the entire film).",0
